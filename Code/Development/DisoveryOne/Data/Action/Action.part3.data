                                                          FOURTH DRAFT
                                                         March 7, 1995

          

          

          FADE IN:

          A FIST HITS A FACE
          The fist is in a boxing glove. It belongs to VIC DEAKINS, 38.
          The face belongs to RAWLEY HALE, 28. They are in...

          INT. GYMNASIUM, WHITEMAN AFB - DAY

          Hale and Deakins are sparring in a ring. Other people are
          lifting weights, shooting baskets.

          IN THE RING
          Hale and Deakins circle each other. Hale is shaking cobwebs out
          of his head.

          DEAKINS
          You know what happened there?

          HALE
          Hell, I barely know what day it is.

          DEAKINS
          I set you up. I fake right, go
          left three times in a row. You
          expect it again, I take the right
          in hard. That's what boxing's all
          about. Make your opponent think
          you're gonna do one thing, then do
          another. Like Ali in Zaire, using
          the rope-a-dope on Foreman.
          (mimes rope-a-dope)
          Everyone thought Ali's arms were
          getting destroyed, when he was
          really just letting Foreman tire
          himself out. Eighth round, Ali
          starts hitting, George's got
          nothing left -- fight's over.

          HALE
          The fact that I can't feel the
          left side of my face -- that's
          okay, right?
          Deakins laughs. Hale seizes the relaxed moment and suddenly
          launches into Deakins with a flurry of punches.

          THE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE GYM
          Take notice -- the fight is getting real. They move to the ring.

          DEAKINS
          Several of Hale's punches land. Deakins staggers back, caught
          off guard. It looks like he might even go down.

          

          

          

          

           2.

          HALE
          He cocks his arm back. He could finish Deakins off. But he
          doesn't. He drops his fist.

          DEAKINS
          Seizes the opportunity and slugs back.

          THE CROWD
          Loves it.

          HALE AND DEAKINS
          Now Deakins has the upperhand. He backs Hale around the ring.

          DEAKINS
          Don't watch my hands -- watch my
          shoulders. That's where the punch
          starts. Ready?
          Deakins hits Hale hard in the face, sending him back.

          THE SPECTATORS
          Are circling the ring, following the fighters, cheering.

          HALE AND DEAKINS

          DEAKINS
          You were looking at my hands.
          Let's try it again. Ready?
          Deakins hits Hale hard. He's got Hale on the run.

          DEAKINS
          Come on. Focus. Ready?

          (PUNCH)
          My shoulders. Ready?
          Deakins fakes left, puts everything into one big uppercut. It
          connects.

          HALE
          Lands, dazed, blood trickling out of the corner of his mouth.

          DEAKINS
          He's in silhouette, the lights above him.

          HALE
          Looks up at Deakins, catches his breath.

          

          

          

          

           3.

          HALE AND DEAKINS
          Deakins offers his hand. Hale pushes it aside. Deakins ignores
          Hale, grabs him and helps him to his feet. Deakins climbs out
          of the ring between the ropes.
          Hale grabs the top rope and flips himself over, landing on his
          feet. Deakins gives Hale a look, laughs, shakes his head.

          INT. SHOWERS

          Hale lets the water rinse the blood off his face.

          INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY

          Hale and Deakins are sitting on the bench between their lockers,
          getting into their flightsuits, pulling on boots. Deakins is
          smoking a cigarette. The smoke curls up into the light slanting
          down across the room from high windows.

          HALE'S LOCKER
          Is in sunlight. On the inside of his locker door are pictures
          of exotic planes -- the SR-71, a swept-wing fighter, an artist's
          rendition of the Aurora, etc.

          DEAKINS' LOCKER
          On the shady side of the room. Nothing on the inside of his
          locker door. The locker is spare, Zen-like in its neatness.

          HALE
          Here.

          HALE'S HAND
          Slams a twenty dollar bill down on the bench.

          DEAKINS
          I can't take that.

          HALE
          Oh, shut up.

          DEAKINS
          Really. I feel bad. How many times
          have we fought and how many times
          have you won?

          HALE
          Jerk.

          DEAKINS
          Well, if you insist.
          Deakins grins, folds the bill and jams it into his flightsuit.

          

          

          

          

           4.

          DEAKINS
          You know why I beat you?

          HALE
          Because you've been boxing for
          twenty years and you're much
          better at it than I am?

          DEAKINS
          You don't want it enough. You had
          me today. I was back on my heels.
          But you didn't close the door.

          HALE
          We were just sparring.

          DEAKINS
          Life isn't sparring, Hale.

          HALE
          I think I saw that on a T-shirt.
          Deakins pulls out the twenty dollar bill; hands it back to Hale.

          DEAKINS
          Here.

          HALE
          No, that's yours.

          DEAKINS
          If you weren't giving it
          everything you've got, then I
          don't want it.

          HALE
          No, I mean -- that's yours,
          literally. I took it out of your
          wallet when you were in the shower.
          Deakins laughs, puts the money away.

          EXT. WHITEMAN AIR FORCE BASE - DUSK

          Planes taxiing, vehicles moving.

          INT. WHITEMAN MISSION BRIEFING ROOM

          Deakins and Hale enter to find GENERAL BOONE, 50s.

          DEAKINS/HALE
          General.

          

          

          

          

           5.

          BOONE
          Gentlemen.
          (nods at NO SMOKING

          SIGN)
          Deak?

          DEAKINS
          Sorry.
          (puts out cigarette)
          What's the mission, General?

          BOONE
          Simulate a border penetration. Hug
          the ground. Scare some cows. See
          if anyone can spot you.

          HALE
          The usual ...?

          BOONE
          No, actually, it's a little
          unusual. You're carrying a couple
          of nukes tonight, fellas.
          (off their looks)
          Palmdale's afraid low-level gamma
          and x-ray diffusion might screw up
          the peripherals. They asked us to
          send a couple on a run, see if
          anything glows.

          HALE
          '61s?

          BOONE
          (shakes head)
          Big ones. '83s.

          HALE
          Ooh. Crowpleasers.

          INT. HANGAR

          A BOMB TRUCK carrying two B-83 nuclear weapons drives under the
          wing of a big, black plane, toward the open bomb bays. GROUND
          CREWMEN are hurrying about.

          HALE AND DEAKINS
          Enter and walk under the plane, nodding to the ground crew. Hale
          and Deakins are royalty. Deakins and Hale climb up the
          airplane's Crew Entry steps and disappear.

          INT. COCKPIT

          Hale and Deakins climb into a very strange cockpit. There are
          two pilots' seats in this plane, with duplicate controls.

          

          

          

          

           6.
          But instead of the usual dials and gauges on the control panels,
          there are FOUR COMPUTER SCREENS in front of each pilot. Hale
          gets into the left seat; Deakins the right. They review
          information on their screens, flip switches.

          INTERCUT WITH BOMBS
          Being loaded into the bomb bays. When they've been clamped into
          place in the rotary bomb racks...

          DEAKINS
          (into helmet mike)
          Ready for rollout.

          INT./EXT. HANGAR

          Alarm horns sound, wheels roll on track and the huge hangar
          doors open revealing...

          THE GHOST
          An enormous black flying wing.

          INT. COCKPIT

          Deakins looks at maps on his computer screens. Hale looks over,
          sees the map of Utah.

          HALE
          You know, these exercises are
          fantastic. I mean, when that day
          comes and we finally go to war
          against Utah, we are really going
          to kick ass.

          CUT TO:

          EXT. CANYONLANDS NATIONAL PARK, UTAH - NIGHT

          Bright moonlight shows a campfire burning at the edge of an
          escarpment, the Colorado River a thousand feet below. Near the
          campfire is an Army surplus tent. Next to it, an easel holds a
          painting in progress.

          A PARK RANGER TRUCK
          Drives up, stops. The driver's door open, and out gets...

          A RANGER
          We don't see his face in the dark. He switches on a flashlight,
          walks over and taps on the tent.

          RANGER
          Park Ranger. I'd like to talk to
          somebody about this fire.

          

          

          

          

           7.
          We hear a man and a woman -- JIM and WANDA, 60s -- wake up.

          JIM (O.S.)
          Wha--? Oh, hell.

          WANDA (O.S.)
          I'll talk to him, Jim.

          JIM (O.S.)
          Wanda, you stay put.
          Jim comes out of the tent, the ranger's light in his face.

          JIM
          I know -- no wood fires in the
          Park. It's just -- Wanda's got a
          cold and I wanted her to stay warm.

          RANGER
          Sir, you see any other hikers,
          campers anywhere around here?

          JIM
          Not this time of year. What's the
          fine for something like this?

          RANGER
          Your life.
          Jim grins. But the ranger pulls out a pistol and shoots Jim,
          who falls into the fire. He then puts three shots through the
          wall of the tent. Nothing moves. The Ranger -- call him
          BAKER -- pulls out a walkie-talkie, clicks on.

          BAKER
          Done.

          HEADLIGHTS
          Come on and two Humvees roll in and four men get out. Three of
          them -- JOHNSON, a tech-whiz; LETT, gangly, grim, and NOVACEK,
          a wiry guy in a baseball cap -- start setting up what looks to
          be a high-tech missile launcher. The fourth man is...

          MR. PRITCHETT
          A neatly groomed man, 40s, with a perpetually sour attitude. He
          looks like -- and is -- a lawyer.

          PRITCHETT
          (to Baker, re: Jim in

          FIRE)
          Jesus. Do you think maybe you
          could get him out of the fire?
          Unless you like that smell.

          

          

          

          

           8.

          EXT. THE NIGHT SKY

          The Ghost flies overhead, roaring.

          INT. COCKPIT

          Deakins and Hale check their screens.

          DEAKINS
          (thinks of something)
          Weren't you going to call Taylor
          today about the Aurora Project?

          HALE
          Yeah. Turns out he wants people
          with more fighter hours.

          DEAKINS
          What'd you say?

          HALE
          What could I say?

          DEAKINS
          Jesus. You are such a pussy. You
          never fight for anything.
          Hale is stung. Pissed, he goes on the offensive.

          HALE
          Yeah, well you know what your
          problem is?

          DEAKINS
          Because I said what your problem
          is, you're gonna--?

          HALE
          You fight too much.
          (Deakins look at him)
          Right? You said it yourself --
          you should be at least Wing
          Commander by now. Maybe you would
          be if you didn't insist on telling
          people what they're doing wrong
          all the time.

          DEAKINS
          I'm usually right though, aren't I?
          Hale shakes his head, grins. Deakins clicks on his mike.

          DEAKINS
          Ghost 7 to McMurran. Hey,
          Wilkins, you old bag of dirt, your
          boys in Utah still awake?

          

          

          

          

           9.

          EXT. MCMURRAN AIR FORCE BASE - UTAH

          Establishing shot of McMurran Air Force Base.

          INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL CENTER

          Jammed with MEN looking at radar screens and computer monitors.
          COLONEL WILKINS, 50s, seen it all, talks over a headset.

          WILKINS
          Ready and waiting, Mr. Deakins.
          And tell our favorite hotshot,
          he's not gonna lose us tonight.

          INT. COCKPIT

          Deakins covers his mike, turns to Hale.

          DEAKINS
          Wilkins says you won't lose them
          tonight.

          HALE
          Tell Colonel Wilkins I could fly
          this puppy up his ass without him
          knowing.

          DEAKINS
          (grins, shakes his
          head; into helmet

          MIKE)
          Hale says ... if anyone can catch
          him it'd be you.

          INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL CENTER


          CU RADAR SCREEN
          The Ghost makes a prominent blip on the screen.

          WILKINS
          Everyone get a fix! They're about
          to turn out the lights!

          INT. COCKPIT

          Deakins turns to Hale.

          DEAKINS
          Ready, Major?

          HALE
          On your word.

          DEAKINS
          Go to war.

          

          

          

          

           10.

          CLOSE ON CONTROL PANEL - THREE BUTTONS
          The left, labeled TAKE OFF, is lighted. The other two buttons
          are MISSION and LANDING. Hale pushes MISSION.

          THE COCKPIT
          everything goes quiet.

          EXT. NIGHT SKY

          The plane's running lights go out. The roar of the engines
          quickly drops to a low rushing sound. The plane in in full
          stealth mode.

          INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL CENTER


          CU RADAR SCREEN
          The Ghost's blip disappears.

          WILKINS
          Lost 'em on active! Who's still
          got 'em?

          IR CREWMAN
          Got their heat signature, sir.
          (points to computer

          SCREEN)
          Their engines may be cold, but the
          air is colder.

          CU COMPUTER SCREEN
          Half of the screen shows a waveform, like a voiceprint. The
          other half shows a triangle moving across a map of Colorado.

          INT. COCKPIT

          Deakins studies the maps on the computer screens.

          DEAKINS
          Descend to 400 feet AGL. River
          valley approach.

          HALE
          Airspeed lock at point-seven Mach.
          Blue line descent on throttle to
          400 feet AGL.
          Hale pulls back on the throttle. The plane descends.

          HALE
          Time to limbo down. How low can
          we go.

          

          

          

          

           11.

          EXT. NIGHT SKY

          The Ghost drops away from us, a stark black cut-out against the
          moonlit Colorado landscape. The Colorado River is a winding
          silver ribbon five miles below.

          EXT. CANYONLANDS NATIONAL PARK, UTAH - NIGHT


          A PARK RANGER TRUCK
          Driving along the blacktop. The driver is not Baker. It's...

          TERRY CARMICHAEL
          Pretty, late 20s. Her radio squawks.

          CLYDE (V.0.)
          Terry? You been through the
          Needles entrance tonight?

          TERRY
          (grabs mike, answers)
          No. Why?

          CLYDE (V.0.)
          Mrs. Parker called --

          TERRY
          Oh, God. What is it this time?
          UFO abduction? Ritual human
          sacrifice?

          CLYDE (V.0.)
          She said she saw a bunch of trucks
          going through the Needles entrance
          an hour ago and thought they
          looked suspicious.

          TERRY
          Yes, well, this is a woman who
          chopped off one of her own fingers
          because it'd "turned on her."

          CLYDE (V.0.)
          Thing is, she said one of the
          trucks was ours, and you're the
          only one out.

          TERRY
          (arches eyebrow)
          She was probably hallucinating,
          but I'll check it out.

          EXT. COLORADO RIVER VALLEY - THIRTY MILES UP RIVER

          We feel the Ghost before we hear it. It rushes over, close to
          the river, below the ridgelines on either side of the valley.

          

          

          

          

           12.

          INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL CENTER

          The triangle representing the Ghost disappears from a computer
          screen.

          IR CREWMAN
          Lost 'em.

          WILKINS
          Stay on it. They're gonna have to
          come up for air sooner or later.

          INT. COCKPIT

          Deakins reads his computer screens.

          DEAKINS
          We're under the radar. Proceed to
          primary target.
          Hale hits a button, lets go of the stick -- they're on
          autopilot. It's a moment of peace. Hale looks out.

          HALE
          I tell people I became a pilot
          because I wanted to fly cool
          planes. It's also for this. When
          we're up here, I feel... closer
          ... I don't know.

          DEAKINS
          To God? Is that what you're going
          to say? That you feel closer to
          God up here?

          (SNORTS)
          Hell, Hale, with the payload we're
          carrying, we are God.
          Deakins notices something odd on his screen. He checks between
          the screen and what he can see through the windshield.

          DEAKINS
          Hale, take a look out your side.
          I think our terrain following is
          off. It's got us two klicks from
          the left flank ridge.
          Hale turns to look out the window on his side.

          HALE'S POV
          Looking out the window. There's some movement in the reflection
          in the glass. QUICK PULL FOCUS to see, distorted in the curve
          of the window, Deakins reaching inside his flight suit.

          

          

          

          

           13.

          HALE
          Turns his head back toward Deakins.

          HALE
          Deak, you can't smoke in here --
          But then Hale sees it's not a cigarette that Deakins is pulling
          out of his flight suit. It's shiny, metal. It's...

          A GUN
          And Deakins levels it right at Hale's head and his finger starts
          to squeeze the trigger.

          HALE
          Grabs Deakins' hand, pushing up as...

          DEAKINS
          Pulls the trigger and the gun FIRES.

          HALE
          The bullet cuts a line through the top of his helmet, punching
          a hole in the window by his head.

          DEAKINS AND HALE
          Deakins goes for another shot, but Hale grabs the gun and pushes
          up, sending bullets through the ceiling of the plane, into the
          walls. Deakins forces the gun down, fires.

          THE BULLET
          Tears through Hale's harness, blowing apart a shoulder strap.

          HALE AND DEAKINS
          Hale brings Deakins' gun hand hard against Hale's own helmet.
          Deakins yowls and the gun goes flying. Then Hale sees something.

          THE PLANE
          Is banking towards a ridge-line cliff wall.

          HALE
          Sees it, yanks on the stick.

          THE PLANE
          Banks hard away from the cliff, just missing.

          

          

          

          

           14.

          EXT. CANYONLANDS

          Baker gives a sign. Johnson, standing beside the missile
          launcher-like device, hits a button. Instead of a missile, a
          brilliant light shoots out.

          INT. COCKPIT


          ARMAMENTS CONTROL BUTTONS
          Buttons include ONE, TWO, LOCK, LEFT, RIGHT, OPEN, CLOSE, ARM
          and RELEASE. Deakins presses ONE and TWO, then RIGHT.

          HALE
          No!
          He pulls at Deakins' arms.

          CU COMPUTER SCREENS
          Graphics of bomb racks rotate, the B-83 nukes -- labeled and
          glowing red -- move into the bottom spot. The word RELEASE
          appears on the screen. Next to it, the word UNARMED flashes.

          HALE AND DEAKINS
          Deakins hits Hale with the back of his hand, knocking him back.
          Hale grabs Deakins' helmet, yanks it off his head and smashes
          Deakins back with it. Hale keys the armament buttons.

          CU COMPUTER SCREENS
          The nukes rotate out of the release position. RELEASE and
          UNARMED disappear.

          HALE AND DEAKINS
          Deakins grabs a fire extinguisher, swings it, getting Hale in
          the face. Hale is almost knocked out, blood running from his
          nose.

          EXT. PARK - NEEDLES AREA

          Terry is standing by her truck, talking on the radio.

          TERRY
          Clyde, tell Mrs. Parker that
          there's nothing weird going on. No
          truck, no UFOs, and, except for
          the odd human head on a stick, no
          sign of Satan.
          She feels it before she hears it or sees it.

          

          

          

          

           15.

          THE GHOST
          Rushes over Terry, no more than fifty feet above the ground. The
          jet-wash rocks the truck, almost knocks Terry down.

          TERRY
          Holy shit.

          INT. COCKPIT

          Hale groggy, hears a loud click. He looks down to see...

          DEAKINS' HAND
          AUTO to MANUAL. Deakins grabs Hale's EJECTION HANDLE.

          HALE AND DEAKINS
          Hale tries to push the handle down as Deakins pulls it up as...

          EXT. THE GHOST

          Heads into the beacon light.

          INT. COCKPIT

          Hale and Deakins look at each other as the plane enters the
          light and the light, in SLOW MOTION, washes across their faces.

          DEAKINS
          Suddenly lets go of Hale's hand, then hits Hale hard under the
          chin with the fire extinguisher.

          HALE
          His head snaps back as Deakins pulls.

          HALE'S EJECTION SEAT HANDLE
          Pop, hiss like a huge vacuum-sealed can is being opened.

          EXT. ABOVE GHOST

          The ejection hatch blows and is ripped away by the wind.

          HALE'S POV
          As he rockets up out of the cockpit.

          HALE
          When the chute opens, he almost spills out because of the
          severed shoulder harness. He grabs the straps, holds on.

          Somebody ejected!

          INT. COCKPIT

          Debris -- coffee cups, flight bags, anything not nailed down --
          is whipping around the inside of the cabin. Deakins reaches
          through the maelstrom, then reaches to the ARMAMENT BUTTONS and
          punches them.

          INT. BOMB BAYS

          The the clamps snap back and the two B-83s drop toward the earth.

          INT. COCKPIT

          Deakins looks around, then gets an idea. He hits the LANDING
          mission mode button and the cockpit lights up.

          INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL CENTER

          The Ghost starts popping up on everyone's screens. There's a
          chorus of "I got em!" and "They're ba-a-a-ck!" Wilkins looks at
          a screen, puzzled.

          WILKINS
          They're not due for another
          halfhour.

          INT. GHOST COCKPIT

          Deakins yells into his helmet mike as he gets ready to eject.

          DEAKINS
          (into helmet mike)
          This is Deakins! Hale lost it!
          I have to punch out!
          Deakins pulls his second handle. BLAM! WHOOSH! He's gone. He
          hear and feel the plane dropping, screaming toward the earth.

          INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL CENTER


          CU RADAR SCREEN
          The Ghost's blip suddenly disappears from the screen. A chorus
          of "What the hell?" and "Jesus."

          WILKINS
          That's not good.

          EXT. MCMURRAN RUNWAY

          Alarm horns blare. FIVE MEN are running to a waiting Blackhawk
          helicopter. Waving the men on is Wilkins. The last man up is...

          LIEUTENANT COLONEL SAM RHODES
          40s, short grey hair: he could snap your neck with a look.
          Wilkins pats Rhodes on the shoulder and Rhodes jumps into...

          THE HELICOPTER
          And it lifts up and flies off.

          EXT. CANYONLANDS

          Hale lies, unconscious, his parachute whipping in the wind.

          INT./EXT. SEARCH AND RESCUE HELICOPTER/DESERT

          The helicopter glides over wind-whipped sand, searchlights on.
          Rhodes sits with MCKELLAR, the pilot. Lieutenants KELLY, REED
          and THOMAS are in the back.

          IN THE SAND
          Something glints in the searchlights but the helicopter moves on.

          RHODES
          Hold it. Come back.
          The lights sweep back, find...

          THE TIP OF BLACK WING
          Sticking out of the sand.

          backlit maps and coffee. Present are GENERALS (including Air
          Force General CREELEY), the CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF
          STAFF (CHAIRMAN) and ASSISTANTS, all in uniform. They turn as...

          BAIRD
          Enters. Baird, 60s, is the White House Chief of Staff. His
          assistant stays in the b.g. as Baird walks in.

          

          

          

          

           18.

          BAIRD
          So, do I wake the President?

          CHAIRMAN
          Where is he -- Las Vegas?

          BAIRD

          (NODS)
          Computer convention. Some
          information superhighway crap.

          CHAIRMAN
          Let him sleep for now.
          (hands Baird a piece
          of paper)
          We're going out with this. Rick's
          team prepared it.
          The chairman nods toward RICK. Baird reads, mumbling.

          BAIRD
          "United States Air Force ...
          regrets to announce ... C-130
          heavy-lift cargo plane ... down
          over the Utah desert ... status of
          crew not determined at this time
          ... yadda yadda ... Nice bullshit,
          Rick.
          Baird hands it to Rick, who starts for the door.

          GILES (O.S.)
          That's a mistake.
          The room quiets. All eyes on...

          GILES
          Baird's intensely competent assistant.

          BAIRD
          Giles ...?

          GILES
          Aviation Week has been following
          this plane's development for
          years. They have stringers who
          spend their vacations sitting in
          lawnchairs all night long by the
          Whiteman perimeter fence just in
          case one of these things takes
          off. The boys in those lawnchairs
          know one took off tonight. They're
          going to know when it doesn't come
          back.

           19.
          GILES (cont'd)
          And when we put out a press
          release saying a C-130 went down
          in Utah, they're going to put two
          and two together. Aviation week
          will run a story, everyone'll know
          what really happened and we're
          going to look real stupid.

          (BEAT)
          We might as well tell the truth.

          BAIRD
          (mock shock)
          The truth? How the hell did you
          get this job?
          A few chuckles in the room. Baird looks at the Chairman --
          well? The Chairman thinks for a second, nods. Baird turns to
          Rick.

          BAIRD
          Rewrite it. What Giles just said.
          Rick grits his teeth and hurries out. Baird looks at Giles.

          BAIRD
          I want you in Utah. Now.
          Giles nods, heads out. Baird grabs his arm.

          BAIRD
          You scare me sometimes.

          GILES
          Hell, sir. Sometimes I scare
          myself.
          And out Giles goes.

          EXT. GHOST CRASH SITE

          Rhodes and his men are on the ground. Wind is whipping the
          sand. Rhodes is walking under part of the wing that is exposed.
          He's yelling into a headset microphone.

          Rhodes walks up to his men who are in the process of opening the

          Stunned silence. They've just gotten the news. Baird doesn't
          know what it means.

          BAIRD
          Broken Arrow?

          CHAIRMAN
          That's what we call it when we
          lose a nuclear weapon.

          BAIRD
          Oh, Jesus.
          (thinks, shakes head)
          I don't know what's scarier --
          losing nuclear weapons or the fact
          that it happens so often that you
          people have a term for it.

          INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL CENTER

          Wilkins is on the radio with Rhodes.

          WILKINS
          Find the nukes, Sam. But be
          careful. I know they say those
          eggs can't be cracked, but if your
          geigers pick up more rads than
          you'd get off a toaster, I want
          you out of there.
          Wilkins to the CORPORAL.

          Baird on the nukes.

          BAIRD
          They dropped from a plane but they
          didn't go off...?

          CREELEY
          They have to be armed to detonate.

          BAIRD
          Then they're destroyed?

          CREELEY
          (shakes head)
          They're designed to survive
          crashes intact. They can lie in
          a pool of burning jet fuel for
          five hours without any problem.

          BAIRD
          How did this happen?

          CREELEY
          In his last transmission, Colonel
          Deakins said Major Hale lost
          control. He probably hit weapons
          release by accident. Believe me,
          when a plane's auguring in, you
          start pushing every button you can.
          Baird stands, looks at a picture of a Ghost shakes his head.

          BAIRD
          Hell, we should take the cost of
          the plane out of major Hale's
          salary. Although I guess at two
          billion dollars a pop, that could
          take a while.

          EXT. CANYONLANDS - DAWN

          Hale is still unconscious, lying beside his parachute. There's
          the crunch of footsteps and a FIGURE looms over Hale. The figure
          reaches down to touch Hale's shoulder and...

          HALE
          Spins, grabs the shirt of the figure and cocks his arm about to
          punch. He hesitates when he sees it's...

          

          

          

          

           22.

          TERRY
          She seizes Hale's hesitation and punches him hard.

          HALE AND TERRY
          Hale is stunned. Terry starts to get up, reaching for her gun.
          Hale strikes out with a leg, getting Terry in the gut, sending
          her back. She hits the ground, still struggling for her gun.
          Hale gets up, runs, sprinting off over the rocky terrain.

          HIS POV
          Jarring, racing over rock and then...

          HALE
          Pulls up fast, almost not fast enough.

          HALE'S POV
          He's stopped right at the edge of a fifty foot drop.

          TERRY (O.S.)
          That would be the wrong way.

          TERRY
          Is walking slowly, calmy, up behind Hale, pistol out.

          TERRY
          Turn around.

          HALE

          (TURNING)
          Look, I --

          TERRY
          (not interested)
          Gimme your hands.
          Hale sticks his hands behind him. Terry handcuffs them.

          HALE
          I'm going to tell you something I
          can't tell you.
          Terry puts away her gun, spins Hale around and starts marching
          him off.

          HALE
          There were nuclear weapons on that
          plane. The guy I was flying with
          is trying to steal them.
          Terry reacts to that, but keeps Hale moving.

          

          

          

          

           23.

          HALE
          I have to stop him, and I need
          your help.

          TERRY

          (STOPS)
          Look, pal, all I know is, I saw
          you come down, I come in to help
          you and you grab me, kick me and
          run away.

          HALE
          I only ran because you punched me.

          TERRY
          What, we're ten years old now?
          "You started it. No you started
          it."

          HALE
          He has men on the ground. I --

          TERRY
          Save it. My dog's waiting for his
          breakfast.
          Terry starts to push Hale along again and...

          HALE
          Jumps up and through the handcuffs.

          TERRY
          Reaches for her revolver, but...

          HALE
          Grabs it from her, puts it to-her head, but not before...

          TERRY
          Whips a knife from her belt and puts it under Hale's chin.

          HALE AND TERRY
          Don't move. A beat while they catch their breath.

          HALE
          This isn't a stand-off, okay? I've
          got a gun.

          TERRY
          Yeah, well, I never keep my gun
          loaded.
          Terry taps her belt.

          

          

          

          

           24.

          CLOSE ON HER BELT
          A line of bullets.

          HALE AND TERRY
          Terry holds out her hand. Hale lets the revolver swing down on
          his finger. Just as Terry takes it...

          HALE
          Moves fast, grabs Terry's knife hand, then kicks her legs out
          from under her. Hale lands on top of her, still holding her
          knife hand, putting the knife to her throat.

          HALE
          I'm telling you the truth.

          TERRY
          This is a good way to convince me.

          HALE
          I could kill you now. Right?
          Terry nods, bewildered and more than a little scared.
          Hale lets go of Terry's hand holding the knife.

          HALE
          I need your help.
          Terry looks at Hale for a long moment. She's still holding the
          knife. She exhales, then sticks the knife in the dirt.

          INT./EXT. HELICOPTER

          The helicopter flies low. Rhodes looks at a device on his lap.

          ON THE DEVICE'S SCREEN
          Green, like a radar screen. It's blank, and then two dots
          appear on the outer edge of the screen.

          RHODES
          Got 'em!

          EXT. CANYONLANDS

          Terry unlocks Hale's handcuffs.

          TERRY
          I've got a radio in the truck. We
          can call McMurran and get the
          Marines in here.

          

          

          

          

           25.

          HALE
          (shakes head)
          Deakins'll be monitoring any radio
          transmissions out of here.
          (off her look)
          That's what I'd do.

          TERRY
          Who is this guy?

          HALE
          (a flash of the
          horrible betrayal he

          FEELS)
          Someone I would've trusted with my
          life.

          (BEAT)
          You've gotta get to a phone.

          TERRY
          Me? What are you going to do?
          (no answer, she

          REALIZES)
          Wait. You're gonna go after this
          guy? Isn't he going to have a lot
          guns and shit? I don't want to
          sound insulting or anything, but
          ... you're just a pilot.

          HALE
          I don't have any choice. The
          nukes are my responsibility.
          Besides...
          (pulls something from

          POCKET)
          I do have one thing going for me.

          TERRY
          What's that?
          Hale sticks...

          A TWENTY DOLLAR BILL
          Under a rock.

          HALE
          The last thing in the world he
          expects is for me to come after
          him.
          Hale walks off into the light of the rising sun. Terry looks at
          the $20 bill.

          EXT. CREVICE SITE

          The helicopter is parked at the edge of a deep crevice.

          

          

          

          

           26.

          DOWN IN THE CREVICE
          Rhodes comes down the last few feet of rope to the bottom of the
          crevice. Kelly, Thomas and Reed are waiting, shining lights on
          a B-83 lying in the dirt, all in one piece.

          RHODES
          (into mike)
          We've got one intact.
          (to his men)
          Let's go find the other one.
          Rhodes starts off along the bottom of the crevice.

          EXT. TOP OF THE CREVICE - BY THE HELICOPTER

          McKellar is sitting in the pilot's seat, eating a candy bar. He
          turns at the unexpected sound of a truck-driving up.

          A HUMVEE
          climbs up the slope toward the helicopter.

          MCKELLAR
          Grabs his rifle, hops out of the helicopter.

          NOVACEK AND LETT
          Are in the Humvee. Novacek sticks his head out.

          NOVACEK
          Hey, you guys need any help?

          MCKELLAR
          It's an Air Force training
          exercise, sir. I'm going to have
          to ask you to leave.

          NOVACEK
          Hey, no problem. We just --

          LETT
          Whips out a silenced rifle and shoots.

          MCKELLAR
          Barely has time to raise his rifle before he's hit. He drops.

          ANOTHER HUMVEE
          Drives up fast.

          BAKER, JOHNSON AND PRITCHETT
          Get out. Johnson wears radio headgear. Pritchett is furious.

          

          

          

          

           27.

          NOVACEK
          Picks up McKellar's half-eaten candy bar, takes a bite.

          BAKER
          (to Novacek)
          Any sign of Deakins?
          Novacek, mouth full, shakes his head.

          PRITCHETT
          He better be dead.

          DEAKINS (O.S.)
          Sorry to disappoint you, Mr.
          Pritchett.
          They all look over to see...

          DEAKINS
          Walk out of the shadows, smoking a cigarette. While soldierly
          with his men, Deakins is courteous and polite with Pritchett.

          PRITCHETT
          You said nothing would go wrong!

          DEAKINS
          Well, point of fact, nothing has.

          PRITCHETT
          You didn't drop the nukes where
          you were supposed to!

          DEAKINS
          Ah, but we always planned on the
          search and rescue team finding the
          weapons for us, and they have. Mr.
          Pritchett, I really have thought
          of everything.
          Johnson walks up, pointing to his radio headgear.

          JOHNSON
          Newsflash. Two gunships just left
          from McMurran and they're headed
          this way.

          PRITCHETT
          You thought of that?

          DEAKINS
          That'll take care of itself.

          PRITCHETT
          What about the other pilot? We
          saw him eject.

          

          

          

          

           28.

          DEAKINS
          You don't have to worry about
          Major Hale. He's probably hiding
          behind a rock somewhere, praying
          I don't find him.

          JOHNSON
          Someone else might find him.
          (off Deakins' look)
          A Ranger called her base, said she
          saw a pilot come down and was
          gonna go look for him.
          Deakins thinks it over, turns to Novacek.

          DEAKINS
          Get ready. You'll go when the
          clean-up's done.
          Novacek nods, goes to the helicopter.
          Ext. Canyonlands - 4wd trail
          Hale and Terry are hurrying along a 4WD trail toward Terry's
          truck. Terry taken a look at Hale's ripped and torn flightsuit.

          TERRY
          Is that the new uniform?

          HALE
          Yeah. Less constricting.

          TERRY
          The dayshift guy left some work
          clothes in the truck. You can
          have them if you want.
          Hale nods. His feet crunch on something.

          TERRY
          Don't walk there.

          HALE
          Don't walk where?

          TERRY
          On that black stuff. That's
          cryptogamic soil. It's very
          fragile. One footprint takes
          centuries to repair.

          HALE
          That's a new one. Endangered dirt.
          Terry gives Hale a look.

          

          

          

          

           29.

          EXT. BOTTOM OF THE CREVICE

          Rhodes, Reed, Thomas and Kelly move along the shadowy crevice.

          INT. HELICOPTER

          Novacek flips switches in the helicopter, getting ready to start
          up. Deakins reaches in, flips off a switch marked COM LINK.

          EXT. BOTTOM OF CREVICE

          Rhodes hears the connection go dead. He taps his headset.

          RHODES
          Hello? McMurran? Come in.
          Suddenly, there's a soft popping sound and Reed drops.

          RHODES
          Reed? What the --?
          Rhodes looks down, sees blood on Reed. Before he can say
          another word, there's a fusillade of soft popping sounds as
          silenced bullets ricochet off the rock around them. Thomas goes
          down.

          INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL CENTER

          Silence from the speakers.

          WILKINS
          Sam? Sam, are you there? Sam?

          EXT. TOP OF CREVICE

          Lett aims a sniper's rifle down into the crevice. He flips a
          switch and a red laser beam stabs out from the scope.

          EXT. BOTTOM OF CREVICE

          Rhodes and Kelly are pressed against the crevice wall.

          THE RED LASER BEAN
          Dances along the wall, heading for them.

          RHODES
          Raises his pistol and shoots at the source of the laser.

          EXT. ATOP THE CREVICE

          Lett pitches back, dead.

          

          

          

          

           30.

          PRITCHETT AND DEAKINS
          Pritchett looks at Deakins -- another part of the plan? Deakins
          is unperturbed. He's holding an overnight bag. He unzips it.

          EXT. BOTTOM OF THE CREVICE

          Rhodes whispers to Kelly.

          RHODES
          We'll open up the access panels,
          put in a couple grenades. The
          nukes won't go nuclear, but they
          will go dirty. I won't lie and
          say we'll be all right. We won't.
          But if we're gonna go, might as
          well take those bastards with us.
          Rhodes scrambles off.

          KELLY
          Just one thing, sir.

          RHODES

          (TURNS)
          What?

          KELLY
          This.
          Kelly opens fire with his rifle. Rhodes is thrown back, dead.
          Kelly yells up top.

          KELLY
          Done!
          Kelly grabs the rope, climbs fast.

          EXT. ATOP THE CREVICE

          Mr. Pritchett looks at Deakins, surprised. Deakins -- putting
          on new clothes -- just grins. Deakins takes...

          THE TWENTY DOLLAR BILL
          From his flightsuit and puts it into his shirt pocket.

          KELLY
          Climbs into view.

          INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL CENTER

          Kelly's voice comes in over the speaker.

          

          

          

          

           31.

          KELLY (V.0.)

          (TERRIFIED)
          Colonel Wilkins? You there?

          WILKINS
          Who is this?

          KELLY (V.0.)
          It's Lieutenant Kelly, sir.

          WILKINS
          What happened, Kelly?

          EXT. ATOP CREVICE

          Kelly talks over the helicopter's radio mike. Deakins is behind
          him, shaving with an electric shaver.

          KELLY
          Colonel Rhodes is dead, sir!
          They're all dead!

          WILKINS (V. 0.)
          What happened?
          Deakins puts the shaver to the radio mike. There's a wash of 40
          static. Deakins pulls the shaver away, nods to Kelly.

          KELLY
          It's the nuke, sir! It's open!
          Wide open! Oh, God, what am I
          going to do?!
          Deakins puts the shaver to the mike again -- more static. He
          reaches into the helicopter and flips off the COM LINK switch,
          then backs away, shaving. He nods to Novacek, who fires up the
          helicopter.

          INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL CENTER

          Wilkins slumps in his chair.

          WILKINS
          Call back the teams and get me the
          Room. We're gonna need NEST in
          here.

          EXT. CREVICE SITE

          Novacek lifts off in the helicopter and flies away.
          Deakins turns to Kelly and applauds his performance.

          DEAKINS
          Brought a tear to my eye.

          

          

          

          

           32.

          KELLY
          I'd just like to thank the members
          of the Academy.

          PRITCHETT
          (to Deakins)
          I hope you've got another surprise
          up your sleeve. If I'm not
          mistaken, there are two attack
          helicopters headed this way.

          JOHNSON
          Not any longer.
          They look at him; he taps his radio headgear.

          JOHNSON
          They've just been recalled.

          DEAKINS
          You see, Mr. Pritchett, they think
          they've got an exposed core.
          They'll want to get a satellite to
          take a look, but it'll take ninety
          minutes minimum to shift the
          orbit. Until then? Well, people
          get a little weird when it comes
          to radiation. No one'll have the
          balls to come near here unless
          it's NEST -- the Nuclear Emergency
          Search Teams --and it'll take the
          nearest team at least two hours to
          get out here, and we only need an
          hour to reach our connection with
          the transport squad.

          (GRINS)
          Not that I'm not delighted with
          your presence, but you really
          don't need to be here.

          INT./EXT. TERRY'S TRUCK - 4WD TRAIL

          Hale and Terry are riding in Terry's truck. Terry drives. Hale
          is wearing work clothes. After some silence...

          HALE
          What's your dog's name?

          TERRY
          Bear. I was going to call him
          Death, so I could say things like,
          "I walk with Death," and "Death
          chewed my boots," but I chickened
          out. You?

          HALE
          No dog.

          

          

          

          

           33.

          TERRY
          Do you have a name, or is that
          classified?
          Before Hale can answer...

          THE SEARCH AND RESCUE HELICOPTER
          Rises up in front of them, Novacek piloting. Novacek thumbs a
          button and machine guns on the sides open up.

          TERRY AND HALE
          Terry jumps on the brakes. She and Hale bail out as...

          THE TRUCK
          is riddled with bullets and explodes.

          TERRY AND HALE
          Sprint up the trail.

          HALE
          We've gotta hide!

          TERRY
          Follow me!
          Terry leads Hale up a short slope. Hale scrambles over the top
          and is stunned. Terry runs out onto an open expanse -- no cover.

          HALE
          Hide where?

          IN THE HELICOPTER
          Novacek grins, shoots.

          HALE
          Looks at the helicopter as the bullets whistle in. When he
          turns back, Terry's gone.

          HALE
          What the --?

          TERRY (O.S)
          Come on!
          Hale runs in the direction of her voice.

          NOVACEK'S POV
          Aiming at Hale's back. But then Hale suddenly drops from view.

          

          

          

          

           34.

          HALE
          Arms flailing, drops fifteen feet, to deep sand.

          TERRY
          This way.
          Terry runs. Hale follows.

          HALE
          How do you --?

          TERRY
          (looks back, still

          RUNNING)
          I'm a Ranger. I've been over
          these trails a million times.
          Not looking, Terry runs straight into a wall, smacks her head
          and drops like a rock.

          IN THE HELICOPTER
          Novacek can't see his prey. He gets an idea and reaches back.

          TERRY AND HALE
          Terry is trying to get her eyes to focus.

          TERRY
          Please don't tell anyone I did
          that.

          IN THE HELICOPTER
          Novacek has a box of grenades beside him. He pulls the pin on
          a grenade and drops it.

          TERRY AND HALE
          Hale is helping Terry to her feet as BOOM -- the first grenade
          goes off. They run.

          THE HELICOPTER
          Chases them, strafing them. BOOM! -- a grenade goes off in
          front of them. They run back. They're cornered. Hale looks
          around, looks up.

          HALE
          Can you climb up?

          TERRY
          Yeah ...?

          HALE
          Give me your gun.

          

          

          

          

           35.

          TOP OF CLIFF
          Terry climbs up into view of...

          NOVACEK
          Who sees her.

          TERRY
          Pull herself up, stands, hands up.

          THE HELICOPTER
          Novacek swivels the helicopter around.

          TERRY
          This has nothing to do with me.

          NOVACEK
          Tell me where he is!

          HALE
          Is down in the fissure, pointing the revolver straight up at the
          helicopter hovering right overhead, figuring out where to shoot.

          HALE
          Blackhawk ... Moved pilot seat
          back a foot ... Puts him right
          about ... here.
          Hale hesitates -- he's never shot at someone before -- then
          takes a breath and starts shooting.

          IN THE HELICOPTER
          The bullets fly up from below. One hits Novacek. He slumps,
          pushing the joystick to one side.

          THE HELICOPTER
          Starts to lean over sideways.

          HALE
          Is surprised -- it worked!'

          TERRY
          Watches in horror as...

          THE HELICOPTER'S MAIN ROTOR BLADES
          Angle toward her, slicing the air as the helicopter tips over.

          

          

          

          

           36.

          TERRY
          Dives and rolls over the edge of the cliff as...

          THE ROTOR BLADES
          Hit the rock, sparking, grinding, right over Terry's head. The
          blades stop dead. But the torque of the motor brings...

          THE TAIL OF THE HELICOPTER
          Up and over, in a high arc.

          TERRY
          Looks up.

          THE TAIL --SECTION
          Is swinging over fast and the tail rotor is coming right for her.

          HALE AND TERRY
          Hale runs up, grabs Terry, pulls her to her feet as...

          THE TAIL SECTION
          Swings down, rotor spinning. It digs into the dirt and sand a
          split-second after...

          HALE AND TERRY
          Run clear.

          EXT. ATOP CREVICE

          Deakins and Pritchett watch a fireball from the exploding
          helicopter rise up in the distance.

          PRITCHETT
          We don't have to worry about the
          other pilot?
          Deakins shakes his head.

          PRITCHETT
          Then how come the helicopter
          crashed?

          DEAKINS
          (a flicker of worry)
          Pilot error.
          Deakins turns and walks away, over to...

          

          

          

          

           37.

          BAKER AND KELLY
          Who have taken the three-foot, pointed, front section off each
          nuke. They are loading them into the back of one Humvee.
          Pritchett walks up behind Deakins, still nagging.

          PRITCHETT
          Tell me again how I don't need to
          be here.

          DEAKINS
          Mr. Pritchett, I understand your
          concerns. You and your associates
          gave me a lot of money to mount
          this operation. But they're
          getting ten times that back if we
          succeed.

          PRITCHETT
          If we succeed?

          DEAKINS
          All I can do is my part. We've
          got the weapons, we're ...
          (checks watch)
          ... seventeen minutes ahead of
          schedule and everything will be in
          place within two hours. But I
          can't guarantee that the assholes
          in Washington won't do something
          stupid like not pay.

          PRITCHETT
          What if they don't?

          DEAKINS
          Then the next census for this
          region is going to show a very
          sudden drop in population.

          INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL ROOM

          Giles enters and is brought over to Wilkins.

          GILES
          Colonel Wilkins? I'm Giles
          Prentice.
          (they shake hands)
          My word from your search and
          rescue team?

          WILKINS
          No.

          

          

          

          

           38.

          GILES
          I'm sorry. Picked up any
          radiation?
          Wilkins shakes his head.

          GILES
          That's kind of strange -- if
          there's an exposed core out there.

          WILKINS
          Point?

          GILES
          Probably nothing. I asked for a
          transcript of the last cockpit
          transmission...?
          Wilkins nods to a CORPORAL who hands some papers to Giles. Giles
          reads them quickly.

          WILKINS
          I don't know what you expect to
          find.

          CU TRANSCRIPTS
          We see COLONEL DEAKINS: "This is Deakins! Hale lost it! Oh,
          God! I have to punch out!"

          GILES
          You know these guys? The pilots?

          WILKINS
          Just on the radio. Never met 'em.
          Why?

          GILES
          (looks up)
          What if this wasn't pilot error?

          INT. PENTAGON SITUATION ROOM

          Baird has put Giles on speaker phone. The people in the
          Situation Room exchange looks.

          BAIRD
          No rhetorical questions, Giles.
          Spit it out.

          

          

          

          

           39.

          CROSSCUT WITH GILES IN MCMURRAN CONTROL ROOM

          GILES
          In the last transmission from the
          plane, Colonel Deakins said Major
          Hale lost it and made the plane
          crash. We all assumed that meant
          pilot error. But what if Deakins
          meant Hale made the plane crash.
          Murmurs of "That's insane" "No way" fill the room.

          BAIRD
          Why would he do that?

          GILES
          Two nuclear weapons would be worth
          a hell of a lot of money.

          CHAIRMAN
          To whom? Son, there are easier
          ways for someone to buy nuclear
          weapons. You go to one of the old
          Soviet republics, you can get one
          for the price of a BMW.

          GILES
          I meant they'd be worth a lot of
          money to us. How much would we
          pay to get them back? To make
          sure they weren't used in this
          country?
          A flurry of looks around the room.

          BAIRD
          Hold on, hold on.
          (to Creeley)
          These nukes have codes or
          something that prevent people from
          using them.

          CREELEY
          Of course.

          BAIRD
          No one has these codes -- outside
          of the President and you guys.

          CREELEY
          Access to the codes requires the
          highest security --

          BAIRD
          I mean, not even the pilots have
          these codes, right?

          

          

          

          

           40.
          Creeley starts to stammer. Baird slumps. The chairman turns.

          CHAIRMAN
          (to an assistant)
          Where's that NEST team now?

          ASSISTANT
          They just took off.

          EXT. NEST HELICOPTER - IN FLIGHT

          A sleek, very serious-looking helicopter.

          INT. NEST HELICOPTER

          SIX very serious-looking SOLDIERS are in black radiation suits,
          listening to COLONEL HUNT, 45, over headsets.

          HUNT
          Listen up, sportsfans. Word is,
          this particular broken arrow has
          broken open. Our ETA Utah is
          ninety-six minutes. I want
          everyone to take that time to
          triple-check the seams and seals
          on their E-suits. Let's go!

          INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL ROOM

          Giles looks at Wilkins.

          GILES
          You think I'm nuts. You don't
          think NEST or the satellite will
          find anything weird.

          WILKINS
          That's right.

          (BEAT)
          But it wouldn't hurt to get some
          gunships fueled just in case.
          Wilkins reaches for a phone. Giles smiles.

          EXT. HELICOPTER EXPLOSION SITE

          The helicopter wreck burns. Hale looks over the terrain.

          HALE
          How do they get out of here?

          TERRY
          Get out? I don't think that
          helicopter's going anywhere.

          

          

          

          

           41.

          HALE
          Deak'd have a back-up. He'd be
          prepared.

          TERRY
          If they've got trucks they could
          take the four-wheel-drive trail we
          were on.

          HALE
          He wouldn't want to go towards
          town.

          TERRY
          He could go to the river.
          Hale looks at Terry -- that's exactly what Deakins would do.

          EXT. 4WD TRAIL

          The two Humvees roll along the narrow, twisting trail.

          IN THE SECOND HUMVEE
          Kelly drives, Deakins beside him, Johnson and Pritchett in back.

          DEAKINS
          You a fan of boxing, Mr. Pritchett?

          PRITCHETT
          I think it's barbaric.

          DEAKINS
          Me, too! I love it! Two men
          trying to do as much damage to the
          other as he can. As basic as you
          can get, don't you think?

          PRITCHETT
          I think it should be banned.

          DEAKINS
          So do I! God, wouldn't that make
          it more exciting? Having to go
          into dark alleys and basements to
          see a fight? I bet we see eye-to-
          eye on a lot of things, Mr.
          Pritchett.
          Deakins grins; Mr. Pritchett steams.

          EXT. CANYONLANDS

          Hale and Terry stand on an outcropping overlooking the 4WD trail.

          

          

          

          

           42.

          THEIR POV
          The two Humvees make their way along the trail.

          HALE
          See the one in front? It just has
          a driver? They wanted to keep the
          weight down. It has the nukes.
          Hale takes Terry's gun from her.

          TERRY
          You gonna shoot out the tires?

          HALE
          Humvees can reseal and inflate
          with the flick of a switch. That's
          why Deak chose 'em.
          Terry looks at Hale -- then what is he going to do?

          HALE
          I'm gonna steal it.
          (checks gun)
          You get to a phone and call
          McMurran.

          TERRY
          The nearest phone is a two-hour
          walk.

          HALE
          Then you better start walking.

          TERRY
          Look, I know my way around here.
          You're gonna need me.

          HALE
          (very serious)
          I appreciate what you've done so
          far. But now it gets hairy. Go
          to the phone.
          He scrambles off over the rock.

          THE HUMVEES
          Come around a corner. The trail hugs the face of a ten-foot-
          high cliff. Suddenly, from off the cliff...

          HALE AND TERRY
          Jump down onto the roof of the lead Humvee. Hale looks at
          Terry, angry. But before he can say anything...

          

          

          

          

           43.

          IN THE HUMVEE
          Baker swerves, trying to throw them off. He pulls out a pistol,
          shoots up through the ceiling.

          HALE AND TERRY
          Bullets punch up. Hale pulls out the gun. It falls from his
          hand. Terry grabs it as a sharp swerve sends...

          HALE
          Flying. He lands hard behind the Humvee.

          IN THE SECOND HUMVEE
          Deakins points at Hale, getting to his feet.

          DEAKINS
          Run him down.

          HALE
          Sprints after the leading Humvee. Deakins' Humvee closes fast.

          TERRY
          Looks back, sees Hale's predicament.

          TERRY
          Here!
          She slides the pistol along the truck roof.

          HALE
          Grabs the gun out of the air as...

          BAKER
          Slams on the brakes.

          TERRY
          Comes flying off the top, landing on the hood, barely holding on.

          HALE
          Is going to be crushed between the Humvees. He jumps up,
          turning, as the bumpers come together. He lands on the tailgate
          facing backwards and fires into Deakins' windshield.

          DEAKINS AND KELLY
          Kelly ducks below the dash and slams on the brakes but Deakins
          doesn't flinch. The bullets bounce off the glass --bulletproof.

          

          

          

          

           44.

          IN THE LEAD HUMVEE
          Baker sticks his gun out the window and aims at Terry and starts
          to pull the trigger when he stops, feeling a gun against the
          back of his head.

          HALE
          Is behind him. Hale gets into the passenger seat.

          HALE
          Gimme the gun and get out.

          BAKER

          (SMIRKING)
          I don't know. I think we got
          ourselves a little stand-off.

          HALE
          No, we don't.
          Hale shoots Baker in the thigh. Baker howls.

          TERRY
          Reaches forward and grabs Baker's gun as...

          HALE
          Kicks Baker out of the Humvee.

          BAKER
          Bad timing for him. He tumbles out, right in front of...

          DEAKINS' HUMVEE
          And is run over.

          HALE
          Holds the steering wheel, yells to Terry.

          HALE
          You drive!

          TERRY
          Climbs into the Humvee, takes the wheel from Hale. She jams
          Baker's gun into her belt.

          HALE
          I'd yell at you for coming after
          me, but you did just save my life.

          

          

          

          

           45.
          There's a look between them, then Hale climbs into the back. He
          finds what he is looking for -- a jerry can of gasoline and an
          emergency tool box.

          IN THE SECOND HUMVEE

          DEAKINS
          What're you doing, Hale?

          IN HALE AND TERRY'S HUMVEE
          Hale keeps his back to the other Humves. He pulls gaffer's tape
          off a roll, tears it with his teeth, grabs...

          A FLARE
          Out of the tool kit.

          IN THE SECOND HUMVEE

          KELLY
          Maybe he'll set off a nuke. That'd
          show us.

          BETWEEN THE HUMVEES
          Hale tosses the jerry can of gasoline out the back of the Humvee.

          THE JERRY CAN OF GASOLINE
          Flies through the air. There's a burning flare taped to the
          side of the plastic can.

          ECU TIP OF FLARE
          As the plastic of the can bubbles and melts and...

          IN THE SECOND HUMVEE

          DEAKINS
          Stop!
          But it's too late and...

          THE JERRY CAN
          Explodes.

          THE SECOND HUMVEE
          Skids to a stop, showered with burning gasoline. Deakins and
          his men bail out. Kelly, Johnson and Pritchett run for cover.

          DEAKINS
          Coolly grabs a fire extinguisher and starts spraying.

          

          

          

          

           46.

          IN HALE AND TERRYS HUMVEE
          Hale climbs up into the front seat. Terry looks at him,
          genuinely impressed.

          HALE
          We need somewhere to hide.

          TERRY

          (THINKS)
          I know a place.

          EXT. 4WD TRAIL

          Deakins keeps spraying the burning Humvee with foam.

          EXT. MINE ENTRANCE

          Terry and Hale have taken the Humvee to the parking area in
          front of an abandoned mine. The winch on the Humvee strains.
          The cable is attached to the handles on the padlocked metal
          doors. The doors are slowly pulling out, groaning.

          TERRY
          It was a copper mine, barely
          squeaking along for years. They
          shut it-down a few months ago when
          they hit an underground river.
          The hinges on the metal doors buckle and snap and the doors rip
          loose. Hale shuts down the winch, unhooks it from the doors.
          He motions for Terry to drive it in.

          INT. MINESHAFT ENTRANCE

          Terry drives the Humvee into the mineshaft entrance. Hale uses
          a flashlight to look around. He finds a switch a flips it. A
          gas generator comes to life. Another click and lights come on.
          Now they can see the rest of the entry area, including a wire-
          mesh-enclosed elevator. As Terry looks around, Hale grabs the
          Humvee radio, tries to tune in other frequencies, gives up.

          HALE
          They hardwired in their frequency.
          We can't call out.

          TERRY
          What are we gonna do?
          Hale goes to the back of the Humvee, pulls down the tailgate.

          HALE
          I'm gonna take away Deakins'
          reason for being here.
          Hale grabs a screwdriver from the tool kit and pries open a
          panel on the side of one of the B-83s.

          

          

          

          

           47.

          INSIDE PANEL
          There's an LCD DISPLAY, a NUMERIC KEYPAD and a CLOCK showing the
          current time. The keys are oversized and brightly colored.

          TERRY
          Fisher-Price makes nuclear weapons?

          HALE
          They're designed to be used by
          guys wearing gloves in Alaska.
          He reaches in, hits a key and the LCD display lights up.

          HALE
          These nukes have security codes.
          If you enter the wrong code three
          times, the nuke goes dead -- all
          the circuitry shorts out and shuts
          down. Kind of like the security
          systems with car radios.

          TERRY
          And people say the public doesn't
          benefit from defense spending.

          HALE

          (GRINS)
          Hand me the radio.
          Terry goes for the radio mike. Hale sees something.

          A PLASTIC NAME TAG
          Sticking out from under one of the nukes.

          HALE
          Pulls it out, looks at it.

          ECU NAMETAG
          It's from "St. Judes Hospital, Radiology Department."

          HALE AND TERRY
          Hale turns to Terry as she pulls over the radio mike.

          HALE
          Where's St. Judes Hospital?

          INT. 4WD TRAIL -- DEAKINS' HUMVEE

          The fire is out. The radio crackles.

          HALE (V.0.)
          Deak -- you there?

          

          

          

          

           48.
          Deakins and Kelly look at each other.

          HALE (V.O.)
          Ding, ding, ding, Deak. We're
          starting a new round. You took
          the first couple, but I've got you
          on the ropes now, you son of bitch.
          Deakins gets in the passenger side, grabs the radio mike.

          DEAKINS
          Hey, there. What was that last
          part? There was some static.
          (clicks off mike; to

          JOHNSON)
          Find them.
          (to Pritchett and

          KELLY)
          Let's go!
          Johnson pulls out a radiation detector scanner like the one
          Rhodes used. Kelly and Pritchett get back in the vehicle.

          CROSSCUT BETWEEN HALE AND DEAKINS
          Kelly drives Deakins' Humvee along the trail as they talk.

          HALE
          I know you're stalling while you
          try to find the nukes with your
          scanner, but you're gonna be too
          late. Hear that?
          Hale holds the radio mike up to the keypad as he enters numbers.

          HALE
          I'm entering the wrong code, you
          bastard. A couple more times and
          these are gonna be useless to you.

          DEAKINS
          You really got me there. I sure
          didn't think of that.
          Hale slows down -- something's wrong -- Deakins doesn't cars.

          DEAKINS
          All that time we spent in the
          cockpit together and you think I'm
          stupid? I got some new boards and
          circuits from a friend at Pantex.
          But nice try.
          Hale curses to himself. Terry looks at him. He shakes his head
          they're in trouble.

          

          

          

          

           49.

          DEAKINS
          You know, Hale, I thought of
          asking you to join me on this. You
          wanna know why I didn't?

          HALE
          Because I would've said no?

          DEAKINS
          I would've just killed you if you
          said no. I was more afraid you'd
          say yes. Because I knew I
          couldn't count on you. You can
          pretend you've got guts, but when
          and if it comes down to it, you're
          gonna run off crying like a little
          girl.

          HALE
          You better hope that's true, Doak.
          Because I've got the nukes, and
          there's nothing to stop me from
          entering the right code, if you
          know what I mean.

          DEAKINS
          (flash of worry)
          You wouldn't do that.

          HALE
          Nah. You're right. I wouldn't
          have the guts.
          END SPLIT-SCREEN. Hale drops the mike; looks at the elevator.

          HALE
          How deep is this mine?

          TERRY
          I don't know. A couple thousand
          feet.

          HALE
          That's deep enough.
          Hale opens the elevator gate.

          TERRY
          For what?

          HALE
          A nuclear explosion.
          Terry's jaw drops.

          

          

          

          

           50.

          EXT. 4WD TRAIL/ INT. DEAKINS' HUMVEE

          Kelly drives the blackened Humvee as fast as he can. Johnson
          looks at his scanner, grins.

          JOHNSON
          Got it! They're --

          DEAKINS
          In the mine.
          (off their looks)
          I could tell he was inside
          something. There was an echo.

          INT. MINE ENTRANCE

          Hale hurries to the back of the Humvee.

          TERRY
          We can still hide them!

          HALE
          He's got a scanner. He'd find
          them.

          TERRY
          You're talking about setting off
          a nuclear weapon!

          HALE
          They set them off underground in
          Nevada all through the fifties and
          sixties. There's no risk.

          TERRY
          Tell it to the two-headed cows.
          Hale grabs the straps around one of the nukes, pulls. He can
          barely move the thing. He turns to Terry.

          TERRY
          No! I am not helping you set off
          a nuclear weapon.

          HALE
          We won't be down there when it
          goes off. This isn't a suicide
          mission.

          TERRY
          No!

          

          

          

          

           51.

          HALE

          (IMPATIENT)
          All right. Fine. Though I think
          you should know, before I ejected,
          I heard Deakins say the nukes were
          going to be used to wipe out the
          last few remaining handicapped gay
          whales.
          Terry looks at him -- you asshole. Hale looks at her, very
          serious.

          HALE
          I need your help.
          Terry thinks, shakes her head, steps up and grabs the nuke.

          EXT. 4WD TRAIL

          The Humvee takes the turn-off to the mine entrance.

          INT. MINESHAFT ELEVATOR - DESCENDING

          Hale and Terry are going down with the nukes.

          HALE
          When we get to the bottom we'll
          have to get away from this shaft.
          It'll limit the amount of
          radiation released into-the
          atmosphere.

          EXT. MINE ENTRANCE

          Deakins's Humvee comes into the clearing. The Humvee stops and
          Deakins and Kelly jump out, followed by Pritchett and Johnson.

          EXT. MINE - BOTTOM OF ELEVATOR SHAFT

          The elevator comes down. Hale slides open the gate. He and
          Terry drag the nukes out.

          TERRY
          We'll each drag one down a tunnel?

          HALE
          No. I'm only going to set off one.
          We'll leave the other one here.
          It'll be buried under a billion
          tons of rock.
          They are startled when the elevator starts going up behind them

          HALE
          We better hurry.
          (nods down tunnel)
          Let's try down there.

          

          

          

          

           52.
          They start hauling the nuke down the tunnel.

          INT. MINE ENTRANCE

          Deakins, Pritchett, Kelly and Johnson wait by the elevator.

          PRITCHETT
          I can't wait to see how this fits
          into your plan.
          Deakins' charm peels away for an instant and he fixes Pritchett
          with a stare. Pritchett shrinks back.

          INT. PENTAGON SITUATION ROOM

          Baird, the Chairman and the others are watching large TV
          monitors. Creeley walks them through what they're looking at.

          ON THE MONITORS
          A wide-view, bird's-eye, thermal image of rocky terrain.

          CREELEY
          This is the KH-12 satellite's
          infrared view of the area. An
          exposed nuclear core would be
          relatively hot -- it'd show as a
          circle of bright white. As you
          can see, there's nothing. The
          only heat signatures we found were
          these.
          The image changes. There are four blotches, glowing a dull red.

          BAIRD
          What's --?

          CREELEY
          We think it's Colonel Rhodes and
          his men. Their bodies.
          A look between Baird and the Chairman. The Chairman reaches for
          a phone.

          INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL CENTER

          Wilkins is on the phone. Giles looks at him.

          WILKINS
          I understand, sir.

          GILES

          (WHISPERS)
          Was I right?
          Wilkins nods. Giles grins smugly for about half a second, then
          realizes what it really means.

          

          

          

          

           53.

          GILES
          Oh, shit.

          WILKINS
          (into phone)
          I've got ten ships ready to go ...
          We should be hearing from NEST any

          Flying over Canyonlands.

          INT. MINESHAFT ELEVATOR - DESCENDING

          Deakins, Kelly and Johnson are in the elevator. Kelly holds a
          small metal briefcase.

          INT. END OF MINE TUNNEL

          Hale and Terry have stopped at the end of a tunnel. Hale has
          opened the guts of the nuke. He's pulling out a chip.

          TERRY
          How do you know how to do this?

          HALE
          Pilots who fly with nuclear
          weapons have standing orders to ...
          (quoting from the

          MANUAL)
          ... "retrieve if possible, disable
          if necessary and destroy if we
          must," and destroy I must.
          He stands, looks around. He sees...

          EYEBOLTS
          Screwed into the cross beaus on the ceiling.

          HALE
          I'm gonna need your belt and one
          of your socks.

          INT. BOTTOM OF ELEVATOR SHAFT

          The elevator descends into view. Deakins, Kelly and Johnson get
          out. They see the other nuke lying there.

          KELLY
          Send it up?

          DEAKINS
          (shakes head)
          Let's take care of Hale first.
          Spread out.

          

          

          

          

           54.

          INT. END OF MINE TUNNEL

          In one hand Hale holds Terry's sock, filled with sand. His
          other hand grips the eyebolt. Terry is giving Hale a log up,
          straining under the weight.

          TERRY
          Take your time. Really.
          Hale has pushed the open end of the sock through the eyebolt. He
          tightens a belt around the open end of the sock.

          HALE
          Okay.
          Terry lets Hale down. Hale picks up a big rock and loops the
          free end of the belt around it. Then he picks up a smaller rock.

          CLOSE ON NUCLEAR WEAPON
          One chip has been pulled out of a circuit board. Hale very
          gingerly lays the small rock on top of the chip.

          HALE
          We make a small hole in the sock,
          and when enough sand drains out --
          and we're hopefully in New
          Mexico -- the sock is pulled
          through the eyebolt, the rock
          drops...
          (re: smaller rock)
          ... hitting the rock on this chip,
          closing the firing circuit and
          that's it.
          Hale finishes putting the small rock in position. He stands.

          TERRY
          How much time are we going to have?

          HALE
          I don't know precisely. This
          isn't a Swiss sock. Ten minutes,
          maybe --
          Hale is cut off by...

          BULLETS
          Flying in, ricocheting off the rock walls, fired by...

          JOHNSON
          Thirty yards down the tunnel.

          

          

          

          

           55.

          HALE AND TERRY
          Dive to the ground. They pull pistols, start shooting.

          THE SOCK
          One of Johnson's bullets cuts through it.

          HALE
          Feels sand hitting his face, looks up.

          HIS POV
          Sand is draining out of the sock very fast.

          HALE AND TERRY
          Reaches up to grab the big rock, but Johnson sends a spray of
          bullets in. Terry grabs Hale.

          TERRY
          Come on!

          HALE
          The sock --
          More bullets. Terry pulls Hale. They run down a side passage.
          Hale and Terry fire back at Johnson as they run out of sight.

          JOHNSON
          Shoots after them, then runs up to the weapon. He reaches for
          the rock, stops -- maybe that'll set it off.

          THE SOCK
          The last sand pours out; the sock is sucked through the eye-bolt.

          THE ROCK
          Drops fast toward the nuke.

          A HAND
          Grabs it, stopping it just in time. The hand belongs to...

          DEAKINS
          He looks at Johnson in disgust, exhales, and tosses the rock. He
          pulls out a walkie-talkie, clicks on, talks into it.

          

          

          

          

           56.

          DEAKINS
          We're at the end of tunnel three.
          (clicks off; to

          JOHNSON)
          You two get this one set. I'll
          take the other one up.

          HALE AND TERRY
          Running along a tunnel.

          TERRY
          What do we do?

          HALE
          Beat 'em back to the elevator.
          Stop 'em from getting out.
          Terry nods. They hurry off around a corner and are met by...

          A FLURRY OF BULLETS
          Fired by...

          DEAKINS
          With his Uzi.

          HALE AND TERRY
          Run back down the side tunnel, bullets winging off the rock all
          around them, shooting back. Hale starts shooting out the
          lights, plunging the tunnel into darkness.

          DEAKINS
          Slows down.

          DEAKINS
          The bit with the sock was good.
          I like it. Still, I'm gonna use
          the the Field Expedient Tactical
          Timer. It's a little more precise.

          (BEAT)
          See, Hale -- you aren't the only
          one who's thought of setting off
          a nuke in this mine.

          BY THE NUKE
          Kelly is there with Johnson. Kelly flips on a lamp on a
          headstrap, giving him better light as he opens up the metal
          briefcase he's been carrying.

          INSIDE THE BRIEFCASE
          An elaborate electronic timer.

          

          

          

          

           57.

          IN THE TUNNELS
          Deakins pulls out a fresh clip.

          DEAKINS
          I need a demonstration. Otherwise,
          some swinging dick in Washington
          is going to say I don't have the
          balls or the ability to set off a
          nuclear weapon. I'm gonna show
          these puppies I'm ready, willing
          and able. Hell, I'm eager.
          Deakins jams in his clip, walks into the dark part of the tunnel.

          HALE AND TERRY
          In the dark, waiting to ambush Deakins and then...

          DEAKINS
          Opens fire -- but not at Hale and Terry -- at the cable along
          the ceiling connecting the lights. The cable snaps and
          electrical sparks shoot out, flooding the tunnel with light,
          showing...

          HALE AND TERRY
          Suddenly exposed to Deakins' fire. The bullets whiz in.

          DEAKINS
          The muzzle flashes from his Uzi give away his position and Hale
          and Terry's bullets scream in at him. He backs around a corner.

          HALE AND TERRY
          Take cover. It's a stand-off.

          DEAKINS
          Well, Hale, I better be going.
          Look at it this way, partner. If
          you wanted to get closer to God,
          you are about to get your wish.
          Hale hears Deakins' footsteps start off.

          HALE
          You're gonna ransom Salt Lake
          City, aren't you?
          The footsteps stop.

          DEAKINS
          What makes you think that?

          

          

          

          

           58.

          HALE
          That's where St. Judes Hospital
          is. You're gonna hide the nukes
          near the radiology department so
          they won't show up an any
          satellite radiation scans.

          DEAKINS
          I'm impressed.

          HALE
          How much are you gonna ask for?

          DEAKINS
          Enough. I've got a broker in
          Stockholm. Monday morning he's
          going to buy me five percent of
          Volvo. For the rest of my days
          I'm going to live off the
          dividends, happy in the knowledge
          I'm helping to build the safest
          car in the world.

          HALE
          So that's it? You're just doing
          'this for the money? I'm kind of
          disappointed.

          DEAKINS
          Why would you do it, Hale?

          HALE
          That's the thing -- I wouldn't.

          DEAKINS
          If you were me.

          HALE
          If I were you...?
          (thinks, starts in)
          Because ... because I got passed
          over for promotion and goddamnit
          I'm going to show the bastards
          that I'm smarter than them all.
          (getting angry)
          Because ... everyone's selling out
          and cashing in, so why not me?

          (ANGRIER)
          Because ... because my ex-wife was
          sleeping around. Because my
          parents abused me. Because I ate
          some sugar.

          (takes a breath,

          GRINS)
          It's all bullshit, Deak. There
          are no reasons. Not really.
          There's no difference between you
          and the guy who shoots up the
          schoolyard with an M-16. You both
          think you have reasons. You both
          think you were wronged. The
          truth? You're both just fucked in
          the head.

          DEAKINS' FACE
          Grim, evil -- fades into darkness as he turns and walks off.

          HALE AND TERRY
          They hear footsteps, receding. Hale bolts out of their hiding
          spot. Terry follows.

          INT. BOTTOM OF ELEVATOR SHAFT

          Deakins gets to the elevator, drags the other nuke in, shuts the
          gate and starts up.

          INT. END OF TUNNEL

          Kelly finishes keying in numbers into the nuke timer. An amber
          light comes on and...

          THE TIMER
          Starts ticking down from ton minutes.

          KELLY AND JOHNSON
          Grab their guns and run.

          INT. MINESHAFT ENTRANCE

          The elevator comes up. Deakins drags out the nuke, hits the
          DOWN button, shuts the gate. The elevator descends.

          DEAKINS
          Mr. Pritchett!

          Hale and Terry are waiting for the elevator to come down when...

          Unload with their Uzis.

          HALE AND TERRY
          Back around a corner, side by side, shooting their pistols.

          JOHNSON
          Is shot, drops.

          KELLY
          Grabs Johnson's Uzi and, firing both guns, backs to the
          elevator, kicks open the gate with his foot and gets inside. He
          hits the UP button with the butt of one of the guns and the
          elevator starts to rise.

          HALE AND TERRY
          Step out of the tunnel and fire on the climbing elevator.

          We can go back, try to shut it
          down.

          HALE
          We don't know the code, and Deak'd
          have it wired to blow if we so
          much as look at it funny.

          TERRY

          come.

          TERRY
          Oh, God.
          Hale takes Terry in his arms, holds her.

          TERRY
          I ... I just hope someone
          remembers to feed my dog.
          Hale nods, hugs Terry. Terry starts to say something else, but
          Hale puts a finger to his lips -- he's heard something -- a
          distant rushing.

          HALE
          Come on.
          Hale pulls Terry, running, down the far tunnel.

          TERRY
          What're you --?

          HALE
          You said they shut down the mine
          when they hit an underground river.

          INT. MINESHAFT ENTRANCE

          Deakins slams the tailgate on the Humvee shut. From the
          distance, he and Pritchett hear the whump-whump-whump of a
          helicopter. Deakins motions Pritchett to stay.

          EXT. MINE ENTRANCE

          Deakins comes out, looks up, sees...

          THE NEST HELICOPTER
          Coming toward him, two miles away.

          INT. MINE TUNNEL

          Hale and Terry run up. The tunnel comes to an end at a big
          hole. The rushing sound comes from the hole. They step up
          to the edge and look down.

          THEIR POV
          Dark water rushes by ten feet below them.

          HALE
          Any idea where it goes?

          TERRY
          No.
          They look at each other. They don't have any choice. They
          flick on their flashlights and jump. They-hit the water and are
          swept from view.

          INT. MINESHAFT ENTRANCE

          Deakins enters, motions for Pritchett to get into the Humvee.

          DEAKINS
          Get in. We're leaving.

          PRITCHETT
          (re: Kelly and

          JOHNSON)
          Aren't you going to wait for them?

          DEAKINS
          No time. And if they get out,
          they might talk. Fortunately,
          there's something wrong with the
          elevator.
          Deakins opens fire with his Uzi on the generator. Sparks fly
          and the thing shuts down.

          INT. ELEVATOR

          Kelly is jarred when the elevator stops and the lights dim.

          EXT. MINE ENTRANCE

          Deakins and Pritchett drive out of the mine in the Humvee.
          Deakins punches the trip odometer, setting it to zeroes.

          Jutting down like knives, ready-to rip then open.

          HALE AND TERRY
          Dodge them, push off, duck under. And then they notice that...

          THE CEILING
          Is getting lower, getting closer to the surface of the water.
          They're running out of breathing room. Three feet, two feet,
          one foot. They take big breaths, maybe their last, and
          they're...

          UNDERWATER
          Tumbling along, pulled at by the eddies, flashlights showing
          their faces -- they are running out of air. And then, there's
          light above them in the water.

          HALE AND TERRY
          Lungs bursting, they start kicking up.

          Closing in on him.

          PRITCHETT

          PRITCHETT
          I think I've finally figured out

          but we're going to rise from the
          dead and

          DEAKINS
          Very suddenly and very violently lashes out. The side of his
          hand hits Pritchett in the throat.

          PRITCHETT
          Gags silently, suddenly unable to get any air. He pulls at his
          throat, even pounds himself in the back of the neck. No go. He
          slowly slumps, dying, skin turning blue.

          THE NEST HELICOPTER
          Drops out of sight behind a rock formation. There's an
          explosion and a ball of fire shoots up.

          EXT. COLORADO RIVER - RIVER BANK

          Terry looks over at Hale -- holy shit.

          INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL ROOM

          The lamps are still swinging.

          GILES
          That's all we need. A goddamn
          earthquake.

          WILKINS
          Son, I was at the Nevada Test site
          in the fifties. That wasn't an
          earthquake.

          EXT. 4WD TRAIL

          Deakins picks himself up.

          DEAKINS
          (to himself)
          At least I know they work.

          INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL ROOM

          Wilkins grabs a phone. Giles is pacing, freaked.

          

          

          

          

           68.

          WILKINS
          (into phone)
          Get me the Room.

          GILES
          I have to get out of here.

          WILKINS
          You're going to be fine. It was
          underground.
          (into phone)
          Colonel Wilkins for General
          Creeley.

          GILES
          How do you know?

          WILKINS
          For one thing, if it was above
          ground, it wouldn't have caused
          the same kind of ground tremor.
          For another, if it was above
          ground, we'd all be blind and
          dying.
          (into phone)
          Sir, we've just had a detonation.

          INT. PENTAGON -- SITUATION ROOM

          Bedlam. People yelling. The Chairman is huddling with Baird.

          BAIRD
          How'd that happen?

          CHAIRMAN
          I don't know, but thank God it
          happened underground.

          BAIRD
          What do we do now?

          CHAIRMAN
          First thing we do is put a huge
          goddamn lid on this thing. With
          all due respect to your boy Giles
          and his belief in honesty as the
          best policy, from now on and until
          the end of time, what happened in
          Utah tonight was an earthquake.
          All right?
          Baird nods.

          EXT. 4WD TRAIL

          The Humvee races along the trail.

          

          

          

          

           69.

          IN THE HUMVEE
          Deakins and the dead Pritchett motor along. Deakins turns to
          Pritchett as if Pritchett had just asked him a question.

          DEAKINS
          The helicopter? It was hit by
          EMP. Electromagnetic pulse. It's
          released in a nuclear detonation.
          It wipes out anything electronic
          for miles. That"s another reason
          I wanted to set off a nuke. I
          knew it'd bring down any
          helicopters coming for us. It'll
          also shut down all radio
          communications for a few hours,
          which will severely screw up their
          response.

          (GRINS)
          You see, Mr. Pritchett? There
          really is nothing for you to worry
          about.
          Pritchett's body seems to nod from the motion of the Humvee.

          EXT. COLORADO RIVER - RIVER BANK


          BUTTERFLIES
          Hover and dance over the water in the early morning light.

          HALE
          Hale has his shirt off and is wringing it out.

          TERRY (O.S.)
          Goddamn it!
          He turns to see Terry trying to undo her buttons but unable to
          her fingers are too numb.

          TERRY
          Stupid buttons. I hate these
          shirts. They're ugly and stupid
          and --
          Terry suddenly starts crying. It's not the shirt she's upset
          about. Hale holds her.

          HALE
          It's okay.

          TERRY
          We just ... I mean, we almost...

          HALE
          I know.

          

          

          

          

           70.

          TERRY
          A nuclear bomb went off.

          HALE
          That it did.

          TERRY
          Are we...?

          HALE
          Look.
          (points at

          BUTTERFLIES)
          If the butterflies are okay, then
          we'll be okay.

          TERRY
          Really?

          HALE
          Absolutely. It says so in the
          manual. "If you see butterflies
          after a detonation, you are fine."
          Terry looks at Hale. She knows he's bullshitting her, but she
          appreciates it. They look at each other. They could kiss ...
          but they both shy away from it. Terry gets her shirt off.

          HALE
          We better get moving. We might be
          able to reach Deakins when he gets
          to the river.
          They start off along a trail by the river.

          HALE
          Something I've been meaning to ask.
          (Terry looks at him)
          How did someone like you end up
          with a gun?

          TERRY
          I hit a bankrobber with a frozen
          chicken.

          HALE
          Excuse me?

          TERRY
          I came out here one summer during
          college. It was the campaign to
          stop the dam in the Grand Canyon.
          I loved it here. I came back,
          worked as a river guide and
          eventually stayed year-round. When
          a Park Ranger job came open, I
          applied.

          

          

          

          

           71.

          HALE
          I'm still waiting for the chicken.

          TERRY
          The local Parks Department wasn't
          sure how I'd do with the law
          enforcement part of the job. Well,
          one night I was coming home from
          the store and Tommy Drewson part
          of the local brain trust was
          robbing old Bob Kearney in front
          of the ATM. I bear old Bob
          yelling and I see Tommy heading
          for his car, so I tossed a bag of
          groceries at him at thirty miles
          an hour. A frozen chicken in the
          bag hit him in the forehead and he
          dropped like a rock. Next thing
          I know, I'm a Ranger.
          Hale looks at Terry with a new appreciation.

          EXT. 4WD TRAIL

          Deakins pilots the Humvee along the trail.

          EXT. COLORADO RIVER - RIVERBANK TRAIL

          Hale and Terry are crouching behind a rock, looking down.

          THEIR POV
          A zodiac raft has been pulled up on the river bank. A man with
          an Uzi -- SHEPPARD -- waits, duffel bag by his feet.

          TERRY
          Get me a frozen Zacky's fryer and
          he's a dead man.
          There's the sound of an approaching engine. Sheppard stands,
          gun ready. The engine stops. A few seconds later...

          DEAKINS
          Appears, walking down a footpath toward Sheppard.

          SHEPPARD
          Where is everyone?

          DEAKINS
          I am everyone. Let's go.
          Sheppard hurries to Deakins. They disappear up the footpath.

          

          

          

          

           72.

          HALE AND TERRY

          HALE
          Shit.

          TERRY
          What?

          HALE
          We're the only ones who know
          what's going on, and I don't have
          the faintest idea how we're gonna
          stop them.

          TERRY
          You'll think of something.

          HALE
          Why do you say that?

          TERRY
          You have so far.
          Hale looks at Terry -- she's right. But it almost pisses him
          off more than it gives him confidence. He grumbles to himself
          and starts off down toward the raft.

          TERRY
          Sink it?

          HALE
          Steal it.
          They get down to the raft. They climb in. Hale grabs the
          engine throttle, slumps.

          HALE
          Keys.
          Hale looks around, spots Sheppard's duffel bag lying on the
          riverbank. He hops out and starts rummaging through it when
          they hear grunting and feet approaching.
          Hale looks around for a place to hide. There isn't any. Terry
          tries to get out of the raft, but she trips on a tarpaulin
          bunched on the bottom of the raft. she drops.

          WITH DEAKINS AND SHEPPARD
          Coming down a path, lugging the last remaining nuke.

          THEIR POV
          Of the raft. Hale and Terry are nowhere to be seen.

          

          

          

          

           73.

          HALE
          Is alone, in the water, on the far side of the raft, very
          silent. He hears Deakins and Sheppard load the nuke into the
          raft.

          SHEPPARD (O.S.)
          Why were you driving around with
          a dead guy?

          DEAKINS (O.S.)
          Because I like him. He doesn't
          ask a lot of annoying questions.
          All right?
          A few seconds later the engine starts up. Hale ducks down under
          water as the raft takes off over him. He surfaces to watch the
          raft zooming off into the distance. He is very worried.

          ON THE RAFT - MOVING
          The nuke is on a pallet in the middle of the raft. Sheppard
          pilots the raft. Deakins looks around, sees what he wants.

          A TARP
          Is lying on the deck of the raft along one side, all bunched up.
          It'd be the kind of thing you'd hide under.

          DEAKINS
          Grabs the tarp and pulls.

          UNDER THE TARP
          There's no one there.

          DEAKINS
          Throws the tarp over the nuke. As he does, we PAN OVER to...

          A LONG CRATE MARKED "LIFE JACKETS"
          Strapped to one of the side pontoons. A small triangle of cloth
          is sticking out from inside the crate -- like the corner of a
          shirt. It's quickly pulled out of sight from within.

          BACK ON THE RIVERBANK
          Hale climbs out of the water and looks around, not knowing quite
          what to do.

          EXT. LAKE POWELL - TRANSFER POINT

          The zodiac boat is on the shore. Sheppard and four man -- call
          them the GUNMEN -- are hauling the nuke to the truck. Deakins
          walks with another man -- MAX, 50s. Max checks his watch.

          

          

          

          

           74.

          MAX
          Your friends in Washington should
          be getting the package about now.

          DEAKINS
          I wish I could see their faces.

          INT. PENTAGON - SITUATION ROOM

          Baird, the Chairman, Creeley and the others are all staring
          slack-jawed at a TV screen.

          ON THE TV
          Camcorder shot of Deakins against a black backdrop.

          DEAKINS
          ... two-hundred-and-fifty million
          dollars, by nine a.m. Utah time.
          The depositing instructions are in
          the envelope that came with this
          tape. This deadline is not
          negotiable, and there is no grace
          period. The device is on a timer.
          Shortly after you receive this,
          the timer will be activated. At
          nine a.m., I will make a call. If
          I find out you've done as you've
          been told, I will stop the timer.
          If you have not complied --
          The screen suddenly cuts to a flurry of images of nuclear
          destruction -- buildings being knocked sideways, mushroom
          clouds, shockwaves, fires.

          CHAIRMAN
          Turn that off!

          EXT. LAKE POWELL

          Hale runs along the shoreline, headed for...

          A MARINA
          Where houseboats are rented out. Hale's eyes focus on a sign
          with a picture of a phone on it.

          EXT. LAKE POWELL - TRANSFER POINT

          The back gate of the truck is shut from the inside. The truck
          starts up and rumbles off, slowly at first.

          TERRY
          Jumps up from the raft and runs after the truck, staying right
          behind. She grabs a handhold and pulls herself up. She holds
          on tight as the truck bounces off down the dirt road.

          

          

          

          

           75.

          INT. PENTAGON SITUATION ROOM

          Loud voices and crosstalk. Baird is on the phone, nodding.

          BAIRD
          Yes, sir.
          Creeley's phone rings. He answers it.

          CREELEY
          Creeley.

          BAIRD
          (covers phone; to

          CHAIRMAN)
          The President wants to know if we
          know where the device is headed.

          CHAIRMAN
          If Deakins had a plane waiting, it
          could be anywhere. We just don't
          know.

          CREELEY
          I do.
          (all eyes on him)
          Major Hale is alive. According to
          him, Colonel Deakins is headed for
          Salt Lake City.

          EXT. LAKE POWELL - MARINA

          Army helicopters are landing near the marina. Two are already
          down. One has TROOPS standing outside of it.

          HALE, WILKINS AND GILES
          Are walking toward the second helicopter.

          WILKINS
          We found the raft on the other
          side of the lake. Tracks from a
          heavy truck ran out when they hit
          the paved road.

          HALE
          If we get a rad scanner we can
          track them.
          A brief look between Wilkins and Giles.

          WILKINS
          Actually, Major, we're going back
          to McMurran.

          HALE
          What?

          

          

          

          

           76.

          GILES
          We'd just like to ask you a few
          questions.

          HALE
          I'm not wasting time answering
          questions. We've got --

          WILKINS
          No debate, Major. I was given
          orders. Now, you can come with us,
          or you can go with them.
          Wilkins nods over at the other helicopter. The troops standing
          in front of it are MPs. Hale looks at Wilkins, astounded.

          EXT./INT. WILKINS' HELICOPTER - IN FLIGHT

          Wilkins is up front with the pilot. Hale and Giles are in back.
          All wear headsets. Hale is yelling at Wilkins.

          HALE
          Deakins thinks I'm dead. He
          thinks it's over. You've got to
          let me go after him. I can help.
          I know how his mind works.

          WILKINS
          Major, I know this is personal for
          you, but I think we can handle it.
          We're putting a wall of men and
          machines around Salt Lake City as
          we speak. That truck is not
          getting through.

          INT. TRUCK


          CLOSE ON THE NUCLEAR WEAPON
          Dusty slices of light come through the truck's slatted walls.
          The nuclear weapon is lashed to a hammock, straps running off to
          D-rings on the sides. Max is hooking up an electronic timer.

          INT. WILKINS' HELICOPTER


          HALE
          What about the Ranger?

          GILES
          What about her?

          HALE
          When you find that truck, you'll
          hit it hard. Chances are she'll
          be killed in the crossfire.
          "Regrettable but unavoidable."

          

          

          

          

           77.
          Giles and Wilkins share a look -- Hale is right.

          HALE
          Look, she's not supposed to be
          there. She should be checking
          camping permits, finding lost
          kids. She...

          (BEAT)
          She saved my life.
          Giles wants to help. So does Wilkins, but...

          WILKINS
          We were ordered to take you back
          to McMurran. You understand what
          orders are, don't you, Major?
          Wilkins turns away. Hale sits back, mind racing, not knowing
          what to do. He quickly grabs a pistol from the helicopter's
          weapons rack and puts it to Wilkin's neck.

          WILKINS
          Major, put that away or say
          goodbye to your career and hello
          to twenty years in Leavenworth.

          HALE
          If that's what it takes.

          WILKINS
          You'll have to shoot me.
          Hale thinks, but there's no way he can do that. He lowers the
          gun, sits back.
          Giles gets Hale's attention, then points to his own head. Hale
          doesn't understand, so Giles grabs Hale's gunhand and puts the
          gun up to his head.

          GILES
          Colonel! How about this?
          Wilkins looks back, sees Hale holding the gun to Giles' head.

          HALE
          (bad acting)
          I swear to God I'll shoot.
          Wilkins grins.

          INT. TRUCK

          Max finishes hooking up the timer. He looks at Deakins.

          MAX
          Ready when you are.

          

          

          

          

           78.

          DEAKINS
          Wait until I get back. I'm going
          to check on Sheppard.
          Deakins goes to a ladder that leads up to the ceiling.

          INT. WILKIN'S HELICOPTER

          Hale is looking back and forth between what he sees out the
          window and the map on his lap.

          WILKINS
          I don't know what you're looking
          for, Major. Every road between
          here and salt Lake has already
          been sealed.

          HALE
          Deak would know that. Maybe he's
          not on the road.
          Wilkins doesn't understand.

          HALE
          They were using maps like these to
          set up the roadblocks?

          WILKINS
          Yes...?

          HALE
          Then that's the answer.
          Wilkins doesn't understand. Hale points outside, down at...

          TRAIN TRACKS
          On the ground. Old ones, half-covered by weeds.

          HALE
          It's an old spur. Probably hasn't
          been used in twenty years. Nobody
          bothered to put it on the new maps.

          WILKINS
          What are you --?

          HALE
          The nuke isn't in a truck,
          Colonel. It's on a train.

          EXT. TRAIN

          A freight train -- engine, a car carrier (carrying a load of
          Toyotas), several boxcars and a caboose. A hatch opens up an
          the roof of one of the boxcars near the tail of the train and...

          

          

          

          

           79.

          DEAKINS
          Climbs out and we discover that indeed they are not in a truck,
          they're in a train. The "nuke boxcar" has a small satellite
          dish mounted on the roof.

          THE FOUR GUNMEN
          Are in position at points along the train, ready with Uzis.

          INT. WILKINS' HELICOPTER

          Wilkins hangs up the radio mike.

          WILKINS
          Radio's still down. We'll head
          north, look for a phone, then look
          for a train.
          Giles nods. Hale is thinking. Wilkins starts to tell the pilot.

          HALE
          No. Go south.

          GILES
          Salt Lake is north.

          HALE
          He's not going to Salt Lake.

          GILES
          But you said it would be Salt
          Lake. You found that hospital tag.

          HALE
          He planted that. He wanted
          whoever found it to think that's
          where he was going.
          (Shakes head)
          He's been doing a rope-a-dope.
          Giles and Wilkins look at him like he's nuts.

          HALE
          It's a boxing term. When Ali --
          Look, I know this guy. If
          everything has been saying he's
          heading north, then he's heading
          south.
          They look at him, then Wilkins grabs the map.

          WILKINS
          What's south of here?

          

          

          

          

           80.

          ECU MAP
          Wilkins' finger follows the train line on the map. It goes
          right into Las Vegas.

          HALE
          No. Not Vegas. What the hell is
          there to blow up in Vegas?
          Wilkins' finger keeps moving on the map.

          GILES
          The President.
          Wilkins' finger stops.

          EXT. TRAIN

          Deakins jumps the gap between two boxcars and walks on. We
          ANGLE DOWN to reveal...

          TERRY
          Crouching down between the two cars.

          INT. TRAIN ENGINE - DRIVER'S COMPARTMENT

          Sheppard is working with a torch, welding the brake and
          accelerator controls. Deakins enters. Sheppard turns the torch
          down. Deakins lights a cigarette off it.

          DEAKINS
          How much longer?

          SHEPPARD
          Almost done.

          INT. TRAIN ENGINE ENGINE AREA

          Behind the driver's compartment is the engine itself, with
          walkways along either side.

          TERRY
          Creeps-up to one of the doors that lead into the driver's
          compartment. She hears...

          SHEPPARD (O.S.)
          How long until the helicopter gets
          here?

          INT. DRIVER'S COMPARTMENT


          DEAKINS
          Five minutes. We'll leave from
          the boxcar roof.

          

          

          

          

           81.
          Deakins turns to go.

          INT. TRAIN ENGINE - ENGINE AREA

          Deakins opens the door and strides along beside the engine.

          TERRY
          Is hiding on the other side of the engine, very quiet and still.
          As Deakins goes out the back door of the engine, Terry follows.

          EXT. TRAIN - BETWEEN ENGINE AND BOXCAR

          Terry comes out the door and is about to step across to the
          ladder on the boxcar when we PULL BACK to reveal...

          DEAKINS
          As he puts a gun to the back of Terry's head.

          EXT. GAS STATION AND MINI-MART

          A RANCHER comes out of the mini-mart with a cup of coffee and
          heads for his old pickup truck. He starts to open his door when
          he hears, incongruously, whump-whump-whump. He looks up as...

          WILKINS' HELICOPTER
          Comes in, gets about three feet off the ground and Giles jumps
          out. As Giles runs to a payphone, the helicopter pulls up and
          flies away, leaving the Rancher agog.

          INT. NUKE BOXCAR

          Terry comes down the ladder from the hatch, followed by Deakins
          with a gun.

          DEAKINS
          Terry, Max. Max, Terry.

          MAX
          (to Terry)
          A pleasure.
          (to Deakins)
          What the hell is a "Terry" and why
          is it still live?

          DEAKINS
          She asked me how I thought I was
          going to get away with this and I
          thought I'd tell her.
          (to Terry)
          We're going to a cabin in the
          mountains, not far from here. When
          we get there I'm gonna make two
          phone calls.

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

           82.
          DEAKINS (cont'd)
          The first is to the Pentagon. I'm
          gonna tell them where the train
          is.

          (GRINS)
          See, all their forces are up at
          Salt Lake by now. By the time
          they could get a F-15 down here
          the train will be on the outskirts
          of Vegas. And I'll remind them
          about the impact trigger -- if
          they hit this train hard, the
          nuke'll blow.
          (shakes head)
          They won't have any choice.
          They'll have to let the train get
          into the city and because of that,
          they'll have to pay.

          TERRY
          You said two phone calls.

          DEAKINS
          The second will be to my bank in
          Geneva. If the money's in my
          account, I use this...
          (pulls out what looks
          like a modified cell-

          PHONE)
          ... and shut down the timer. If
          not, we sit back, put on some
          shades and get a quick tan.

          TERRY
          But -- radio isn't working.

          DEAKINS
          You saw the dish on the roof?
          Microwave. It's not affected by
          EMP. See? I really have thought
          of everything.

          MAX
          You kept her alive just so you can
          impress her with how smart you are?

          DEAKINS
          (to Max)
          No, I kept her alive because I
          want her to do me a favor. See,
          if something goes wrong and this
          thing goes off, a half a million
          people are going to be vaporized.
          I don't want that on my
          conscience. So I'm not going to
          arm the nuke.

          DEAKINS (cont'd)
          (puts gun to Terry's

          HEAD)
          She is.

          INT. PENTAGON SITUATION ROOM

          The room is silent. Everyone is looking at video monitors
          showing a map of Las Vegas. They are listening to a nervous
          ASSISTANT as he uses a telestrator to diagram the blast effects.

          AIR FORCE ASSISTANT
          Starting at ground zero and moving
          out, we have, in terms of
          immediate effect, one hundred
          percent fatalities to thirty
          miles. Ninety percent from thirty
          to forty miles, dropping roughly
          ten percent for every-ten miles
          after that. The long term --

          CHAIRMAN
          (cut to the chase)
          Son?

          AIR FORCE ASSISTANT
          (looks up, seared)
          Two hundred and fifty thousand in
          the first few seconds. The same
          again within a year.

          BAIRD
          (it sinks in)
          Good God.

          INT. NUKE BOXCAR

          Terry is shaking, tears in her eyes, as she slowly-enters the
          numbers Deakins tells her to in the nuke timer keypad.

          DEAKINS
          Nine ... Then pound ... Good. Now
          six ...

          ECU TERRY'S EYES
          Filled with tears. She blinks and...

          QUICK CUTS
          Terry has visions of RETIREES in Vegas, watering potted plants
          outside their motor home, of TEENAGERS ragging on each other as
          they walk to school, of CHILDREN in a playground.

          DEAKINS
          Seven ... Star ... One...

          

          

          

          

           84.
          And Terry shakingly pushing each button and then...
          The images of the retirees, the teenagers and the children each
          bleach out to white, fast, as if hit by a nuclear blast.

          DEAKINS
          Then ENTER and it's done.

          TERRY
          Her finger hovers over the ENTER button, almost pushes it, then
          shifts to CANCEL and pushes that.

          ECU NUKE TIMER
          The display goes blank.

          DEAKINS
          Stunned. He shakes his head.

          DEAKINS
          Ooh. You really shouldn't have
          done that. I said I would kill
          you, and I will.

          TERRY
          I'm gonna be dead either way. I
          don't want any part of this.
          Deakins shrugs -- he sees her logic. He puts his gun to Terry's
          head. Terry shuts her eyes.

          DEAKINS
          Night-night.
          Deakins is about to pull the trigger when Max stops him. Max
          gestures -- listen. They hear a helicopter approaching. Max
          checks his watch.

          DEAKINS
          They're early.
          Just then, they hear gunfire. Max gives Deakins a look.

          DEAKINS
          It's not a problem. Set the
          timer, then kill her. Have fun
          with it.
          Deakins starts climbing up the ladder to the hatch.

          EXT. TRAIN

          The GUNMAN at the caboose is firing on Wilkins's helicopter,
          hanging a hundred yards off the back of the train.

          

          

          

          

           85.

          INT. NUKE BOXCAR

          Max holds a pistol on Terry with one hand while he quickly sets
          the timer with the other.

          TERRY'S HAND
          Rests on Max's tool tray. Her fingers creep over to a vrench.

          MAX
          Presses ENTER and finishes setting the timer.

          MAX
          There.

          TERRY AND MAX
          Terry swings hard and fast with the wrench, knocking the gun out
          of Max's hand. Max spins, and when Terry swings at him again.
          Max kicks the wrench out of her hand, then steps up fast and
          hits Terry under the chin with the heel of his hand. She drops
          straight back.

          MAX
          Thought I was just friendly old
          Max, huh? Lady, I was a Navy SEAL.
          You should see what I can do with
          just my thumb.
          Max goes for his gun.

          TERRY'S HAND
          Grabs onto something. It's the wrench.

          TERRY AND MAX
          As Max turns back with the gun, Terry heaves the wrench. It
          hits Max square in the forehead. He drops like a rock.

          TERRY
          Yeah? Well, you should see what
          I can do with just a chicken.

          EXT. TRAIN - CABOOSE

          Deakins joins his man on top of the caboose, firing on Wilkins,
          helicopter.

          INT. HELICOPTER

          Wilkins and Hale are returning fire. Hale points at Deakins.

          HALE
          That's him!

          

          

          

          

           86.

          WILKINS
          (to pilot)
          Get him!

          PILOT
          They've got guns!

          WILKINS
          You've got a helicopter. Use it!

          EXT. TRAIN

          Deakins and the gunman keep firing on the helicopter as...

          THE HELICOPTER
          Comes swooping in.

          DEAKINS
          Sees what's going to happen and turns and runs as...

          THE HELICOPTER
          Drops down beside the train. The rotor blades whip about three
          feet over the train roof and the pilot starts forward.

          DEAKINS AND THE GUNMAN
          Run from the blades as fast as they can.

          THE HELICOPTER
          Closes fast.

          DEAKINS AND THE GUNMAN
          Jump from car to car. The gunman passes Deakins. Just when the
          helicopter blades are about to catch up to Deakins...

          DEAKINS
          Jumps down between two boxcars and the rotor blades go right
          over his head. Deakins hears an awful sound and a scream cut
          short.

          HELICOPTER POV
          Swooping fast over the train when suddenly...

          TERRY
          Pops up out of the hatch, her back to the helicopter.

          HALE (O.S.)
          Pull up!

          

          

          

          

           87.

          THE HELICOPTER
          Pulls up fast.

          TERRY
          Watches the helicopter bank away. Bullets-start whizzing by her.

          DEAKINS
          Has climbed up and is shooting at her.

          TERRY
          Runs away from Deakins, shooting Max's pistol behind her blindly.

          TWO GUNMEN
          Appear two cars ahead of Terry and start toward her, shooting.

          TERRY
          Is caught between Deakins and the gunmen with no way out when...

          THE HELICOPTER
          Comes along the length of the train, flying low. It rises up
          and there's...

          HALE
          Hanging from the helicopter on a cable hooked to a harness and
          he's firing a pistol, shooting right over Terry at...

          THE FIRST GUNMAN
          He's hit, falls off the train.

          THE SECOND GUNMAN
          Aims at Terry and starts firing.

          TERRY
          The bullets rip up the boxcar roof around her. She jumps up and
          grabs onto...

          HALE
          As he swings in on the cable, shooting his pistol.

          HALE AND TERRY
          Are lifted up and over...

          

          

          

          

           88.

          THE SECOND GUNMAN
          Who turns, firing a shotgun. Hale's bullets find him. He falls.

          SHEPPARD
          Appears, firing an Uzi at Hale, Terry and the helicopter.

          IN THE HELICOPTER
          Bullets rip through. Wilkins is hit, knocked back.

          THE CABLE HOLDING HALE AND TERRY
          Is severed by one of Sheppard's bullets.

          HALE AND TERRY
          Drop ten feet to the roof of a boxcar. Hale shoots as they fall.

          SHEPPARD
          Is hit and drops.

          THE HELICOPTER
          Banks away fast, making ugly sounds, smoke billowing out. The
          engine cuts out and the helicopter drops to a hard landing
          beside the tracks.

          HALE AND TERRY
          Watch the helicopter land as the train rolls on. They look at
          each other.

          TERRY
          You stop the nuke. I'll stop the
          train.
          Hale nods. Terry starts forward, then turns.

          TERRY
          I'd yell at you for coming after
          me, but you did just save my life.
          Hale grins. They hear a helicopter in the distance. They look
          over to see...

          A RED CROSS HELICOPTER
          Coming in fast.

          HALE AND TERRY
          Any excitement turns to confusion when they see...

          

          

          

          

           89.

          A MAN
          Standing in the doorway of the Red Cross helicopter, holding a
          gun.

          TERRY
          That's Deakins' escape route.

          HALE
          Not any more.
          Terry nods. They share a last look, then Terry heads off. Male
          coils up the winch cable, slings it over his shoulder and heads
          for the nuke boxcar and his old friend Deakins. He picks up...

          THE SHOTGUN
          Left by deceased Gunman #2.

          EXT. CAR CARRIER

          Makes her way past the Toyotas.

          EXT. WILKINS' HELICOPTER - BESIDE TRAIN TRACKS

          Wilkins and the pilot stand outside their disabled helicopter.
          The train is way off in the distance. They hear honking and
          turn to see...

          A PICKUP TRUCK
          Tearing toward then along a dirt road, horn honking.

          CLOSE ON PICKUP
          The RANCHER from the mini-mart is driving; Giles beside him.

          INT. TRAIN ENGINE - DRIVER'S COMPARTMENT

          Terry comes into the driver's compartment. She tugs at the
          brake and accelerator levers. It's useless. She looks around,
          spots a cigarette lighter.

          INT. BOXCAR

          Deakins and the one remaining GUNMAN hear the helicopter. They
          start toward the ladder to the roof hatch when they hear
          footsteps on the roof of the car. Deakins gestures to the
          gunman. He raises his gun, trying to figure out where to shoot.
          Then they hear someone tugging at the hatch handle. The gunman
          opens fire on the hatch.

          EXT. ON TOP OF BOXCAR

          Bullets stream up through the hatch cover, but Hale is nowhere
          in sight. One end of Hale's helicopter winch cable is tied to
          the hatch cover.

          

          

          

          

           90.
          We follow the cable fast, over to the side of the boxcar to
          find...

          HALE
          Standing, tugging on the cable, still attached to the harness.
          Hale racks a load in the shotgun and jumps back off the side of
          the train.

          INT. BOXCAR

          The gunman hears a sound, starts to turn, just as...

          HALE
          Swings into the boxcar on the cable, firing the shotgun.

          THE GUNMAN
          Is picked up by the blast and smashed back through the wood slat
          wall of the boxcar and out of the train.

          DEAKINS
          Climbs up fast through the hatch to the roof.

          HALE
          Shoots at Deakins, misses. The shotgun clicks empty. Hale
          tosses the gun then unhooks the cable from the harness. He
          drops to the floor-of the boxcar and runs to the ladder.

          EXT. CAR CARRIER

          Terry has a three-foot length of gasoline-soaked cloth stuffed
          into the gas tank opening of a Toyota on the lower level of the
          car carrier. She lights it and hurries off.

          EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN

          Deakins steadies himself as...

          THE RED CROSS HELICOPTER
          Hovers in sideways toward the train. The MAN in the doorway
          holds out a hand to Deakins.

          DEAKINS
          Is reaching for the man's hand and grabs it when...

          HALE
          Reaches out of the hatch and grabs onto Deakins' foot.

          

          

          

          

           91.

          HALE AND DEAKINS
          Deakins kicks free of Hale, holds onto the man in the helicopter
          and is pulled onboard.

          THE HELICOPTER
          Moves sideways over the train.

          IN THE HELICOPTER
          Deakins turns, pulling his gun and shoots down at the train as...

          THE HELICOPTER
          Moves back sideways over the train.

          DEAKINS' POV
          No sign of Hale on the train roof.

          DEAKINS
          Get us out of here!

          THE PILOT
          Nods and starts to lift and bank. Then he gets an odd
          expression. The helicopter isn't doing what he wants.

          THE HELICOPTER
          Is hovering over the train, but it can't fly away because...

          HALE
          Is hanging onto the skids and he's hooked the cable to the skid.
          The other end of the cable is still attached to the hatch.

          THE HELICOPTER
          Strains against the cable, but it doesn't snap.

          IN THE HELICOPTER

          DEAKINS
          Hurry!

          POWER LINES
          Cross the track, a quarter-mile ahead.

          DEAKINS
          Leans out of the helicopter with his Uzi, shooting down at...

          

          

          

          

           92.

          HALE
          Who grabs onto the cable and slides down it to the roof of the
          train, bullets plugging in all around his. He jumps down
          through the hatch as...

          DEAKINS
          Sees what's coming and jumps.

          THE HELICOPTER
          Hits...

          THE POWER LIKES
          Which snap, shoot sparks and wrap around the helicopter's rotor.

          THE HELICOPTER
          Breaks up and flies apart as the train rolls on.

          EXT. CAR CARRIER

          The flame burning up the gas-soaked cloth goes into the Toyota
          gas tank and...

          THE TOYOTA
          Explodes.

          INT. NUKE BOXCAR

          Hale gets to his feet, goes to look at the nuke.

          ECU NUKE TIMER
          Five minutes and counting.

          HALE
          Looks at it, trying to figure out how to disarm it. He hears
          the whoosh-thump of someone jumping down into the boxcar. He
          turns.

          DEAKINS
          Stands there, trying to smile, trying to be cool, but...

          DEAKINS
          They would've paid and I would've
          stopped it. You've made a very,
          very big mistake.

          HALE
          It's over, Deak. I beat you.
          Disarm it.

          

          

          

          

           93.

          DEAKINS
          If it's over and you beat me, you
          disarm it.

          HALE
          Deak...

          DEAKINS
          Course you are going to need this.
          (holds cell-phone

          REMOTE)
          All you have to do is get it.
          (puts remote in

          POCKET)
          And if you do, as a special added
          bonus, you get this.
          Deakins pulls out...

          THE TWENTY DOLLAR BILL
          Then pockets it.

          HALE AND DEAKINS
          Share a look. Deakins puts up his fists.

          DEAKINS
          Ready?
          Hale puts up his fists.

          EXT. CAR CARRIER

          It's a chain reaction, with one flaming Toyota setting off the
          one above it or next to it.

          BETWEEN BOXCAR AND CAR CARRIER
          Terry is looking under the car carrier.

          TERRY'S POV
          The train car axle is smoking, grinding, glowing red in the heat
          from the flaming Toyotas.

          INT. BOXCAR

          Hale and Deakins circle each other.

          DEAKINS
          Modern boxing is a pussy sport.
          They want to make it about scoring
          points. It's not about scoring
          points! It's about this!

          

          

          

          

           94.
          Deakins fakes a right, jabs with his left, catching Hale on the
          chin. Hale is jarred. Blood runs from his mouth.

          DEAKINS
          Okay. You're bleeding. Good. In
          the old fights, there'd be so much
          blood, guys would slip and fall.
          Let's see if we can't get a little
          more of that red goo out of you.
          Ready?
          Again Deakins fakes right, jabs left. Hale half blocks it, but
          is sent back.

          EXT. TRAIN


          CU TRAIN AXLE
          The axle is bending, grinding, groaning.

          TERRY
          Is between the car carrier and a boxcar, looking down at the
          axle, not knowing what the hell she's going to do when she hears
          a horn honking. She turns.

          INT. BOXCAR


          DEAKINS
          Used to be, every fight was to a
          knockout. You know what happens
          when you get knocked out? It's
          your brain slapping against the
          inside of your skull. Here. I'll
          let you see what it's like. Ready?
          Deakins steps toward Hale, about to finish him off. Deakins
          swings. Hale ducks, comes up hard with all he's got, gets
          Deakins under the chin and Deakins sails up and back, landing
          prone, seeing stars.

          HALE
          Stands over Deakins, in silhouette, the light of the hatch above
          him. And then...

          EXT. THE TRAIN AXLE

          Snaps and...

          THE TRAIN
          Jumps the tracks.

          INT. BOXCAR

          Hale is thrown off his feet.

          

          

          

          

           95.

          THE NUCLEAR WEAPON
          Swings wildly in the hammock webbing.

          THE STRAPS
          Securing the webbing to the walls of the car start to snap.

          EXT. TRAIN

          The front cars accordion sideways off the tracks, down a short,
          steep, embankment. It's all grinding, twisting, groaning metal.

          FLAMING TOYOTAS
          Fly, tumble, explode.

          INT. BOXCAR

          Hale tries to get to his feet, but then the floor starts
          dropping below him as...

          EXT. THE TRAIN


          THE NUKE BOXCAR
          Goes down the steep slope of the embankment and stops.

          THE TRAIN
          The sounds of the crash cease. Dust and smoke. Burning Toyotas.

          INT. BOXCAR

          Flickering light from a burning Toyota comes in through the
          slatted walls. In this weird light, Hale sees...

          THE NUCLEAR WEAPON
          It's above him, at the end (top) of the car. It's hanging in
          mid-air, tangled up in the webbing. Two straps are the only
          things keeping the nuclear weapon from dropping twenty feet to
          the bottom of the car.

          DEAKINS
          Is lying at the bottom (end) of the car, directly under the
          nuke, not moving.

          HALE
          Looks around for something. He sees it --

          DEAKINS' REMOTE CONTROL DEVICE
          On the floor.

          

          

          

          

           96.

          DEAKINS' EYES
          Flicker open. He sees...

          A PISTOL
          Lying a few feet away.

          HALE

          DEAKINS (O.S.)
          You have to push amber, then red.
          You might have time to push amber.
          You won't get to red.
          Hale turns to see...

          DEAKINS
          Pointing a gun at him.

          HALE
          The nuke is armed, Deak. If it
          falls, the impact trigger will set
          it off.

          DEAKINS
          I know.

          HALE
          Half a million people will die.

          DEAKINS
          (thinks, shrugs)
          Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.

          ONE OF THE STRAPS
          Holding the nuke tears through. One strap left.

          HALE
          His finger hovers over the amber button.

          DEAKINS
          Do it and I shoot.
          Hale looks at Deakins.

          HALE
          I guess you really don't know me
          that well after all.
          Hale presses the amber button.

          

          

          

          

           97.

          DEAKINS
          Shoots.

          HALE
          Spins back, blood spraying from his shoulder.

          THE REMOTE
          Falls from his hand.

          DEAKINS
          Is about to shoot again, then hears a tearing and looks up as...

          THE LAST STRAP
          Rips through and...

          THE NUKE
          Drops toward him, point first.

          HALE'S BLOODY HAND
          Grabs the remote and his finger presses the RED button.

          ECU NUKE TIMER
          Mid-air, dropping, the clock and display go blank as...

          DEAKINS
          His eyes fill with true terror as...

          THE NUCLEAR WEAPON
          Punches into Deakins, point first, crushing him.

          HALE
          Gets to his feet and stands over Deakins. He reaches down,
          opens Deakins' pocket and pulls out the twenty-dollar bill.

          HALE
          Ready.
          He heads out of the boxcar.

          EXT. TRAIN TRACKS

          Hale climbs out of the boxcar and starts running through the
          train wreckage and burning cars, looking for Terry.

          

          

          

          

           98.

          A TV NEWSVAN
          Pulls up and a REPORTER and CAMERAMAN jump out.

          HALE
          Keeps running through the wreckage. He stops, unable to breathe
          when he sees...

          A FOOT
          In a boot, sticking out from under a burning Toyota.

          HALE
          Runs to the car, pulls at the foot, tries to push the car off
          the body underneath. O.S. another vehicle drives up.

          HALE
          Come on! Oh, God. Oh, no.
          Hale is pulling hard on the foot when...

          TERRY (O.S.)
          The Air Force pays you so little
          you have to steal shoes off dead
          people?
          Hale turns to see...

          TERRY
          Walkins over from the Rancher's pickup truck.

          WILKINS AND GILES
          Are behind her, grinning.

          HALE AND TERRY
          Run to each other. They embrace, start smoothing each other's
          hair, start wiping blood off each other's faces, start kissing,
          only to be interrupted by...

          THE TV REPORTER AND CAMERMAN

          REPORTER
          What happened here?
          Hale and Wilkins and Giles share a look.

          HALE
          Uh...
          (looks at flaming

          TOYOTAS)
          ... somebody was trying to steal
          some Toyotas.
          

          

           99.
          The reporter asks more questions. Hale and Terry walk off, arms
          around each other. As they go, Hale sticks out his hand to
          Terry.

          HALE
          Rawley Hale.

          TERRY
          Terry Carmichael.
          They shake hands and walk on as we...

             FADE IN:

             EXT. MEDIEVAL VILLAGE - JUST BEFORE SUNSET

             We see an Italian village at the height of the plague.  Funeral 
             processions, decrepit houses with their windows boarded up...  
             the stench of death all around.

             TITLE:  EUROPE. THE DARK AGES

             Through the filth a KNIGHT walks his horse.  He is weary but 
             not so dingy as his surrounding; a stranger in these parts.  
             He comes to an inn, where a boy takes his horse round back.  
             He enters the inn.

             INT. INN - SAME TIME

             The inn is dark and almost empty.  A couple of patrons drink 
             silently at tables.  Behind the bar stands a slovenly BARMAID, 
             dark-haired and lazy.  She scratches at her shoulder, on which 
             we see a birthmark.  The knight approaches the bar, throws 
             money down.

                                       KNIGHT
                            A tankard of ale, wench.

             The barmaid pours him a cup of ale.  He drinks deep, stands a 
             moment.

                                       KNIGHT
                                (continuing)
                            Some plague we're having, huh?

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. INN - UPSTAIRS HALL/BEDROOM - NIGHT

             The barmaid leads the knight, by candlelight, upstairs to his 
             room.  The door opens inward.  The knight stands in the doorway, 
             places a hand on the barmaid's hip.  She pauses a moment, then 
             breaks free of his grasp, starts down the hall.  He laughs a 
             bit, resignedly, and closes the door.

             A VAMPIRE stands behind it.  Not two feet from the knight, 
             grinning at him.  His eyes are skull-hollow and dancing in his 
             head, his bloody smile full with teeth.  His skin is gray, and 
             peeling.  The knight turns slowly and sees him.

                                       KNIGHT
                            Oh, my god...

             The vampire licks his lips.

             He is on the knight in a second, pushing him backwards into 
             the middle of the small room.  The knight struggles but is no 
             match for the vampire, who buries his face in the knight's 
             neck.  The knight screams.

             ANGLE ON DOOR

             It suddenly flies open, the lock shattered.

             The vampire turns like a frightened animal.  In the doorway 
             stands the barmaid, a SLAYER.  In her hand is a wooden stake.

             The vampire drops the knight, who crabs backwards into a corner.  
             The Slayer and the vampire come at each other.  The Slayer 
             spins and kicks; the vampire flies back.  Snarling, he comes 
             back at the slayer.  They struggle; he slips free and is out 
             the door.

             For a moment, the Slayer remains still, crouched on the floor.  
             The knight watches her.  She seems to be making a decision -- 
             perhaps even knows what is going to happen.

             She runs at the window.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             EXT. IN FRONT OF THE INN - SAME TIME

             The vampire comes running out the front door.  Before he is a 
             few feet from the front of the inn, the Slayer SMASHES through 
             the upstairs window and lands on him.  They both hit the ground, 
             and she plants the stake right in his heart.

             After a moment, we hear a voice:

                                       AMILYN (O.S.)
                            The lord giveth, and the lord taketh 
                            away.  Ashes, ashes...

             She looks up.

                                       AMILYN
                                (continuing)
                            ... All fall down

             There are ten or more vampires walking slowly toward her in 
             the otherwise deserted street.  At the front, maybe ten feet 
             away, is AMILYN.

             Amilyn is a grinning jackal, a servant to the Vampire-King.  
             His garb is a rotted approximation of a courtier's livery.  He 
             ambles toward the Slayer, giggling, as she stands.

             Behind her is LOTHOS, the Vampire-King.  His skin is deep white, 
             and smooth.  He wears a long coat -- his dress is not of any 
             era.  He is practically upon her before he speaks.

                                       LOTHOS
                            You must forgive Amilyn.  He tends 
                            to drool before supper.

             She turns.  He smiles, almost lovingly.

                                       SLAYER
                            Lothos...

                                       LOTHOS
                            You people will never learn.

             She swings at him but he grabs her arm.  Amilyn laughs 
             obnoxiously.  Lothos grabs the back of the Slayer's head, brings 
             her to him in a loving embrace.

                                       LOTHOS
                                (continuing)
                            We can't be stopped.  This is our 
                            world now.

             He pulls her head back swiftly, snapping her spine as her head 
             hits the back of her legs.  Lightning flashes.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. ENGLISH CASTLE - NIGHT

             Lightning flashes outside the window.  It is torrenting rain.  
             An old MAN speaks to a hysterical GIRL of sixteen or so.  They 
             are both obviously noble of birth.

                                       GIRL
                            I can't!

                                       MAN
                            You know you must.  There is only 
                            one.  Now you are that one.  It is 
                            time.

                                       GIRL
                            Why?  Why me?

                                       MAN
                            She has died.  You are the next to 
                            be called.  Why do you think you 
                            were sent to me?  Trained as you 
                            were?  You bear the mark.

             He pulls aside her blouse to reveal a birthmark on her shoulder, 
             identical to the barmaid's.

                                       MAN
                                (continuing)
                            The mark of the Coven.

                                       GIRL
                            I don't understand.

                                       MAN
                            Ever since Adam and Eve first left 
                            the garden, he followed: the serpent.  
                            Satan.  He sends his legion in the 
                            shape of men, to feed on us, to 
                            breed his Hell on our earth.  They 
                            are a plague upon us.

             The man unravels a satchel of cloth.  From it he pulls an 
             elaborately carved wooden stake.

                                       MAN
                                (continuing)
                            But as long as there have been 
                            vampire, there has been the Coven; 
                            the line of Slayers.  Ones with the 
                            strength and the skill to kill them, 
                            to find them where they gather and 
                            stop the swell of their numbers.  
                            One dies, the next is called.

                                       GIRL
                            I'm just a girl.

                                       MAN
                            You are much more.

             He hands her the stake.  She feels the fit.

                                       MAN
                                (continuing)
                            One dies, the next is called...

             As she grips the stake more tightly, an awareness and sense of 
             power sees to fill her.  She lifts the stake over her head.

             CLOSEUP - A HAND

             The hand is lifted high, but it is not the girl's.  It holds 
             not a stake, but a pom-pom.

             EXT. HEMERY HIGH FOOTBALL FIELD - WIDER SHOT - DAY

             Opening CREDITS OVER:

             A football game in progress.  The stands are pretty full, the 
             crowd enthusiastic.  The hemery football stadium is just that; 
             a real stadium, not just makeshift stands on grass.

             On  the sidelines are the Hemery cheerleaders, led by BUFFY. 
             She is blonde (in nature as in name), pretty, and very 
             gracefully athletic.  She obviously enjoys what she is doing, 
             and she's good at it.

             With her on the squad are JENNIFER and NICOLE, two of her best 
             friends.  Beside them the COACH, yelling at the players.  The 
             scoreboard reads HEMERY VS. SETON.

             On the field are JEFFREY, wide receiver (and Buffy's boyfriend), 
             ANDY, quarterback, and GRUELLER, the huge left tackle.

             Buffy and the crowd wince as Andy is sacked for a nine-yard 
             loss.

                                       COACH
                            Come on, do the play!  The one 
                            where...  the one from the book!  
                            Where you make it go forward!

             The players huddle.

                                       ANDY
                            All right, guys, come on!

             He hits Grueller's helmet.

                                       ANDY
                                (continuing)
                            Grueller!  Fill that hole!  They 
                            were all over me!  Okay.  Let's run 
                            twenty-two.  Grueller, close the 
                            pocket, watch out for thirty-five.  
                            Thompson, run the post, right, wide 
                            out.  Jeffrey, go up the middle and 
                            run around like a chicken.

             They clap and break.  As they line up, Jeffrey looks over at 
             Buffy.  She smiles at him.  He winks, very suave.

                                       BUFFY AND CHEERLEADERS
                            Jeffrey!  Jeffrey! 
                            He's our man!  
                            If he can't do it 
                            We don't want it!

             On the hike, Andy drops back and looks for a receiver.  Jeffrey 
             runs in circles like an idiot (and not unlike a chicken), waving 
             his arms until Andy sails him the ball and he breaks for a 
             touchdown.

             The crowd goes wild -- particularly Buffy, who does an 
             impressive standing backflip.  Nicole looks at her, impressed.  
             Buffy smiles at her, giddy.

                                       COACH
                                (looking around)
                            Is that good?  Was that a good thing?

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. THE MALL - AFTERNOON

             The mall is typically busy.  Buffy, Nicole, Jennifer and 
             KIMBERLY can bee seen making their way through it.  They are 
             all dressed very similarly:  bright colors, a lot of white and 
             pink.  Not trashy, but mainstream and uninspired.  Esprit.  
             All of them carry shopping bags; they've done a good days work.

             TITLE:  CALIFORNIA. THE LITE AGES

             The girls pass by stores, vaguely window shopping.

                                       BUFFY
                            Mr. Howard is so heinous.  He's 
                            always giving me a hard time.  I 
                            get a C-plus on the test and he 
                            tells me, 'You have no sense of 
                            history.'  I have no sense of 
                            history?  He wears a brown tie.

                                       NICOLE
                            You got a C-plus?  I can't believe 
                            I cheated off you.

                                       BUFFY
                            Excuse me for not knowing about El 
                            Salvador.  Like I'm ever going to 
                            Spain anyway.  Ooh!

             A dress on a rack outside a store has caught her eye.  She 
             takes it and holds it in front of her.

                                       BUFFY
                                (continuing)
                            Mmmm.  Wouldn't I look just edible 
                            and nutritious in this?

             Kimberly and Jennifer catch up to them.

                                       KIMBERLY
                            Guys, what's the sitch?  I'm bored.

                                       BUFFY
                                (modeling the dress for 
                                Kimberly))
                            What do you think?

                                       KIMBERLY
                            Please.  It's so '91.

                                       GIRL
                            Oh.

             Buffy puts it back.

                                       KIMBERLY
                            What are we doing?

                                       BUFFY
                            Why don't we see a movie?

                                       KIMBERLY
                            Well, where?

                            thinking Pavilion.  Sitch?

                                       BUFFY
                            Sounds toasty.  We're going Pavilion.

                                       JENNIFER
                            Excellent.

                                       BUFFY
                            What's playing there?

             A stranger, walking the other way, bumps into Buffy, doesn't 
             stop.  A man of about fifty, he is dressed shabbily, in a 
             wrinkled black suit and a black shirt.  He somewhat resembles 
             a priest.

                                       BUFFY
                                (continuing)
                            Excuse much!  Not rude or anything.

                                       KIMBERLY
                                (calling back)
                            Nice ensemble!

                                       NICOLE
                            What a homeless.

             The girls continue walking.  The man stops, turns to stare 
             after them.  His look is intense, slightly worried, his face 
             somewhat haggard.  Intelligence shines through his eyes.  He 
             holds himself stiffly, arms close to him, almost as if he 
             expected something to strike at him.

             This is MERRICK.  He pulls a picture out of his coat pocket, 
             looks at it.  Looks at them.

             INT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY

             The film is in progress.  This has no effect on the girls, 
             however, as they continue to talk ceaselessly.  They all have 
             diet sodas.

                                       NICOLE
                                (to Buffy)
                            So, is Jeffrey really spending the 
                            night at your house?

                                       BUFFY
                            That's the plan.

                                       NICOLE
                            Good enough!

                                       JENNIFER
                            Your parents are always going away 
                            for the weekend.  You're so lucky.

                                       BUFFY
                                (maybe not)
                            Yeah, I guess.

                                       JENNIFER
                            My mom doesn't go anywhere.  She 
                            even does the shopping network.  
                            I'm gonna die a virgin.

                                       KIMBERLY
                            What did Jeffrey's dad say?

                                       BUFFY
                            'Just remember you're in training, 
                            son'

                                       NICOLE
                            Oh, God.

                                       KIMBERLY
                            He is so bald.

             Seated a few rows behind the girls are PIKE and BENNY.  The 
             are fairly punked out, (and not currently attending high 
             school).  Pike is long and lean, has short hair spiked and a 
             taste for long coats and black.  Benny is somewhat stockier, 
             opts for a shaved head and suspenders.  Doc Martins for both.  
             Benny is clearly the more belligerent of the two -- when Pike 
             speaks, it's with surprising wit and reserve.  Sometimes.

                                       PIKE
                            Will you guys shut up, please?

                                       BUFFY
                            It could happen.

             Pike and Benny throw popcorn at her.

                                       PIKE
                            Booo!

                                       BENNY
                            Suck!

                                       PIKE
                            Wrong answer!  No prize.

                                       NICOLE
                            God!  Take a chill lozenge.

                                       KIMBERLY
                            Like we don't have rights too?

                                       BUFFY
                            Ignore them.

                                       BENNY
                            I can't believe these people.  We 
                            paid money to see this.

                                       PIKE
                            No, we didn't.

                                       BENNY
                            Oh, yeah.  But I still want to know 
                            what happens.

                                       BUFFY
                            Everyone get horribly killed except 
                            the blonde girl in the nightie, who 
                            finally kills the monster with a 
                            machete but it's not really dead.

             The boys stare at her.

                                       JENNIFER
                            Oh, my God.  Is that true?

                                       BUFFY
                            Probably.  What movie is this?

                                                                    CUT TO:

             ANGLE - THE MOON

             Fat and yellow, behind the clouds.  We hear a long HOWL.

             EXT. THE MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT

             Jeffrey pulls into the parking lot in his BMW convertible.  
             Grueller, howling, sits in the back behind Jeffrey and Andy.  
             They park and hop out, head toward the entrance.

                                       GRUELLER
                            Look at that moon!  It's huge!  
                            Come on, guys, we gotta do something 
                            tonight.  Party.

                                       ANDY
                            You know, if you would spend more 
                            time at home sleeping, you would 
                            spend less time on the field, 
                            sucking.

                                       JEFFREY
                            You were a bone out there today.  
                            Anyway, I'm booked.  Gonna spend 
                            some quality time with the little 
                            woman.

                                       ANDY AND GRUELLER
                                (coughing it into their 
                                hands)
                            Pussy-whipped.  Pussy-whipped.

                                       JEFFREY
                            You guys are pathetic.

                                       GRUELLER
                            Later for you, then.  I'm blowing.  
                            Andy, you coming?

                                       ANDY
                            No, I'll hitch a ride with Jeffrey.

                                       GRUELLER
                            Okay.  Later.

                                       ANDY
                            Headbutt!

             Andy and Grueller bring their foreheads together with 
             painstaking slowness, grimacing, and barely tap heads.

                                       ANDY
                                (continuing)
                            Later.

             Grueller walks off, head through a park.

             At the same time, Pike and Benny emerge from the theater.  
             They pass Andy and Jeffrey and the two pairs circle each other, 
             almost growling, eyes locked, before pike and Benny turn and 
             walk off, not quite in the direction Grueller took.  Buffy, 
             Kimberly, Jennifer and Nicole come out right after.  Buffy 
             heads straight for Jeffrey and they kiss massively.

                                       BUFFY
                            Nice game.

                                       ANDY
                            Jeffrey, I don't mean to sound sexist 
                            or anything, but can I borrow her?

                                       BUFFY
                            Andy!

                                       JEFFREY
                            No way.  You'd get her dirty.
                                (off her look)
                            He would, honey.  He's an animal.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             EXT. THE PARK - SAME TIME

             Grueller walks through the trees, enters an enclosed clearing 
             of grass.  He hears something, stops.  Maybe his name, maybe 
             just the BUSHES RUSTLING.  He looks about him, hesitantly.  
             Starts forward, stops again.

                                       GRUELLER
                            Yo!  Who is that?  Don't mess with 
                            me man, I'll rip your head off.

             Nothing.

                                       GRUELLER
                                (continuing)
                            Come on, come out here.  Let's see 
                            what you got.

             RUSTLING.  No one.

                                       GRUELLER
                                (continuing)
                            Forget this.

             He turns on his heel, ready to drop all show and bolt.  WALLY 
             BESSEL is right behind him.

             Wally is a ninth grader, small, nerdy, and recently undead.  
             In marked contrast to the older vampire in the prologue, Wally 
             is freshly undead.  He still has fat on his face; in fact, he 
             looks almost normal from afar.  But his inhuman eyes and his 
             uncommon pallor mark him as a vampire.  And the way he speaks 
             is unearthly.  Hollow, almost detached; repeating phrases 
             sometimes almost as though he had never heard them before.

             He smiles at Grueller.

                                       GRUELLER
                                (continuing)
                            Bessel!  What are you doing here?

                                       WALLY
                            Hi, Grueller.

                                       GRUELLER
                            What are you grinning at?  You think 
                            I was scared?

                                       WALLY
                            Could be.

                                       GRUELLER
                            You think so?

                                       WALLY
                            Could be.

             Grueller grabs Wally by his shirt collar and readily hoists 
             his small body up, Wally's feet dangling two feet off the 
             ground.

                                       GRUELLER
                            Listen, you little worm.  I could 
                            beat your head to a pulp for you, 
                            just like I did last year, you got 
                            that?  You got that?

                                       WALLY
                                (repeating)
                            Got that.

                                       GRUELLER
                            Good.

             He lets Wally go.  Wally remains two feet in the air.  
             Grueller's eyes go wide.

                                       GRUELLER
                                (continuing)
                            What the...

             Wally smiles even more broadly, quietly hissing.  He has long 
             fangs, made somehow more grotesque by the fact that he also 
             has braces.

             Wally's hands vise onto Grueller's head, lightning quick.  
             Grueller screams.

             ANGLE - PIKE AND BENNY

             Crossing a street, turning and listening.

             ANGLE - JEFFREY'S CAR

             Speeding by, everyone packed into it.  Andy howls back at 
             Grueller, mistaking his intent.  He settles back.  The girls 
             are looking at him.

                                       ANDY
                            It's um... you had to be there.

             In the front seat next to Jeffrey, Buffy winces slightly.

                                       JEFFREY
                            You okay?

                                       BUFFY
                            I... yeah, I'm okay.  I'm fine.

             INT. BUFFY'S LIVING ROOM - ANGLE ON TV - NIGHT

             We see another full moon, this one on the TV screen.  "Dracula" 
             is on, Lugosi's original.

             The lights are off in the living room as Jeffrey enters from 
             the kitchen, sits down on the couch holding a bag of munchies.  
             Buffy is still in the kitchen, making corn.  Jeffrey flicks 
             the remote, changes channels.

             ANGLE - THE TV

             The movie is replaced by the local news, in mid-broadcast.  A 
             NEWSCASTER sits at his deck, a super of a teenage girl behind 
             him.

                                       NEWSCASTER
                            -- The fourth such disappearance in 
                            less than two months.  The sheriff 
                            was not available for comment, but 
                            a police spokesman issued a 
                            statement, saying that the situation 
                            is not out of hand...

             INT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME

             Buffy's FATHER walks purposefully into the kitchen holding a 
             suitcase that he plops by the front door.  He crosses out again 
             as Buffy's MOM crosses in, also with luggage.

                                       BUFFY'S DAD
                            We're gonna be late.  I knew it.

                                       BUFFY'S MOM
                                (to Buffy, but not looking 
                                at her)
                            Now, we'll be back on Sunday,

                            dishwasher.

             She's already out again by the end of this, as dad comes back 
             in.

                                       BUFFY'S DAD

                            Jag.

                            I know.

             And he's out the back, mom entering on his heels.

                                       BUFFY'S MOM
                            Well, that's everything.  Kiss noise.

             She actually makes a kiss noise at her daughter.

                                       BUFFY
                            'Bye.

             Buffy's mom heads out the door as Buffy heads into the living 
             room.

                            name's Bobby.

                                       BUFFY
                            Something like that.

                                       JEFFREY
                            Hey, it works for me.  If they want 
                            to leave you alone in the house, 
                            all helpless and vulnerable...

             Buffy sits, squints disapprovingly at the screen.  She has a 
             bag of microwave lite popcorn and is spraying diet butter 
             substitute on it.

                                       BUFFY
                            What show is this?

                                       JEFFREY
                            It's the news, Buffy.

                                       BUFFY
                            Oh.  Who's in it?
                                (off his look)
                            I know what it is.  It's what's on 
                            instead of the movie.

                                       JEFFREY
                            I just want to see the basketball 
                            scores.  It's important.

                                       BUFFY
                                (over a handful of popcorn)
                            Mmmnkay.

             Jeffrey leans in toward her.

                                       JEFFREY
                            Of course, there are... other 
                            considerations...

             He starts kissing her about the face and neck.  She leans 
             submissively back on the couch as he works his way on top of 
             her.  He gives her a long kiss on the mouth, then works over 
             to her ear.  As he is burrowing about in there, Buffy sneaks 
             another handful of popcorn into her mouth.

             She leans back, by accident, on the remote.

             "Dracula" reappears.

             INT. 18TH CENTURY CHINESE WHOREHOUSE - NIGHT

             Not, by any stretch, an upscale joint.  Dark, cramped, and 
             scummy.  A young Chinese Whore sits on a bed, wearing little 
             enough that we can see the telltale birthmark on her shoulder.  
             A repulsive British SAILOR is dressing, his business finished.  
             Looking disgusted, he throws his payment on the bed.  For some 
             reason, the bed is littered with popcorn.

                                       SAILOR
                            You never touched my heart.

             He leaves.  Alone, the Girl hears a NOISE in the dark corner, 
             a wet RUSTLING.  Slowly she gets up to see.  Approaches...

             It is a pool of blood.  She stares at it, terrified.  A hand 
             reaches out of it.

             She runs out into the hall, but it leads nowhere but a dead 
             end.  Standing there, waiting for her, is Lothos.  He smiles 
             at her and we see she is now Buffy.

                                       LOTHOS
                            Soon.

             Buffy is thrashing in bed.  Jeffrey is holding her by the 
             shoulders and shaking her.

                                       JEFFREY

                            Wake up!

             She wakes, grasping, her eyes melting into focus on Jeffrey's 
             face.

                                       BUFFY
                            Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.

                            You were having a nightmare.

             He settles back down, his arms around her, and almost instantly 
             begins to fall asleep again.

                                       JEFFREY

                            Nothing.  It was just a dream.

             INT. LOTHOS' CHAMBER - SAME TIME

             Dark, cavernous -- walls hewn from rock, lit torches clamped 
             to them.  Cold stone floor and in the foreground, a dark pool 
             of blood.  A HUM, possibly a chant, fills the air.

             A figure steps up to the pool, his back to the CAMERA, and 
             kneels before it.  He holds his hand over the surface of the 
             blood.  As he speaks, his voice an urgent hiss, we TRACK AROUND 
             him, see that it is Amilyn.

                                       AMILYN
                            You have brought us here, and we

                            in a new world.  Just as I promised, 
                            untold splendor, rubies dripping 
                            from our lips.  Just as we said.

             CLOSEUP - AMILYN'S HAND

             A hand shoots out of the pool and grabs Amilyn's.  Amilyn leans 
             over and fervently kisses it.

             Buffy sits with Nicole, Jennifer, Kimberly and CASSANDRA.  
             Cassandra is not quite in the same league as the other girls -- 
             for one thing, she studies.  She's not as glamorous, nor a 
             vacuous.

                                       ANDY
                            I like it.  Can I be your friend?

                                       JEFFREY
                            Stay away from my thang.
                                (to Buffy)
                            Sorry, honey.  'Thing.'

                                       NICOLE
                            Environment.  That's cool with me.

                                       KIMBERLY
                            Okay.

                                       CASSANDRA
                            So, what are the most immediate 
                            threats to the world environment 
                            right now?

             Cassandra has paper and pen, is poised to make a list of 
             suggestions.  The other all look at each other uncomfortably.  
             Cassandra obviously knows the answer, but regards her friends 
             silently, waiting to see what the come up with.

                                       JEFFREY
                            Well, um... litter?

                                       ANDY
                            Litter, yeah!

             Everyone but Cassandra is impressed by this.

                                       JEFFREY
                                (to Cassandra)
                            Write that down.

                                       JENNIFER
                            Okay, what else?

                                       NICOLE
                            Forest fires?

                                       ANDY
                            Communism?

                                       BUFFY
                            Bugs.

                                       CASSANDRA
                                (helpfully)
                            Okay, guys, how about the ozone 
                            layer?

                                       KIMBERLY
                            Oh, yeah!

                                       NICOLE
                            Right!

                                       BUFFY
                            We gotta get rid of that!  That's 
                            right.

             GARY MURRAY, a well meaning but pompous little administrator, 
             come up to the kids.  He's kind of like Charlie Brown:  you 
             always say his whole name.

                                       GARY MURRAY
                            I don't suppose you kids heard the 
                            first bell, did you?  The first 
                            bell was saying, 'Start going to 
                            class, it's time to go to class.'  
                            In about thirty seconds the second 
                            bell is going to be saying, 'Already 
                            be in class.'

                                       JEFFREY
                            We're having a very important 
                            discussion here.

                                       GARY MURRAY
                            Why do I have trouble believing 
                            you?

                                       JEFFREY
                            Something from your childhood, maybe?

                                       GARY MURRAY
                            Button it, Kramer.  Classes are 
                            starting.  Be there or beware.

             Gary Murray walks off.

                                       ANDY
                            Man has a complex.

                                       BUFFY
                            He's got a...  What do you call it?  
                            A Napoleonic Code.

                                       JENNIFER
                            It's 'cause he's so tiny.

                                       ANDY
                            Yes, but what he lacks in height he 
                            makes up in shortness.

             They get up and start heading to class.

                                       KIMBERLY
                            Let's meet tonight, okay?

                                       BUFFY
                            Where?

                                       KIMBERLY
                            Cafe Blase.

                                       NICOLE
                            Cool.  We can figure decorations 
                            and stuff.

                                       BUFFY
                            Cassandra, you gotta come, too.

                                       CASSANDRA
                            Can't.  History report.  The Normans 
                            and the Saxons.

                                       BUFFY
                            Bogutude.  Blow it off.

                                       CASSANDRA
                            I really can't.  Besides, it's pretty 
                            interesting.

                                       BUFFY
                                (not harshly)
                            You're weird and I'm afraid of you.  
                            Seriously, Cassandra, there's a lot 
                            cooler things you could be doing 
                            than your homework.

                                       CASSANDRA
                            Like what?

                                       BUFFY
                            Like my homework.

             Buffy smiles, trots off.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             EXT. THE CITY - NIGHT

             We see SHOTS of the deserted city at night.  It's a small, 
             upscale town.  Suburban streets, businesses, and a  few more 
             depressed areas, boarded up houses.  No one is out.  TREES 
             RUSTLE, shadows flicker, but the curling mist is the only 
             visible presence.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. CAFE BLASE - NIGHT

             A classic faux-Fifties L.A. diner.  Pictures of Frankie and 
             Annette, bright lights, those same tired Fifties standards 
             playing on the JUKEBOX.  Buffy, Kimberly, Jennifer and Nicole 
             are sitting at the end of the counter, at the corner.

                                       KIMBERLY
                            I don't see why we have to invite 
                            everyone.

                                       BUFFY
                            Kimberly, it's the senior dance.

                                       NICOLE
                            If we don't invite all the seniors 
                            we can't use the school funds, you 
                            know that.

                                       KIMBERLY
                            Can't they make exceptions?  Maryanne 
                            Heinel?  She's such a scud.  Can't 
                            we have a Maryanne clause?

                                       NICOLE
                            Well, look who's here.

             GIRLS' POV

             Pike and Benny have entered the diner, quite drunk.  As they 
             pass the jukebox, Benny gives it a kick and the music stops.  
             A few people look up, annoyed, as they approach the counter.

                                       WAITRESS
                            Hey!

                                       BENNY
                            The Fifties are over.

                                       PIKE
                                (earnestly)
                            We have to learn to let go.

                                       WAITRESS
                            Don't give me any trouble, okay?

                                       PIKE
                            No trouble.  We just want to eat.

             They sit next to Buffy and begin pooling their money on the 
             counter.  It comes to about $2.50, heavy with pennies.

                                       PIKE
                                (continuing)
                            Come on, come on, fork up the scub.

                                       BENNY
                            That's it, man.  That's the whole 
                            story.

                                       PIKE
                            We're looking at a dog, possible 
                            coffee...

             He digs and produces a quarter from his pocket.

                                       PIKE
                                (continuing)
                            It's coffee.

                                       BENNY
                            Amazing!

                                       KIMBERLY
                                (to the other girls)
                            Smell of booze much.

                                       NICOLE
                            Nice much.

                                       PIKE
                                (to the waitress)
                            Can we have a hot dog, please, medium 
                            rare, and a cup of joe?

                                       BUFFY
                            You guys are thrashed.

                                       JENNIFER
                                (to Buffy)
                            What are you talking to them for?

                                       BENNY
                                (to Buffy)
                            What did you say?

                                       PIKE
                            Yeah, we're drunk.  We're the Drunks.  
                            What's your name?

                                       BUFFY
                            Buffy.

                                       BENNY
                            Figures.

                                       PIKE
                            Do people ever call you 'Buffy the 
                            Buffalo?'  I'm just wondering.

             Buffy gives him a look.

                                       PIKE
                                (continuing)
                            The don't.  You kind of wish they 
                            would, though.

                                       KIMBERLY

                                       PIKE
                            I'm sorry.  I'm Pike.  This is Benny.

                                       KIMBERLY
                            Pike isn't a name.  It's a fish.

                                       PIKE
                            Hey, wait a minute...

                                       BENNY
                            You're the guys from the movie!

                                       PIKE
                                (good naturedly)
                            We hate you guys!

             The girls all make sad noises, real sarcastic.

                                       PIKE
                                (continuing)
                            You guys were way rude.  It was 
                            shocking.

                                       NICOLE
                            You just snuck in anyway.

                                       PIKE
                            So you have to ruin the movie for 
                            us?  You know, other people have 
                            feelings, too.

                                       KIMBERLY
                            I am so sure.

             The waitress brings the hot do.  Benny takes it out of the bun 
             and holds it over his crotch, phallus-like.

                                       BENNY
                            Hey, Buffy, you hungry?  I got 
                            something for you...

             The other girls look down and shriek.  Buffy looks at Benny, 
             looks at him in the eye.

             ANGLE - BUFFY'S HAND

             It closes silently around the knife at her place.

             Buffy is still looking at Benny, she seems to be hypnotizing 
             him, and maybe even herself.  The NOISE in the diner seems to 
             FADE AWAY for a moment.  Buffy shifts slightly, almost a twitch, 
             and the spell is broken.  The SOUND RETURNS, Buffy looks away, 
             letting go of the knife exactly where it was.

             Benny looks down.  His hot dog has been sliced neatly down to 
             about an inch.  He is shocked.

                                       BENNY
                                (continuing)
                            Hey!  She wasted my dog!

                                       PIKE
                                (smiling)
                            Bummer metaphor.

             Buffy looks off, a little surprised herself.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             EXT. STREET - NIGHT

             Pike and Benny have left the diner and are walking down the 
             street.  Pike produces a bottle of Mezcal from his coat pocket 
             and takes a swig, hand it to Benny.  They continue to pass it 
             back and forth.

                                       BENNY
                            Rich bitches.  They're a plague.  
                            They've gotta be stopped.

                                       PIKE
                            You didn't like them.

                                       BENNY
                            They're all the same!  They're so 
                            stuck up, they're just... they're 
                            not even human.  I hate them.

                                       PIKE
                            Would you sleep with them?

                                       BENNY
                            Yes.  Definitely.  Definitely.  
                            Please, God.

                                       PIKE
                            Well, there it is, isn't it?  You 
                            don't even like them, and you'd 
                            sleep with them.  What's that all 
                            about?

                                       BENNY
                            I got a news flash, man, another 
                            shot of this and I'll have sex with 
                            you.

                                       PIKE
                            Oh, yeah, and then you'll never 
                            call me.

             They continue walking.  A shadowy figure appears behind them, 
             following.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. DINER - NIGHT

             The girls have all finished their sundaes.

                                       NICOLE
                            Come one, that was so weird.

                                       BUFFY
                                (uncomfortable)
                            What, it's not weird.  I just cut 
                            the stupid hot dog in half.

                                       KIMBERLY
                            I can't believe they still ate it.

                                       JENNIFER
                                (to Buffy)
                            Where'd you learn how to do that?

                                       BUFFY
                            I didn't learn... I just... it's 
                            not a big deal.

                                       KIMBERLY
                            Buffy, I'm gonna tell Jeffrey you 
                            were playing with another man's 
                            Hebrew National.

                                       BUFFY
                                (annoyed)
                            Get a boob job.

                                       NICOLE
                            It's like when we took gymnastics 
                            in eighth grade.

             Buffy makes a face.  She doesn't want to hear this story.  We 
             HOLD on her as Nicole tells it.

                                       JENNIFER
                            What happened?

                                       NICOLE
                            Buffy was on the uneven parallels -- 
                            she was really good; coach said she 
                            could have been in the Olympics -- 
                            but she was doing a routine, 
                            spinning, and the beam broke.

                                       JENNIFER
                            You're kidding.

                                       NICOLE
                            Snapped.  Buffy was, you know, on 
                            the upswing, and I swear to God she 
                            went across the room.  Perm over 
                            heels.

                                       JENNIFER
                            Oh, my God!  Ouch!  No wonder you 
                            quit.

                                       NICOLE
                            Well, that's the thing.  She landed 
                            on her feet.  Didn't even sprain a 
                            toe.  And I go up to her and she 
                            turns and looks at me and she's 
                            like this --

             She makes a hyper-intense face.  The others laugh.

                                       NICOLE
                                (continuing)
                            -- like she's gonna kill me.

                                       BUFFY
                            I was just scared is all.

                                       NICOLE
                            No.  It was mondo bizarro.

                                       KIMBERLY
                            Buffy, the ape-woman.

                                       NICOLE
                            Seriously, Buffy.  That look was 
                            way twisted.  What were you thinking 
                            about?

                                                                    CUT TO:

             EXT. STREET - NIGHT

             Perhaps in answer, we see the same shadowy figure moving behind 
             Pike and Benny as they continue to walk home.  They're really 
             bombed now.  They are somewhere in the hills now, and they 
             come to the edge of a steep incline overlooking the valley.  A 
             waist-high concrete wall is built into the side of the earth.  
             They stand below a thick, green tree.

                                       PIKE
                            I'll have it running in a week.  
                            It's be beauty.  It just needs new 
                            shocks, you know, break pads, an 
                            engine, and some wheels.  It'll be 
                            totally cherry.

             Pike finishes the bottle, eats the worm, and chucks the BOTTLE 
             over the side.  There is a moment before they hear it SHATTER.

                                       BENNY
                            When you get your car together, 
                            man, let's bail.

                                       PIKE
                            You think?  Split?

                                       BENNY
                            Utterly.  Let's bail this town.  
                            It's getting... I don't know.  Let's 
                            go somewhere where there aren't any 
                            rich bitches.

                                       PIKE
                            Our own world, where we could live 
                            and grow beans.  Hundreds of beans.

             Benny wavers, catches hold of Pike.

                                       BENNY
                            I think I'm gonna ralf.

             He leans over the side of the wall, hangs his head down.

                                       PIKE
                            Don't worry, Benny.  I'm here for 
                            you.

             Pike falls over backwards.

                                       PIKE
                                (continuing)
                            I'm here for you, Ralf.

             Pike passes out.

             CLOSEUP - BENNY

             Still waiting to throw up.  The figure approaches slowly from 
             behind him.  The figure is a few feet away from him when a 
             hand shoots down from above and grabs Benny's face.

             ANGLE - IN THE TREE

             Amilyn sits on a low branch, pulls Benny up to face him.  Amilyn 
             has changed his manner of dress drastically.  He wears a 
             motorcycle jacket and sunglasses.  His hair is punked out.  
             Benny is in shock, as Amilyn holds him easily by his shirt 
             collar.

                                       AMILYN
                            You wanna go for a ride?

             Amilyn leans back -- all the way back, falling back out of the 
             tree and pulling Benny with him.  We see them fall out past 
             the wall just as the shadowy figure reaches it.

             It is Merrick, the man from the mall.  He runs to the side of 
             the wall, looks over.  The two are already lost in the dark 
             mist.  Merrick turns around, looks about him.  He digs in his 
             pockets, pulls out a cross and a stake, holds them tightly.  
             While digging he pulls out an old, stained picture, lays it on 
             the railing.  Stake and cross in hand, he stands by Pike looking 
             out at the night.

             ANGLE - THE PICTURE

             It is a ten year old girl about to blow out the candles on her 
             birthday cake.  The cake reads, "Happy Birthday, Buffy".

                                                                    CUT TO:

             EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - AFTERNOON

             Buffy, Nicole and Jennifer and another cheerleader are 
             practicing.

                                       JENNIFER
                            What was the step after...  The one 
                            from Thursday.  I never learned it 
                            right, I don't think.

             Buffy shows her.  They do it together for a minute.

                                       BUFFY
                            That is so cool.

                                       NICOLE
                            Thank you very much.

                                       BUFFY
                            Nobody is even gonna look at the 
                            game.

                                       JENNIFER
                            Hey, I was thinking, for the dance, 
                            what about a big sign that says 
                            'Don't Tread On Me'.  You know, and 
                            a picture of the earth.

                                       BUFFY
                            Don't tread on the earth?

                                       NICOLE
                            I don't get it.

                                       BUFFY
                            How do you not tread on the earth?  
                            I mean, you kind of have to.

                                       JENNIFER
                            I never thought of that.

                                       NICOLE
                            I gotta bail.  You coming?

                                       BUFFY
                            You guys blow.  I'm waiting on 
                            Cassandra.  She's gonna help me 
                            with my history.

                                       NICOLE
                            Cassandra's really smart.

                                       BUFFY
                            Yeah... She's okay, though.

                                       NICOLE
                            I guess.

                                       JEFFREY
                            Are you going out with Jeffrey 
                            tonight?

                                       BUFFY
                            Jealous?

             Jennifer laughs, uncomfortably.

                                       BUFFY
                                (continuing)
                            Don't worry, Jennifer.  Someday 
                            your prince will come.

                                       NICOLE
                            Yeah, just make sure you do first.  
                            Let's go, guys.

                                       BUFFY
                            B'bye.

             The other girls leave.  Buffy is alone on the empty field.  
             She looks around her.  She starts doing a routine, tentatively.  
             Then she runs toward the middle of the field and jumps, flies 
             into an extraordinary series of gymnastic flips and cartwheels.  
             She rolls into one final flip, a huge one, and lands, a perfect 
             ten, about three inches from Merrick.

             She screams in surprise, steps back.

                                       BUFFY
                                (continuing)
                            God, where the hell did you come 
                            from?  You scared me to death.

                                       MERRICK
                            I'm sorry.  That was impressive.  
                            The...  tumbling.

             His accent is clipped -- British.

                                       BUFFY
                            What?  Oh.  I used to do gymnastics.  
                            Are you looking for someone?

                                       MERRICK
                            I'm looking for you, actually.

                                       BUFFY
                            Am I in trouble or something?

                                       MERRICK
                            Not at all.  My name is Merrick.  I 
                            was sent to find you some time ago.  
                            I should have found you much sooner 
                            but there were...  complications.  
                            You should have been taught, 
                            prepared.

                                       BUFFY
                            What are you talking about?

                                       MERRICK
                            I've searched the entire world for 
                            you, Buffy.

                                       BUFFY
                            Why?

                                       MERRICK
                            To bring you... your birthright.

                                       BUFFY
                            My birthright?  You mean, like a 
                            trust fund?

             Merrick looks at her.

                                       BUFFY
                                (continuing)
                            I had a trust fund my great-
                            grandfather, or maybe it was an 
                            inheritance, 'cause he's dead, and 
                            I spent it on shoes.

                                       MERRICK
                            You must come with me.  It's much 
                            too late already.  You must come 
                            with me to the graveyard.

                                       BUFFY
                            Wait a minute.  My birthright is in 
                            the graveyard?  Later not.

                                       MERRICK
                            Wait!

                                       BUFFY
                            You're one of those skanky old men 
                            that, like, attack girls and stuff.  
                            Forget you.  My, um, my boyfriend 
                            is gonna be here in about thirty 
                            seconds, and he's way testy.

                                       MERRICK
                            You don't understand.  You have 
                            been chosen.

                                       BUFFY
                            Chosen to go to the graveyard?  Why 
                            don't you just take the first runner 
                            up, okay?

                                       MERRICK
                            You must believe me.  You must come 
                            with me while there's still time.

                                       BUFFY
                            Time to do what?

                                       MERRICK
                            To stop the killing.  To stop the 
                            vampires.

                                       BUFFY
                            Let me get this straight.  You're 
                            like, this greasy bum, and I have 
                            to go to the graveyard with you 
                            'cause I'm chosen, and there's 
                            vampires.

                                       MERRICK
                            Yes.

                                       BUFFY
                            Does Elvis talk to you?  Tell you 
                            to do things?  Do you see spots?

                                       MERRICK
                            I don't have time for your prattling.  
                            I have proof.  You bear the mark.

             He steps forward and pulls the neck of Buffy's shirt aside, 
             revealing her shoulder.

                                       MERRICK
                                (continuing)
                            The mark of the Coven!  The -- 
                            where's the mark?

             There is no birthmark on her shoulder.  He looks at the other 
             one.

                                       MERRICK
                                (continuing)
                            The mark of the -- wait a minute.

             Buffy pushes his hand off her.

                                       BUFFY
                            You mean that big hairy mole?  Excuse 
                            me:  eeyuu.  I had it removed.  
                            And, like, knowing about my big old 
                            mole isn't proof of anything except 
                            that it's way past medication time.

             She starts to walk away.

                                       BUFFY
                                (continuing)
                            Just stay away from me, okay?

                                       MERRICK
                            Did you ever dream that you were 
                            someone else?

             Buffy stops.  This obviously registers with her.

                                       BUFFY
                            Everybody does.

                                       MERRICK
                            In the past.  A girl.  Maybe... A 
                            Magyar peasant.  An Indian princess.  
                            A slave.

             The last one hits the mark.

                                       BUFFY
                            I was a slave.

                                       MERRICK
                            In Virginia.

                                       BUFFY
                            I don't know.  It was...  There was 
                            a big gram or something.  And there's 
                            one, I'm like a prostitute...

                                       MERRICK
                            China.

                                       BUFFY
                            Oh, my God.  I never told anybody 
                            about this.  I remember the one 
                            about the peasant, too.  God, there's 
                            a bunch.  Is this, like channeling 
                            or something.

             Merrick rolls his eyes.

                                       BUFFY
                                (continuing)
                            I had a dream once where I was...  
                            There was like, knights in it, and 
                            I worked in this bar.  And I... was 
                            fighting.  I'm always fighting.  
                            And there's a guy...  He's not always 
                            there, but he's horrible, all white, 
                            and he's always... trying to kill 
                            me.

                                       MERRICK
                            Lothos.

             The name has an obvious effect on the girl.

                                       BUFFY
                            How do you know all this?

                                       MERRICK
                            I have to show you.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             ANGLE - THE SUN

             Thick and orange, sinking beyond the hills.

             EXT. GRAVEYARD - SUNSET

             Merrick leads Buffy, searching for a particular grave.

                                       BUFFY
                            I can't believe I'm doing this.  I 
                            can't believe I'm in a graveyard 
                            with a strange man hunting for 
                            vampires on a school night.

                                       MERRICK
                            Why didn't you ever tell anybody 
                            about your dreams?

                                       BUFFY
                            Oh, yeah, tell everyone I'm crazy.  
                            Beauty ida.

             Buffy stops, winces slightly.

                                       BUFFY
                                (continuing)
                            Ow.

                                       MERRICK
                            Cramps?

                                       BUFFY
                            None of your business.  God.

                                       MERRICK
                            This is it.

             Buffy is standing on a freshly dug grave.  The headstone reads: 
             "ROBERT BERMAN, 1972 - 1990.  GOD IS AT HIS HEELS".

                                       MERRICK
                                (continuing)
                            Robert Berman was killed three days 
                            ago.  The body was found in the 
                            bushes out by the canal.  Extensive 
                            tissue damage -- tearing -- at the 
                            neck and shoulders.  Coroner thinks 
                            it's a dog.  You sit her.

             He points out a plot of ground about eight feet from the foot 
             of the grave.  Buffy sits and leans against another stone.

             Merrick reaches into his jacket, pulls out a stake and a cross, 
             hands the cross to Buffy.

                                       BUFFY
                            Wait a minute.

                                       MERRICK
                            Just for protection.  You won't 
                            have to do anything.  I just need 
                            you to watch.

                                       BUFFY
                            All right.  What do we do now?

                                       MERRICK
                            We wait for Robert to wake up.

             Merrick goes over to the other headstone, crouches by it.

                                       BUFFY
                            Do you have any gum?

             ANGLE - SUNSET

             The last red glimmer disappears behind the hills.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             EXT. OUTSIDE THE SCHOOL - SAME TIME

             Cassandra stands waiting for Buffy.  The sun is down, darkness 
             increasing.  She looks at her watch and gives up, heads for 
             her car.  Her key in the door, she hears a RUSTLING behind 
             her.  Looks slowly around.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             EXT. GRAVEYARD - SAME TIME

             Buffy sits fidgeting.  Playing with her fingernails.  Merrick 
             stays in the position, listening.

             A low, almost inaudible MOAN come from under the ground.  Buffy 
             sits up straight, holds the cross to her.  The MOAN becomes 
             louder, almost a scream.  The SOUND is followed by the SOUND 
             of FINGERS SCRAPPING wood -- of WOOD SPLINTERING -- of digging.  
             The moaning continues, becoming eerier, somewhat more 
             articulate.

             Buffy and Merrick wait.

             ANGLE - THE GRAVE

             Finally, fingers break through the ground and hold stiff in 
             the open air.  The moan becomes a triumphant HISS.  The fingers 
             clutch at the ground.

             ROBERT BERMAN pops halfway out of his grave like a jack-in-the-
             box, his face dirty and dead-white.  He sees Buffy in front of 
             him, and he bobs toward her with a crazy grin, stretching as 
             to a mother's tit.

             Merrick drops down behind Robert and grabs him, raising the 
             stake.  Buffy watches, immobilized.

             A pair of arms shoot up from the ground right under Buffy.  
             They grab her and pull her to the ground.  Next to her face, 
             the face of another vampire, a YOUNG WOMAN, emerges grinning 
             from the crumbling earth.

             Buffy screams lustily, and struggles to break free.

             Merrick is momentarily distracted by this, and Robert throws 
             him off, and pulls himself out of the grave.  Merrick falls to 
             the ground, and his stake goes flying.

             Buffy pulls herself out of the girl's grasp, starts running 
             away, but the girl grabs her.  Buffy remembers the cross in 
             her hand, spins and holds it to the vampire's forehead.  It 
             burns and the lady lets go, screaming and falling to the ground.

                                       BUFFY
                            'Bye now.

             Buffy runs.

             ANGLE - MERRICK AND ROBERT

             They are struggling, several feet away.  Robert grabs Merrick 
             by the shoulders and picks him up, preparing to bite him.  A 
             stake suddenly pops out of his chest, planted in his back by 
             Buffy.  He falls and dies.

                                       MERRICK
                            Where's the other one?

                                       BUFFY
                            She --

             It leaps at her, screaming.  She throws it off, as Merrick 
             produces another stake and throws it to her.  Buffy sticks it 
             in the vampire's heart.  She dies, screaming, her face still 
             smoking, blood spurting onto Buffy.

             Buffy looks at herself.  At the blood.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             EXT. FRONT OF BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

             Merrick walks Buffy to the door.  She is silent, slow.

                                       MERRICK
                            Go to school tomorrow.  Try to act 
                            normal.  Don't let anyone know what's 
                            happening.  This is important.  
                            When the vampires find out who you 
                            are... you won't be hunting them 
                            anymore.

                                       BUFFY
                            All right.

             He hands her a piece of paper.

                                       MERRICK
                            Meet me at this address after school.

                                       BUFFY
                            I have cheerleading squad.

                                       MERRICK
                            Skip it.

             Buffy nods.  Merrick starts back down the path.

                                       BUFFY
                            Merrick.

             Merrick stops.

                                       BUFFY
                                (continuing)
                            They can't come in, right?  Unless 
                            you invite them.  Is that true?

                                       MERRICK
                            It's true.

             Merrick moves on.  Buffy goes inside.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. BUFFY'S HOUSE - FOYER - SAME TIME

             Buffy shuts the door, turns to go up to her room.  She is 
             startled by someone standing in her path.  She almost screams.

             It's her mother.  She stands, arm akimbo, looking very 
             confrontational.  Buffy looks a sight, and stands uncomfortably 
             in front of her mother for a moment.

                                       BUFFY'S MOM
                            Do you know what time it is?

                                       BUFFY
                            Uum... around ten?

             Mom taps her watch, annoyed.

                                       BUFFY'S MOM
                            I knew this thing was slow.

             She crosses out of the room.

                                       BUFFY'S MOM
                                (continuing)
                            You pay a fortune for something...
                                (calls out)
                            Honey, come on, we're gonna be late.

             Her mother gone, Buffy lets out a small sigh -- of relief or 
             frustration, it is not clear.  She heads upstairs.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. BUFFY'S HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT

             Buffy stands at the sink, washing her shirt.  She tries to get 
             the blood off with fierce intensity.  She is near tears.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. BUFFY'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

             She sits in the middle of the bed in her pajamas, the blankets 
             pooled around her.  She cannot sleep.  Finally, she lies back 
             on the pillow.

             Lothos is beside her.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. SCHOOL HALL - DAY

             Buffy walks through the hall slowly, obviously the worse for 
             last night's wear.  Gary Murray comes up next to her, looking 
             at his watch pointedly:  she's late for class.  He moves on.  
             Jeffrey, going the other way, stops next to her.

                                       JEFFREY
                            Hey, baby, how ya doing?  You look 
                            beat.

                                       BUFFY
                            I do?  I guess I do.

                                       JEFFREY
                            Where were you last night?  I called 
                            your house like four times.

                                       BUFFY
                            I went to sleep.  I think I have 
                            the flu or something.

             Jeffrey backs away from her.

                                       JEFFREY
                            I can't get sick.  You know -- 
                            training and all.  I'm gonna be 
                            late.

                                       BUFFY
                            'Bye.

             Jeffrey moves off to class.  Buffy walks on a bit.  She bumps 
             into Nicole.

                                       NICOLE
                            Hey, Buffers.  You look thrashed.

                                       BUFFY
                            Thanks.

                                       NICOLE
                            You and Cassandra get anything done 
                            last night?

             Buffy looks confused for a moment, then remembers.

                                       BUFFY
                            Oh.  No.  She never showed.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. LOTHOS' CAVE - CLOSEUP OF CASSANDRA'S FACE

             She is waking up, obviously from being knocked out.  She blinks 
             stupidly, looks around.  She is lying by a pool of what looks 
             to be dark water in a large cave.  Torches burn around her.

             She tries to get up and finds it difficult.  She pulls herself 
             up to the side of the pool and splashes water on her face.

             It's blood.

             She starts, staring with growing horror at her hands.  She 
             does not even see the figure rise from the pool at first.

             It's Lothos.  He wears no shirt, only white trousers and boots, 
             the style maybe Nineteenth Century.  No blood seems to touch 
             him as he rises.  He looks at Cassandra with an almost sleepy 
             lust.

                                       LOTHOS
                            I find it restorative, sleeping in 
                            the life-blood of so many.  To feel 
                            their souls coursing about me.

                                       CASSANDRA
                            What's happening?  What do you want?

                                       LOTHOS
                                (smiling)
                            So very much.

                                       CASSANDRA
                            My parents have money...

                                       LOTHOS
                            Yes, I'm sure they do.  This place 
                            is everything you said it was, 
                            Amilyn.

             Cassandra turns.  Amilyn stands behind her, grinning.  He 
             hisses, bares his fangs at Cassandra.

                                       CASSANDRA
                            What... are you?

                                       LOTHOS
                            Are we so strange?  So alien to 
                            you?  I've seen this culture, the 
                            wealth, the greed, the waste... 
                            it's truly heartwarming.  The perfect 
                            place to spread my empire.  Honestly, 
                            Eastern Europe was so dead, the 
                            Communists just drained the blood 
                            out of the place.  It's livened up 
                            a bit in the past few years, but 
                            it's nothing compared to this.... 
                            this Mecca of consumption.  The 
                            city of Angels.

             He steps right up to her.

                                       LOTHOS
                                (continuing)
                            What are we?  We are man, perfected.  
                            We exist to consume.

             On the world "to consume" we see Amilyn mouthing the words 
             with Lothos, his eyes to the ceiling.  He's heard this a hundred 
             times.

                                       AMILYN
                            So?  Do we change this one, or do 
                            we just drain her?

             Cassandra pulls her gold card out of her wallet.

                                       CASSANDRA
                            Here, look.  My gold card.  It's 
                            your.  I'll never report it.

             Amilyn snatches it from her, looks it over.

                                       LOTHOS
                            She has a certain quality, this 
                            one...

             Amilyn bites the card.

                                       AMILYN
                            I don't think this is gold.

                                       LOTHOS
                            Not as single-minded as the others, 
                            not as sybaritic.  Almost thoughtful.  
                            She's useless.

                                       CASSANDRA
                            No, wait.  I can be dumb.  Really.  
                            Or mean, or whatever.  I can learn.  
                            I'm useful.

                                       LOTHOS
                            Really?

                                       CASSANDRA
                            Swear to God.

             He rips out her throat, tearing at it with his teeth as blood 
             gushes around their faces and she wriggle, twists, dies.  He 
             hurls her into the door and wipes blood from his mouth.

                                       LOTHOS
                            I wish you wouldn't mention him...

             Slowly Cassandra slides down the wall, her eyes glazing over.  
             As she descends we see, stenciled on the wall, "Hemery High 
             School.  Maintenance Only."

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. WAREHOUSE - AFTERNOON

             Grey, dusty and long since abandoned.  Sunlight pours in through 
             the large windows, practically caked with dust.  Old crates 
             are stacked here and there, bits of manikins leaning on one or 
             two.  Merrick sits on a crate, reading the newspaper.

             Buffy enters hesitantly, puts down her bookbag next to a pile 
             of Merrick's stuff, including a rolled-up sleeping bag.  This 
             is definitely not her turf.  She runs her finger along a crate, 
             picks up a world of dust.  She holds up her finger at Merrick.

                                       BUFFY
                            Fire the help.  No kidding.

             Merrick looks up at her.

                                       MERRICK
                            It's not pretty, but it does suit 
                            our purposes.

                                       BUFFY
                            Our purposes.

             She repeats it not with attitude, but a dull wonder at her 
             connection with this strange man.  She crosses to him.

                                       BUFFY
                                (continuing)
                            What, um...  What do we do?

                                       MERRICK
                            There's a great deal I have to show 
                            you, I'm not even sure where to 
                            start  There's so little time.

                                       BUFFY
                            Why do you keep saying that?

                                       MERRICK
                            Do you know what a Vampire-King is?

                                       BUFFY
                            A Vampire-King?  You mean like 
                            Dracula?

                                       MERRICK
                            Oh, yes.  And the man from your 
                            dreams.  Lothos.

                                       BUFFY
                            Oh, him.

                                       MERRICK
                            Yes.  They travel about, usually 
                            with one or two of their followers 
                            to lay the groundwork.  The vampires 
                            find a community and they feed on 
                            it, make it their own.  You were 
                            difficult to trace, and I think the 
                            process has gone a lot further than 
                            I'd anticipated.  Usually this goads 
                            a community into some kind of 
                            paranoid frenzy.  But for some 
                            reason, nobody here seems to be 
                            paying any attention.

                                       BUFFY
                                (not paying attention)
                            What?

                                       MERRICK
                                (annoyed)
                            We'll cover it later.

                                       BUFFY
                            I still don't get how they happened 
                            to come to my town.  I mean, was I 
                            born here because... because they  
                            were coming here?  That Lothos guy, 
                            and his buddies?

                                       MERRICK
                            In a way, yes.  Your fate is 
                            inexorably connected to them.

                                       BUFFY
                            Great.  First I have a birthright, 
                            now I've got a fate.  Hey, do I 
                            have to take notes on this?

                                       MERRICK
                                (put down his paper)
                            We're going to have the work hard.  
                            You'll need some excuse for staying 
                            out.  For your parents.

             Buffy laughs.

                                       BUFFY
                            Not a pressing issue.

                                       MERRICK
                            I tell you, the best thing I can do 
                            right now is find out more about 
                            you.  What your strengths are, your 
                            likes...  Everything.  What's your 
                            best subject?

                                       BUFFY
                            Uh... gym.

                                       MERRICK
                            Yes, you used to do gymnastics.  
                            But you stopped.  Why?

                                       BUFFY
                            Well, everybody says... it's just 
                            kind of dorky.  I mean, have you 
                            ever seen a gymnast's legs?  They're 
                            like --
                                (indicating huge)
                            -- the mighty oak.  It's not a look.

                                       MERRICK
                            But you enjoyed it, yes?

                                       BUFFY
                            Well... I do cheerleading now.  
                            It's way cooler.

                                       MERRICK
                            Cheerleading.  For... sporting 
                            events, yes?

                                       BUFFY
                            Sporting events, yeah.

                                       MERRICK
                            All right.  Why don't you show me a 
                            cheer?

                                       BUFFY
                            Here?

                                       MERRICK
                            Yes, yes.  It would be interesting.  
                            A nice cheer.

                                       BUFFY
                            Okay.

             Buffy starts, a bit awkwardly, doing a cheer.

                                       BUFFY
                                (continuing)
                            Who we gonna beat?

                                       MERRICK
                                (pathetically following her 
                                motion)
                            Who we gonna beat?

                                       BUFFY
                                (stops)
                            No -- you don't have to --

                                       MERRICK
                            Oh.  I thought... you lead me --

                                       BUFFY
                            No.  You don't do anything.  I do 
                            it.

                                       MERRICK
                            Oh.  Good.

             She starts again.

                                       BUFFY
                            Who we gonna beat? 
                            Who do we defeat? 
                            Who will we be pulverizing 
                            Into cream of wheat?

             Gradually, Buffy gets more into the cheer.  The steps become 
             more complicated as she repeats the verse.

             CLOSEUP - MERRICK'S HAND

             We see a knife slip out of Merrick's sleeve.  He palms it, 
             hands behind his back.

             In the middle of her routine, he hurls it at her.  She catches 
             it, reflexively, inches from her face.  Stops dead.  Then bursts 
             into tears.  Merrick is thrown off by this reaction.

                                       BUFFY
                            Oh, what the hell is wrong with 
                            you?  You threw a knife at my head!

                                       MERRICK
                            I had to test you.

                                       BUFFY
                            But you threw a knife at my head!

                                       MERRICK
                            And you caught it!  Only the chosen 
                            one could have done that.

                                       BUFFY
                            I don't want to be the chosen one, 
                            okay?  I don't want to spend the 
                            rest of my life chasing after 
                            vampires!  I just want to graduate 
                            from high school, go to Europe, 
                            marry Charlie Sheen and die.  It 
                            may not sound too exciting to a 
                            sconehead like you, but I think 
                            it's swell.  And then you come 
                            along...  and... and then I'm a 
                            member of the hairy mole club, so 
                            you throw things at me!

             She is coming at him now.  He begins to back up.

                                       MERRICK
                            It was necessary.

                                       BUFFY
                                (realizing)
                            Last night.  You knew I was sitting 
                            on a fresh grave, didn't you?

                                       MERRICK
                            I don't think you understand the 
                            full implications of --

             Buffy punches him in the face.  He goes flying a good ways, 
             lands on his back.  His nose bleed merrily.  Buffy stops.

                                       BUFFY
                            Oh.  Sorry.

                                       MERRICK
                                (getting up)
                            Don't you see what's happening?  
                            You're changing.  You've got powers 
                            you've only just begun to tap.  
                            Physical, mental prowess you've 
                            never dreamed of.

                            God, this hurts.  I've administered 
                            a few shocks to your system to start 
                            the adrenaline working.  I'm sorry 
                            I have to take so many shortcuts in 
                            the training process.

                                       BUFFY
                            Put your head back.

                            Two days ago, would you have even 
                            hit me?  Let alone so powerfully?

                                       BUFFY
                            No... I guess I would have gotten 
                            Jeffrey to hit you.

                                       MERRICK
                            Exactly.  You're changing.  You're 
                            becoming something extraordinarily 
                            powerful.

             Buffy looks at the knife in her hand.  The MUSIC COMES UP and 
             we...

                                                                    CUT TO:

             Buffy's period of training.  Over the difficult course of it, 
             she is obviously becoming more self-possessed, more at ease.  
             Her style of dress loosens a bit:  a little punkier.  Stops 
             dying her hair blonde and her roots start showing.  Accumulates 
             a few more holes in her ears.

             Dead, and The Complete Garlic Cookbook.

             Merrick sits on a crate, reading the obituaries and circling 
             certain entries.

             Buffy stands on her head, sweating with concentration.  The 
             CAMERA TILTS up to reveal her feet.  Between the toes of one 
             is a nail brush, with which she is very carefully painting her 
             toenails.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             Amilyn and a few of the old-world vampires are on a spree,

             TRACKS behind the counter, where we find the clerk, bloody and 
             dead, slumped on the floor.

             starts off, comes back and plants a big ol' on his lips one 
             last time before splitting.

                                (as announcer)
                            Ooh, another embarrassment for the 
                            teabag, while the chosen one is 
                            still well under par.

                            Your turn.

             Buffy positions herself.

                                       BUFFY
                            What about bats?  Do they turn into 
                            bats?

                                       MERRICK
                            No.  No bats, no flying.  They... 
                            float, occasionally.  Not really 
                            flying.

                                       BUFFY
                            Toasty.  Were there ever any, like, 
                            famous vampires?

                                       MERRICK
                            Oh, several.  Lucretia Borgia, Joseph 
                            Mengele, Franklin Pangborn... are 
                            any of those names familiar?

                                       BUFFY
                            If I say 'no' does that make me a 
                            bad person?

                                       MERRICK
                            Good Lord.  What do you study in 
                            history?

                                       BUFFY
                            My nails.

             She gives a little 'isn't that funny' kind of laugh.  He doesn't 
             respond.

                                       MERRICK
                            All right.  You've heard of the 
                            emperor Caligula, perhaps?  Or Jack 
                            the Ripper?

                                       BUFFY
                            They were vampires?

                            Oh.

             She considers this a moment.  Tees off:  another hole in one.

             the look in her eye.

                            Yes, my child?  Is something 
                            troubling you?

                                       BUFFY
                            Well, sort of.

                            Well, maybe I can help.

                                       BUFFY

             We see the entire cave, the still pool of blood, the torches 
             lit.  At the far end sits Lothos.  In his arms is the body of 
             a dead girl.  Blood stains her neck and yet the image is poetic, 
             reminiscent of Michelangelo's "Pieta".  They are both perfectly 
             still, her draped across his lap, he with his eyes far far 
             away.  The silence holds.

             Lothos belches massively.

             Merrick is lecturing Buffy.  Buffy is sitting, doodling in an 
             open notebook, "uh-huh"ing and obviously not paying attention.

                                       MERRICK
                            ... Lothos was probably born in the 
                            eleventh or twelfth century; he's 
                            been difficult to trace.  His power 
                            has increased with age.  It will be 
                            a long while before you are ready 
                            to face him.  We'll be lucky if we 
                            can get him to leave the area, to 
                            lie low for awhile.  That will 
                            scatter the rest of them.  Lothos 
                            is...

             He looks at Buffy, who is staring down at her notebook.

                                       MERRICK

                            ... is extremely powerful, but he 
                            is still a vampire, and vulnerable 
                            to the same...

             He looks at her.  Is she listening?

                            Daylight is still his enemy.  The 
                            stake can still find his heart.

             Is she?

             Nope.  No reaction, just another "Uh-huh."

             Merrick slams a stake right through the middle of it.  Buffy 
             screams, jumps back a good two feet and lands on her butt.

             Silently, a leaf falls.  It wafts gently down.  Buffy hurls a 
             knife at it with easy precision.

             ANGLE - ANOTHER TREE

             The knife stick deep into the trunk, the leaf perfectly pinned.

             Merrick looks at it.  Buffy smiles, knowing she has hit the 
             target.  Blindfold still on, she turns toward Merrick and walks 
             into a branch, falls heavily backwards.

                            of!  I know where you're coming 
                            from.  Believe me.  I'll tell you 
                            the truth.  I've had my drug 
                            experiences, too.  I did a lot -- I 
                            did some acid in the Sixties.  Well, 
                            the late Seventies, actually.  It 
                            was at a Doobie Brother's concert.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. THE MALL - DAY

             Buffy at the mall with Kimberly, Nicole and Jennifer.  For the 
             first time, we really see how she stands out against her 
             friends.  She is wearing much more functional, cool garb, and 
             less makeup, while they still sport the same dainty shit from 
             the beginning.

             They stop to look at some dresses.  Something in the next store 
             catches Buffy's eye; she wanders off.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. GARY MURRAY'S OFFICE - SAME TIME

             Gary Murray is crouching on his desk.  Buffy still sits.  The 
             FLY still BUZZES.

             As Gary talks, Buffy picks up a push pin from the table beside 
             her, holds it.

                                       GARY MURRAY
                            ... and I could see the music flowing 
                            into me, it was bright red and 
                            electric, and I felt like a big 
                            toaster, and I thought, maybe I am 
                            a toaster, we're all molecules, and 
                            my friend Melissa, her head looked 
                            like a big party balloon, and that 
                            scared me, I started to freak out...

             Buffy surreptitiously puts the push pin in her mouth.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. THE MALL - DAY

             The other girls are moving on from the dress shop, notice Buffy 
             is not with them.  They spot her in the next shop, urge her to 
             come on.  Buffy puts back the chain saw she was looking at, 
             follows them.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. GARY MURRAY'S OFFICE - DAY

             Buffy hasn't moved, or opened her mouth.  The FLY BUZZES on.  
             Gary Murray now sits behind his desk.

                                       GARY MURRAY
                            I guess you're surprised.  Well, 
                            you know, there's more to most people 
                            than meets the eye.  Everybody's 
                            got a secret.  I just want you to 
                            know that you can always share your 
                            secrets with me.  What you say in 
                            this office, it will stay in this 
                            office.  I'm your pal.

             Buffy smiles at Gary.  As he looks away for a second, Buffy 
             spits out the push pin.  The BUZZING STOPS.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

             Buffy sparring with Merrick again.  She holds a stake.  This 
             time she ends up pinning him, the stake at his solar plexus.

             He moves the point to where his heart would be.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. PIKE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

             The room is a shambles.  Outside the first floor window, it is 
             dark night.  "Help Yourself" by the Posies blasts from Pike's 
             STEREO.  Pike lies on his bed.

             Through the window we see Benny approach, slowly fading up to 
             the pane.  He's floating, really.  (He's a vampire.)  He scrapes 
             his fingers on the glass.

                                       BENNY
                            Pike...

             Pike sits up, turns down the music.  He goes to the window, 
             begins to try to open it.  It's stuck.

                                       PIKE
                            Benny, man, where you been?  You 
                            bailed on me, I passed out, man, I 
                            almost did a Jimi Hendrix!

                                       BENNY
                            Let me in.

                                       PIKE
                            Hey, I'm trying, but this window is 
                            burnt --

             Pike gets a good look at Benny for the first time.

                                       BENNY
                            Invite me in, Pike.

                                       PIKE
                            Wait a minute.  What's wrong with 
                            you, man?

                                       BENNY
                            I'm fine.

                                       PIKE
                            You look like shit, Benny.

             Benny grins, presses his slimy forehead against the glass.

                                       BENNY
                            I... feel.... pretty.

                                       PIKE
                            No offense, man, but I think you're 
                            on something nasty.  Why don't you 
                            just go and cool out and I'll see 
                            you in the morning or something.

                                       BENNY
                            The sun!  It burns!  It burns!

             He laughs at his impression, brown spittle caking the window.

                                       BENNY
                                (continuing)
                            Let me in, Pike!  I'm hungry!

                                       PIKE
                            Get away from here.

                                       BENNY
                            I'm hungry.

                                       PIKE
                            I mean it.

             Benny smiles, moves suddenly out of sight.  Pike looks at the 
             window for a second, then bolts out of his room.  He runs to 
             the front door, frantically hooks the chain.  Benny appears at 
             the door's little window, banging and scraping the glass.

                                       BENNY
                            I'm hungry!  I'm hungry!  I'm hungry!

             Pike backs away.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             EXT. DESERTED STREET - NIGHT

             Buffy walks slowly down the street, trying to appear nonchalant, 
             but looking about her a lot.

                                       BUFFY
                            Sure is cold.  What a dark night.  
                            Nice night for a walk.

             She whistles some, keeps walking.

                                       BUFFY
                                (continuing)
                            'Feelings, la la la la feelings'...  
                            Boy, I'm helpless.

             She passes an alley and there is a RUSTLING amid the garbage 
             cans.  She moves slowly down the alley toward the noise.  She 
             is about halfway down when a rat scurries out from the cans 
             and down a drain.

                                       BUFFY
                                (continuing)
                            Yeucch.

             Behind her, another SOUND.  She turns slowly.  At the entrance 
             to the alley stands a vampire.  They stare at each other, some 
             thirty feet away.

                                       BUFFY
                                (continuing)
                            Hello...

             She moves back a step.  The vampire takes a step.

                                       BUFFY
                                (continuing)
                            What do you want?

             It floats rapidly at her, hissing.  Buffy looks about her 
             frantically, trapped.  It hits her at top speed and she 
             instantly rolls onto her back, flipping it and hurling it 
             against the wall at the end of the alley.  As it hits, Buffy, 
             still rolling, produces a stake from her jacket and throws it 
             directly at its heart.  The stake punctures the startled 
             creature's chest.  Before he can so much as grab it, Buffy 
             throws a roundhouse kick, driving the stake all the way home 
             with her foot.  The vampire screams, sinks to the ground.

             Buffy turns, triumphant.

                                       BUFFY
                                (continuing)
                            Toaster-caked him!

             CLOSEUP - A STOPWATCH

             A hand stops it.  It is Merrick, who steps into the alley and 
             stares at Buffy.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             EXT. OUTSIDE THE WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

             The two exit Merrick's car, an old Dodge Dart.  As they talk, 
             they make their way into the warehouse.  Buffy looks out for 
             trouble while Merrick unlocks the door.  This is obviously 
             their routine.

                                       MERRICK
                            He was slow.  Very simple.  They 
                            won't all be that easy.

                                       BUFFY
                            Fine.

                                       MERRICK
                            And the alley was a mistake.  Never 
                            corner yourself like that.  If they'd 
                            come at you in force you'd be dead 
                            now.  One vampire is a lot easier 
                            to kill then ten.

                                       BUFFY
                            Does the world 'Duhh' mean anything 
                            to you?

                                       MERRICK
                            You felt a little sick, didn't you?  
                            The cramps.

             They enter the warehouse.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. THE WAREHOUSE - SAME TIME

             They unload their stuff as they argue.

                                       BUFFY
                            Nice conversationalist!  Yeah, I 
                            felt 'em a little, but I ain't due 
                            for two weeks since you're so excited 
                            about the subject.

                                       MERRICK
                            It's natural.  A reaction to their 
                            presence, to the... unnaturalness 
                            of it.  It's part of how you are 
                            able to track them.

                                       BUFFY
                            Oh, wonderful.  My secret weapon is -
                            PMS.  That's just great.  Thanks 
                            for telling me.

                                       MERRICK
                            You'll get used to it.  I'm more 
                            worried about your tactical mistakes.

                                       BUFFY
                            You are such a wet.

                                       MERRICK
                            A what?

                                       BUFFY
                            A wet!  Didn't I just kill that 
                            vampire?  I think I did.  I didn't 
                            see you killing any vampires.  You 
                            were too busy playing 'Beat the 
                            Clock'.

                                       MERRICK
                            Don't start with me again.

                                       BUFFY
                            Aren't I, like the chosen one?  The 
                            one and only?  The Grand High Poobah 
                            and doesn't that mean you have to 
                            be nice to me?  Like, ever?

                                       MERRICK
                            Buffy...

                                       BUFFY
                            And why are you always wearing black?  
                            It's so down.  It's totally not 
                            your color.  I don't think you have 
                            a color.

                                       MERRICK
                            What do you want?  Encouragement?
                                (in bad American accent)
                            'Gosh, Buffy, you're so special, I 
                            just want to give you a great big 
                            hug, oh I'm just having a warm 
                            fuzzy.'

                                       BUFFY
                            Oh, fuck you!

             Merrick turns on her.

                                       MERRICK
                            Do you know how many girls I've 
                            trained to be Slayers?  Five.  Five 
                            properly prepared girls, girls who 
                            faced their responsibilities, who 
                            worked hard to become women overnight -- 
                            harder than you've ever worked in 
                            your life -- and I saw them ripped 
                            apart.  Do you want to live?  Do 
                            you?

                                       BUFFY
                            I...

                                       MERRICK
                            What did you think, that being able 
                            to jump about and hit people makes 
                            you a Slayer?

             Buffy looks at him a bit.

                                       BUFFY
                            Five?

                                       MERRICK
                            Five.

                                       BUFFY
                            So, basically, I've got the life 
                            expectancy of a zit, right?

                                       MERRICK
                            Not if you're careful.

                                       BUFFY
                            How can you keep doing this?

                                       MERRICK
                            It's what I was raised to do.  There 
                            aren't many of us left, the Watchers.

                                       BUFFY
                            Watchers?

                                       MERRICK
                            There's a small village in Hampshire, 
                            near Stonehenge...
                                (sees she doesn't know it)
                            ... near a bunch of big rocks.  
                            That's where I was born.  My father 
                            taught me about the training, about 
                            finding the Slayers, reading the 
                            signs.  There's a small cluster of 
                            us, a few families, really... most 
                            of the neighboring villagers think 
                            we're just a bunch of harmless old 
                            loonies.  I thought so myself for a 
                            time, when I was younger...
                                (stops himself)
                            I'm sorry.  I'm not supposed to... 
                            I shouldn't go on like this.

                                       BUFFY
                            I wish you would.

                                       MERRICK
                            It isn't important.

                                       BUFFY
                            I'm curious, is all.

                                       MERRICK
                            Buffy, don't... don't start thinking 
                            of me as your friend.  It interferes 
                            with the work, and it...

                                       BUFFY
                            And it makes it worse when I die, 
                            right?

             Silence.

                                       BUFFY
                                (continuing)
                            Well, you know, I'm not gonna kick 
                            so easy.  I've got a few things the 
                            other girls didn't have.

                                       MERRICK
                            As for example, what?

                                       BUFFY
                            Well... there's my keen fashion 
                            sense, for one.

                                       MERRICK
                            Vampires of the world, beware.

                                       BUFFY
                                (impressed)
                            Merrick.  You made a joke.  Are you 
                            okay, I mean, do you want to lie 
                            down?  I know it hurts the first 
                            time.

             In spite of himself, Merrick smiles.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. SCHOOL HALL - DAY

             Buffy, Nicole, Kimberly, and Jennifer are walking down the 
             hall.

                                       JENNIFER
                            So they found Cassandra's body out 
                            by the railway tunnels.  Nobody's 
                            saying anything, but they think she 
                            was involved in something, like, 
                            illegal or something.  Like dealing.

                                       KIMBERLY
                            Well, I hope so.

                                       JENNIFER
                            Probably was.  What do you suppose 
                            she was doing out there.

                                       BUFFY
                            Dying.

                                       JENNIFER
                            Eeyuu.

             Coming from the opposite direction are Jeffrey, Andy and some 
             of the other football players.  They're suited up and heading 
             for the gym.

                                       ANDY
                            ... And they're having some memorial 
                            service or something tomorrow.  You 
                            going?

                                       JEFFREY
                            I don't know.  Coach said I had to 
                            work on my 'ab's.'

                                       ANDY
                            Coach knows what abs are?

             They pass Buffy.  Andy stops and grabs her from behind.

                                       ANDY
                                (continuing)
                            Got to get some!

             Unthinkingly, Buffy flips Andy over and pins him against a 
             locker.

                                       ANDY
                                (continuing)
                            Whoa!  Whoa!  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  
                            I don't actually need any right 
                            now.

                                       JEFFREY
                                (to Buffy)
                            What's with you?

                                       BUFFY
                            Don't grab me, okay?

                                       ANDY
                            Absolutely.  I see now the error of 
                            my mistake.

                                       JEFFREY
                            Yeah, keep your mitts off my thang.  
                            I'll pop you one.
                                (to Buffy)
                            Did he scare you?

             Jeffrey puts his arm around Buffy but she shakes it off.

                                       BUFFY
                            I can take care of myself, Jeffrey.

                                       JEFFREY
                            So I noticed.

             Buffy goes off by herself.  Jeffrey watches her.

                                       JEFFREY
                                (continuing)
                            Nice to feel needed.

                                       ANDY
                            Let's move out!

                                       JEFFREY
                                (rallying)
                            Yes!

             The lads move off.  We see Nicole, Kimberly and Jennifer, who 
             have been watching the whole exchange.  Nicole and Kimberly 
             are obviously disdainful of Buffy's behavior.  Jennifer is 
             feeling sorry for Jeffrey.  Boy does she want him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. CLOTHING STORE - DAY

             A mod, brightly lit store.  A little hipper than your usual 
             mall fare, but not Melrose either.  Bright colors reign.  Buffy 
             is standing by a dressing stall, inspecting her fingernails, 
             talking to Merrick as he changes inside.

                                       BUFFY
                            I mean, most of the time Jeffrey's 
                            really sweet, but sometimes he gets 
                            kind of... 'Me-Tarzan'ish, you know 
                            what I mean?  Lately it bugs me, I 
                            guess.
                                (no response)
                            Merrick?  Are you still breathing?

                                       MERRICK (O.S.)
                                (from inside)
                            I can't work this.

                                       BUFFY
                            We call them zippers.  They're not 
                            supposed to be a challenge.

                                       MERRICK
                            But it's in the back.  Why are we 
                            wasting time with this, anyway?

                                       BUFFY
                            Because you clash, Merrick.  You 
                            clash with everything.  I mean you 
                            might as well go around with a sign, 
                            'Slayers trained her.'  Honestly, 
                            you look like something out of... 
                            Pasadena.

                                       MERRICK
                            My clothes have always been perfectly 
                            serviceable.

                                       BUFFY
                            Well, you're on my turf now.  You're 
                            just gonna have to trust me.

             Merrick comes out of the booth.  He wears multi-colored 
             parachute pants and an equally loud T-shirt.  Buffy looks at 
             him -- he looks at himself.

                                       MERRICK
                            I want to die.

                                       BUFFY
                                (doesn't like it either)
                            Okay.  The important thing is not 
                            to panic.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             EXT. ZEPH'S AUTO REPAIR - LATE AFTERNOON

             Pike is hurriedly working on a part in the hood of his beat-up 
             Dodge, which is filled with all his belongings.  ZEPH stands 
             watching him.  Zeph is about forty-five, greasy, good-natured.  
             Pike works for him.

                                       PIKE
                            You said you'd have the part by 
                            two!  Christ, it's almost dark.

             Pike finishes, slams the hood.  He picks up a battered guitar 
             case and stuffs it into the car, shuts the door.

                                       ZEPH
                            What nasty bug crawled up your bungus 
                            and where the hell are you going?

                                       PIKE
                            I'm leaving, man.  I'm bailing town.  
                            This place has gotten way too hairy.

                                       ZEPH
                            Where am I gonna find another 
                            mechanic stupid enough to work for 
                            my money?

                                       PIKE
                            Hey, have you seen Benny lately?

                                       ZEPH
                            No...  You want me to give him a 
                            message?

                                       PIKE
                            You should think about leaving, 
                            too, man.  Sell this place...  
                            Something's going on here.  I don't 
                            know.  Something real weird.

             Pike gets in the car.  It sputter, starts.

                                       ZEPH
                            Ah, you'll be coming back.

                                       PIKE
                            I don't think so.

                                       ZEPH
                            All right.  Take care of yourself.

                                       PIKE
                            I am.

                                       ZEPH
                            Hey.  What should I do if I see 
                            Benny?

                                       PIKE
                            Run.

             Pike peels out.  Zeph watches him go.

                                       ZEPH
                            That's my guitar...

             ANGLE - THE SUN

             burning down.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. PIKE'S CAR - NIGHT

             On the edge of town.  The car has stalled at an intersection.  
             Pike is hunched over the wheel, his head down as he listens to 
             the rasping ENGINE.

                                       PIKE
                            Come on, come on.  Don't leave me, 
                            baby.  Come on, breathe.

             Amilyn appears in the street in front of the car.  Pike finally 
             hears the SCRAPING OF HIS FEET as he approaches the car.  Pike 
             straightens up slowly, and as the rear view mirror comes INTO 
             THE FRAME, we see there are two more behind him.  They are 
             both high-school age, fresh like Bessel and Benny.  They all 
             approach, slowly.

             Pike waits for a second, his hand on the key.

                                       PIKE
                                (continuing)
                            This is for the money, baby.  Make 
                            me proud.

             He turns the key again and the car ROARS to life.  The 
             headlights trap the hungry scowl of the vampires as Pike pops 
             the car in reverse, smashing into the back two vampires.  They 
             both go flying, hurt but not killed.

             ANGLE - INSIDE THE CAR

             Pike races at Amilyn, but he leaps up as Pike reaches him, and 
             Pike hears a THUD as Amilyn lands on the roof of his car.  
             Pike continues to bullet down the street as a hand suddenly 
             punches through the roof, grabbing at him.  He fights off the 
             hand and tries to control the speeding car.

             It can't be done:  he goes off the road and into a park.  The 
             car careens along.

             ANGLE - ON TOP OF THE CAR

             Amilyn ride it, laughing.

             ANGLE - INSIDE THE CAR

             Pike spots a tree with a low branch and heads for it.  Still 
             fighting, he aims at the branch.  It gets closer.

             ANGLE - ON TOP OF THE CAR

             Amilyn looks up.

             ANGLE - INSIDE THE CAR

             They pass under the branch and we hear a TEARING THUD.  The 
             arm stiffens and falls into Pike's lap.

             The car hits another tree dead on.  Pike slams into the steering 
             wheel.  The guitar case flies right through the windshield and 
             lands on the grass.

             Pike pulls himself slowly from the car.  He is bleeding, but 
             not badly.  Just shaken.  He hears a low, seething WAIL from a 
             few yards back and turns around.  Amilyn is getting shakily to 
             his feet.

                                       PIKE
                            Oh, give me a break.

             Amilyn hisses at him, then turns and races away, snarling, 
             clutching what's left of his arm.

             One of the other vampires nears him.  Pike tries to run and 
             his knees buckle.  He lands on them right next to the guitar 
             case.  As the vampire nears, he pulls the guitar out of the 
             case and swings it, hitting the vampire in the head.  He hits 
             him again.  The vampire bats away the guitar and grabs Pike.  
             Brings his face to Pike's as Pike squirms.

             A blasting kick in the head from Buffy.  The vampire is flung 
             to one side, falls.  He starts up at Buffy and she nails him 
             with a stake.  Pike stares at her.  She pulls a walkie-talkie 
             from her pocket.

                                       BUFFY
                                (into walkie-talkie)
                            I'm on the east side, near the 
                            playground...  all right.

             She puts the walkie-talkie back.

                                       BUFFY
                                (continuing)
                            Hi.

                                       PIKE
                            Hi there.

                                       BUFFY
                            Is that your car?

                                       PIKE
                            It was.  I think it's pretty much 
                            ready for the --

             The last vampire hits Pike from behind.  Without missing a 
             beat, Buffy picks up the guitar and snaps the neck off.  She 
             and the vampire meet in the middle -- the creature barely moves 
             before she buries the guitar neck in its chest.  It falls.

             Merrick runs up.  He is wearing black jeans and a windbreaker.  
             He is more modern than he was before, but subtly.  He sees the 
             decaying bodies, one with a guitar sticking out of its chest.

                                       MERRICK
                            Interesting.

                                       BUFFY
                            I kind of had to improvise.
                                (to Pike)
                            Sorry about your guitar.

                                       PIKE
                            That's okay.  Umm, listen, I'm 
                            not.... I have to fall down now.

             Pike's eyes glaze over slightly as he collapses into Buffy's 
             arms.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. BOILER ROOM - CLOSEUP ON AMILYN - NIGHT

             Thrashing about the room in hysterics, screaming and snarling, 
             banging his one fist on the boiler tank.  It booms hollowly.  
             Lothos grabs him, throws him up against the wall.

                                       LOTHOS
                            What's wrong with you!?!

                                       AMILYN
                            My arm!  He took my fucking arm!

                                       LOTHOS
                            Shut up!  You let him have it!

             Lothos lets Amilyn go.  Amilyn still fumes, quietly.

                                       LOTHOS
                                (continuing)
                            You reckless imbecile.  This place 
                            is ours for the taking and you let 
                            yourself... twelve hundred years 
                            old and you act like a child.

                                       AMILYN
                            I had him in my grasp.

                                       LOTHOS
                            Cheer up.  You may still.

             Only Lothos smiles at the joke.  Amilyn raises his stump, looks 
             at it.  The tattered end of his jacket covers the grossness of 
             it, but it still isn't good.

                                       AMILYN
                                (forlornly)
                            I look horrible.

                                       LOTHOS
                            The other two -- the new ones.  
                            Where are they?

                                       AMILYN
                            I don't know.  But the boy, he 
                            couldn't kill them.

                                       LOTHOS
                                (thoughtfully)
                            No... Not a boy...
                                (gathers himself)
                            Find out if they're dead.  And do 
                            something about that arm.  Honestly, 
                            I don't know how you made it through 
                            the Crusades.

             He turns toward his chamber.

                                       LOTHOS
                                (continuing)
                            Let me know about our little 
                            recruits.  I'll be in my chamber...

             On his way through the door he passes a box on an oil drum.  
             He plucks a large kitten out of it.

                                       LOTHOS
                                (continuing)
                            ... having a snack.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

             Buffy and Pike walk in, Pike still a bit unsteady on his feet.

                                       BUFFY
                            How are you doing?

                                       PIKE
                            Oh, I'm good.  I'm good.  Kind of 
                            miss my knees, though.

                                       BUFFY
                            You want some water or something?

                                       PIKE
                            Water.  Okay.

             They move into the kitchen.

                                       PIKE
                                (continuing)
                            Do you do this kind of thing a lot?  
                            I mean, is this like a hobby?

                                       BUFFY
                            Not exactly.

                                       PIKE
                            They were vampires, weren't they?

                                       BUFFY
                            Yeah.

                                       PIKE
                            God!  Unbelievable.  Vampires.

             Buffy hands Pike the water and they move back into the living 
             room.  Pike curls up in an armchair by the window.  Buffy begins 
             stripping off her bloody clothes, leaving on a tank-top and 
             jeans.

                                       BUFFY
                            You had a car full of stuff.  Were 
                            you leaving?

                                       PIKE
                            Yeah, I was bailing.  I have a 
                            friend, and he's really... well, 
                            he's really vampire, I guess.  Bad 
                            scene.

                                       BUFFY
                            Well, stay here tonight.

                                       PIKE
                            Thanks.  Tomorrow morning, I'm on a 
                            bus.  I'm gone.

                                       BUFFY
                            Where are you gonna go?

                                       PIKE
                            Well, I've always wanted to see 
                            Oxnard.

             As Buffy strips down to her tank top, she notices a gash on 
             her arm.  It's not bleeding much any more, but it's fairly 
             impressive.  Pike jumps up to help as she pats it down with 
             her shirt.

                                       PIKE
                                (continuing)
                            Hey, jeez are you okay?  You need a 
                            hand?

                                       BUFFY
                            It's nothing.  It doesn't hurt.

             Pike looks at her a moment as she wraps her shirt around it.

                                       PIKE
                                (almost awed)
                            Who are you?

             Buffy doesn't look up.  The questions seems to upset her a 
             great deal.  She even fights back tears.

                                       PIKE
                                (continuing)
                            I'm sorry, I just mean... well you 
                            seemed like such a flake.  But, in 
                            a good way!  I can just keep talking 
                            till you strike me dead, or...

             Buffy smiles at this, though still upset.  She sits down.

                                       BUFFY
                            Things are kind of confusing.

                                       PIKE
                            I'll back that up.

                                       BUFFY
                            Three weeks ago all I thought about 
                            was... well, I didn't actually think 
                            about anything.  I definitely didn't 
                            expect this.

                                       PIKE
                            I know.  My guidance counselor never 
                            mentioned anything about vampires.  
                            'Prison' came up a few times, but 
                            nothing about undead.

                                       BUFFY
                            It's weird.  I went back to my old 
                            grade school once, to the playground -- 
                            I used to hang out there all the 
                            time, playing on the swings and 
                            stuff... I went back and it was so 
                            tiny, the whole place.  I couldn't 
                            even fit on the swings.  Everything 
                            just looked so small.
                                (collects herself)
                            I'm sorry.  I'm babbling.

                                       PIKE
                            No, you're not.

             But she stands anyway, head to the stairs.

                                       BUFFY
                            I'm kinda beat.  You can stay in my 
                            mom's room if you want.

                                       PIKE
                            I think I'll just hang out here.  
                            Make sure the sun comes up and 
                            everything.

                                       BUFFY
                            You sure?

                                       PIKE
                            Oh, I'll be fine.  Got my chair, 
                            got my window, I'm great.

                                       BUFFY
                            Mmkay.

             She starts up the stairs.

                                       PIKE
                            Hey, Buffy...

                                       BUFFY
                            Yeah?

                                       PIKE
                            You know, you saved my life.  And I 
                            just wanted to say... I forgive you 
                            for talking during the movie.  
                            Almost.

             She gives him a look, heads upstairs.  He watches her go, looks 
             out the window.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             EXT. BUS TERMINAL

             A bus is pulling out.  We see Pike through the window, looking 
             comtemplative.  He watches the terminal disappear.

             PIKE'S POV

             The streets move by.  On one there is a Police Officer talking 
             to a hysterical Man.  Next to them is a body, covered by a 
             sheet.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             EXT. OUTSIDE SCHOOL - MORNING

             Buffy and Merrick are walking along the path to the steps of 
             the main building, arguing.  Merrick is wearing casual 
             California gear, but again, very subdued.

                                       MERRICK
                            There isn't time.

                                       BUFFY
                            Make time, okay?  You're the one 
                            who told me to act normal.  I've 
                            missed three practices already.  If 
                            I'm not there for the Barber game 
                            tomorrow everyone's gonna talk.

                                       MERRICK
                            Another distraction.  It's not right.

                                       BUFFY
                            Why because it's not my fate?  It's 
                            not in the Book-of-All-
                            Knowledgefullness that I'm gonna be 
                            cheerleading at the Barber game?

                                       MERRICK
                            Sooner or later you're going to 
                            have to accept it.  Your fate.

                                       BUFFY
                            I'm pretty much learning not to 
                            accept anything anymore.  Come on, 
                            Merrick.  Football.  Afterwards we 
                            can kill and kill until there is 
                            nothing left.

                                       MERRICK
                            All right.

                                       BUFFY
                            Toasty.  You should come; it's gonna 
                            be a great game.

                                       MERRICK
                            Oh, I'll be there all right.  I'm 
                            not letting you out of my sight.  
                            Not till you're ready.

                                       BUFFY
                            Try and be inconspicuous, okay?  
                            Act like a fan.

                                       MERRICK
                                (being a fan)
                            Football is my life.

                                       BUFFY
                            You're learning.  Slowly, incredibly 
                            slowly, but you're learning.

             She turns to go.

                                       MERRICK
                            None of the other girls ever gave 
                            me this much trouble.

                                       BUFFY
                            And where are they now?

             She smiles at him and runs up the steps, where Jeffrey is 
             waiting for her.  He looks at the departing figure of Merrick.

                                       JEFFREY
                            So that's your tutor, huh?  What is 
                            he, like, your boyfriend now?

                                       BUFFY
                            Jeffrey.  Projectile vomit.

             They enter the building together.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - NIGHT

             Right before the game.  The scoreboard reads "Hemery vs Barber".  
             Fans fill the stands.  We see Buffy with the other cheerleaders.  
             She's really into it, enjoying herself as they all rally the 
             crowd.

             We see Merrick taking a seat.  He is wearing another new outfit -- 
             a letterman jacket and baseball cap.  He has binoculars around 
             his neck.  He takes his seat amidst the teens.  Real 
             inconspicuous.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. LOCKER ROOM - SAME TIME

             The coach is giving players his pep talk.

                                       COACH
                            Some people say winning is a state 
                            of mind.  Can't win out there if 
                            you don't win --
                                (point to his head)
                            -- in here.  I say, winning isn't a 
                            state of mind.  I say winning is 
                            having more points.  And how do we 
                            get point?  By putting the thing, 
                            the ball over the.. in the place.

                                       AMILYN
                            End zone.

                                       COACH
                            Right.  So I don't care about your 
                            minds.  Maybe you're tired.  Maybe 
                            you're worried about your grades.  
                            Maybe you dog just died or you've 
                            suddenly found that you're attracted 
                            to other men.  I don't care!  'Cause 
                            we're a team.  And there only on 
                            thing that matters to a team.  What 
                            that?

                                       TEAM
                            Winning!

                                       COACH
                            And how do we win?

                                       TEAM
                            By putting the thing in the place!!

                                       COACH
                            So let's go!!

                                       TEAM
                            Yeahh!!!!

             They run out, full of fire.  The coach turns to one player, 
             whose face we cannot see.

                                       COACH
                            There you are!  You missed practice 
                            again.  You're benched till the 
                            fourth, um, the fourth part.  Now 
                            get out there.

             Coach heads out.  The player turns around, smiles after him.  
             It's Grueller.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. STADIUM TUNNEL - SAME TIME

             The players run out toward the field, yelling.  The last of 
             them is Grueller.  He floats behind them slowly, grinning and 
             speaking in a passionless voice, again as if he were repeating 
             words phonetically.

                                       GRUELLER
                            Go team.  Rah.  Go team go.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD  (LATER)

             Fourth quarter.  The scoreboard read "Hemery: 17, Barber: 21".  
             Fifty seconds left.

                                       CHEERLEADERS
                            Two!  Four!  Six!  Eight! 
                            Who do we emasculate! 
                            Barber!  Barber!  Yay!!

             On the sidelines, a player hobbles out and coach pushes Grueller 
             in.  He passes Buffy and she winces slightly.  It messes up 
             the routine and Nicole practically falls over her.

                                       NICOLE
                            Buffy, Jesus!  You know these steps.

                                       BUFFY
                            Sorry.

             Buffy starts cheering again as the players huddle.

             ANGLE - MERRICK

             He is watching Buffy through his binoculars.  A TEEN nudges 
             him.

                                       TEEN
                            Hey, can I borrow your binoculars, 
                            man?

                                       MERRICK
                                (without looking around)
                            No.

                                       TEEN
                            You're checking out the cheerleaders.  
                            All right.  Buffy, man.

             Merrick does turn.

                                       MERRICK
                            What about her?

                                       TEEN
                            Everybody knows about her, man.

                                       MERRICK
                            Knows what about her?

             The teen leans closer.

                                       TEEN
                            She's had sex.

             He nods at Merrick; "You know what I mean".  Merrick turns 
             back.

                                       MERRICK
                            I'm on the wrong bloody side.

             ANGLE - THE FIELD

             The players are lined up.  Grueller, at left tackle, smiles at 
             the player facing him, growls.  The player looks worried.

                            Twenty-three!  Thirty-two!  Hike!

             The players scramble as Andy hands off.  The carrier gets a 
             few yards.  When the pileup on the line of scrimmage peels 
             apart, the player that had been facing Grueller is unconscious.

             As he is carted off the field, Grueller gleefully trots back 
             to the huddle.

             ANGLE - BUFFY

             Watching the game, a little perplexed.

             ANGLE - THE STANDS

             Merrick watches Buffy.

             ANGLE - THE SIDELINES

             The coach yells at the players.

                                       COACH
                            Come on!  Do the thing!  Where you... 
                            go towards the guy!  Come one!  
                            Throw the thing!

             ANGLE - GRUELLER

             Smiling, listening to Andy call the play.

             ANGLE - ANOTHER SECTION IN THE STANDS

             Kimberly sits, complaining to no one in particular.

                                       KIMBERLY
                            What are they doing?  The clock's 
                            running out!
                                (shouts)
                            Throw the ball!

             She sits back, turns to her neighbor.

                                       KIMBERLY
                            Are they so brain-dead?

             Her neighbor smiles at her.  He is a vampire, and he speaks in 
             the same monotone that Grueller used.  He waves a pennant.

             ANGLE - THE FIELD

             The players are lined up again.  Grueller is drooling.  The 
             other team is really worried about him now.

             The snap.  Andy drops back and lobs it to Jeffrey.  Jeffrey is 
             way open.  He catches it easily, looks behind him as he runs.  
             Barber players are rushing at him.  And Grueller is coming at 
             him too, throwing other players right and left.

             Jeffrey looks a little worried.  He bolts down field, toward 
             the end zone, Grueller on his heels.

             ANGLE - BUFFY

             She sees something is definitely wrong.

                                       BUFFY
                            Jeffrey...

             In a flash, she races onto the field.

                                       NICOLE
                            Buffy!

             He stands, his eyes following Buffy.

             She also see Buffy.

                            Oh, wow.  She's really lost it.

                            Party hearty.

             Everybody rises to their feet and cheers as Jeffrey makes it 
             to the end zone.

             ANGLE - THE CLOCK

             Two, one, zero.

             ANGLE - THE FIELD

             Grueller hits Jeffrey a second before he is enveloped by other 
             players.  Grueller, hungry with bloodlust, is confused by the 
             exultant crowd, snarling at people.

             Buffy races for the crowd.  She sees Jeffrey is all right.  
             Grueller makes his way out of the throng and up into the stands 
             even as everyone else is rushing onto the field.

             Jeffrey is triumphant.  He sees Buffy running for him and raises 
             his arms.  She passes him right by and continues after Grueller, 
             heads up the stands.  He looks after her, confused, before he 
             is swamped again.

             ANGLE - MERRICK

             He tries to make his way through the crowd.

             ANGLE - TOP OF THE STANDS

             Grueller reaches them and leaps over the back.  Buffy sees 
             him, runs up and without hesitation, dives off herself.

             The stands reach some thirty feet off the ground.  Buffy sails 
             down like a diver, grabs a branch about halfway down.  She 
             swings like a gymnast and the branch snaps.  Still holding the 
             broken branch, she completes a perfect flip and lands on her 
             feet.

             The vampire fan is on the ground behind her, come for her and 
             without stopping or even turning she twirls the branch and 
             sinks the broken end in his heart.

             She looks around for Grueller.  He is booking out, already 
             several yards away..

             Merrick appears at the top of the stands just in time to see 
             Buffy take off after Grueller.

                                       MERRICK
                            Wait!

                                       BUFFY
                                (calls as she runs)
                            He knows who I am!

             She continues to race after Grueller.

             ANGLE - MERRICK

             Running back down the stands, making his way through the 
             dispersing crowd to the nearest exit.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             EXT. STREET - SAME TIME

             Buffy is still following, but she can't keep up.  She spot a 
             BIKER tooling along the street on a Harley.  She comes up to 
             the side of the road and tentatively sticks her thumb out.  
             The biker smiles, stops in front of her.

             ANGLE - THE BIKE

             Ground level, behind the bike, we see its engine revving, smoke 
             puffing from twin pipes.

                                       BIKER
                            Hey, babe.  You want to get some 
                            real power between your legs?

             Buffy looks at the biker a moment.

             ANGLE - THE BIKE

             The same angle as before, ground level.  Suddenly the biker's 
             body lands in front of CAMERA

             CLOSEUP - WHEEL

             spinning

             CLOSEUP - HAND

             revving the engine.

             Buffy takes off at top speed.

                                       BIKER
                            Dyke!  You're a dyke!  I'm telling 
                            the world!

                                                                    CUT TO:

             EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE  (MOMENTS LATER)

             A RUSTLING in the trees signifies Grueller's flight.  Seconds 
             late, Buffy roars into view behind him.  She navigates the 
             streets with less ease than determination.

             Her eyes follow him off the road and she steers the bike on a 
             violently bumpy and erratic course through the site.  She 
             finally hits a pile of bricks and is thrown headlong from the 
             bike.  She hits the ground hard; she rolls into it but has 
             trouble getting up.

             BUFFY'S POV

             Grueller's smiling face appears over her.

                                       GRUELLER
                            Fall down go boom have to see the 
                            nurse.

                                       BUFFY (O.S.)
                            Grueller, God, what did they do 
                            you?

             He brings his face right next to hers.  His voice is no longer 
             passionless; it boils up from hell.

                                       GRUELLER
                            They killed me.

             RESUME SCENE

             He grabs her and hauls her up.

                                       BUFFY
                            No kidding.

             She head-butts him with enormous force, sending him staggering 
             back.  Before he can recover, she dives for a pile of discarded 
             lumber, chooses a nasty shard of wood.

             She turns on Grueller, who is smiling again.  There are two 
             more Vampires approaching her, surrounding her.

                                       GRUELLER
                            The Master walks tonight.  This is 
                            his kingdom, now.

             They rush her.  She takes one on as the second hits her, 
             knocking her over.  They all three swarm over her, meeting her 
             kicks with raking claws.  The two hold her in front of Grueller.

                                       GRUELLER
                                (continuing)
                            You know, Buffy, I've always wanted 
                            you.

             He smiles again and leans toward her neck.

             The stake that pops out through his chest is as much a surprise 
             to him as it is to Buffy.  He falls backward, shocked and dead.  
             Behind him stands Pike.

             One of the other vampires stupidly goes after Pike, who runs 
             away.  Buffy instantly flips the other one over onto Grueller, 
             impaling him as well.

             Pike runs more or less in a circle, yelling, the vampire at 
             his heels.

                                       PIKE
                            I didn't mean it!  I didn't mean 
                            it!

             Wooden shard in hand, Buffy sprints toward them, jumps into a 
             series of flips.  She lands with her legs around the vampire's 
             shoulders, plants the stake in its heart as they topple onto 
             Pike.

             For a moment, Pike and Buffy lie on top of each other, breathing 
             hard.  Then they get up awkwardly, embarrassed by their 
             touching, (and by their slight arousal).

                                       BUFFY
                            I didn't expect to see you.

                                       PIKE
                            I know.

                                       BUFFY
                            Why'd you come back?

                                       PIKE
                            I don't know.  I kind of thought I 
                            ought to be here.  You know, this 
                            isn't exactly the kind of thing you 
                            can run away from.

                                       BUFFY
                            Thanks.

                                       PIKE
                            Besides, Oxnard sucks.

             They start out of the site.

                                       PIKE
                                (continuing)
                            Listen, I... I really do want to 
                            help.  I mean, these guys are dag 
                            nasty, and somewhere my best friend 
                            is out there, and I'd like to, I 
                            don't know.  Even the score.  Do 
                            some damage.  I'm good with damage.

             ANGLE - KIMBERLY'S CAR

             She drives by, see Buffy with Pike.  It's an eyebrow-raiser, 
             but she keeps driving.

                                       BUFFY
                            Pike, I don't think you're up to 
                            this.

                                       PIKE
                            I think I could help.  You gonna 
                            tell me you don't need help?

                                                                    CUT TO:

             EXT. STREET - SAME TIME

             Merrick runs up to the street where Buffy took the Harley.  He 
             has shed the raccoon coat.  The biker is still there, standing 
             in the road trying to thumb a ride.

                                       MERRICK
                            Did you see a girl come by here?

                                       BIKER
                            You don't mean, like, a cheerleader?

                                       MERRICK
                            Yes.

                                       BIKER
                            Yeah, I saw her.  Bitch took my 
                            wheels.

                                       MERRICK
                            Wheels?

                                       BIKER
                            My bike!  She's a lesbian, too.  
                            She told me.

                                       MERRICK
                            Which way did she go?

                                       BIKER
                            Down there.

             He points.  The CAMERA PANS with Merrick as he takes a step in 
             that direction, leaving the biker behind (and momentarily OUT 
             OF FRAME).

                                       MERRICK
                            Idiot girl.  Can't watch over her.  
                            How long ago did --

             The CAMERA PAN back with Merrick as he turns to the biker, but 
             in his place stands Lothos.  Not five feet from Merrick.

                                       MERRICK
                            Oh, my God.

             ANGLE - THE BIKER

             On his knees, Lothos' hand firmly locked around his throat.  
             He cannot move or breathe.

             Merrick and Lothos look at each other a moment.

                                       LOTHOS
                            It's a beautiful night.  I have 
                            never understood the human tendency 
                            to equate darkness with emptiness.  
                            To me the black is so thick with 
                            life, like soil...  like blood.  
                            Darkness writhes under my eye.

             He looks at the night.  Merrick slowly reaches for a gun stuck 
             in the back of his pants as Lothos continues.

                                       LOTHOS
                                (continuing)
                            I know who you are.  She's out her, 
                            as well, isn't she?  Another Slayer.  
                            Who is it this time?  What offering 
                            have you brought me?

             EXT. ANOTHER STREET - ANGLE ON BUFFY - SAME TIME

             She is crouching on the ground, holding her stomach and gritting 
             her teeth.

                                       PIKE
                            Buffy?  What's wrong?

                                       BUFFY
                            Oh, God.  It's him.  I think it's 
                            him.

                                       PIKE
                            Who?

                                       BUFFY
                                (not answering)
                            Merrick...

             Buffy ups and runs in the direction of the noise.  Calls back 
             to Pike.

                                       BUFFY
                                (continuing)
                            Stay here.

             She runs out of sight.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             EXT. STREET - ANGLE ON THE BIKER - SAME TIME

             Lothos lets him go and he falls, dead.

                                       LOTHOS
                            It doesn't really matter.  The names, 
                            the faces, they all melt together.  
                            After a time, there really is no 
                            difference.  One more pathetic bitch, 
                            begging for me to suck on her clotted 
                            heart.

                                       MERRICK
                            This one may surprise you.

             CLOSEUP - THE GUN

             Merrick holds it firm behind his back, finger on the trigger.

                                       LOTHOS
                            I rather doubt it, if she was raised 
                            here.

             He laughs.  He doesn't appear to have noticed the gun, but:

                                       LOTHOS
                                (continuing)
                            Where is she?  I can't wait to meet 
                            her.  Do you think she's ready to 
                            face me?  Or perhaps you can stop 
                            me with that gun.

                                       MERRICK
                            Perhaps.

             Merrick looks out at the trees nearby.

             MERRICK'S POV

             Buffy appears, far away, between the trees.

             Merrick looks at Lothos, afraid he will notice.

             ANGLE - BUFFY

             Approaching, stopping some twenty yards away.  She looks about 
             her for a weapon.

                                       LOTHOS
                            Look at you.  You pathetic thing.  
                            So small, so full of fury.  After 
                            you've served me for a hundred years, 
                            I think you'll have a little more 
                            perspective.

                                       MERRICK
                            I don't think so.

             Lothos rushes suddenly at Merrick, hissing, his feet just off 
             the ground.  Merrick steps back, whips out the GUN, and SHOOTS 
             himself without hesitation in the head.

             Buffy's eyes go wide.

             Lothos growls, holding Merrick's spurting corpse.

             A small, involuntary noise escapes Buffy.

             CLOSEUP - LOTHOS

             Even twenty yards away, he hears.  He spins and stares, starest 
             at CAMERA.  Listening.

             Buffy walks slowly, silently backward, fading back into the 
             dark, terrified and shocked.

             Lothos turns back and looks at Merrick dead in his hands.  
             Disgusted, he lets him drop.

                                       LOTHOS
                            Fool.

             He looks at the blood on his fingers.  After a moment, he tastes 
             it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             EXT. STREET  (LATER)

             Pike is standing by the trees where Buffy stood before, looking 
             out into the street.

             PIKE'S POV

             The same angle as Buffy's, before.  Now Lothos is gone.  Buffy 
             is kneeling quietly by Merrick, holding his head in her lap.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             EXT. A WOOD - JUST BEFORE DAWN

             Through the dark mist Buffy appears, carrying Merrick's body 
             in her arms.  She is alone.  She does not stop.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             EXT. GRAVEYARD - MORNING

             On the outskirts of the graveyard, Buffy finishes filling in 
             Merrick's grave under an old tree.  She is still wearing her 
             cheerleader outfit, now caked with dirt.  She stands at the 
             foot of the grave, tries to think of a prayer.

                                       BUFFY
                            Ummm, our Father, Who art in Heaven, 
                            duhmm... hallowed be Thy name.  
                            Uhh, kingdom come, daily break, I 
                            don't know.  I don't even know if 
                            you're religious.  You probably 
                            are.  But you're dead, you know.  
                            You're just totally dead.  and...

             She sits heavily on his grave.

                                       BUFFY
                                (continuing)
                            ... and I don't know what to do.  
                            You were the one who... I don't 
                            know if the training was over.  I 
                            don't even know if I passed.  You're 
                            so stupid!  How could you be so 
                            stupid?  What am I supposed to do 
                            without you?  You son of a bitch!

             She stops, looks down for a moment.

                                       BUFFY
                                (continuing)
                            Amen.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. ZEPH'S AUTO REPAIR - DAY

             Pike is at work on a contraption.  Built out of scraps and 
             parts, it is the beginnings of a cartridge-load crossbow.  
             Zeph watches, behind him.

                                       ZEPH
                            Hah, I'd knew you'd be back.  Didn't 
                            I say you'd be back?  Ha, ha, ha!  
                            You're sitting in your old car saying 
                            'Nope, I'm never coming back.'  
                            Hee, Hee!  Like you got anywhere to 
                            go.  'I'm never coming back'  But I 
                            knew you would.  Birds got to return 
                            to the nest sooner or later.  That's 
                            what I said.  Just like I told you...

             Pike pays no attention to this babbling monologue.  Over the 
             course of it he takes a slim, handmade wooden shaft, slightly 
             thicker than an arrow, and rubs it with garlic.  He places it 
             in the crossbow, take aim in front of him.  He fires into the 
             tire of a truck.  The tire pops flat.  Zeph cracks up.

                                       ZEPH
                                (continuing)
                            Hah!  Shot the damn tire, dumbass, 
                            didn't even look, just going around 
                            shooting things, popped it flat, ya 
                            bonehead.

             Pike, still not listening, continues to work.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. GYM - DAY

             We see a banner stretched across the central beam of the 
             ceiling.  It reads "THE EARTH IS OUR HOME".  A half dozen 
             inflatable globes dangle from the ceiling.  Nicole and Kimberly 
             are stetting up the drinks table, unloading and stacking 
             hundreds of styrofoam cups.  Jennifer crosses by them, carrying 
             an armful of plastic wrappings and containers.

                                       JENNIFER
                            I got all the plastic stuff.  What 
                            should I do with it?

                                       KIMBERLY
                                ("you idiot")
                            Throw it out.

             Jennifer crosses out as the two resume their conversation.

                                       NICOLE
                            I really was way way too too.

                                       KIMBERLY
                            Oh, please!  When she ran onto the 
                            field in the middle of the game?  
                            Was that the most out-of-it thing 
                            ever, or did I blink?

                                       NICOLE
                            I'm, like, yelling at her, 'What 
                            are you doing?'  And she's going 
                            'Jeffrey, Jeffrey!'  Way mental.

             They laugh.  Jennifer is the first to see Buffy walk in, looking 
             cleaned-up but still ragged.  They stop laughing.

                                       JENNIFER
                            Hi, Buffy.

                            Buffy, what is your sitch?  You're 
                            acting like The Thing From Another 
                            Tax-Bracket; it's too weird.

                            I need to tell you.  You see... a

                            Oh my God you're having an affair.

                                       NICOLE
                            Cool!

                                       JENNIFER
                            Does Jeffrey know?

                                       BUFFY
                            It's not that at all.  This is an 
                            old guy, he's like fifty.

                                       KIMBERLY/NICOLE
                            Eeyuu.

                                       BUFFY
                            No, no.  Listen.  Haven't you guys 
                            noticed how weird things have gotten 
                            around here?  Like, people 
                            disappearing, people turning up 
                            dead...

                                       NICOLE
                            What are you talking about?

                                       KIMBERLY
                            Weird?  You mean like you hanging 
                            out with that homeless, Poke?  I 
                            saw you last night after the game.

                                       BUFFY
                            Pike.

                                       NICOLE
                            You're having a fling with him?

                                       JENNIFER
                            He doesn't look fifty.

                                       BUFFY
                            Guys.  Guys!  Reality pulled out of 
                            her five minutes ago.

                                       KIMBERLY
                            Oh, thank you very much.

                                       NICOLE
                            Like you've got a grip.

                                       KIMBERLY
                            You're so out of it.  You've blown 
                            off cheerleading, you've blown off 
                            dance committee --

                                       BUFFY
                            Excuse me for having something 
                            important to do.

                                       KIMBERLY
                            This isn't important?  The earth is 
                            our home.

                                       BUFFY
                            Kimberly, it's a dance.  It's a 
                            stupid dance with a bunch of stupid 
                            kids that I see every stupid day.

                                       NICOLE
                            So, we're stupid now?

                                       KIMBERLY
                            You know, just because you're having 
                            full-on wiggans doesn't mean you 
                            have to drag us into it.  This isn't 
                            just any dance.  It happens ot be 
                            the last dance of our last year.

                                       NICOLE
                            Except for Prom.

                                       KIMBERLY
                            Right.

                                       JENNIFER
                            And Spring Fling.

                                       KIMBERLY
                            Okay.

                                       NICOLE
                            And the January Semi-formal --

                                       KIMBERLY
                            Okay!  Look, Buffy.  You want to 
                            play house with the unwashed masses, 
                            that's fine.  But personally, I 
                            think you ought to spend a little 
                            time prioritizing.  I really do.

                                       BUFFY
                            Listen to you.  What language are 
                            you speaking?

                                       KIMBERLY
                            Get out of my facial.

             She storms out.

                                       NICOLE
                            Well, I guess you got what you came 
                            for.

                                       BUFFY
                            Nicole...

                                       NICOLE
                            Later for it.

             She also leaves, with Jennifer.  Buffy stands alone in the 
             room, small amidst the streamers.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. BUFFY'S KITCHEN - EVENING

             Buffy stands at the sink, rinsing a glass for way too long, 
             staring.  Her mother breezes THROUGH THE FRAME.

                                       BUFFY'S MOM
                            Dinner's in the fridge, stay away 
                            from the Jag, we'll be back by 
                            twelve.

             She stops, seems to notice something about Buffy.

                                       BUFFY'S MOM
                                (continuing)
                            Buffy, honey?

                                       BUFFY
                                (wanting to talk)
                            Yeah?

                                       BUFFY'S MOM
                            Have you gained a few pounds?  Maybe 
                            it's that outfit...

                                       BUFFY
                            Maybe.

                                       BUFFY'S MOM
                            What's Bobby gonna say?

                                       BUFFY
                            I don't know, Mom; I've never met 
                            Bobby.

                                       BUFFY'S MOM
                                (laughs)
                            Aren't we the chatty ones.  Kiss 
                            noise.

             And she's out.  Buffy looks at her clothes, herself.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             EXT. MALL PARKING LOT - NIGHT

             Pike drives slowly between the cars.  He sees Buffy walking 
             toward the mall.  He pulls up by her, parks.  Gets out of the 
             car.

                                       PIKE
                            Buffy, hey, I've been looking all 
                            over for you.

             Buffy doesn't stop.  He paces her.

                                       PIKE
                                (continuing)
                            I been working on some stuff for 
                            you.  What'cha doing?

                                       BUFFY
                            I'm going shopping.  Don't try to 
                            stop me.

                                       PIKE
                            Cool.  I could actually use a couple 
                            of Allen wrenches.  What do you 
                            need?

                                       BUFFY
                            A dress.

                                       PIKE
                            Dress, huh?  What for?

                                       BUFFY
                            For the dance.

                                       PIKE
                            Come again?

                                       BUFFY
                            I'm going to the senior dance.

                                       PIKE
                                (charades)
                            Second word... sound like 'dance'.

             She stops.

                                       BUFFY
                            I'm going to the dance.

                                       PIKE
                            What for?

                                       BUFFY
                            In order to dance and to drink punch 
                            and to be with my friends.  
                            Comprende?

                                       PIKE
                            I don't believe this.  The world's 
                            under attack by the legions of the 
                            undead and you're going to a mixer?

                                       BUFFY
                            It's not a mixer.  It's the senior 
                            dance.  And it's important.  You 
                            wouldn't understand.

                                       PIKE
                            You got that right.  I thought you 
                            wanted to kill vampires.

                                       BUFFY
                            I don't want to kill anybody, and I 
                            don't want to talk about it anymore.

                                       PIKE
                            Listen, I know you're bummed about 
                            your friend, and I'm really sorry...

                                       BUFFY
                                (offhand, almost disdainful)
                            He did what he was supposed to.

                                       PIKE
                            But, Buffy, you're the guy, the 
                            chosen guy.

                                       BUFFY
                            Right.  I'm the chosen one.  And I 
                            choose to be shopping.

                                       PIKE
                            I should have known.

             Buffy raises her fist at him; he starts back, involuntarily.

                                       BUFFY
                            Leave me alone.

                                       PIKE
                            Benny was right.  You guys are all 
                            exactly the same.

             Buffy walks away, leaving Pike alone.

                                       PIKE
                                (continuing; calls after 
                                her)
                            I'm not disappointed, I'm just angry.

             As Pike walks off, the camera TILTS UP the lamp post behind 
             them.  Benny is perched upon it.

                                       BUFFY
                            Buffy?  Buffy?

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. BOILER ROOM - NIGHT

             Vampires are gathered around.  Lothos stands with Benny.  Benny 
             is beaming.

                                       LOTHOS
                            Buffy...

             Lothos laughs, long and hard.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. THE MALL - NIGHT

             Buffy looks at dresses, most of them fairly tight and fairly 
             out there.  She holds one in front of her, looks in a mirror.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. ZEPH'S AUTO REPAIR - ANOTHER NIGHT

             Pike sits, fiddling with his crossbow.  Looks out the window, 
             discontented.  Laid out next to him we see wooden shafts, 
             garlic, and a cross.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. BUFFY'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

             Buffy lays her dress on the bed.  We cannot see exactly what 
             it looks like.

             She stuffs some blood-stained clothes into a duffel bag along 
             with some stakes.  She tosses the bag in the closet.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             EXT. THE GYM - PROM NIGHT

             Dozens of limos pull up.  Kids pour inside.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. THE GYM - NIGHT

             The party is underway.  Streamers everywhere, tables by the 
             windows.  Couples dance, a D.J spins the tunes.  There is a 
             setup in one corner for taking prom pictures.  The kids are 
             all very elegant and hip.  Every shade of black is represented.

             ANGLE - PUNCH BOWL

             Nicole and Kimberly stand by the punch bowl, chatting.  They 
             are both wearing slinky little black dresses.

             ANGLE - THE DOOR

             There are two: at one end, leading to the house (it's closed) 
             and one leading outside.  Gary Murray stands by the outside 
             door, on guard, as students enter.  He is looking disdainfully 
             at Andy and holding a flask he has confiscated.

                                       ANDY
                            Well, it came with the tux.

             Buffy enters the gym.  She is wearing a long white strapless 
             gown.  It is lovely, but very conservative for this crowd.  
             Over her shoulder is a purse that goes with the dress.  She 
             enters hesitantly, looking around her for Jeffrey.  She passes 
             Andy, who is moving away from Gary Murray.

                                       ANDY
                            Buffy!  Looking tasty.

                                       BUFFY
                            Thanks.  Have you seen Jeffrey?

             But Andy has moved on.  Buffy works her way through the crowd 
             to the punch bowl, sees Nicole and Kimberly.  They stop 
             whispering real quick.

                                       BUFFY
                                (continuing)
                            Hi, guys.

                                       NICOLE
                            Hi.

                                       BUFFY
                            Have you guys seen Jeffrey?  The 
                            limo never showed, I thought he 
                            might be here.

             Nicole and Kimberly look at each other significantly.

                                       NICOLE
                            I haven't seen him tonight.

                                       BUFFY
                            Oh.

             She picks up a glass of punch.

                                       BUFFY
                                (continuing)
                            I'm glad you guys are here.  It's 
                            good to see you.

                                       KIMBERLY
                                (miss sarcasm)
                            Yeah, whoops I came.

                                       BUFFY
                                (tries again)
                            You look way pretty, Kim.

                                       KIMBERLY
                            I know.  I like your little outfit.

                                       NICOLE
                            It's amazing what you can do with a 
                            parachute and some starch.

                                       KIMBERLY
                            As long as there's room for three 
                            in it.  What, didn't you bring your 
                            new friends?

             Buffy is startled by this attack.  Nicole giggles.

                                       BUFFY
                            I guess you guys are mad at me.  
                            I'm sorry.  I've been really --

             Jeffrey suddenly appears between them.  Jennifer is on his 
             arm.

                                       BUFFY
                                (continuing)
                            Jeffrey!  There you are.  I --

             She stops, as everybody assesses the situation.  Buffy is 
             shocked, doing a slow fade to hurt.  Jeffrey is uncomfortable.  
             Jennifer is apoplectic with embarrassment.  Kimberly is in 
             serious giggle, Nicole a bit more restrained, checking it out.

                                       JEFFREY
                            Buffy, what are you doing here?

                                       BUFFY
                            I thought we were meeting here.

                                       JEFFREY
                            I'm here with Jenny.

             -- who is practically hyperventilating, pulling at his arm 
             like a dog on a leash.

                                       BUFFY
                            I don't understand.

                                       JEFFREY
                            Oh, come on, Buffy.  You know what's 
                            going on.  It's not working out at 
                            all.  I've got to move on.  I mean, 
                            I've got needs, too.  I told you 
                            about all this.

                                       BUFFY
                            No, you didn't.  When?

                                       JEFFREY
                            Didn't you get my message?

                                       BUFFY
                            You broke up with my machine?

                                       JEFFREY
                            You weren't home.  Like always.

                                       BUFFY
                            You left me a message?

                                       JEFFREY
                            I'm out of here.  Jenny.

             At the mention of her name Jenny jumps, and in her haste to 
             get away, she bumps into Buffy's arm, spilling bright red punch 
             on Buffy's chest.  She flees, Jeffrey in tow.  They leave the 
             gym.  Kimberly finds it all pretty funny.  Nicole is silent.

             Buffy turns away, toward the wall.  A soft BALLAD come on over 
             the SPEAKERS.  Tears are forming in Buffy's eyes, as she wipes 
             futilely at her dress.  Finally she turns, looks toward the 
             door.

             BUFFY'S POV

             Pike is there, walking in on his own.  He wears a leather jacket 
             and baggy old tux pants, accented by chains, earring and unlaced 
             Doc Martins.  He looks great.

             He walks directly toward Buffy, and does turn a few heads.

                                       PIKE
                            I crashed your party.

                                       BUFFY
                            Pretty shallow of you.

                                       PIKE
                            That's me.

                                       BUFFY
                            I'm glad you came.

                                       PIKE
                            Yeah, you look like you're having a 
                            swell time.

             Pike picks up a glass of punch as he notices the stain on 
             Buffy's dress.  He looks about him a bit, then without 
             hesitation dumps some punch on his lapel, matching stains.  
             Buffy smiles at him.

                                       PIKE
                                (continuing)
                            Will I get the shit kicked out of 
                            me if I ask you to dance?

                                       BUFFY
                            I don't actually think Jeffrey's 
                            gonna notice.

             They begin slow dancing, not too close.

                                       PIKE
                            Yeah, well, you're the one I'm afraid 
                            of.

             They dance for a while, closer and closer.

                                       PIKE
                                (continuing; gee-whizzically)
                            You know, you're not like the other 
                            girls.

             Buffy pulls him closer, holds him, whispers almost weakly in 
             his ear.

                                       BUFFY
                            Yes, I am.

             We see couples dancing, kissing... Gary Murray watching them.

             ANGLE - KIMBERLY

             Sitting by the window with her bovine date, she watches Buffy 
             dance disdainfully.

                                       KIMBERLY
                            I can't believe it.

             The window SHATTERS by her head, a vampire's hand reaching for 
             her.  She screams, starts back.

             Other windows shatter, vampires appearing all around.  A couple 
             of students run for the inner door but it is locked shut from 
             the other side.

             Gradually the party stops as everybody becomes aware of the 
             situation.  They vaguely herd to the middle of the room.

             ANGLE - BUFFY AND PIKE

             Looking around, assessing the situation.

             ANGLE - OUTER DOOR

             A STUDENT runs staggering in, blood spurting from his neck.

                                       BLOODY STUDENT
                            They're out there!  They're vampires!  
                            God, help me!

             He falls to the ground, a few feet in front of the doorway.  
             Nobody moves for a second.  Then one of the students starts 
             toward the body.

                                       BUFFY
                            Don't go near the door.

             Buffy does instead, checking the lifeless body and listening 
             as a number of figures begin to lumber toward the door through 
             the mist.

             Buffy steps back as three 17-year-old vampire come to the door.

                                       1ST VAMPIRE
                            It's party time.

                                       BUFFY
                            Don't worry!  They can't come in 
                            here.  They can't come in unless 
                            they're invited.

                                       KIMBERLY
                            I already invited them.

             Everyone looks at her.

                                       KIMBERLY
                                (continuing; defensively)
                            They're seniors!

             Pike reaches into an inner pocket and pulls out a number of 
             small stakes he has made, hands them to Buffy.  She opens her 
             purse.

             ANGLE - INSIDE THE PURSE

             Cosmetics, hair spray, etc.  She fits the stakes in.

                                       BUFFY
                            The first thing we should --

                                       1ST VAMPIRE
                            Buffy... You wanna dance?

                                       PIKE
                                (to Buffy)
                            Looks like you're busted.

                                       2ND VAMPIRE
                            We want her!  We want Buffy.  Send 
                            her out.

                                       1ST VAMPIRE
                            Or we come in.

             They fade back, almost out of sight.  Pike looks out the window.  
             More are gathering.

                                       GARY MURRAY
                            All right, everybody stay calm.
                                (to Buffy)
                            What's going on?

                                       PIKE
                            Looks bad, Buffy.

                                       SENIOR GIRL
                            Send her out.

                                       BUFFY
                            What?

                                       KIMBERLY

                            afraid to use them...

             But other students have picked up the cry, are clamoring to 
             sacrifice Buffy.  Pike crosses to his bag, sitting by the door.

             Two guys move toward Buffy, Andy intervenes.  Pike steps in 
             front of Buffy, holding his custom made cartridge-load crossbow.  
             Trains it on the others.  They quiet down.

                                       PIKE
                            There's gotta be a back way out of 
                            here, or something.

             Buffy looks at the partygoers.  Her friends.  They stare back 
             at her, scared, angry.  She looks out the door.  Back at her 
             friends.

                                       BUFFY
                            I'm going out the front.

                                       PIKE
                            Are you nuts, Buffy?  There's a 
                            hundred of them out there.  They'll 
                            rip us apart.

                                       BUFFY
                            You're staying here.
                                (before he can speak)
                            Some of them might not come after 
                            me.  If they don't this place is 
                            gonna turn into a total stain.

                            Buffy, this is crazy.  What do these 
                            guys want?

                                       BUFFY
                            Andy, start breaking up some chairs.  
                            You'll need weapons.

             Andy looks at her a moment, moves off.  Buffy goes to Pike's 
             bag, starts pulling out stakes.

                                       BUFFY
                                (continuing)
                            Good thing one of us was prepared.

                            Buffy, there's no way you're going 
                            out there alone.

             Buffy stands up.  She kisses Pike very hard on the lips.

                                       BUFFY
                            Don't piss me off.

             She kneels down, begins to rip the hem of her dress.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             EXT. OUTSIDE THE GYM - NIGHT

             We see the doorway to the gym.  A mist has risen around the 
             entire house, swirling about the feet of the undead who stand 
             clustered about it.  Some have keen and eager expressions, 
             some vacant, half-conscious with bloodlust.  They wait.

             A figure appears in the doorway, walking slowly out.  Buffy.  
             Her torn dress now comes to just above her knees.  She wears 
             Pike's leather jacket over it.  She wears her purse strapped 
             across her chest under the jacket.  In one hand she holds his 
             crossbow; in her other hand is a cross.  As she steps further 
             away from the doorway, the vampires slowly begin to close around 
             her.

             The door shuts behind her.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. THE GYM - SAME TIME

             Kimberly and some of the others are anxiously barricading the 
             door.  Pike looks out the window after Buffy.

                                       PIKE
                                (to himself)
                            Come on, move.

             EXT. THE GYM - SAME TIME

             The vampires move closer and closer.  They circle her.  She 
             waits, apprehensive.  When they are about eight feet from her 
             she whips out a bottle of Perrier.  She sprays it all around, 
             searing the inner circle.  Screaming, they clutch their faces.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             Others are watching as well.  Andy comes up with some chair-
             made stakes, hands some to Pike.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             EXT. THE GYM - SAME TIME

             Buffy is defending herself in an astounding blur of gymnastics 
             and martial arts.  Leaping, throwing kicks, punches, and the 
             odd stake, she manages to scatter them enough to make a run 
             for it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             Everyone is watching through the windows as the vampires follow 
             after Buffy.

                            It's okay!  I think they're going

             Almost as if it heard that, one of the vampires turns toward 
             the gym, grinning hugely.  It and at least half the others 
             turn back toward the easy pickings inside.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                            Get 'em.

             Andy and some others drag a table forward.  Pike helps hoist 
             it up against the window.  He looks one last time outside, 
             then covers it up.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             Buffy runs.  She heads toward the nearby cluster of school 
             buildings.  Close behind are the undead.  She passes a line of 
             parked cars.

             ANGLE - CAR

             Jeffrey and Jennifer are in the back of his parked BMW, making 
             heated, clumsy love.  We can see them through the window.

                                       JENNIFER
                            Oh, yes!  Yes!

                            woman!

             As they are spouting this nonsense, Buffy zooms IN and OUT OF 
             the FRAME behind the car.  After a second she walks back INTO 
             the FRAME, staring at the two of them.

             Vampires swarm about the car in pursuit of Buffy.

             Jeffrey goes wide-eyed at the sight.  Starts climbing off 
             Jennifer and into the driver's seat.

             Windows and the boards covering them begin to smash inward.  A 
             student pounding in nails is caught, pulled out the window.  A 
             vampire crawling in is spiked by Pike.  Another makes it in 
             and is smashed on the head repeatedly by Andy.  It staggers, 
             smilingly, and turns toward him.

                            The heart!  Stab them in the heart!

             Andy manages to shove the two-by-four in its heart just as it 
             gets its fingers around his throat.

             Kimberly screams.  One of them has hold of her, starts pulling 
             her out the window.  Nicole runs to her, starts pulling the 
             vampire's hands off her.  Suddenly, the vampire grabs Nicole 
             instead.  Off balance, she is almost out the window before 
             Kimberly can react, and all Kim can do is scream.  Andy and 
             Pike make it to the window too late; Nicole is pulled out, and 
             they swarm over her.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             as more approach.

             ANGLE - THE RECORD PLAYER

             A junior vampire has snuck behind it and is going through the 
             records.  He stops, finding one he likes, and starts to put it 
             on.  MUSIC: "Teen Angel".  It wafts over the carnage in the 
             gym, lending it a surreal and dreamy quality.

             Hearing the music, another vampire grabs Kimberly and starts 
             dancing with her.  She screams a lot.

             It's about to plant one on her neck when Pike stabs it in the 
             back.  Pike turns from the dying vampire and is face to face 
             with Benny.

             Pike is frozen for a moment.

             The door is locked.  She smashes it in with her shoulder.  
             Runs inside.

             A few vampires are about to follow Buffy into the building 
             when a hand is suddenly raised before them, stopping the.  
             Slowly they start fading back.

             It is Amilyn.  He smiles at the other vampires, and raises his 
             fingers to his lips.

             Shhhh....

                                                                    CUT TO:

             Pike is slammed down onto it, Benny's face inches from his.  
             "Teen Angel" has been replaced by some hard rock.

                            on the run.

             He hoists Pike up and backhands him in the jaw, sends him flying 
             against a wall.  Pike shakes his head as Benny comes at him 
             again, no longer smiling.

                                       BENNY
                                (continuing)
                            Of course I'm angry!  I leave you 
                            alone for five minutes, and look 
                            who you're hanging out with!

             He turns suddenly and grabs a girl, yells in her face.

                                       BENNY
                                (continuing)
                            I don't want girls with good taste; 
                            I want a girl that tastes good!

             She faints and he drops her, turns back to Pike.  Pike is 
             getting shakily to his feet.  Blood trickles down his forehead.

                                       BENNY
                                (continuing)
                            I was gonna change you, man.  I was 
                            gonna give you life!  Do you know 
                            what that means?

             ANGLE - ANOTHER WINDOW

             Gary Murray, yelling orders at student, holding a board against 
             a window as vampires pound on it.  The exposed part of the 
             window above him shatters, raining glass on his head.

             ANGLE - THE PHOTO SETUP

             A vampire is clutching a helpless girl as another vampire takes 
             their picture with an Instamatic.  He expresses confusion and 
             dismay when his image does not come out in the photo.

             ANGLE - PIKE AND BENNY

             Pike is backing away from Benny, who is approaching him.  Pike 
             passes an overturned table, the stubs of its broken legs 
             sticking up at the ceiling.

                                       BENNY
                            Never die.  Never get kicked around, 
                            never get busted.

             Benny grabs him with hateful force.  His fingers dig into Pike's 
             arms enough to draw blood.

                                       BENNY
                                (continuing)
                            It means never having to say you're 
                            sorry!  And you blow it all off for 
                            that slut?!  What about my needs?!

             Pike suddenly grabs Benny, holds him tightly in a brotherly 
             embrace.  Benny is thrown slightly by this.

             Still holding him, Pike pitches onto the table, driving the 
             leg-shard through Benny's back.  Pike still holds Benny as he 
             twitches and screams, dying.  Finally, he lets go, gets up.  
             He looks a little dazed, a little lost.  A window shattering 
             far behind him pulls his eyes back into focus, and he goes to 
             help.

             ANGLE - KIMBERLY

             Sitting by a wall, tiny and silent amid the carnage.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. HALL - SAME TIME

             Buffy moves quickly along, crouching near a window and peering 
             out.  Nothing.  She looks about her, waiting for an attack.  
             She checks her purse.

             ANGLE - BUFFY'S PURSE

             Cosmetics and hair spray.  A small cross.  No stakes left.

             Muttering under her breath, she moves swiftly into a classroom.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. CLASSROOM - SAME TIME

             Still moving cautiously, she heads for the window and pulls 
             down the shade.  She crouches behind the teacher's desk and 
             pulls the chair down to her, laying it on its side.

                                       BENNY
                                (cattily, to herself)
                            'Ooh, make me a woman, Jeffrey... 
                            oh, Jeffrey, you're so atheletical... 
                            I love you...'

             She slams her elbow down on the chair leg -- very controlled, 
             efficient motion -- and snaps it off.  Looks around to see if 
             anyone is around to hear as she picks up the leg, now a weapon.

             She goes softly to the door, peers cautiously out.

             CLOSEUP - BUFFY

             Looking out.  Amilyn's face appears right next to her, also 
             looking out.

                                       AMILYN
                            All clear?

             Buffy screams, turns, and Amilyn decks her, sends her flying 
             back into the classroom.  The stake flies out of her hand.  It 
             lands on a desk by the window.

             Buffy does not land nearly as well, crashing into a pile of 
             desks and twisting her leg badly.  Amilyn laughs repulsively, 
             advancing.

                                       AMILYN
                            Pleased to meet you!  Won't you 
                            guess my --
                                (kicks her hard)
                            -- name?

                                       BUFFY
                                (defiantly, through the 
                                pain)
                            It wouldn't be 'Dick,' would it?

             He kicks her again.

                                       BUFFY
                                (continuing)
                            'Lefty'?

                                       AMILYN
                            You're a fool, bloodbag.  Die a 
                            fool and go to hell!

             He grabs her by the neck with his one arm and pins her against 
             the wall in the corner.  She reaches for the stake but it is 
             just out of reach.  He is squeezing the life out of her, his 
             face inches from hers.

                                       AMILYN
                                (continuing)
                            The chosen one.  You're just another 
                            bloodbag -- not even fit to die for 
                            the Master.  When will you ever 
                            learn?

             Buffy looks about for succor.

             ANGLE - THE WINDOW SHADE

             Buffy eyes the bottom of the shade, the pull dangling aimlessly.

                                       BUFFY
                                (with difficulty)
                            I do know... one thing...

                                       AMILYN
                            What?

                                       BUFFY
                            I know... what time sunrise is.

             She pulls down hard on the shade pull and lets go.

                                       AMILYN
                            No!

             He turns in horror, letting go of Buffy, trying to catch the 
             shade.  The instant he releases her, Buffy grabs the stake and 
             in one swift motion, buries it in Amilyn's back.

             The shade goes up, flapping loudly as it spins.  It is still 
             pitch black out.  Amilyn stare, wide-eyed and silent, at the 
             night as he dies.

                                       BUFFY
                            It's in about four hours, Dick.

             Amilyn spins, dying rage in his eyes.  He grabs her.  His 
             strength is formidable even as his body begins to smoke.  
             Suddenly screaming, he forces her over suddenly with such power 
             that the two of them go crashing through the floorboards.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. LOTHOS' CHAMBER - SAME TIME

             The two of them fall through the ceiling directly into the 
             blood pool.

             Amilyn's body surfaces first, now just a husk.

             Buffy pops up from the waist-deep blood, soaked and wounded.  
             She stays a moment, breathing hard.  Suddenly her eyes go wide.

                                       BUFFY
                            Oh, god, no... not yet...

             Lothos rises from the pool, smiling.  Buffy is clearly paralyzed 
             by fear.

                                       LOTHOS
                            I knew you'd come.

             He moves toward her.

                                       LOTHOS
                                (continuing)
                            You knew it, too, didn't you?  All 
                            your life, dreaming... waiting to 
                            feed me.

             Buffy is suddenly galvanized into action.  She throws a few 
             punches at Lothos, but he takes them without flinching.  She 
             grabs at the stake in what remains of Amilyn's chest.  Lightning 
             quick, Lothos closes his hand around her and squeezes till the 
             stake splinters and she screams with pain.  He knocks her back 
             on her ass.

             She starts moving backward, away from him, but it is hard enough 
             for her to make her way through the thick gore.  Lothos 
             contemplates Amilyn's corpse, and his face darkens.

                                       LOTHOS
                                (continuing)
                            Ah, my fool is dead.  He was 
                            careless, always.  Still, I'll pull 
                            out your tongue for that.
                                (coming toward her)
                            Don't you understand?  I've killed 
                            you a dozen times.  Your life is 
                            not a blink of my eye, not a single 
                            breath.  I have lived in the shadows, 
                            in the pulsing filth behind men's 
                            eyes.  A thousand years, and more.  
                            I have conversed with the worms 
                            that fed on my corpse and I have 
                            bathed in the blood of emperors.

                                       BUFFY
                                (breaking the spell)
                            Have you ever thrown up in the front 
                            row of a Richard Marx concert?

                                       LOTHOS
                            What?

             And she is up, turning to run.  He is thrown momentarily by 
             her insolence.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. LOTHOS' CHAMBER - THE BOILER ROOM - SAME TIME

             But he is on her the moment she emerges from the chamber, 
             grabbing her by the hair and throwing her to the ground.

                                       LOTHOS
                            You waste time.  That is a sin.

             He kneels over her prostrate body.  She is reaching frantically 
             into her purse.  He runs his hand along her body, a gesture 
             both lustful and disdainful.

                                       LOTHOS
                                (continuing)
                            You're even weaker than the others.

                                       BUFFY
                            I think you've forgotten something.

             She pulls out a small cross, holds it in front of him.  He 
             snarls at it, then grabs it, his hand around her.  The cross 
             bursts into flame.  He holds her hand onto it.

                                       LOTHOS
                            This?  This is you only weapon?  
                            Your puny faith?

                                       BUFFY
                            No...

             With her other hand, Buffy holds up her hair spray.

                                       BUFFY
                                (continuing)
                            ... my keen fashion sense.

             She squeezes it at him, the spray catching fire form the cross 
             and whooshes a jet of flame right into his face.  He screams, 
             letting her go and backing up.  Hey, his head is on fire!

             Buffy turns and hobbles away.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. LOTHOS' CHAMBER - SAME TIME

             Lothos stumbles about, head all aflame, till he finally pitches 
             into the pool.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. LOTHOS' CHAMBER - HALL - SAME TIME

             Buffy comes out of the boiler room and hobbles along, moving 
             as fast as she can.

                                       BUFFY
                            This is the suckiest party I have 
                            ever been to.  It's not even a 
                            contest.

             She reaches a locked door that says "Gymnasium -- Authorized 
             Personnel Only".  Puts her shoulder to it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. LOTHOS' CHAMBER - CLOSEUP ON LOTHOS - SAME TIME

             As he pulls himself out of the pool, we are treated to a good 
             look at his new head.  It is charred and torn almost beyond 
             recognition.  It is so inhuman looking, that we are almost 
             surprised when it screams!

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. LOTHOS' CHAMBER - HALL - SAME TIME

             The SCREAM fills the hall.  Buffy is still working on the heavy 
             metal door.  She turns, wide-eyed, at the SOUND.

                                       BUFFY

             INT. LOTHOS' CHAMBER - LOTHOS' POV - SAME TIME

             We TRACK rapidly through the cave, through the boiler room, 
             the hall.  We're moving much too fast to be running.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. GYM - SAME TIME

             Buffy pulls herself up through a trap door in the corner.  
             Everything stops.  For a moment there is silence.

             Buffy gets shakily up.

                                       KIMBERLY
                            Don't let her in!  Don't let her 
                            in!

             Pike and the others see her.  Pike and Andy run to her to help.

                                       KIMBERLY
                                (continuing)
                            They'll kill us!  Get her out!

             Gary Murray stops in front of Kimberly, takes her face in his 
             hand and lightly pops the back of her head against the wall.  
             Cross-eyed, she slides back down into comatic silence.

                                       PIKE
                            Are you okay?

                                       BUFFY
                            Get away from me!

             She pushes them away.  Lothos crashes through the trap door 
             behind her, ugly and crazed.  He picks her up, floating a good 
             two feet off the ground.

                                       LOTHOS
                            You bitch!

             He hurls her the length of the room.  She hits a locker, which 
             opens, spilling out someone's notebook.  The binder falls open, 
             inside it is a plastic pen case with pens and pencils within.

             Buffy looks, by this time, like shit.  She props herself up as 
             best she can, looks about her.  There is nothing wooden, nothing 
             sharp, within reach.

                                       LOTHOS
                                (continuing)
                            You would challenge me?

             Andy charges Lothos from behind.  Pike tries to stop him, but 
             is too late, as Lothos grabs him by the face without even 
             looking at him.

                                       LOTHOS
                                (continuing; to Buffy)
                            I'll rip the flesh from your stinking 
                            bones!

             Squeeze Andy's head until we hear something crack.  Lets him 
             drop.  Looks around at the cowed students.

                                       LOTHOS
                                (continuing)
                            I am a God!  A God!

                                       BUFFY
                            I am so sure.

             Lothos roars.  Furious, he charges Buffy, his feet just skimming 
             the ground, racing toward her, violently fast, upon her...

             She spins, on her feet in a flash, one quick motion.  She 
             thrusts her palm forward and stops him, cold, like Superman 
             stopping a train, palm at his chest.

             Silence.  Buffy looks directly into his eyes, the mad rictus 
             of his face.

             Lothos stops, almost wide-eyed, as he looks down at his chest.

             Sticking out of the middle of his chest is a small eraser, and 
             a #2.

             He steps back, staring at Buffy.  The expression on his horrible 
             face seems to have changed to one almost of respect.  Her look 
             is unfathomable.

             Lothos smiles, graciously.

                                       LOTHOS
                            It doesn't... hurt... as much as I 
                            had imagined.

             He falls gently to the ground.  He's dust before he hits it.

             Silence.  One by one the vampires, stricken, slip out into the 
             night.

             ANGLE - PIKE

             Kneeling by Andy's body.  He gets up, and walks toward what's 
             left of Lothos, warily keeping his eye on the spot.  In the 
             background we see Gary Murray, running out after a vampire.

                                       GARY MURRAY
                            Just a minute, you!  I'm not finished 
                            with you!

             Pike kneels by the pile of dust with a pencil in it.

             Everybody is looking at Buffy.  She stares back at the students 
             who cast her out.  Turns and walks out.  Pike follows her.

             EXT. THE SCHOOL - EARLY MORNING

             We see the direct aftermath; the gym, police cars, people 
             helping the wounded.  Over this is the voice of a reporter.

                                       REPORTER (V.O.)
                            The death toll now reaches twelve 
                            and a half in the tragedy of Hemery 
                            High School.  It was at the Senior 
                            Prom five days ago that the school 
                            was beset by a roving gang of crack-
                            crazed gunmen.  Survivors say some 
                            two hundred of the ruffians laid 
                            the school gym under a kind of siege, 
                            claiming several lives in the 
                            process.  Said one administrator, 
                            'Things here will never be the same.'

                                                                    CUT TO:

             SHOT FROM ABOVE, the blue water FILLING THE SCREEN.  Kimberly 
             dives gracefully into it, comes up on the other side.

             EXT. KIMBERLY'S BACKYARD - DAY

             Kim climbs out and joins Jeffrey, Jennifer and a boy and girl 
             we don't know.  They are all in bathing gear, with fluorescent 
             zinc on their noses.

                                       JENNIFER
                            She was even crazier after that.  I 
                            mean it, you wouldn't even have 
                            recognized her.

                                       KIMBERLY
                            Buffy?

             Jennifer nods.  Kimberly wrinkles her nose in distaste.

                                       JENNIFER
                            She didn't even hardly talk to anyone 
                            in school.  All year.  She didn't 
                            even go to the prom.

                                       JEFFREY
                            I heard she got straight A's.

             Jennifer glares at him.

                                       JEFFREY
                                (continuing)
                            That's what I heard.

                                       KIMBERLY
                            The worst is, her parents -- this 
                            is true -- her parents were gonna 
                            send her to the Bahamas for 
                            graduation, and she refused.  True 
                            story.  She said she didn't want to 
                            go.  It is to vomit.

                                       BOY
                            Well, where is she now?

             EXT. A COURTYARD - LATE EVENING

             Buffy and Pike are walking up the elaborate stone drive toward 
             us.  We can't really tell where they are, but there are trees, 
             hills in the background.

             Buffy leads the way.  She is confident, at ease.  She wears a 
             large old sports jacket, a baseball cap pulled backward.  Skirt 
             and sneakers.  Casual, cool, but disarming.  She carries a 
             knapsack.

                                       PIKE
                            I didn't say it was a bad idea, I 
                            just said the timing was off.  We 
                            could maybe wait till later.

                                       BUFFY
                            Don't be such a fraidy-cat.

                                       PIKE
                            Who's afraid?  Besides me, I mean.

                                       BUFFY
                            We've come all this way.  We just 
                            have to check it out.  I got a hunch.

                                       PIKE
                            You're the boss, boss.  I just 
                            thought maybe we should wait.

             Buffy stops at a large, elaborately carved door.  She turns to 
             Pike.

                                       BUFFY
                            Trust me.

             ANGLE - DOOR KNOCKER

             Buffy grabs the large metal knocker, ringed through a gargoyle's 
             mouth.

             And on the boom of the knocker, we see:

             WIDER ANGLE - THE CASTLE

             The castle.  Archetypal, turreted, terrifying.  Standing lonely 
             on the craggy hill, drenched in the light of the rising moon.

                                                                 BLACK OUT.

             FADE IN:

             EXT. MEDIEVAL VILLAGE - JUST BEFORE SUNSET

             We see an Italian village at the height of the plague.  Funeral 
             processions, decrepit houses with their windows boarded up...  
             the stench of death all around.

             TITLE:  EUROPE. THE DARK AGES

             Through the filth a KNIGHT walks his horse.  He is weary but 
             not so dingy as his surrounding; a stranger in these parts.  
             He comes to an inn, where a boy takes his horse round back.  
             He enters the inn.

             INT. INN - SAME TIME

             The inn is dark and almost empty.  A couple of patrons drink 
             silently at tables.  Behind the bar stands a slovenly BARMAID, 
             dark-haired and lazy.  She scratches at her shoulder, on which 
             we see a birthmark.  The knight approaches the bar, throws 
             money down.

                                       KNIGHT
                            A tankard of ale, wench.

             The barmaid pours him a cup of ale.  He drinks deep, stands a 
             moment.

                                       KNIGHT
                                (continuing)
                            Some plague we're having, huh?

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. INN - UPSTAIRS HALL/BEDROOM - NIGHT

             The barmaid leads the knight, by candlelight, upstairs to his 
             room.  The door opens inward.  The knight stands in the doorway, 
             places a hand on the barmaid's hip.  She pauses a moment, then 
             breaks free of his grasp, starts down the hall.  He laughs a 
             bit, resignedly, and closes the door.

             A VAMPIRE stands behind it.  Not two feet from the knight, 
             grinning at him.  His eyes are skull-hollow and dancing in his 
             head, his bloody smile full with teeth.  His skin is gray, and 
             peeling.  The knight turns slowly and sees him.

                                       KNIGHT
                            Oh, my god...

             The vampire licks his lips.

             He is on the knight in a second, pushing him backwards into 
             the middle of the small room.  The knight struggles but is no 
             match for the vampire, who buries his face in the knight's 
             neck.  The knight screams.

             ANGLE ON DOOR

             It suddenly flies open, the lock shattered.

             The vampire turns like a frightened animal.  In the doorway 
             stands the barmaid, a SLAYER.  In her hand is a wooden stake.

             The vampire drops the knight, who crabs backwards into a corner.  
             The Slayer and the vampire come at each other.  The Slayer 
             spins and kicks; the vampire flies back.  Snarling, he comes 
             back at the slayer.  They struggle; he slips free and is out 
             the door.

             For a moment, the Slayer remains still, crouched on the floor.  
             The knight watches her.  She seems to be making a decision -- 
             perhaps even knows what is going to happen.

             She runs at the window.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             EXT. IN FRONT OF THE INN - SAME TIME

             The vampire comes running out the front door.  Before he is a 
             few feet from the front of the inn, the Slayer SMASHES through 
             the upstairs window and lands on him.  They both hit the ground, 
             and she plants the stake right in his heart.

             After a moment, we hear a voice:

                                       AMILYN (O.S.)
                            The lord giveth, and the lord taketh 
                            away.  Ashes, ashes...

             She looks up.

                                       AMILYN
                                (continuing)
                            ... All fall down

             There are ten or more vampires walking slowly toward her in 
             the otherwise deserted street.  At the front, maybe ten feet 
             away, is AMILYN.

             Amilyn is a grinning jackal, a servant to the Vampire-King.  
             His garb is a rotted approximation of a courtier's livery.  He 
             ambles toward the Slayer, giggling, as she stands.

             Behind her is LOTHOS, the Vampire-King.  His skin is deep white, 
             and smooth.  He wears a long coat -- his dress is not of any 
             era.  He is practically upon her before he speaks.

                                       LOTHOS
                            You must forgive Amilyn.  He tends 
                            to drool before supper.

             She turns.  He smiles, almost lovingly.

                                       SLAYER
                            Lothos...

                                       LOTHOS
                            You people will never learn.

             She swings at him but he grabs her arm.  Amilyn laughs 
             obnoxiously.  Lothos grabs the back of the Slayer's head, brings 
             her to him in a loving embrace.

                                       LOTHOS
                                (continuing)
                            We can't be stopped.  This is our 
                            world now.

             He pulls her head back swiftly, snapping her spine as her head 
             hits the back of her legs.  Lightning flashes.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. ENGLISH CASTLE - NIGHT

             Lightning flashes outside the window.  It is torrenting rain.  
             An old MAN speaks to a hysterical GIRL of sixteen or so.  They 
             are both obviously noble of birth.

                                       GIRL
                            I can't!

                                       MAN
                            You know you must.  There is only 
                            one.  Now you are that one.  It is 
                            time.

                                       GIRL
                            Why?  Why me?

                                       MAN
                            She has died.  You are the next to 
                            be called.  Why do you think you 
                            were sent to me?  Trained as you 
                            were?  You bear the mark.

             He pulls aside her blouse to reveal a birthmark on her shoulder, 
             identical to the barmaid's.

                                       MAN
                                (continuing)
                            The mark of the Coven.

                                       GIRL
                            I don't understand.

                                       MAN
                            Ever since Adam and Eve first left 
                            the garden, he followed: the serpent.  
                            Satan.  He sends his legion in the 
                            shape of men, to feed on us, to 
                            breed his Hell on our earth.  They 
                            are a plague upon us.

             The man unravels a satchel of cloth.  From it he pulls an 
             elaborately carved wooden stake.

                                       MAN
                                (continuing)
                            But as long as there have been 
                            vampire, there has been the Coven; 
                            the line of Slayers.  Ones with the 
                            strength and the skill to kill them, 
                            to find them where they gather and 
                            stop the swell of their numbers.  
                            One dies, the next is called.

                                       GIRL
                            I'm just a girl.

                                       MAN
                            You are much more.

             He hands her the stake.  She feels the fit.

                                       MAN
                                (continuing)
                            One dies, the next is called...

             As she grips the stake more tightly, an awareness and sense of 
             power sees to fill her.  She lifts the stake over her head.

             CLOSEUP - A HAND

             The hand is lifted high, but it is not the girl's.  It holds 
             not a stake, but a pom-pom.

             EXT. HEMERY HIGH FOOTBALL FIELD - WIDER SHOT - DAY

             Opening CREDITS OVER:

             A football game in progress.  The stands are pretty full, the 
             crowd enthusiastic.  The hemery football stadium is just that; 
             a real stadium, not just makeshift stands on grass.

             On  the sidelines are the Hemery cheerleaders, led by BUFFY. 
             She is blonde (in nature as in name), pretty, and very 
             gracefully athletic.  She obviously enjoys what she is doing, 
             and she's good at it.

             With her on the squad are JENNIFER and NICOLE, two of her best 
             friends.  Beside them the COACH, yelling at the players.  The 
             scoreboard reads HEMERY VS. SETON.

             On the field are JEFFREY, wide receiver (and Buffy's boyfriend), 
             ANDY, quarterback, and GRUELLER, the huge left tackle.

             Buffy and the crowd wince as Andy is sacked for a nine-yard 
             loss.

                                       COACH
                            Come on, do the play!  The one 
                            where...  the one from the book!  
                            Where you make it go forward!

             The players huddle.

                                       ANDY
                            All right, guys, come on!

             He hits Grueller's helmet.

                                       ANDY
                                (continuing)
                            Grueller!  Fill that hole!  They 
                            were all over me!  Okay.  Let's run 
                            twenty-two.  Grueller, close the 
                            pocket, watch out for thirty-five.  
                            Thompson, run the post, right, wide 
                            out.  Jeffrey, go up the middle and 
                            run around like a chicken.

             They clap and break.  As they line up, Jeffrey looks over at 
             Buffy.  She smiles at him.  He winks, very suave.

                                       BUFFY AND CHEERLEADERS
                            Jeffrey!  Jeffrey! 
                            He's our man!  
                            If he can't do it 
                            We don't want it!

             On the hike, Andy drops back and looks for a receiver.  Jeffrey 
             runs in circles like an idiot (and not unlike a chicken), waving 
             his arms until Andy sails him the ball and he breaks for a 
             touchdown.

             The crowd goes wild -- particularly Buffy, who does an 
             impressive standing backflip.  Nicole looks at her, impressed.  
             Buffy smiles at her, giddy.

                                       COACH
                                (looking around)
                            Is that good?  Was that a good thing?

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. THE MALL - AFTERNOON

             The mall is typically busy.  Buffy, Nicole, Jennifer and 
             KIMBERLY can bee seen making their way through it.  They are 
             all dressed very similarly:  bright colors, a lot of white and 
             pink.  Not trashy, but mainstream and uninspired.  Esprit.  
             All of them carry shopping bags; they've done a good days work.

             TITLE:  CALIFORNIA. THE LITE AGES

             The girls pass by stores, vaguely window shopping.

                                       BUFFY
                            Mr. Howard is so heinous.  He's 
                            always giving me a hard time.  I 
                            get a C-plus on the test and he 
                            tells me, 'You have no sense of 
                            history.'  I have no sense of 
                            history?  He wears a brown tie.

                                       NICOLE
                            You got a C-plus?  I can't believe 
                            I cheated off you.

                                       BUFFY
                            Excuse me for not knowing about El 
                            Salvador.  Like I'm ever going to 
                            Spain anyway.  Ooh!

             A dress on a rack outside a store has caught her eye.  She 
             takes it and holds it in front of her.

                                       BUFFY
                                (continuing)
                            Mmmm.  Wouldn't I look just edible 
                            and nutritious in this?

             Kimberly and Jennifer catch up to them.

                                       KIMBERLY
                            Guys, what's the sitch?  I'm bored.

                                       BUFFY
                                (modeling the dress for 
                                Kimberly))
                            What do you think?

                                       KIMBERLY
                            Please.  It's so '91.

                                       GIRL
                            Oh.

             Buffy puts it back.

                                       KIMBERLY
                            What are we doing?

                                       BUFFY
                            Why don't we see a movie?

                                       KIMBERLY
                            Well, where?

                                       JENNIFER
                            Omniplex?

                                       NICOLE
                            Nee sitch.  No way.

                                       BUFFY
                            No THX.

                                       NICOLE
                            They don't even have Dolby.

                                       KIMBERLY
                            Beverly Center.

                                       BUFFY
                            Please.  They show previews for 
                            foreign movies.

                                       NICOLE
                            AMC?

                                       KIMBERLY/BUFFY
                            Bogus corn!

                                       KIMBERLY
                            Totally stale.  And the ushers are 
                            like, the acne patrol.  We're 
                            thinking Pavilion.  Sitch?

                                       BUFFY
                            Sounds toasty.  We're going Pavilion.

                                       JENNIFER
                            Excellent.

                                       BUFFY
                            What's playing there?

             A stranger, walking the other way, bumps into Buffy, doesn't 
             stop.  A man of about fifty, he is dressed shabbily, in a 
             wrinkled black suit and a black shirt.  He somewhat resembles 
             a priest.

                                       BUFFY
                                (continuing)
                            Excuse much!  Not rude or anything.

                                       KIMBERLY
                                (calling back)
                            Nice ensemble!

                                       NICOLE
                            What a homeless.

             The girls continue walking.  The man stops, turns to stare 
             after them.  His look is intense, slightly worried, his face 
             somewhat haggard.  Intelligence shines through his eyes.  He 
             holds himself stiffly, arms close to him, almost as if he 
             expected something to strike at him.

             This is MERRICK.  He pulls a picture out of his coat pocket, 
             looks at it.  Looks at them.

             INT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY

             The film is in progress.  This has no effect on the girls, 
             however, as they continue to talk ceaselessly.  They all have 
             diet sodas.

                                       NICOLE
                                (to Buffy)
                            So, is Jeffrey really spending the 
                            night at your house?

                                       BUFFY
                            That's the plan.

                            Your parents are always going away 
                            for the weekend.  You're so lucky.

                                       BUFFY
                                (maybe not)
                            Yeah, I guess.

                            My mom doesn't go anywhere.  She 
                            even does the shopping network.

                            What did Jeffrey's dad say?

                                       BUFFY
                            'Just remember you're in training, 
                            son'

                            Oh, God.

                            He is so bald.

             Seated a few rows behind the girls are PIKE and BENNY.  The 
             are fairly punked out, (and not currently attending high 
             school).  Pike is long and lean, has short hair spiked and a 
             taste for long coats and black.  Benny is somewhat stockier, 
             opts for a shaved head and suspenders.  Doc Martins for both.  
             Benny is clearly the more belligerent of the two -- when Pike 
             speaks, it's with surprising wit and reserve.  Sometimes.

                                       PIKE
                            Will you guys shut up, please?

                                       BUFFY
                            It could happen.

             Pike and Benny throw popcorn at her.

                                       PIKE
                            Booo!

                                       BENNY
                            Suck!

                            Wrong answer!  No prize.

                            Like we don't have rights too?

                                       BUFFY
                            Ignore them.

                                       BENNY
                            I can't believe these people.  We 
                            paid money to see this.

                                       PIKE
                            No, we didn't.

                                       BENNY
                            Oh, yeah.  But I still want to know 
                            what happens.

                                       BUFFY
                            Everyone get horribly killed except 
                            the blonde girl in the nightie, who 
                            finally kills the monster with a 
                            machete but it's not really dead.

             The boys stare at her.

                                       JENNIFER
                            Oh, my God.  Is that true?

                                       BUFFY
                            Probably.  What movie is this?

                                                                    CUT TO:

             ANGLE - THE MOON

             Fat and yellow, behind the clouds.  We hear a long HOWL.

             EXT. THE MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT

             Jeffrey pulls into the parking lot in his BMW convertible.  
             Grueller, howling, sits in the back behind Jeffrey and Andy.  
             They park and hop out, head toward the entrance.

                                       GRUELLER
                            Look at that moon!  It's huge!  
                            Come on, guys, we gotta do something 
                            tonight.  Party.

                                       ANDY
                            You know, if you would spend more 
                            time at home sleeping, you would 
                            spend less time on the field, 
                            sucking.

                                       JEFFREY
                            You were a bone out there today.  
                            Anyway, I'm booked.  Gonna spend 
                            some quality time with the little 
                            woman.

                                       ANDY AND GRUELLER
                                (coughing it into their 
                                hands)
                            Pussy-whipped.  Pussy-whipped.

                                       JEFFREY
                            You guys are pathetic.

                                       GRUELLER
                            Later for you, then.  I'm blowing.  
                            Andy, you coming?

                                       ANDY
                            No, I'll hitch a ride with Jeffrey.

                                       GRUELLER
                            Okay.  Later.

                                       ANDY
                            Headbutt!

             Andy and Grueller bring their foreheads together with 
             painstaking slowness, grimacing, and barely tap heads.

                                       ANDY
                                (continuing)
                            Later.

             Grueller walks off, head through a park.

             At the same time, Pike and Benny emerge from the theater.  
             They pass Andy and Jeffrey and the two pairs circle each other, 
             almost growling, eyes locked, before pike and Benny turn and 
             walk off, not quite in the direction Grueller took.  Buffy, 
             Kimberly, Jennifer and Nicole come out right after.  Buffy 
             heads straight for Jeffrey and they kiss massively.

                                       BUFFY
                            Nice game.

                                       ANDY
                            Jeffrey, I don't mean to sound sexist 
                            or anything, but can I borrow her?

                                       BUFFY
                            Andy!

                                       JEFFREY
                            No way.  You'd get her dirty.
                                (off her look)
                            He would, honey.  He's an animal.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             EXT. THE PARK - SAME TIME

             Grueller walks through the trees, enters an enclosed clearing 
             of grass.  He hears something, stops.  Maybe his name, maybe 
             just the BUSHES RUSTLING.  He looks about him, hesitantly.  
             Starts forward, stops again.

                                       GRUELLER
                            Yo!  Who is that?  Don't mess with 
                            me man, I'll rip your head off.

             Nothing.

                                       GRUELLER
                                (continuing)
                            Come on, come out here.  Let's see 
                            what you got.

             RUSTLING.  No one.

                                       GRUELLER
                                (continuing)
                            Forget this.

             He turns on his heel, ready to drop all show and bolt.  WALLY 
             BESSEL is right behind him.

             Wally is a ninth grader, small, nerdy, and recently undead.  
             In marked contrast to the older vampire in the prologue, Wally 
             is freshly undead.  He still has fat on his face; in fact, he 
             looks almost normal from afar.  But his inhuman eyes and his 
             uncommon pallor mark him as a vampire.  And the way he speaks 
             is unearthly.  Hollow, almost detached; repeating phrases 
             sometimes almost as though he had never heard them before.

             He smiles at Grueller.

                                       GRUELLER
                                (continuing)
                            Bessel!  What are you doing here?

                                       WALLY
                            Hi, Grueller.

                                       GRUELLER
                            What are you grinning at?  You think 
                            I was scared?

                                       WALLY
                            Could be.

                                       GRUELLER
                            You think so?

                                       WALLY
                            Could be.

             Grueller grabs Wally by his shirt collar and readily hoists 
             his small body up, Wally's feet dangling two feet off the 
             ground.

                                       GRUELLER
                            Listen, you little worm.  I could 
                            beat your head to a pulp for you, 
                            just like I did last year, you got 
                            that?  You got that?

                                       WALLY
                                (repeating)
                            Got that.

                                       GRUELLER
                            Good.

             He lets Wally go.  Wally remains two feet in the air.  
             Grueller's eyes go wide.

                                       GRUELLER
                                (continuing)
                            What the...

             Wally smiles even more broadly, quietly hissing.  He has long 
             fangs, made somehow more grotesque by the fact that he also 
             has braces.

             Wally's hands vise onto Grueller's head, lightning quick.  
             Grueller screams.

             ANGLE - PIKE AND BENNY

             Crossing a street, turning and listening.

             ANGLE - JEFFREY'S CAR

             Speeding by, everyone packed into it.  Andy howls back at 
             Grueller, mistaking his intent.  He settles back.  The girls 
             are looking at him.

                                       ANDY
                            It's um... you had to be there.

             In the front seat next to Jeffrey, Buffy winces slightly.

                                       JEFFREY
                            You okay?

                                       BUFFY
                            I... yeah, I'm okay.  I'm fine.

             INT. BUFFY'S LIVING ROOM - ANGLE ON TV - NIGHT

             We see another full moon, this one on the TV screen.  "Dracula" 
             is on, Lugosi's original.

             The lights are off in the living room as Jeffrey enters from 
             the kitchen, sits down on the couch holding a bag of munchies.  
             Buffy is still in the kitchen, making corn.  Jeffrey flicks 
             the remote, changes channels.

             ANGLE - THE TV

             The movie is replaced by the local news, in mid-broadcast.  A 
             NEWSCASTER sits at his deck, a super of a teenage girl behind 
             him.

                            was not available for comment, but 
                            a police spokesman issued a 
                            statement, saying that the situation 
                            is not out of hand...

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME

             Buffy's FATHER walks purposefully into the kitchen holding a 
             suitcase that he plops by the front door.  He crosses out again 
             as Buffy's MOM crosses in, also with luggage.

                            We're gonna be late.  I knew it.

                                at her)
                            Now, we'll be back on Sunday, 
                            number's on the fridge, don't drive 
                            the Jaguar and tell Consuela my 
                            underwear does not go in the 
                            dishwasher.

             She's already out again by the end of this, as dad comes back 
             in.

                                       BUFFY'S DAD
                            Have fun be good stay away from the 
                            Jag.

                                       BUFFY
                            I know.

             And he's out the back, mom entering on his heels.

                                       BUFFY'S MOM
                            Well, that's everything.  Kiss noise.

             She actually makes a kiss noise at her daughter.

                                       BUFFY
                            'Bye.

             Buffy's mom heads out the door as Buffy heads into the living 
             room.

             INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

                                       BUFFY'S MOM
                                (calling out)
                            Bye-bye, Bobby!

                                       JEFFREY
                            Bye!
                                (to Buffy)
                            They think my name's Bobby?

                                       BUFFY
                            Well... it's possible they think my 
                            name's Bobby.

                                       JEFFREY
                            Real 'quality-timers,' Hugh.

                                       BUFFY
                            Something like that.

                                       JEFFREY
                            Hey, it works for me.  If they want 
                            to leave you alone in the house, 
                            all helpless and vulnerable...

             Buffy sits, squints disapprovingly at the screen.  She has a 
             bag of microwave lite popcorn and is spraying diet butter 
             substitute on it.

                                       BUFFY
                            What show is this?

                                       JEFFREY
                            It's the news, Buffy.

                                       BUFFY
                            Oh.  Who's in it?
                                (off his look)
                            I know what it is.  It's what's on 
                            instead of the movie.

                                       JEFFREY
                            I just want to see the basketball 
                            scores.  It's important.

                                       BUFFY
                                (over a handful of popcorn)
                            Mmmnkay.

             Jeffrey leans in toward her.

                                       JEFFREY
                            Of course, there are... other 
                            considerations...

             He starts kissing her about the face and neck.  She leans 
             submissively back on the couch as he works his way on top of 
             her.  He gives her a long kiss on the mouth, then works over 
             to her ear.  As he is burrowing about in there, Buffy sneaks 
             another handful of popcorn into her mouth.

             She leans back, by accident, on the remote.

             ANGLE - THE TV

             "Dracula" reappears.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. 18TH CENTURY CHINESE WHOREHOUSE - NIGHT

             Not, by any stretch, an upscale joint.  Dark, cramped, and 
             scummy.  A young Chinese Whore sits on a bed, wearing little 
             enough that we can see the telltale birthmark on her shoulder.  
             A repulsive British SAILOR is dressing, his business finished.  
             Looking disgusted, he throws his payment on the bed.  For some 
             reason, the bed is littered with popcorn.

                                       SAILOR
                            You never touched my heart.

             He leaves.  Alone, the Girl hears a NOISE in the dark corner, 
             a wet RUSTLING.  Slowly she gets up to see.  Approaches...

             It is a pool of blood.  She stares at it, terrified.  A hand 
             reaches out of it.

             She runs out into the hall, but it leads nowhere but a dead 
             end.  Standing there, waiting for her, is Lothos.  He smiles 
             at her and we see she is now Buffy.

                                       LOTHOS
                            Soon.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. BUFFY'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

             Buffy is thrashing in bed.  Jeffrey is holding her by the 
             shoulders and shaking her.

                                       JEFFREY
                            Buffy!  Hey, what's the sitch?!?  
                            Wake up!

             She wakes, grasping, her eyes melting into focus on Jeffrey's 
             face.

                                       BUFFY
                            Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.

                                       JEFFREY
                            You were having a nightmare.

             He settles back down, his arms around her, and almost instantly 
             begins to fall asleep again.

                                       JEFFREY
                                (continuing)
                            What'd you dream about?

                                       BUFFY
                            Nothing.

                                       JEFFREY
                            Come on, what was it?

                                       BUFFY
                            Nothing.  It was just a dream.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. LOTHOS' CHAMBER - SAME TIME

             Dark, cavernous -- walls hewn from rock, lit torches clamped 
             to them.  Cold stone floor and in the foreground, a dark pool 
             of blood.  A HUM, possibly a chant, fills the air.

             A figure steps up to the pool, his back to the CAMERA, and 
             kneels before it.  He holds his hand over the surface of the 
             blood.  As he speaks, his voice an urgent hiss, we TRACK AROUND 
             him, see that it is Amilyn.

                                       AMILYN
                            You have brought us here, and we 
                            thrive.  We thrive.  You will awake 
                            in a new world.  Just as I promised, 
                            untold splendor, rubies dripping 
                            from our lips.  Just as we said.

             CLOSEUP - AMILYN'S HAND

             A hand shoots out of the pool and grabs Amilyn's.  Amilyn leans 
             over and fervently kisses it.

                                       AMILYN

             EXT. SCHOOL YARD - DAY

             Buffy sits with Nicole, Jennifer, Kimberly and CASSANDRA.  
             Cassandra is not quite in the same league as the other girls -- 
             for one thing, she studies.  She's not as glamorous, nor a 
             vacuous.

                                       BUFFY
                            The environment.

                            Oh, please.

                            Are there any good sicknesses that 
                            aren't too depressing?

                                       BUFFY
                            Guys.  The environment.  I'm telling 
                            you, it's totally key.  The earth 
                            is in terrible shape, we could al 
                            die, and besides, Sting's doing it.

                            I thought he was doing Indians.

             Jeffrey and Andy arrive, sit.  Jeffrey straddles Buffy from 
             behind, wrapping his arms around her.  She snuggles in his 
             grasp.

                            my suggestion.

                                       CASSANDRA
                            It is a pretty crucial subject.

                            See, Cassandra likes it.  Cassandra's

                            Okay.

                                       CASSANDRA
                            So, what are the most immediate 
                            threats to the world environment 
                            right now?

             Cassandra has paper and pen, is poised to make a list of 
             suggestions.  The other all look at each other uncomfortably.  
             Cassandra obviously knows the answer, but regards her friends 
             silently, waiting to see what the come up with.

                                       JEFFREY
                            Well, um... litter?

                            Litter, yeah!

             Everyone but Cassandra is impressed by this.

                            Okay, guys, how about the ozone 
                            layer?

                                       KIMBERLY
                            Oh, yeah!

                                       NICOLE
                            Right!

                                       BUFFY
                            We gotta get rid of that!  That's 
                            right.

             GARY MURRAY, a well meaning but pompous little administrator, 
             come up to the kids.  He's kind of like Charlie Brown:  you 
             always say his whole name.

                                       GARY MURRAY
                            I don't suppose you kids heard the 
                            first bell, did you?  The first 
                            bell was saying, 'Start going to 
                            class, it's time to go to class.'  
                            In about thirty seconds the second 
                            bell is going to be saying, 'Already 
                            be in class.'

                            We're having a very important 
                            discussion here.

                                       GARY MURRAY
                            Why do I have trouble believing 
                            you?

                                       JEFFREY
                            Something from your childhood, maybe?

                                       GARY MURRAY
                            Button it, Kramer.  Classes are 
                            starting.  Be there or beware.

             Gary Murray walks off.

                            He's got a...  What do you call it?  
                            A Napoleonic Code.

                            It's 'cause he's so tiny.

                                       ANDY
                            Yes, but what he lacks in height he 
                            makes up in shortness.

             They get up and start heading to class.

                                       KIMBERLY
                            Let's meet tonight, okay?

                                       BUFFY
                            Where?

                                       KIMBERLY

                            Cool.  We can figure decorations 
                            and stuff.

                                       BUFFY
                            Cassandra, you gotta come, too.

                                       CASSANDRA
                            Can't.  History report.  The Normans 
                            and the Saxons.

                                       BUFFY
                            Bogutude.  Blow it off.

                                       CASSANDRA
                            I really can't.  Besides, it's pretty 
                            interesting.

                                       BUFFY
                                (not harshly)
                            You're weird and I'm afraid of you.  
                            Seriously, Cassandra, there's a lot 
                            cooler things you could be doing 
                            than your homework.

                                       CASSANDRA
                            Like what?

                                       BUFFY
                            Like my homework.

             Buffy smiles, trots off.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             EXT. THE CITY - NIGHT

             We see SHOTS of the deserted city at night.  It's a small, 
             upscale town.  Suburban streets, businesses, and a  few more 
             depressed areas, boarded up houses.  No one is out.  TREES 
             RUSTLE, shadows flicker, but the curling mist is the only 
             visible presence.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. CAFE BLASE - NIGHT

             A classic faux-Fifties L.A. diner.  Pictures of Frankie and 
             Annette, bright lights, those same tired Fifties standards 
             playing on the JUKEBOX.  Buffy, Kimberly, Jennifer and Nicole 
             are sitting at the end of the counter, at the corner.

                                       KIMBERLY
                            I don't see why we have to invite 
                            everyone.

                                       BUFFY
                            Kimberly, it's the senior dance.

                                       NICOLE
                            If we don't invite all the seniors 
                            we can't use the school funds, you 
                            know that.

                                       KIMBERLY
                            Can't they make exceptions?  Maryanne 
                            Heinel?  She's such a scud.  Can't 
                            we have a Maryanne clause?

                                       NICOLE
                            Well, look who's here.

             GIRLS' POV

             Pike and Benny have entered the diner, quite drunk.  As they 
             pass the jukebox, Benny gives it a kick and the music stops.  
             A few people look up, annoyed, as they approach the counter.

                                       WAITRESS
                            Hey!

                                       BENNY
                            The Fifties are over.

                                       PIKE
                                (earnestly)
                            We have to learn to let go.

                                       WAITRESS
                            Don't give me any trouble, okay?

                                       PIKE
                            No trouble.  We just want to eat.

             They sit next to Buffy and begin pooling their money on the 
             counter.  It comes to about $2.50, heavy with pennies.

                                       PIKE
                                (continuing)
                            Come on, come on, fork up the scub.

                                       BENNY
                            That's it, man.  That's the whole 
                            story.

                                       PIKE
                            We're looking at a dog, possible 
                            coffee...

             He digs and produces a quarter from his pocket.

                                       PIKE
                                (continuing)
                            It's coffee.

                                       BENNY
                            Amazing!

                                       KIMBERLY
                                (to the other girls)
                            Smell of booze much.

                                       NICOLE
                            Nice much.

                                       PIKE
                                (to the waitress)
                            Can we have a hot dog, please, medium 
                            rare, and a cup of joe?

                                       BUFFY
                            You guys are thrashed.

                                       JENNIFER
                                (to Buffy)
                            What are you talking to them for?

                                       BENNY
                                (to Buffy)
                            What did you say?

                                       PIKE
                            Yeah, we're drunk.  We're the Drunks.  
                            What's your name?

                                       BUFFY
                            Buffy.

                                       BENNY
                            Figures.

                                       PIKE
                            Do people ever call you 'Buffy the 
                            Buffalo?'  I'm just wondering.

             Buffy gives him a look.

                                       PIKE
                                (continuing)
                            The don't.  You kind of wish they 
                            would, though.

                                       KIMBERLY
                            Wit-tay.

                                       PIKE
                            I'm sorry.  I'm Pike.  This is Benny.

                                       KIMBERLY
                            Pike isn't a name.  It's a fish.

                                       PIKE
                            Hey, wait a minute...

                                       BENNY
                            You're the guys from the movie!

                                       PIKE
                                (good naturedly)
                            We hate you guys!

             The girls all make sad noises, real sarcastic.

                                       PIKE
                                (continuing)
                            You guys were way rude.  It was 
                            shocking.

                                       NICOLE
                            You just snuck in anyway.

                                       PIKE
                            So you have to ruin the movie for 
                            us?  You know, other people have 
                            feelings, too.

                                       KIMBERLY
                            I am so sure.

             The waitress brings the hot do.  Benny takes it out of the bun 
             and holds it over his crotch, phallus-like.

                                       BENNY
                            Hey, Buffy, you hungry?  I got 
                            something for you...

             The other girls look down and shriek.  Buffy looks at Benny, 
             looks at him in the eye.

             ANGLE - BUFFY'S HAND

             It closes silently around the knife at her place.

             Buffy is still looking at Benny, she seems to be hypnotizing 
             him, and maybe even herself.  The NOISE in the diner seems to 
             FADE AWAY for a moment.  Buffy shifts slightly, almost a twitch, 
             and the spell is broken.  The SOUND RETURNS, Buffy looks away, 
             letting go of the knife exactly where it was.

             Benny looks down.  His hot dog has been sliced neatly down to 
             about an inch.  He is shocked.

                                       BENNY
                                (continuing)
                            Hey!  She wasted my dog!

                                       PIKE
                                (smiling)
                            Bummer metaphor.

             Buffy looks off, a little surprised herself.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             EXT. STREET - NIGHT

             Pike and Benny have left the diner and are walking down the 
             street.  Pike produces a bottle of Mezcal from his coat pocket 
             and takes a swig, hand it to Benny.  They continue to pass it 
             back and forth.

                                       BENNY
                            Rich bitches.  They're a plague.  
                            They've gotta be stopped.

                                       PIKE
                            You didn't like them.

                                       BENNY
                            They're all the same!  They're so 
                            stuck up, they're just... they're 
                            not even human.  I hate them.

                                       PIKE
                            Would you sleep with them?

                                       BENNY
                            Yes.  Definitely.  Definitely.  
                            Please, God.

                                       PIKE
                            Well, there it is, isn't it?  You 
                            don't even like them, and you'd 
                            sleep with them.  What's that all 
                            about?

                                       BENNY
                            I got a news flash, man, another 
                            shot of this and I'll have sex with 
                            you.

                                       PIKE
                            Oh, yeah, and then you'll never 
                            call me.

             They continue walking.  A shadowy figure appears behind them, 
             following.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. DINER - NIGHT

             The girls have all finished their sundaes.

                                       NICOLE
                            Come one, that was so weird.

                                       BUFFY
                                (uncomfortable)
                            What, it's not weird.  I just cut 
                            the stupid hot dog in half.

                                       KIMBERLY
                            I can't believe they still ate it.

                                       JENNIFER
                                (to Buffy)
                            Where'd you learn how to do that?

                                       BUFFY
                            I didn't learn... I just... it's 
                            not a big deal.

                                       KIMBERLY
                            Buffy, I'm gonna tell Jeffrey you 
                            were playing with another man's 
                            Hebrew National.

                                       BUFFY
                                (annoyed)
                            Get a boob job.

                                       NICOLE
                            It's like when we took gymnastics 
                            in eighth grade.

             Buffy makes a face.  She doesn't want to hear this story.  We 
             HOLD on her as Nicole tells it.

                                       JENNIFER
                            What happened?

                                       NICOLE
                            Buffy was on the uneven parallels -- 
                            she was really good; coach said she 
                            could have been in the Olympics -- 
                            but she was doing a routine, 
                            spinning, and the beam broke.

                                       JENNIFER
                            You're kidding.

                                       NICOLE
                            Snapped.  Buffy was, you know, on 
                            the upswing, and I swear to God she 
                            went across the room.  Perm over 
                            heels.

                                       JENNIFER
                            Oh, my God!  Ouch!  No wonder you 
                            quit.

                                       NICOLE
                            Well, that's the thing.  She landed 
                            on her feet.  Didn't even sprain a 
                            toe.  And I go up to her and she 
                            turns and looks at me and she's 
                            like this --

             She makes a hyper-intense face.  The others laugh.

                                       NICOLE
                                (continuing)
                            -- like she's gonna kill me.

                                       BUFFY
                            I was just scared is all.

                                       NICOLE
                            No.  It was mondo bizarro.

                                       KIMBERLY
                            Buffy, the ape-woman.

                                       NICOLE
                            Seriously, Buffy.  That look was 
                            way twisted.  What were you thinking 
                            about?

                                                                    CUT TO:

             EXT. STREET - NIGHT

             Perhaps in answer, we see the same shadowy figure moving behind 
             Pike and Benny as they continue to walk home.  They're really 
             bombed now.  They are somewhere in the hills now, and they 
             come to the edge of a steep incline overlooking the valley.  A 
             waist-high concrete wall is built into the side of the earth.  
             They stand below a thick, green tree.

                                       PIKE
                            I'll have it running in a week.  
                            It's be beauty.  It just needs new 
                            shocks, you know, break pads, an 
                            engine, and some wheels.  It'll be 
                            totally cherry.

             Pike finishes the bottle, eats the worm, and chucks the BOTTLE 
             over the side.  There is a moment before they hear it SHATTER.

                                       BENNY
                            When you get your car together, 
                            man, let's bail.

                                       PIKE
                            You think?  Split?

                                       BENNY
                            Utterly.  Let's bail this town.  
                            It's getting... I don't know.  Let's 
                            go somewhere where there aren't any 
                            rich bitches.

                                       PIKE
                            Our own world, where we could live 
                            and grow beans.  Hundreds of beans.

             Benny wavers, catches hold of Pike.

                                       BENNY
                            I think I'm gonna ralf.

             He leans over the side of the wall, hangs his head down.

                                       PIKE
                            Don't worry, Benny.  I'm here for 
                            you.

             Pike falls over backwards.

                                       PIKE
                                (continuing)
                            I'm here for you, Ralf.

             Pike passes out.

             CLOSEUP - BENNY

             Still waiting to throw up.  The figure approaches slowly from 
             behind him.  The figure is a few feet away from him when a 
             hand shoots down from above and grabs Benny's face.

             ANGLE - IN THE TREE

             Amilyn sits on a low branch, pulls Benny up to face him.  Amilyn 
             has changed his manner of dress drastically.  He wears a 
             motorcycle jacket and sunglasses.  His hair is punked out.  
             Benny is in shock, as Amilyn holds him easily by his shirt 
             collar.

                                       AMILYN
                            You wanna go for a ride?

             Amilyn leans back -- all the way back, falling back out of the 
             tree and pulling Benny with him.  We see them fall out past 
             the wall just as the shadowy figure reaches it.

             It is Merrick, the man from the mall.  He runs to the side of 
             the wall, looks over.  The two are already lost in the dark 
             mist.  Merrick turns around, looks about him.  He digs in his 
             pockets, pulls out a cross and a stake, holds them tightly.  
             While digging he pulls out an old, stained picture, lays it on 
             the railing.  Stake and cross in hand, he stands by Pike looking 
             out at the night.

             ANGLE - THE PICTURE

             It is a ten year old girl about to blow out the candles on her 
             birthday cake.  The cake reads, "Happy Birthday, Buffy".

                                                                    CUT TO:

             EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - AFTERNOON

             Buffy, Nicole and Jennifer and another cheerleader are 
             practicing.

                                       JENNIFER
                            What was the step after...  The one 
                            from Thursday.  I never learned it 
                            right, I don't think.

             Buffy shows her.  They do it together for a minute.

                                       BUFFY
                            That is so cool.

                                       NICOLE
                            Thank you very much.

                                       BUFFY
                            Nobody is even gonna look at the 
                            game.

                                       JENNIFER
                            Hey, I was thinking, for the dance, 
                            what about a big sign that says 
                            'Don't Tread On Me'.  You know, and 
                            a picture of the earth.

                                       BUFFY
                            Don't tread on the earth?

                                       NICOLE
                            I don't get it.

                                       BUFFY
                            How do you not tread on the earth?  
                            I mean, you kind of have to.

                                       JENNIFER
                            I never thought of that.

                                       NICOLE
                            I gotta bail.  You coming?

                                       BUFFY
                            You guys blow.  I'm waiting on 
                            Cassandra.  She's gonna help me 
                            with my history.

                                       NICOLE
                            Cassandra's really smart.

                                       BUFFY
                            Yeah... She's okay, though.

                                       NICOLE
                            I guess.

                                       JEFFREY
                            Are you going out with Jeffrey 
                            tonight?

                                       BUFFY
                            Jealous?

             Jennifer laughs, uncomfortably.

                                       BUFFY
                                (continuing)
                            Don't worry, Jennifer.  Someday 
                            your prince will come.

                                       NICOLE
                            Yeah, just make sure you do first.  
                            Let's go, guys.

                                       BUFFY
                            B'bye.

             The other girls leave.  Buffy is alone on the empty field.  
             She looks around her.  She starts doing a routine, tentatively.  
             Then she runs toward the middle of the field and jumps, flies 
             into an extraordinary series of gymnastic flips and cartwheels.  
             She rolls into one final flip, a huge one, and lands, a perfect 
             ten, about three inches from Merrick.

             She screams in surprise, steps back.

                                (continuing)
                            God, where the hell did you come 
                            from?  You scared me to death.

                                       MERRICK
                            I'm sorry.  That was impressive.  
                            The...  tumbling.

             His accent is clipped -- British.

                                       BUFFY
                            What?  Oh.  I used to do gymnastics.  
                            Are you looking for someone?

                                       MERRICK
                            I'm looking for you, actually.

                                       BUFFY
                            Am I in trouble or something?

                                       MERRICK
                            Not at all.  My name is Merrick.  I 
                            was sent to find you some time ago.  
                            I should have found you much sooner 
                            but there were...  complications.  
                            You should have been taught, 
                            prepared.

                                       BUFFY
                            What are you talking about?

                                       MERRICK
                            I've searched the entire world for 
                            you, Buffy.

                                       BUFFY
                            Why?

                                       MERRICK
                            To bring you... your birthright.

                                       BUFFY
                            My birthright?  You mean, like a 
                            trust fund?

             Merrick looks at her.

                                       BUFFY
                                (continuing)
                            I had a trust fund my great-
                            grandfather, or maybe it was an 
                            inheritance, 'cause he's dead, and 
                            I spent it on shoes.

                                       MERRICK
                            You must come with me.  It's much 
                            too late already.  You must come 
                            with me to the graveyard.

                                       BUFFY
                            Wait a minute.  My birthright is in 
                            the graveyard?  Later not.

                                       MERRICK
                            Wait!

                                       BUFFY
                            You're one of those skanky old men 
                            that, like, attack girls and stuff.  
                            Forget you.  My, um, my boyfriend 
                            is gonna be here in about thirty 
                            seconds, and he's way testy.

                                       MERRICK
                            You don't understand.  You have 
                            been chosen.

                                       BUFFY
                            Chosen to go to the graveyard?  Why 
                            don't you just take the first runner 
                            up, okay?

                                       MERRICK
                            You must believe me.  You must come 
                            with me while there's still time.

                                       BUFFY
                            Time to do what?

                                       MERRICK
                            To stop the killing.  To stop the 
                            vampires.

                                       BUFFY
                            Let me get this straight.  You're 
                            like, this greasy bum, and I have 
                            to go to the graveyard with you 
                            'cause I'm chosen, and there's 
                            vampires.

                                       MERRICK
                            Yes.

                                       BUFFY
                            Does Elvis talk to you?  Tell you 
                            to do things?  Do you see spots?

                                       MERRICK
                            I don't have time for your prattling.  
                            I have proof.  You bear the mark.

             He steps forward and pulls the neck of Buffy's shirt aside, 
             revealing her shoulder.

                                       MERRICK
                                (continuing)
                            The mark of the Coven!  The -- 
                            where's the mark?

             There is no birthmark on her shoulder.  He looks at the other 
             one.

                                       MERRICK
                                (continuing)
                            The mark of the -- wait a minute.

             Buffy pushes his hand off her.

                                       BUFFY
                            You mean that big hairy mole?  Excuse 
                            me:  eeyuu.  I had it removed.  
                            And, like, knowing about my big old 
                            mole isn't proof of anything except 
                            that it's way past medication time.

             She starts to walk away.

                                       BUFFY
                                (continuing)
                            Just stay away from me, okay?

                                       MERRICK
                            Did you ever dream that you were 
                            someone else?

             Buffy stops.  This obviously registers with her.

                                       BUFFY
                            Everybody does.

                                       MERRICK
                            In the past.  A girl.  Maybe... A 
                            Magyar peasant.  An Indian princess.  
                            A slave.

             The last one hits the mark.

                                       BUFFY
                            I was a slave.

                                       MERRICK
                            In Virginia.

                                       BUFFY
                            I don't know.  It was...  There was 
                            a big gram or something.  And there's 
                            one, I'm like a prostitute...

                                       MERRICK
                            China.

                                       BUFFY
                            Oh, my God.  I never told anybody 
                            about this.  I remember the one 
                            about the peasant, too.  God, there's 
                            a bunch.  Is this, like channeling 
                            or something.

             Merrick rolls his eyes.

                                       BUFFY
                                (continuing)
                            I had a dream once where I was...  
                            There was like, knights in it, and 
                            I worked in this bar.  And I... was 
                            fighting.  I'm always fighting.  
                            And there's a guy...  He's not always 
                            there, but he's horrible, all white, 
                            and he's always... trying to kill 
                            me.

                                       MERRICK
                            Lothos.

             The name has an obvious effect on the girl.

                                       BUFFY
                            How do you know all this?

                                       MERRICK
                            I have to show you.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             ANGLE - THE SUN

             Thick and orange, sinking beyond the hills.

             EXT. GRAVEYARD - SUNSET

             Merrick leads Buffy, searching for a particular grave.

                                       BUFFY
                            I can't believe I'm doing this.  I 
                            can't believe I'm in a graveyard 
                            with a strange man hunting for 
                            vampires on a school night.

                                       MERRICK
                            Why didn't you ever tell anybody 
                            about your dreams?

                                       BUFFY
                            Oh, yeah, tell everyone I'm crazy.  
                            Beauty ida.

             Buffy stops, winces slightly.

                                       BUFFY
                                (continuing)
                            Ow.

                                       MERRICK
                            Cramps?

                                       BUFFY
                            None of your business.  God.

                                       MERRICK
                            This is it.

             Buffy is standing on a freshly dug grave.  The headstone reads: 
             "ROBERT BERMAN, 1972 - 1990.  GOD IS AT HIS HEELS".

                                       MERRICK
                                (continuing)
                            Robert Berman was killed three days 
                            ago.  The body was found in the 
                            bushes out by the canal.  Extensive 
                            tissue damage -- tearing -- at the 
                            neck and shoulders.  Coroner thinks 
                            it's a dog.  You sit her.

             He points out a plot of ground about eight feet from the foot 
             of the grave.  Buffy sits and leans against another stone.

             Merrick reaches into his jacket, pulls out a stake and a cross, 
             hands the cross to Buffy.

                                       BUFFY
                            Wait a minute.

                                       MERRICK
                            Just for protection.  You won't 
                            have to do anything.  I just need 
                            you to watch.

                                       BUFFY
                            All right.  What do we do now?

                                       MERRICK
                            We wait for Robert to wake up.

             Merrick goes over to the other headstone, crouches by it.

                                       BUFFY
                            Do you have any gum?

             ANGLE - SUNSET

             The last red glimmer disappears behind the hills.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             EXT. OUTSIDE THE SCHOOL - SAME TIME

             Cassandra stands waiting for Buffy.  The sun is down, darkness 
             increasing.  She looks at her watch and gives up, heads for 
             her car.  Her key in the door, she hears a RUSTLING behind 
             her.  Looks slowly around.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             EXT. GRAVEYARD - SAME TIME

             Buffy sits fidgeting.  Playing with her fingernails.  Merrick 
             stays in the position, listening.

             A low, almost inaudible MOAN come from under the ground.  Buffy 
             sits up straight, holds the cross to her.  The MOAN becomes 
             louder, almost a scream.  The SOUND is followed by the SOUND 
             of FINGERS SCRAPPING wood -- of WOOD SPLINTERING -- of digging.  
             The moaning continues, becoming eerier, somewhat more 
             articulate.

             Buffy and Merrick wait.

             ANGLE - THE GRAVE

             Finally, fingers break through the ground and hold stiff in 
             the open air.  The moan becomes a triumphant HISS.  The fingers 
             clutch at the ground.

             ROBERT BERMAN pops halfway out of his grave like a jack-in-the-
             box, his face dirty and dead-white.  He sees Buffy in front of 
             him, and he bobs toward her with a crazy grin, stretching as 
             to a mother's tit.

             Merrick drops down behind Robert and grabs him, raising the 
             stake.  Buffy watches, immobilized.

             A pair of arms shoot up from the ground right under Buffy.  
             They grab her and pull her to the ground.  Next to her face, 
             the face of another vampire, a YOUNG WOMAN, emerges grinning 
             from the crumbling earth.

             Buffy screams lustily, and struggles to break free.

             Merrick is momentarily distracted by this, and Robert throws 
             him off, and pulls himself out of the grave.  Merrick falls to 
             the ground, and his stake goes flying.

             Buffy pulls herself out of the girl's grasp, starts running 
             away, but the girl grabs her.  Buffy remembers the cross in 
             her hand, spins and holds it to the vampire's forehead.  It 
             burns and the lady lets go, screaming and falling to the ground.

                                       BUFFY
                            'Bye now.

             Buffy runs.

             ANGLE - MERRICK AND ROBERT

             They are struggling, several feet away.  Robert grabs Merrick 
             by the shoulders and picks him up, preparing to bite him.  A 
             stake suddenly pops out of his chest, planted in his back by 
             Buffy.  He falls and dies.

                                       MERRICK
                            Where's the other one?

                                       BUFFY
                            She --

             It leaps at her, screaming.  She throws it off, as Merrick 
             produces another stake and throws it to her.  Buffy sticks it 
             in the vampire's heart.  She dies, screaming, her face still 
             smoking, blood spurting onto Buffy.

             Buffy looks at herself.  At the blood.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             EXT. FRONT OF BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

             Merrick walks Buffy to the door.  She is silent, slow.

                                       MERRICK
                            Go to school tomorrow.  Try to act 
                            normal.  Don't let anyone know what's 
                            happening.  This is important.  
                            When the vampires find out who you 
                            are... you won't be hunting them 
                            anymore.

                                       BUFFY
                            All right.

             He hands her a piece of paper.

                                       MERRICK
                            Meet me at this address after school.

                                       BUFFY
                            I have cheerleading squad.

                                       MERRICK
                            Skip it.

             Buffy nods.  Merrick starts back down the path.

                                       BUFFY
                            Merrick.

             Merrick stops.

                                       BUFFY
                                (continuing)
                            They can't come in, right?  Unless 
                            you invite them.  Is that true?

                                       MERRICK
                            It's true.

             Merrick moves on.  Buffy goes inside.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. BUFFY'S HOUSE - FOYER - SAME TIME

             Buffy shuts the door, turns to go up to her room.  She is 
             startled by someone standing in her path.  She almost screams.

             It's her mother.  She stands, arm akimbo, looking very 
             confrontational.  Buffy looks a sight, and stands uncomfortably 
             in front of her mother for a moment.

                                       BUFFY'S MOM
                            Do you know what time it is?

                                       BUFFY
                            Uum... around ten?

             Mom taps her watch, annoyed.

                                       BUFFY'S MOM
                            I knew this thing was slow.

             She crosses out of the room.

                                       BUFFY'S MOM
                                (continuing)
                            You pay a fortune for something...
                                (calls out)
                            Honey, come on, we're gonna be late.

             Her mother gone, Buffy lets out a small sigh -- of relief or 
             frustration, it is not clear.  She heads upstairs.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. BUFFY'S HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT

             Buffy stands at the sink, washing her shirt.  She tries to get 
             the blood off with fierce intensity.  She is near tears.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. BUFFY'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

             She sits in the middle of the bed in her pajamas, the blankets 
             pooled around her.  She cannot sleep.  Finally, she lies back 
             on the pillow.

             Lothos is beside her.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. SCHOOL HALL - DAY

             Buffy walks through the hall slowly, obviously the worse for 
             last night's wear.  Gary Murray comes up next to her, looking 
             at his watch pointedly:  she's late for class.  He moves on.  
             Jeffrey, going the other way, stops next to her.

                                       JEFFREY
                            Hey, baby, how ya doing?  You look 
                            beat.

                                       BUFFY
                            I do?  I guess I do.

                                       JEFFREY
                            Where were you last night?  I called 
                            your house like four times.

                                       BUFFY
                            I went to sleep.  I think I have 
                            the flu or something.

             Jeffrey backs away from her.

                                       JEFFREY
                            I can't get sick.  You know -- 
                            training and all.  I'm gonna be 
                            late.

                                       BUFFY
                            'Bye.

             Jeffrey moves off to class.  Buffy walks on a bit.  She bumps 
             into Nicole.

                                       NICOLE
                            Hey, Buffers.  You look thrashed.

                                       BUFFY
                            Thanks.

                                       NICOLE
                            You and Cassandra get anything done 
                            last night?

             Buffy looks confused for a moment, then remembers.

                                       BUFFY
                            Oh.  No.  She never showed.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. LOTHOS' CAVE - CLOSEUP OF CASSANDRA'S FACE

             She is waking up, obviously from being knocked out.  She blinks 
             stupidly, looks around.  She is lying by a pool of what looks 
             to be dark water in a large cave.  Torches burn around her.

             She tries to get up and finds it difficult.  She pulls herself 
             up to the side of the pool and splashes water on her face.

             It's blood.

             She starts, staring with growing horror at her hands.  She 
             does not even see the figure rise from the pool at first.

             It's Lothos.  He wears no shirt, only white trousers and boots, 
             the style maybe Nineteenth Century.  No blood seems to touch 
             him as he rises.  He looks at Cassandra with an almost sleepy 
             lust.

                                       LOTHOS
                            I find it restorative, sleeping in 
                            the life-blood of so many.  To feel 
                            their souls coursing about me.

                                       CASSANDRA
                            What's happening?  What do you want?

                                       LOTHOS
                                (smiling)
                            So very much.

                                       CASSANDRA
                            My parents have money...

                                       LOTHOS
                            Yes, I'm sure they do.  This place 
                            is everything you said it was, 
                            Amilyn.

             Cassandra turns.  Amilyn stands behind her, grinning.  He 
             hisses, bares his fangs at Cassandra.

                                       CASSANDRA
                            What... are you?

                                       LOTHOS
                            Are we so strange?  So alien to 
                            you?  I've seen this culture, the 
                            wealth, the greed, the waste... 
                            it's truly heartwarming.  The perfect 
                            place to spread my empire.  Honestly, 
                            Eastern Europe was so dead, the 
                            Communists just drained the blood 
                            out of the place.  It's livened up 
                            a bit in the past few years, but 
                            it's nothing compared to this.... 
                            this Mecca of consumption.  The 
                            city of Angels.

             He steps right up to her.

                                       LOTHOS
                                (continuing)
                            What are we?  We are man, perfected.  
                            We exist to consume.

             On the world "to consume" we see Amilyn mouthing the words 
             with Lothos, his eyes to the ceiling.  He's heard this a hundred 
             times.

                                       AMILYN
                            So?  Do we change this one, or do 
                            we just drain her?

             Cassandra pulls her gold card out of her wallet.

                                       CASSANDRA
                            Here, look.  My gold card.  It's 
                            your.  I'll never report it.

             Amilyn snatches it from her, looks it over.

                                       LOTHOS
                            She has a certain quality, this 
                            one...

             Amilyn bites the card.

                                       AMILYN
                            I don't think this is gold.

                                       LOTHOS
                            Not as single-minded as the others, 
                            not as sybaritic.  Almost thoughtful.  
                            She's useless.

                                       CASSANDRA
                            No, wait.  I can be dumb.  Really.  
                            Or mean, or whatever.  I can learn.  
                            I'm useful.

                                       LOTHOS
                            Really?

                                       CASSANDRA
                            Swear to God.

             He rips out her throat, tearing at it with his teeth as blood 
             gushes around their faces and she wriggle, twists, dies.  He 
             hurls her into the door and wipes blood from his mouth.

                                       LOTHOS
                            I wish you wouldn't mention him...

             Slowly Cassandra slides down the wall, her eyes glazing over.  
             As she descends we see, stenciled on the wall, "Hemery High 
             School.  Maintenance Only."

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. WAREHOUSE - AFTERNOON

             Grey, dusty and long since abandoned.  Sunlight pours in through 
             the large windows, practically caked with dust.  Old crates 
             are stacked here and there, bits of manikins leaning on one or 
             two.  Merrick sits on a crate, reading the newspaper.

             Buffy enters hesitantly, puts down her bookbag next to a pile 
             of Merrick's stuff, including a rolled-up sleeping bag.  This 
             is definitely not her turf.  She runs her finger along a crate, 
             picks up a world of dust.  She holds up her finger at Merrick.

                                       BUFFY
                            Fire the help.  No kidding.

             Merrick looks up at her.

                                       MERRICK
                            It's not pretty, but it does suit 
                            our purposes.

                                       BUFFY
                            Our purposes.

             She repeats it not with attitude, but a dull wonder at her 
             connection with this strange man.  She crosses to him.

                                       BUFFY
                                (continuing)
                            What, um...  What do we do?

                                       MERRICK
                            There's a great deal I have to show 
                            you, I'm not even sure where to 
                            start  There's so little time.

                                       BUFFY
                            Why do you keep saying that?

                                       MERRICK
                            Do you know what a Vampire-King is?

                                       BUFFY
                            A Vampire-King?  You mean like 
                            Dracula?

                                       MERRICK
                            Oh, yes.  And the man from your 
                            dreams.  Lothos.

                                       BUFFY
                            Oh, him.

                                       MERRICK
                            Yes.  They travel about, usually 
                            with one or two of their followers 
                            to lay the groundwork.  The vampires 
                            find a community and they feed on 
                            it, make it their own.  You were 
                            difficult to trace, and I think the 
                            process has gone a lot further than 
                            I'd anticipated.  Usually this goads 
                            a community into some kind of 
                            paranoid frenzy.  But for some 
                            reason, nobody here seems to be 
                            paying any attention.

                                       BUFFY
                                (not paying attention)
                            What?

                                       MERRICK
                                (annoyed)
                            We'll cover it later.

                                       BUFFY
                            I still don't get how they happened 
                            to come to my town.  I mean, was I 
                            born here because... because they  
                            were coming here?  That Lothos guy, 
                            and his buddies?

                                       MERRICK
                            In a way, yes.  Your fate is 
                            inexorably connected to them.

                                       BUFFY
                            Great.  First I have a birthright, 
                            now I've got a fate.  Hey, do I 
                            have to take notes on this?

                                       MERRICK
                                (put down his paper)
                            We're going to have the work hard.  
                            You'll need some excuse for staying 
                            out.  For your parents.

             Buffy laughs.

                                       BUFFY
                            Not a pressing issue.

                                       MERRICK
                            I tell you, the best thing I can do 
                            right now is find out more about 
                            you.  What your strengths are, your 
                            likes...  Everything.  What's your 
                            best subject?

                                       BUFFY
                            Uh... gym.

                                       MERRICK
                            Yes, you used to do gymnastics.  
                            But you stopped.  Why?

                                       BUFFY
                            Well, everybody says... it's just 
                            kind of dorky.  I mean, have you 
                            ever seen a gymnast's legs?  They're 
                            like --
                                (indicating huge)
                            -- the mighty oak.  It's not a look.

                                       MERRICK
                            But you enjoyed it, yes?

                                       BUFFY
                            Well... I do cheerleading now.  
                            It's way cooler.

                                       MERRICK
                            Cheerleading.  For... sporting 
                            events, yes?

                                       BUFFY
                            Sporting events, yeah.

                                       MERRICK
                            All right.  Why don't you show me a 
                            cheer?

                                       BUFFY
                            Here?

                                       MERRICK
                            Yes, yes.  It would be interesting.  
                            A nice cheer.

                                       BUFFY
                            Okay.

             Buffy starts, a bit awkwardly, doing a cheer.

                                       BUFFY
                                (continuing)
                            Who we gonna beat?

                                       MERRICK
                                (pathetically following her 
                                motion)
                            Who we gonna beat?

                                       BUFFY
                                (stops)
                            No -- you don't have to --

                                       MERRICK
                            Oh.  I thought... you lead me --

                                       BUFFY
                            No.  You don't do anything.  I do 
                            it.

                                       MERRICK
                            Oh.  Good.

             She starts again.

                                       BUFFY
                            Who we gonna beat? 
                            Who do we defeat? 
                            Who will we be pulverizing 
                            Into cream of wheat?

             Gradually, Buffy gets more into the cheer.  The steps become 
             more complicated as she repeats the verse.

             CLOSEUP - MERRICK'S HAND

             We see a knife slip out of Merrick's sleeve.  He palms it, 
             hands behind his back.

             In the middle of her routine, he hurls it at her.  She catches 
             it, reflexively, inches from her face.  Stops dead.  Then bursts 
             into tears.  Merrick is thrown off by this reaction.

                                       BUFFY
                            Oh, what the hell is wrong with 
                            you?  You threw a knife at my head!

                                       MERRICK
                            I had to test you.

                                       BUFFY
                            But you threw a knife at my head!

                                       MERRICK
                            And you caught it!  Only the chosen 
                            one could have done that.

                                       BUFFY
                            I don't want to be the chosen one, 
                            okay?  I don't want to spend the 
                            rest of my life chasing after 
                            vampires!  I just want to graduate 
                            from high school, go to Europe, 
                            marry Charlie Sheen and die.  It 
                            may not sound too exciting to a 
                            sconehead like you, but I think 
                            it's swell.  And then you come 
                            along...  and... and then I'm a 
                            member of the hairy mole club, so 
                            you throw things at me!

             She is coming at him now.  He begins to back up.

                                       MERRICK
                            It was necessary.

                                       BUFFY
                                (realizing)
                            Last night.  You knew I was sitting 
                            on a fresh grave, didn't you?

                                       MERRICK
                            I don't think you understand the 
                            full implications of --

             Buffy punches him in the face.  He goes flying a good ways, 
             lands on his back.  His nose bleed merrily.  Buffy stops.

                                       BUFFY
                            Oh.  Sorry.

                                       MERRICK
                                (getting up)
                            Don't you see what's happening?  
                            You're changing.  You've got powers 
                            you've only just begun to tap.  
                            Physical, mental prowess you've 
                            never dreamed of.
                                (pulling a handkerchief out 
                                of his pocket)
                            God, this hurts.  I've administered 
                            a few shocks to your system to start 
                            the adrenaline working.  I'm sorry 
                            I have to take so many shortcuts in 
                            the training process.

                                       BUFFY
                            Put your head back.

                                       MERRICK
                            Two days ago, would you have even 
                            hit me?  Let alone so powerfully?

                                       BUFFY
                            No... I guess I would have gotten 
                            Jeffrey to hit you.

                                       MERRICK
                            Exactly.  You're changing.  You're 
                            becoming something extraordinarily 
                            powerful.

             Buffy looks at the knife in her hand.  The MUSIC COMES UP and 
             we...

                                                                    CUT TO:

             A SERIES OF IMAGES AND INTERCUT SCENES

             Buffy's period of training.  Over the difficult course of it, 
             she is obviously becoming more self-possessed, more at ease.  
             Her style of dress loosens a bit:  a little punkier.  Stops 
             dying her hair blonde and her roots start showing.  Accumulates 
             a few more holes in her ears.

             EXT. THE WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

             etc.

             EXT. SCHOOL - DAY

             Buffy arriving late for class.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. BRENTANO'S - DAY

             Buffy charging some books: Lawson's Treatis on Demonology, 
             Psychological Interpretations of Vampirism, The Book of the 
             Dead, and The Complete Garlic Cookbook.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

             Merrick sits on a crate, reading the obituaries and circling 
             certain entries.

             Buffy stands on her head, sweating with concentration.  The 
             CAMERA TILTS up to reveal her feet.  Between the toes of one 
             is a nail brush, with which she is very carefully painting her 
             toenails.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. MELROSE CLOTHING STORE ("ROCK STAR") - NIGHT

             Amilyn and a few of the old-world vampires are on a spree, 
             trying on various leather jackets.  As they cavort, the CAMERA 
             TRACKS behind the counter, where we find the clerk, bloody and 
             dead, slumped on the floor.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             EXT. SCHOOL - DAY

             Buffy kissing Jeffrey goodbye after school.  A long, lingering 
             kiss, during which she pulls away, anxious to get going.  She 
             starts off, comes back and plants a big ol' on his lips one 
             last time before splitting.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             EXT. MINIATURE GOLF COURSE - AFTERNOON

             Merrick and Buffy are playing.  Merrick tees off, shoots 
             horribly.

                                       BUFFY
                                (as announcer)
                            Ooh, another embarrassment for the 
                            teabag, while the chosen one is 
                            still well under par.

                                       MERRICK
                            Your turn.

             Buffy positions herself.

                                       BUFFY
                            What about bats?  Do they turn into 
                            bats?

                                       MERRICK
                            No.  No bats, no flying.  They... 
                            float, occasionally.  Not really 
                            flying.

                                       BUFFY
                            Toasty.  Were there ever any, like, 
                            famous vampires?

                                       MERRICK
                            Oh, several.  Lucretia Borgia, Joseph 
                            Mengele, Franklin Pangborn... are 
                            any of those names familiar?

                                       BUFFY
                            If I say 'no' does that make me a 
                            bad person?

                                       MERRICK
                            Good Lord.  What do you study in 
                            history?

                                       BUFFY
                            My nails.

             She gives a little 'isn't that funny' kind of laugh.  He doesn't 
             respond.

                                       MERRICK
                            All right.  You've heard of the 
                            emperor Caligula, perhaps?  Or Jack 
                            the Ripper?

                                       BUFFY
                            They were vampires?

                                       MERRICK
                            Same one.

                                       BUFFY
                            Oh.

             She considers this a moment.  Tees off:  another hole in one.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             Buffy and Merrick sparring, working their way in between the 
             "trees."  She is his superior in speed and strength, but he 
             easily trips her up.  She glares at him from the ground.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             Buffy late again.  Gary Murray watches her from the hall, 
             shaking his head.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             Two college-age guys stand hitchhiking.  A red convertible 
             pulls up, with a beautiful blonde behind the wheel.  The guys 
             look at each other -- all right!  They can't see her teeth, or 
             the look in her eye.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. CHURCH - AFTERNOON

             Buffy walks in, looks around.  She approaches a PRIEST.

                                       BUFFY
                            Excuse me...

                                       PRIEST
                            Yes, my child?  Is something 
                            troubling you?

                                       BUFFY
                            Well, sort of.

                                       PRIEST
                            Well, maybe I can help.

                                       BUFFY
                            Yeah.  Um... Could you bless these?

             She holds up a six-pack of Perrier.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. LOTHOS' CAVE - NIGHT

             We see the entire cave, the still pool of blood, the torches 
             lit.  At the far end sits Lothos.  In his arms is the body of 
             a dead girl.  Blood stains her neck and yet the image is poetic, 
             reminiscent of Michelangelo's "Pieta".  They are both perfectly 
             still, her draped across his lap, he with his eyes far far 
             away.  The silence holds.

             Lothos belches massively.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

             Merrick is lecturing Buffy.  Buffy is sitting, doodling in an 
             open notebook, "uh-huh"ing and obviously not paying attention.

                                       MERRICK
                            ... Lothos was probably born in the 
                            eleventh or twelfth century; he's 
                            been difficult to trace.  His power 
                            has increased with age.  It will be 
                            a long while before you are ready 
                            to face him.  We'll be lucky if we 
                            can get him to leave the area, to 
                            lie low for awhile.  That will 
                            scatter the rest of them.  Lothos 
                            is...

             He looks at Buffy, who is staring down at her notebook.

                                       MERRICK
                                (continuing)
                            ... is extremely powerful, but he 
                            is still a vampire, and vulnerable 
                            to the same...

             He looks at her.  Is she listening?

                                       MERRICK
                                (continuing)
                            Daylight is still his enemy.  The 
                            stake can still find his heart.

             Is she?

                                       MERRICK
                                (continuing)
                            I have huge antlers growing out of 
                            my buttocks.

             Nope.  No reaction, just another "Uh-huh."

             ANGLE - BUFFY'S NOTEBOOK

             Merrick slams a stake right through the middle of it.  Buffy 
             screams, jumps back a good two feet and lands on her butt.

                                       BUFFY
                                (angry)
                            What!?!

                                       MERRICK
                            Try to pay attention.

             annoyingly about his head.

                                       GARY MURRAY
                            Well, I think we can safely say 
                            that something's going on with you, 
                            Buffy.  Now, there's nothing to be 
                            nervous about; you're not in any 
                            trouble.  I just hoped maybe we 
                            could talk.  Don't think of me as

                            of me as Gary Murray, party guy!

             Buffy stands under a tree, blindfolded.  Merrick stands a ways 
             apart, watching.  Buffy stands very still, neck craned, waiting.

             Silently, a leaf falls.  It wafts gently down.  Buffy hurls a 
             knife at it with easy precision.

             ANGLE - ANOTHER TREE

             The knife stick deep into the trunk, the leaf perfectly pinned.

             Merrick looks at it.  Buffy smiles, knowing she has hit the 
             target.  Blindfold still on, she turns toward Merrick and walks 
             into a branch, falls heavily backwards.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                            Hey, there's nothing to be afraid 
                            of!  I know where you're coming 
                            from.  Believe me.  I'll tell you 
                            the truth.  I've had my drug 
                            experiences, too.  I did a lot -- I 
                            did some acid in the Sixties.  Well, 
                            the late Seventies, actually.  It 
                            was at a Doobie Brother's concert.

             Buffy at the mall with Kimberly, Nicole and Jennifer.  For the 
             first time, we really see how she stands out against her 
             friends.  She is wearing much more functional, cool garb, and 
             less makeup, while they still sport the same dainty shit from 
             the beginning.

             They stop to look at some dresses.  Something in the next store 
             catches Buffy's eye; she wanders off.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. GARY MURRAY'S OFFICE - SAME TIME

             Gary Murray is crouching on his desk.  Buffy still sits.  The 
             FLY still BUZZES.

             As Gary talks, Buffy picks up a push pin from the table beside 
             her, holds it.

                                       GARY MURRAY
                            ... and I could see the music flowing 
                            into me, it was bright red and 
                            electric, and I felt like a big 
                            toaster, and I thought, maybe I am 
                            a toaster, we're all molecules, and 
                            my friend Melissa, her head looked 
                            like a big party balloon, and that 
                            scared me, I started to freak out...

             Buffy surreptitiously puts the push pin in her mouth.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. THE MALL - DAY

             The other girls are moving on from the dress shop, notice Buffy 
             is not with them.  They spot her in the next shop, urge her to 
             come on.  Buffy puts back the chain saw she was looking at, 
             follows them.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. GARY MURRAY'S OFFICE - DAY

             Buffy hasn't moved, or opened her mouth.  The FLY BUZZES on.  
             Gary Murray now sits behind his desk.

                                       GARY MURRAY
                            I guess you're surprised.  Well, 
                            you know, there's more to most people 
                            than meets the eye.  Everybody's 
                            got a secret.  I just want you to 
                            know that you can always share your 
                            secrets with me.  What you say in 
                            this office, it will stay in this 
                            office.  I'm your pal.

             Buffy smiles at Gary.  As he looks away for a second, Buffy 
             spits out the push pin.  The BUZZING STOPS.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

             Buffy sparring with Merrick again.  She holds a stake.  This 
             time she ends up pinning him, the stake at his solar plexus.

             He moves the point to where his heart would be.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. PIKE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

             The room is a shambles.  Outside the first floor window, it is 
             dark night.  "Help Yourself" by the Posies blasts from Pike's 
             STEREO.  Pike lies on his bed.

             Through the window we see Benny approach, slowly fading up to 
             the pane.  He's floating, really.  (He's a vampire.)  He scrapes 
             his fingers on the glass.

                                       BENNY
                            Pike...

             Pike sits up, turns down the music.  He goes to the window, 
             begins to try to open it.  It's stuck.

                                       PIKE
                            Benny, man, where you been?  You 
                            bailed on me, I passed out, man, I 
                            almost did a Jimi Hendrix!

                                       BENNY
                            Let me in.

                                       PIKE
                            Hey, I'm trying, but this window is 
                            burnt --

             Pike gets a good look at Benny for the first time.

                                       BENNY
                            Invite me in, Pike.

                                       PIKE
                            Wait a minute.  What's wrong with 
                            you, man?

                                       BENNY
                            I'm fine.

                                       PIKE
                            You look like shit, Benny.

             Benny grins, presses his slimy forehead against the glass.

                                       BENNY
                            I... feel.... pretty.

                                       PIKE
                            No offense, man, but I think you're 
                            on something nasty.  Why don't you 
                            just go and cool out and I'll see 
                            you in the morning or something.

                                       BENNY
                            The sun!  It burns!  It burns!

             He laughs at his impression, brown spittle caking the window.

                                       BENNY
                                (continuing)
                            Let me in, Pike!  I'm hungry!

                                       PIKE
                            Get away from here.

                                       BENNY
                            I'm hungry.

                                       PIKE
                            I mean it.

             Benny smiles, moves suddenly out of sight.  Pike looks at the 
             window for a second, then bolts out of his room.  He runs to 
             the front door, frantically hooks the chain.  Benny appears at 
             the door's little window, banging and scraping the glass.

                                       BENNY
                            I'm hungry!  I'm hungry!  I'm hungry!

             Pike backs away.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             EXT. DESERTED STREET - NIGHT

             Buffy walks slowly down the street, trying to appear nonchalant, 
             but looking about her a lot.

                                       BUFFY
                            Sure is cold.  What a dark night.  
                            Nice night for a walk.

             She whistles some, keeps walking.

                                       BUFFY
                                (continuing)
                            'Feelings, la la la la feelings'...  
                            Boy, I'm helpless.

             She passes an alley and there is a RUSTLING amid the garbage 
             cans.  She moves slowly down the alley toward the noise.  She 
             is about halfway down when a rat scurries out from the cans 
             and down a drain.

                                       BUFFY
                                (continuing)
                            Yeucch.

             Behind her, another SOUND.  She turns slowly.  At the entrance 
             to the alley stands a vampire.  They stare at each other, some 
             thirty feet away.

                                       BUFFY
                                (continuing)
                            Hello...

             She moves back a step.  The vampire takes a step.

                                       BUFFY
                                (continuing)
                            What do you want?

             It floats rapidly at her, hissing.  Buffy looks about her 
             frantically, trapped.  It hits her at top speed and she 
             instantly rolls onto her back, flipping it and hurling it 
             against the wall at the end of the alley.  As it hits, Buffy, 
             still rolling, produces a stake from her jacket and throws it 
             directly at its heart.  The stake punctures the startled 
             creature's chest.  Before he can so much as grab it, Buffy 
             throws a roundhouse kick, driving the stake all the way home 
             with her foot.  The vampire screams, sinks to the ground.

             Buffy turns, triumphant.

                                       BUFFY
                                (continuing)
                            Toaster-caked him!

             CLOSEUP - A STOPWATCH

             A hand stops it.  It is Merrick, who steps into the alley and 
             stares at Buffy.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             EXT. OUTSIDE THE WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

             The two exit Merrick's car, an old Dodge Dart.  As they talk, 
             they make their way into the warehouse.  Buffy looks out for 
             trouble while Merrick unlocks the door.  This is obviously 
             their routine.

                                       MERRICK
                            He was slow.  Very simple.  They 
                            won't all be that easy.

                                       BUFFY
                            Fine.

                                       MERRICK
                            And the alley was a mistake.  Never 
                            corner yourself like that.  If they'd 
                            come at you in force you'd be dead 
                            now.  One vampire is a lot easier 
                            to kill then ten.

                                       BUFFY
                            Does the world 'Duhh' mean anything 
                            to you?

                                       MERRICK
                            You felt a little sick, didn't you?  
                            The cramps.

             They enter the warehouse.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. THE WAREHOUSE - SAME TIME

             They unload their stuff as they argue.

                                       BUFFY
                            Nice conversationalist!  Yeah, I 
                            felt 'em a little, but I ain't due 
                            for two weeks since you're so excited 
                            about the subject.

                                       MERRICK
                            It's natural.  A reaction to their 
                            presence, to the... unnaturalness 
                            of it.  It's part of how you are 
                            able to track them.

                                       BUFFY
                            Oh, wonderful.  My secret weapon is -
                            PMS.  That's just great.  Thanks 
                            for telling me.

                                       MERRICK
                            You'll get used to it.  I'm more 
                            worried about your tactical mistakes.

                                       BUFFY
                            You are such a wet.

                                       MERRICK
                            A what?

                                       BUFFY
                            A wet!  Didn't I just kill that 
                            vampire?  I think I did.  I didn't 
                            see you killing any vampires.  You 
                            were too busy playing 'Beat the 
                            Clock'.

                                       MERRICK
                            Don't start with me again.

                                       BUFFY
                            Aren't I, like the chosen one?  The 
                            one and only?  The Grand High Poobah 
                            and doesn't that mean you have to 
                            be nice to me?  Like, ever?

                                       MERRICK
                            Buffy...

                                       BUFFY
                            And why are you always wearing black?  
                            It's so down.  It's totally not 
                            your color.  I don't think you have 
                            a color.

                                       MERRICK
                            What do you want?  Encouragement?
                                (in bad American accent)
                            'Gosh, Buffy, you're so special, I 
                            just want to give you a great big 
                            hug, oh I'm just having a warm 
                            fuzzy.'

                                       BUFFY
                            Oh, fuck you!

             Merrick turns on her.

                                       MERRICK
                            Do you know how many girls I've 
                            trained to be Slayers?  Five.  Five 
                            properly prepared girls, girls who 
                            faced their responsibilities, who 
                            worked hard to become women overnight -- 
                            harder than you've ever worked in 
                            your life -- and I saw them ripped 
                            apart.  Do you want to live?  Do 
                            you?

                                       BUFFY
                            I...

                                       MERRICK
                            What did you think, that being able 
                            to jump about and hit people makes 
                            you a Slayer?

             Buffy looks at him a bit.

                                       BUFFY
                            Five?

                                       MERRICK
                            Five.

                                       BUFFY
                            So, basically, I've got the life 
                            expectancy of a zit, right?

                                       MERRICK
                            Not if you're careful.

                                       BUFFY
                            How can you keep doing this?

                                       MERRICK
                            It's what I was raised to do.  There 
                            aren't many of us left, the Watchers.

                                       BUFFY
                            Watchers?

                                       MERRICK
                            There's a small village in Hampshire, 
                            near Stonehenge...
                                (sees she doesn't know it)
                            ... near a bunch of big rocks.  
                            That's where I was born.  My father 
                            taught me about the training, about 
                            finding the Slayers, reading the 
                            signs.  There's a small cluster of 
                            us, a few families, really... most 
                            of the neighboring villagers think 
                            we're just a bunch of harmless old 
                            loonies.  I thought so myself for a 
                            time, when I was younger...
                                (stops himself)
                            I'm sorry.  I'm not supposed to... 
                            I shouldn't go on like this.

                                       BUFFY
                            I wish you would.

                                       MERRICK
                            It isn't important.

                                       BUFFY
                            I'm curious, is all.

                                       MERRICK
                            Buffy, don't... don't start thinking 
                            of me as your friend.  It interferes 
                            with the work, and it...

                                       BUFFY
                            And it makes it worse when I die, 
                            right?

             Silence.

                                       BUFFY
                                (continuing)
                            Well, you know, I'm not gonna kick 
                            so easy.  I've got a few things the 
                            other girls didn't have.

                                       MERRICK
                            As for example, what?

                                       BUFFY
                            Well... there's my keen fashion 
                            sense, for one.

                                       MERRICK
                            Vampires of the world, beware.

                                       BUFFY
                                (impressed)
                            Merrick.  You made a joke.  Are you 
                            okay, I mean, do you want to lie 
                            down?  I know it hurts the first 
                            time.

             In spite of himself, Merrick smiles.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. SCHOOL HALL - DAY

             Buffy, Nicole, Kimberly, and Jennifer are walking down the 
             hall.

                                       JENNIFER
                            So they found Cassandra's body out 
                            by the railway tunnels.  Nobody's 
                            saying anything, but they think she 
                            was involved in something, like, 
                            illegal or something.  Like dealing.

                                       KIMBERLY
                            Well, I hope so.

                                       JENNIFER
                            Probably was.  What do you suppose 
                            she was doing out there.

                                       BUFFY
                            Dying.

                                       JENNIFER
                            Eeyuu.

             Coming from the opposite direction are Jeffrey, Andy and some 
             of the other football players.  They're suited up and heading 
             for the gym.

                                       ANDY
                            ... And they're having some memorial 
                            service or something tomorrow.  You 
                            going?

                                       JEFFREY
                            I don't know.  Coach said I had to 
                            work on my 'ab's.'

                                       ANDY
                            Coach knows what abs are?

             They pass Buffy.  Andy stops and grabs her from behind.

                                       ANDY
                                (continuing)
                            Got to get some!

             Unthinkingly, Buffy flips Andy over and pins him against a 
             locker.

                                       ANDY
                                (continuing)
                            Whoa!  Whoa!  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  
                            I don't actually need any right 
                            now.

                                       JEFFREY
                                (to Buffy)
                            What's with you?

                                       BUFFY
                            Don't grab me, okay?

                                       ANDY
                            Absolutely.  I see now the error of 
                            my mistake.

                                       JEFFREY
                            Yeah, keep your mitts off my thang.  
                            I'll pop you one.
                                (to Buffy)
                            Did he scare you?

             Jeffrey puts his arm around Buffy but she shakes it off.

                                       BUFFY
                            I can take care of myself, Jeffrey.

                                       JEFFREY
                            So I noticed.

             Buffy goes off by herself.  Jeffrey watches her.

                                       JEFFREY
                                (continuing)
                            Nice to feel needed.

                                       ANDY
                            Let's move out!

                                       JEFFREY
                                (rallying)
                            Yes!

             The lads move off.  We see Nicole, Kimberly and Jennifer, who 
             have been watching the whole exchange.  Nicole and Kimberly 
             are obviously disdainful of Buffy's behavior.  Jennifer is 
             feeling sorry for Jeffrey.  Boy does she want him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. CLOTHING STORE - DAY

             A mod, brightly lit store.  A little hipper than your usual 
             mall fare, but not Melrose either.  Bright colors reign.  Buffy 
             is standing by a dressing stall, inspecting her fingernails, 
             talking to Merrick as he changes inside.

                                       BUFFY
                            I mean, most of the time Jeffrey's 
                            really sweet, but sometimes he gets 
                            kind of... 'Me-Tarzan'ish, you know 
                            what I mean?  Lately it bugs me, I 
                            guess.
                                (no response)
                            Merrick?  Are you still breathing?

                                       MERRICK (O.S.)
                                (from inside)
                            I can't work this.

                                       BUFFY
                            We call them zippers.  They're not 
                            supposed to be a challenge.

                                       MERRICK
                            But it's in the back.  Why are we 
                            wasting time with this, anyway?

                                       BUFFY
                            Because you clash, Merrick.  You 
                            clash with everything.  I mean you 
                            might as well go around with a sign, 
                            'Slayers trained her.'  Honestly, 
                            you look like something out of... 
                            Pasadena.

                                       MERRICK
                            My clothes have always been perfectly 
                            serviceable.

                                       BUFFY
                            Well, you're on my turf now.  You're 
                            just gonna have to trust me.

             Merrick comes out of the booth.  He wears multi-colored 
             parachute pants and an equally loud T-shirt.  Buffy looks at 
             him -- he looks at himself.

                                       MERRICK
                            I want to die.

                                       BUFFY
                                (doesn't like it either)
                            Okay.  The important thing is not 
                            to panic.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             EXT. ZEPH'S AUTO REPAIR - LATE AFTERNOON

             Pike is hurriedly working on a part in the hood of his beat-up 
             Dodge, which is filled with all his belongings.  ZEPH stands 
             watching him.  Zeph is about forty-five, greasy, good-natured.  
             Pike works for him.

                                       PIKE
                            You said you'd have the part by 
                            two!  Christ, it's almost dark.

             Pike finishes, slams the hood.  He picks up a battered guitar 
             case and stuffs it into the car, shuts the door.

                                       ZEPH
                            What nasty bug crawled up your bungus 
                            and where the hell are you going?

                                       PIKE
                            I'm leaving, man.  I'm bailing town.  
                            This place has gotten way too hairy.

                                       ZEPH
                            Where am I gonna find another 
                            mechanic stupid enough to work for 
                            my money?

                                       PIKE
                            Hey, have you seen Benny lately?

                                       ZEPH
                            No...  You want me to give him a 
                            message?

                                       PIKE
                            You should think about leaving, 
                            too, man.  Sell this place...  
                            Something's going on here.  I don't 
                            know.  Something real weird.

             Pike gets in the car.  It sputter, starts.

                                       ZEPH
                            Ah, you'll be coming back.

                                       PIKE
                            I don't think so.

                                       ZEPH
                            All right.  Take care of yourself.

                                       PIKE
                            I am.

                                       ZEPH
                            Hey.  What should I do if I see 
                            Benny?

                                       PIKE
                            Run.

             Pike peels out.  Zeph watches him go.

                                       ZEPH
                            That's my guitar...

             ANGLE - THE SUN

             burning down.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. PIKE'S CAR - NIGHT

             On the edge of town.  The car has stalled at an intersection.  
             Pike is hunched over the wheel, his head down as he listens to 
             the rasping ENGINE.

                                       PIKE
                            Come on, come on.  Don't leave me, 
                            baby.  Come on, breathe.

             Amilyn appears in the street in front of the car.  Pike finally 
             hears the SCRAPING OF HIS FEET as he approaches the car.  Pike 
             straightens up slowly, and as the rear view mirror comes INTO 
             THE FRAME, we see there are two more behind him.  They are 
             both high-school age, fresh like Bessel and Benny.  They all 
             approach, slowly.

             Pike waits for a second, his hand on the key.

                                       PIKE
                                (continuing)
                            This is for the money, baby.  Make 
                            me proud.

             He turns the key again and the car ROARS to life.  The 
             headlights trap the hungry scowl of the vampires as Pike pops 
             the car in reverse, smashing into the back two vampires.  They 
             both go flying, hurt but not killed.

             ANGLE - INSIDE THE CAR

             Pike races at Amilyn, but he leaps up as Pike reaches him, and 
             Pike hears a THUD as Amilyn lands on the roof of his car.  
             Pike continues to bullet down the street as a hand suddenly 
             punches through the roof, grabbing at him.  He fights off the 
             hand and tries to control the speeding car.

             It can't be done:  he goes off the road and into a park.  The 
             car careens along.

             ANGLE - ON TOP OF THE CAR

             Amilyn ride it, laughing.

             ANGLE - INSIDE THE CAR

             Pike spots a tree with a low branch and heads for it.  Still 
             fighting, he aims at the branch.  It gets closer.

             ANGLE - ON TOP OF THE CAR

             Amilyn looks up.

             ANGLE - INSIDE THE CAR

             They pass under the branch and we hear a TEARING THUD.  The 
             arm stiffens and falls into Pike's lap.

             The car hits another tree dead on.  Pike slams into the steering 
             wheel.  The guitar case flies right through the windshield and 
             lands on the grass.

             Pike pulls himself slowly from the car.  He is bleeding, but 
             not badly.  Just shaken.  He hears a low, seething WAIL from a 
             few yards back and turns around.  Amilyn is getting shakily to 
             his feet.

                                       PIKE
                            Oh, give me a break.

             Amilyn hisses at him, then turns and races away, snarling, 
             clutching what's left of his arm.

             One of the other vampires nears him.  Pike tries to run and 
             his knees buckle.  He lands on them right next to the guitar 
             case.  As the vampire nears, he pulls the guitar out of the 
             case and swings it, hitting the vampire in the head.  He hits 
             him again.  The vampire bats away the guitar and grabs Pike.  
             Brings his face to Pike's as Pike squirms.

             A blasting kick in the head from Buffy.  The vampire is flung 
             to one side, falls.  He starts up at Buffy and she nails him 
             with a stake.  Pike stares at her.  She pulls a walkie-talkie 
             from her pocket.

                                       BUFFY
                                (into walkie-talkie)
                            I'm on the east side, near the 
                            playground...  all right.

             She puts the walkie-talkie back.

                                       BUFFY
                                (continuing)
                            Hi.

                                       PIKE
                            Hi there.

                                       BUFFY
                            Is that your car?

                                       PIKE
                            It was.  I think it's pretty much 
                            ready for the --

             The last vampire hits Pike from behind.  Without missing a 
             beat, Buffy picks up the guitar and snaps the neck off.  She 
             and the vampire meet in the middle -- the creature barely moves 
             before she buries the guitar neck in its chest.  It falls.

             Merrick runs up.  He is wearing black jeans and a windbreaker.  
             He is more modern than he was before, but subtly.  He sees the 
             decaying bodies, one with a guitar sticking out of its chest.

                                       MERRICK
                            Interesting.

                                       BUFFY
                            I kind of had to improvise.
                                (to Pike)
                            Sorry about your guitar.

                                       PIKE
                            That's okay.  Umm, listen, I'm 
                            not.... I have to fall down now.

             Pike's eyes glaze over slightly as he collapses into Buffy's 
             arms.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. BOILER ROOM - CLOSEUP ON AMILYN - NIGHT

             Thrashing about the room in hysterics, screaming and snarling, 
             banging his one fist on the boiler tank.  It booms hollowly.  
             Lothos grabs him, throws him up against the wall.

                                       LOTHOS
                            What's wrong with you!?!

                                       AMILYN
                            My arm!  He took my fucking arm!

                                       LOTHOS
                            Shut up!  You let him have it!

             Lothos lets Amilyn go.  Amilyn still fumes, quietly.

                                       LOTHOS
                                (continuing)
                            You reckless imbecile.  This place 
                            is ours for the taking and you let 
                            yourself... twelve hundred years 
                            old and you act like a child.

                                       AMILYN
                            I had him in my grasp.

                                       LOTHOS
                            Cheer up.  You may still.

             Only Lothos smiles at the joke.  Amilyn raises his stump, looks 
             at it.  The tattered end of his jacket covers the grossness of 
             it, but it still isn't good.

                                       AMILYN
                                (forlornly)
                            I look horrible.

                                       LOTHOS
                            The other two -- the new ones.  
                            Where are they?

                                       AMILYN
                            I don't know.  But the boy, he 
                            couldn't kill them.

                                       LOTHOS
                                (thoughtfully)
                            No... Not a boy...
                                (gathers himself)
                            Find out if they're dead.  And do 
                            something about that arm.  Honestly, 
                            I don't know how you made it through 
                            the Crusades.

             He turns toward his chamber.

                                       LOTHOS
                                (continuing)
                            Let me know about our little 
                            recruits.  I'll be in my chamber...

             On his way through the door he passes a box on an oil drum.  
             He plucks a large kitten out of it.

                                       LOTHOS
                                (continuing)
                            ... having a snack.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

             Buffy and Pike walk in, Pike still a bit unsteady on his feet.

                                       BUFFY
                            How are you doing?

                                       PIKE
                            Oh, I'm good.  I'm good.  Kind of 
                            miss my knees, though.

                                       BUFFY
                            You want some water or something?

                                       PIKE
                            Water.  Okay.

             They move into the kitchen.

                                       PIKE
                                (continuing)
                            Do you do this kind of thing a lot?  
                            I mean, is this like a hobby?

                                       BUFFY
                            Not exactly.

                                       PIKE
                            They were vampires, weren't they?

                                       BUFFY
                            Yeah.

                                       PIKE
                            God!  Unbelievable.  Vampires.

             Buffy hands Pike the water and they move back into the living 
             room.  Pike curls up in an armchair by the window.  Buffy begins 
             stripping off her bloody clothes, leaving on a tank-top and 
             jeans.

                                       BUFFY
                            You had a car full of stuff.  Were 
                            you leaving?

                                       PIKE
                            Yeah, I was bailing.  I have a 
                            friend, and he's really... well, 
                            he's really vampire, I guess.  Bad 
                            scene.

                                       BUFFY
                            Well, stay here tonight.

                                       PIKE
                            Thanks.  Tomorrow morning, I'm on a 
                            bus.  I'm gone.

                                       BUFFY
                            Where are you gonna go?

                                       PIKE
                            Well, I've always wanted to see 
                            Oxnard.

             As Buffy strips down to her tank top, she notices a gash on 
             her arm.  It's not bleeding much any more, but it's fairly 
             impressive.  Pike jumps up to help as she pats it down with 
             her shirt.

                                       PIKE
                                (continuing)
                            Hey, jeez are you okay?  You need a 
                            hand?

                                       BUFFY
                            It's nothing.  It doesn't hurt.

             Pike looks at her a moment as she wraps her shirt around it.

                                       PIKE
                                (almost awed)
                            Who are you?

             Buffy doesn't look up.  The questions seems to upset her a 
             great deal.  She even fights back tears.

                                       PIKE
                                (continuing)
                            I'm sorry, I just mean... well you 
                            seemed like such a flake.  But, in 
                            a good way!  I can just keep talking 
                            till you strike me dead, or...

             Buffy smiles at this, though still upset.  She sits down.

                                       BUFFY
                            Things are kind of confusing.

                                       PIKE
                            I'll back that up.

                                       BUFFY
                            Three weeks ago all I thought about 
                            was... well, I didn't actually think 
                            about anything.  I definitely didn't 
                            expect this.

                                       PIKE
                            I know.  My guidance counselor never 
                            mentioned anything about vampires.  
                            'Prison' came up a few times, but 
                            nothing about undead.

                                       BUFFY
                            It's weird.  I went back to my old 
                            grade school once, to the playground -- 
                            I used to hang out there all the 
                            time, playing on the swings and 
                            stuff... I went back and it was so 
                            tiny, the whole place.  I couldn't 
                            even fit on the swings.  Everything 
                            just looked so small.
                                (collects herself)
                            I'm sorry.  I'm babbling.

                                       PIKE
                            No, you're not.

             But she stands anyway, head to the stairs.

                                       BUFFY
                            I'm kinda beat.  You can stay in my 
                            mom's room if you want.

                                       PIKE
                            I think I'll just hang out here.  
                            Make sure the sun comes up and 
                            everything.

                                       BUFFY
                            You sure?

                                       PIKE
                            Oh, I'll be fine.  Got my chair, 
                            got my window, I'm great.

                                       BUFFY
                            Mmkay.

             She starts up the stairs.

                                       PIKE
                            Hey, Buffy...

                                       BUFFY
                            Yeah?

                                       PIKE
                            You know, you saved my life.  And I 
                            just wanted to say... I forgive you 
                            for talking during the movie.  
                            Almost.

             She gives him a look, heads upstairs.  He watches her go, looks 
             out the window.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             EXT. BUS TERMINAL

             A bus is pulling out.  We see Pike through the window, looking 
             comtemplative.  He watches the terminal disappear.

             PIKE'S POV

             The streets move by.  On one there is a Police Officer talking 
             to a hysterical Man.  Next to them is a body, covered by a 
             sheet.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             EXT. OUTSIDE SCHOOL - MORNING

             Buffy and Merrick are walking along the path to the steps of 
             the main building, arguing.  Merrick is wearing casual 
             California gear, but again, very subdued.

                                       MERRICK
                            There isn't time.

                                       BUFFY
                            Make time, okay?  You're the one 
                            who told me to act normal.  I've 
                            missed three practices already.  If 
                            I'm not there for the Barber game 
                            tomorrow everyone's gonna talk.

                                       MERRICK
                            Another distraction.  It's not right.

                                       BUFFY
                            Why because it's not my fate?  It's 
                            not in the Book-of-All-
                            Knowledgefullness that I'm gonna be 
                            cheerleading at the Barber game?

                                       MERRICK
                            Sooner or later you're going to 
                            have to accept it.  Your fate.

                                       BUFFY
                            I'm pretty much learning not to 
                            accept anything anymore.  Come on, 
                            Merrick.  Football.  Afterwards we 
                            can kill and kill until there is 
                            nothing left.

                                       MERRICK
                            All right.

                                       BUFFY
                            Toasty.  You should come; it's gonna 
                            be a great game.

                                       MERRICK
                            Oh, I'll be there all right.  I'm 
                            not letting you out of my sight.  
                            Not till you're ready.

                                       BUFFY
                            Try and be inconspicuous, okay?  
                            Act like a fan.

                                       MERRICK
                                (being a fan)
                            Football is my life.

                                       BUFFY
                            You're learning.  Slowly, incredibly 
                            slowly, but you're learning.

             She turns to go.

                                       MERRICK
                            None of the other girls ever gave 
                            me this much trouble.

                                       BUFFY
                            And where are they now?

             She smiles at him and runs up the steps, where Jeffrey is 
             waiting for her.  He looks at the departing figure of Merrick.

                                       JEFFREY
                            So that's your tutor, huh?  What is 
                            he, like, your boyfriend now?

                                       BUFFY
                            Jeffrey.  Projectile vomit.

             They enter the building together.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - NIGHT

             Right before the game.  The scoreboard reads "Hemery vs Barber".  
             Fans fill the stands.  We see Buffy with the other cheerleaders.  
             She's really into it, enjoying herself as they all rally the 
             crowd.

             We see Merrick taking a seat.  He is wearing another new outfit -- 
             a letterman jacket and baseball cap.  He has binoculars around 
             his neck.  He takes his seat amidst the teens.  Real 
             inconspicuous.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. LOCKER ROOM - SAME TIME

             The coach is giving players his pep talk.

                                       COACH
                            Some people say winning is a state 
                            of mind.  Can't win out there if 
                            you don't win --
                                (point to his head)
                            -- in here.  I say, winning isn't a 
                            state of mind.  I say winning is 
                            having more points.  And how do we 
                            get point?  By putting the thing, 
                            the ball over the.. in the place.

                                       AMILYN
                            End zone.

                                       COACH
                            Right.  So I don't care about your 
                            minds.  Maybe you're tired.  Maybe 
                            you're worried about your grades.  
                            Maybe you dog just died or you've 
                            suddenly found that you're attracted 
                            to other men.  I don't care!  'Cause 
                            we're a team.  And there only on 
                            thing that matters to a team.  What 
                            that?

                                       TEAM
                            Winning!

                                       COACH
                            And how do we win?

                                       TEAM
                            By putting the thing in the place!!

                                       COACH
                            So let's go!!

                                       TEAM
                            Yeahh!!!!

             They run out, full of fire.  The coach turns to one player, 
             whose face we cannot see.

                                       COACH
                            There you are!  You missed practice 
                            again.  You're benched till the 
                            fourth, um, the fourth part.  Now 
                            get out there.

             Coach heads out.  The player turns around, smiles after him.  
             It's Grueller.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. STADIUM TUNNEL - SAME TIME

             The players run out toward the field, yelling.  The last of 
             them is Grueller.  He floats behind them slowly, grinning and 
             speaking in a passionless voice, again as if he were repeating 
             words phonetically.

                                       GRUELLER
                            Go team.  Rah.  Go team go.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD  (LATER)

             Fourth quarter.  The scoreboard read "Hemery: 17, Barber: 21".  
             Fifty seconds left.

                                       CHEERLEADERS
                            Two!  Four!  Six!  Eight! 
                            Who do we emasculate! 
                            Barber!  Barber!  Yay!!

             On the sidelines, a player hobbles out and coach pushes Grueller 
             in.  He passes Buffy and she winces slightly.  It messes up 
             the routine and Nicole practically falls over her.

                                       NICOLE
                            Buffy, Jesus!  You know these steps.

                                       BUFFY
                            Sorry.

             Buffy starts cheering again as the players huddle.

             ANGLE - MERRICK

             He is watching Buffy through his binoculars.  A TEEN nudges 
             him.

                                       TEEN
                            Hey, can I borrow your binoculars, 
                            man?

                                       MERRICK
                                (without looking around)
                            No.

                                       TEEN
                            You're checking out the cheerleaders.  
                            All right.  Buffy, man.

             Merrick does turn.

                                       MERRICK
                            What about her?

                                       TEEN
                            Everybody knows about her, man.

                                       MERRICK
                            Knows what about her?

             The teen leans closer.

                                       TEEN
                            She's had sex.

             He nods at Merrick; "You know what I mean".  Merrick turns 
             back.

                                       MERRICK
                            I'm on the wrong bloody side.

             ANGLE - THE FIELD

             The players are lined up.  Grueller, at left tackle, smiles at 
             the player facing him, growls.  The player looks worried.

             The players scramble as Andy hands off.  The carrier gets a 
             few yards.  When the pileup on the line of scrimmage peels 
             apart, the player that had been facing Grueller is unconscious.

             As he is carted off the field, Grueller gleefully trots back 
             to the huddle.

             ANGLE - BUFFY

             Watching the game, a little perplexed.

             ANGLE - THE STANDS

             Merrick watches Buffy.

             ANGLE - THE SIDELINES

             The coach yells at the players.

                            Come on!  Do the thing!  Where you... 
                            go towards the guy!  Come one!  
                            Throw the thing!

             ANGLE - GRUELLER

             Smiling, listening to Andy call the play.

             ANGLE - ANOTHER SECTION IN THE STANDS

             Kimberly sits, complaining to no one in particular.

                                       KIMBERLY
                            What are they doing?  The clock's 
                            running out!
                                (shouts)
                            Throw the ball!

             She sits back, turns to her neighbor.

                                       KIMBERLY
                            Are they so brain-dead?

             Her neighbor smiles at her.  He is a vampire, and he speaks in 
             the same monotone that Grueller used.  He waves a pennant.

             ANGLE - THE FIELD

             The players are lined up again.  Grueller is drooling.  The 
             other team is really worried about him now.

             The snap.  Andy drops back and lobs it to Jeffrey.  Jeffrey is 
             way open.  He catches it easily, looks behind him as he runs.  
             Barber players are rushing at him.  And Grueller is coming at 
             him too, throwing other players right and left.

             Jeffrey looks a little worried.  He bolts down field, toward 
             the end zone, Grueller on his heels.

             ANGLE - BUFFY

             She sees something is definitely wrong.

                                       BUFFY
                            Jeffrey...

             In a flash, she races onto the field.

                            Oh, wow.  She's really lost it.

                            Party hearty.

             Everybody rises to their feet and cheers as Jeffrey makes it 
             to the end zone.

             ANGLE - THE CLOCK

             Two, one, zero.

             ANGLE - THE FIELD

             Grueller hits Jeffrey a second before he is enveloped by other 
             players.  Grueller, hungry with bloodlust, is confused by the 
             exultant crowd, snarling at people.

             Buffy races for the crowd.  She sees Jeffrey is all right.  
             Grueller makes his way out of the throng and up into the stands 
             even as everyone else is rushing onto the field.

             Jeffrey is triumphant.  He sees Buffy running for him and raises 
             his arms.  She passes him right by and continues after Grueller, 
             heads up the stands.  He looks after her, confused, before he 
             is swamped again.

             ANGLE - MERRICK

             He tries to make his way through the crowd.

             ANGLE - TOP OF THE STANDS

             Grueller reaches them and leaps over the back.  Buffy sees 
             him, runs up and without hesitation, dives off herself.

             The stands reach some thirty feet off the ground.  Buffy sails 
             down like a diver, grabs a branch about halfway down.  She 
             swings like a gymnast and the branch snaps.  Still holding the 
             broken branch, she completes a perfect flip and lands on her 
             feet.

             The vampire fan is on the ground behind her, come for her and 
             without stopping or even turning she twirls the branch and 
             sinks the broken end in his heart.

             She looks around for Grueller.  He is booking out, already 
             several yards away..

             Merrick appears at the top of the stands just in time to see 
             Buffy take off after Grueller.

                                       MERRICK
                            Wait!

                                       BUFFY
                                (calls as she runs)
                            He knows who I am!

             She continues to race after Grueller.

             ANGLE - MERRICK

             Running back down the stands, making his way through the 
             dispersing crowd to the nearest exit.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             EXT. STREET - SAME TIME

             Buffy is still following, but she can't keep up.  She spot a 
             BIKER tooling along the street on a Harley.  She comes up to 
             the side of the road and tentatively sticks her thumb out.  
             The biker smiles, stops in front of her.

             ANGLE - THE BIKE

             Ground level, behind the bike, we see its engine revving, smoke 
             puffing from twin pipes.

                                       BIKER
                            Hey, babe.  You want to get some 
                            real power between your legs?

             Buffy looks at the biker a moment.

             ANGLE - THE BIKE

             The same angle as before, ground level.  Suddenly the biker's 
             body lands in front of CAMERA

             CLOSEUP - WHEEL

             spinning

             CLOSEUP - HAND

             revving the engine.

             Buffy takes off at top speed.

                                       BIKER
                            Dyke!  You're a dyke!  I'm telling 
                            the world!

                                                                    CUT TO:

             EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE  (MOMENTS LATER)

             A RUSTLING in the trees signifies Grueller's flight.  Seconds 
             late, Buffy roars into view behind him.  She navigates the 
             streets with less ease than determination.

             Her eyes follow him off the road and she steers the bike on a 
             violently bumpy and erratic course through the site.  She 
             finally hits a pile of bricks and is thrown headlong from the 
             bike.  She hits the ground hard; she rolls into it but has 
             trouble getting up.

             BUFFY'S POV

             Grueller's smiling face appears over her.

                                       GRUELLER
                            Fall down go boom have to see the 
                            nurse.

                                       BUFFY (O.S.)
                            Grueller, God, what did they do 
                            you?

             He brings his face right next to hers.  His voice is no longer 
             passionless; it boils up from hell.

                                       GRUELLER
                            They killed me.

             RESUME SCENE

             He grabs her and hauls her up.

                                       BUFFY
                            No kidding.

             She head-butts him with enormous force, sending him staggering 
             back.  Before he can recover, she dives for a pile of discarded 
             lumber, chooses a nasty shard of wood.

             She turns on Grueller, who is smiling again.  There are two 
             more Vampires approaching her, surrounding her.

                                       GRUELLER
                            The Master walks tonight.  This is 
                            his kingdom, now.

             They rush her.  She takes one on as the second hits her, 
             knocking her over.  They all three swarm over her, meeting her 
             kicks with raking claws.  The two hold her in front of Grueller.

                                       GRUELLER
                                (continuing)
                            You know, Buffy, I've always wanted 
                            you.

             He smiles again and leans toward her neck.

             The stake that pops out through his chest is as much a surprise 
             to him as it is to Buffy.  He falls backward, shocked and dead.  
             Behind him stands Pike.

             One of the other vampires stupidly goes after Pike, who runs 
             away.  Buffy instantly flips the other one over onto Grueller, 
             impaling him as well.

             Pike runs more or less in a circle, yelling, the vampire at 
             his heels.

                                       PIKE
                            I didn't mean it!  I didn't mean 
                            it!

             Wooden shard in hand, Buffy sprints toward them, jumps into a 
             series of flips.  She lands with her legs around the vampire's 
             shoulders, plants the stake in its heart as they topple onto 
             Pike.

             For a moment, Pike and Buffy lie on top of each other, breathing 
             hard.  Then they get up awkwardly, embarrassed by their 
             touching, (and by their slight arousal).

                                       BUFFY
                            I didn't expect to see you.

                                       PIKE
                            I know.

                                       BUFFY
                            Why'd you come back?

                                       PIKE
                            I don't know.  I kind of thought I 
                            ought to be here.  You know, this 
                            isn't exactly the kind of thing you 
                            can run away from.

                                       BUFFY
                            Thanks.

                                       PIKE
                            Besides, Oxnard sucks.

             They start out of the site.

                                       PIKE
                                (continuing)
                            Listen, I... I really do want to 
                            help.  I mean, these guys are dag 
                            nasty, and somewhere my best friend 
                            is out there, and I'd like to, I 
                            don't know.  Even the score.  Do 
                            some damage.  I'm good with damage.

             ANGLE - KIMBERLY'S CAR

             She drives by, see Buffy with Pike.  It's an eyebrow-raiser, 
             but she keeps driving.

                                       BUFFY
                            Pike, I don't think you're up to 
                            this.

                                       PIKE
                            I think I could help.  You gonna 
                            tell me you don't need help?

                                                                    CUT TO:

             EXT. STREET - SAME TIME

             Merrick runs up to the street where Buffy took the Harley.  He 
             has shed the raccoon coat.  The biker is still there, standing 
             in the road trying to thumb a ride.

                                       MERRICK
                            Did you see a girl come by here?

                                       BIKER
                            You don't mean, like, a cheerleader?

                                       MERRICK
                            Yes.

                                       BIKER
                            Yeah, I saw her.  Bitch took my 
                            wheels.

                                       MERRICK
                            Wheels?

                                       BIKER
                            My bike!  She's a lesbian, too.  
                            She told me.

                                       MERRICK
                            Which way did she go?

                                       BIKER
                            Down there.

             He points.  The CAMERA PANS with Merrick as he takes a step in 
             that direction, leaving the biker behind (and momentarily OUT 
             OF FRAME).

                                       MERRICK
                            Idiot girl.  Can't watch over her.  
                            How long ago did --

             The CAMERA PAN back with Merrick as he turns to the biker, but 
             in his place stands Lothos.  Not five feet from Merrick.

                                       MERRICK
                            Oh, my God.

             ANGLE - THE BIKER

             On his knees, Lothos' hand firmly locked around his throat.  
             He cannot move or breathe.

             Merrick and Lothos look at each other a moment.

                                       LOTHOS
                            It's a beautiful night.  I have 
                            never understood the human tendency 
                            to equate darkness with emptiness.  
                            To me the black is so thick with 
                            life, like soil...  like blood.  
                            Darkness writhes under my eye.

             He looks at the night.  Merrick slowly reaches for a gun stuck 
             in the back of his pants as Lothos continues.

                                       LOTHOS
                                (continuing)
                            I know who you are.  She's out her, 
                            as well, isn't she?  Another Slayer.  
                            Who is it this time?  What offering 
                            have you brought me?

             EXT. ANOTHER STREET - ANGLE ON BUFFY - SAME TIME

             She is crouching on the ground, holding her stomach and gritting 
             her teeth.

                                       PIKE
                            Buffy?  What's wrong?

                                       BUFFY
                            Oh, God.  It's him.  I think it's 
                            him.

                                       PIKE
                            Who?

                                       BUFFY
                                (not answering)
                            Merrick...

             Buffy ups and runs in the direction of the noise.  Calls back 
             to Pike.

                                       BUFFY
                                (continuing)
                            Stay here.

             She runs out of sight.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             EXT. STREET - ANGLE ON THE BIKER - SAME TIME

             Lothos lets him go and he falls, dead.

                                       LOTHOS
                            It doesn't really matter.  The names, 
                            the faces, they all melt together.  
                            After a time, there really is no 
                            difference.  One more pathetic bitch, 
                            begging for me to suck on her clotted 
                            heart.

                                       MERRICK
                            This one may surprise you.

             CLOSEUP - THE GUN

             Merrick holds it firm behind his back, finger on the trigger.

                                       LOTHOS
                            I rather doubt it, if she was raised 
                            here.

             He laughs.  He doesn't appear to have noticed the gun, but:

                                       LOTHOS
                                (continuing)
                            Where is she?  I can't wait to meet 
                            her.  Do you think she's ready to 
                            face me?  Or perhaps you can stop 
                            me with that gun.

                                       MERRICK
                            Perhaps.

             Merrick looks out at the trees nearby.

             MERRICK'S POV

             Buffy appears, far away, between the trees.

             Merrick looks at Lothos, afraid he will notice.

             ANGLE - BUFFY

             Approaching, stopping some twenty yards away.  She looks about 
             her for a weapon.

                                       LOTHOS
                            Look at you.  You pathetic thing.  
                            So small, so full of fury.  After 
                            you've served me for a hundred years, 
                            I think you'll have a little more 
                            perspective.

                                       MERRICK
                            I don't think so.

             Lothos rushes suddenly at Merrick, hissing, his feet just off 
             the ground.  Merrick steps back, whips out the GUN, and SHOOTS 
             himself without hesitation in the head.

             Buffy's eyes go wide.

             Lothos growls, holding Merrick's spurting corpse.

             A small, involuntary noise escapes Buffy.

             CLOSEUP - LOTHOS

             Even twenty yards away, he hears.  He spins and stares, starest 
             at CAMERA.  Listening.

             Buffy walks slowly, silently backward, fading back into the 
             dark, terrified and shocked.

             Lothos turns back and looks at Merrick dead in his hands.  
             Disgusted, he lets him drop.

                                       LOTHOS
                            Fool.

             He looks at the blood on his fingers.  After a moment, he tastes 
             it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             EXT. STREET  (LATER)

             Pike is standing by the trees where Buffy stood before, looking 
             out into the street.

             PIKE'S POV

             The same angle as Buffy's, before.  Now Lothos is gone.  Buffy 
             is kneeling quietly by Merrick, holding his head in her lap.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             EXT. A WOOD - JUST BEFORE DAWN

             Through the dark mist Buffy appears, carrying Merrick's body 
             in her arms.  She is alone.  She does not stop.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             EXT. GRAVEYARD - MORNING

             On the outskirts of the graveyard, Buffy finishes filling in 
             Merrick's grave under an old tree.  She is still wearing her 
             cheerleader outfit, now caked with dirt.  She stands at the 
             foot of the grave, tries to think of a prayer.

                                       BUFFY
                            Ummm, our Father, Who art in Heaven, 
                            duhmm... hallowed be Thy name.  
                            Uhh, kingdom come, daily break, I 
                            don't know.  I don't even know if 
                            you're religious.  You probably 
                            are.  But you're dead, you know.  
                            You're just totally dead.  and...

             She sits heavily on his grave.

                                       BUFFY
                                (continuing)
                            ... and I don't know what to do.  
                            You were the one who... I don't 
                            know if the training was over.  I 
                            don't even know if I passed.  You're 
                            so stupid!  How could you be so 
                            stupid?  What am I supposed to do 
                            without you?  You son of a bitch!

             She stops, looks down for a moment.

                                       BUFFY
                                (continuing)
                            Amen.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. ZEPH'S AUTO REPAIR - DAY

             Pike is at work on a contraption.  Built out of scraps and 
             parts, it is the beginnings of a cartridge-load crossbow.  
             Zeph watches, behind him.

                                       ZEPH
                            Hah, I'd knew you'd be back.  Didn't 
                            I say you'd be back?  Ha, ha, ha!  
                            You're sitting in your old car saying 
                            'Nope, I'm never coming back.'  
                            Hee, Hee!  Like you got anywhere to 
                            go.  'I'm never coming back'  But I 
                            knew you would.  Birds got to return 
                            to the nest sooner or later.  That's 
                            what I said.  Just like I told you...

             Pike pays no attention to this babbling monologue.  Over the 
             course of it he takes a slim, handmade wooden shaft, slightly 
             thicker than an arrow, and rubs it with garlic.  He places it 
             in the crossbow, take aim in front of him.  He fires into the 
             tire of a truck.  The tire pops flat.  Zeph cracks up.

                                       ZEPH
                                (continuing)
                            Hah!  Shot the damn tire, dumbass, 
                            didn't even look, just going around 
                            shooting things, popped it flat, ya 
                            bonehead.

             Pike, still not listening, continues to work.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. GYM - DAY

             We see a banner stretched across the central beam of the 
             ceiling.  It reads "THE EARTH IS OUR HOME".  A half dozen 
             inflatable globes dangle from the ceiling.  Nicole and Kimberly 
             are stetting up the drinks table, unloading and stacking 
             hundreds of styrofoam cups.  Jennifer crosses by them, carrying 
             an armful of plastic wrappings and containers.

                                       JENNIFER
                            I got all the plastic stuff.  What 
                            should I do with it?

                                       KIMBERLY
                                ("you idiot")
                            Throw it out.

             Jennifer crosses out as the two resume their conversation.

                                       NICOLE
                            I really was way way too too.

                                       KIMBERLY
                            Oh, please!  When she ran onto the 
                            field in the middle of the game?  
                            Was that the most out-of-it thing 
                            ever, or did I blink?

                                       NICOLE
                            I'm, like, yelling at her, 'What 
                            are you doing?'  And she's going 
                            'Jeffrey, Jeffrey!'  Way mental.

             They laugh.  Jennifer is the first to see Buffy walk in, looking 
             cleaned-up but still ragged.  They stop laughing.

                                       JENNIFER
                            Hi, Buffy.

                            I forgot.

                            Buffy, what is your sitch?  You're 
                            acting like The Thing From Another 
                            Tax-Bracket; it's too weird.

                            what I wanted to tell you guys about.  
                            I need to tell you.  You see... a

                            It's not that at all.  This is an

                            noticed how weird things have gotten 
                            around here?  Like, people 
                            disappearing, people turning up 
                            dead...

                            saw you last night after the game.

                                       KIMBERLY
                            Oh, thank you very much.

                                       NICOLE
                            Like you've got a grip.

                                       KIMBERLY
                            You're so out of it.  You've blown 
                            off cheerleading, you've blown off 
                            dance committee --

                                       BUFFY
                            Excuse me for having something 
                            important to do.

                                       KIMBERLY
                            This isn't important?  The earth is 
                            our home.

                                       BUFFY
                            Kimberly, it's a dance.  It's a 
                            stupid dance with a bunch of stupid 
                            kids that I see every stupid day.

                                       NICOLE
                            So, we're stupid now?

                                       KIMBERLY
                            You know, just because you're having 
                            full-on wiggans doesn't mean you 
                            have to drag us into it.  This isn't 
                            just any dance.  It happens ot be 
                            the last dance of our last year.

                                       NICOLE
                            Except for Prom.

                                       KIMBERLY
                            Right.

                                       JENNIFER
                            And Spring Fling.

                                       KIMBERLY
                            Okay.

                                       NICOLE
                            And the January Semi-formal --

                                       KIMBERLY
                            Okay!  Look, Buffy.  You want to 
                            play house with the unwashed masses, 
                            that's fine.  But personally, I 
                            think you ought to spend a little 
                            time prioritizing.  I really do.

                                       BUFFY
                            Listen to you.  What language are 
                            you speaking?

                                       KIMBERLY
                            Get out of my facial.

             She storms out.

                                       NICOLE
                            Well, I guess you got what you came 
                            for.

                                       BUFFY
                            Nicole...

                                       NICOLE
                            Later for it.

             She also leaves, with Jennifer.  Buffy stands alone in the 
             room, small amidst the streamers.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. BUFFY'S KITCHEN - EVENING

             Buffy stands at the sink, rinsing a glass for way too long, 
             staring.  Her mother breezes THROUGH THE FRAME.

                                       BUFFY'S MOM
                            Dinner's in the fridge, stay away 
                            from the Jag, we'll be back by 
                            twelve.

             She stops, seems to notice something about Buffy.

                                       BUFFY'S MOM
                                (continuing)
                            Buffy, honey?

                                       BUFFY
                                (wanting to talk)
                            Yeah?

                                       BUFFY'S MOM
                            Have you gained a few pounds?  Maybe 
                            it's that outfit...

                                       BUFFY
                            Maybe.

                                       BUFFY'S MOM
                            What's Bobby gonna say?

                                       BUFFY
                            I don't know, Mom; I've never met 
                            Bobby.

                                       BUFFY'S MOM
                                (laughs)
                            Aren't we the chatty ones.  Kiss 
                            noise.

             And she's out.  Buffy looks at her clothes, herself.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             EXT. MALL PARKING LOT - NIGHT

             Pike drives slowly between the cars.  He sees Buffy walking 
             toward the mall.  He pulls up by her, parks.  Gets out of the 
             car.

                                       PIKE
                            Buffy, hey, I've been looking all 
                            over for you.

             Buffy doesn't stop.  He paces her.

                                       PIKE
                                (continuing)
                            I been working on some stuff for 
                            you.  What'cha doing?

                                       BUFFY
                            I'm going shopping.  Don't try to 
                            stop me.

                                       PIKE
                            Cool.  I could actually use a couple 
                            of Allen wrenches.  What do you 
                            need?

                                       BUFFY
                            A dress.

                                       PIKE
                            Dress, huh?  What for?

                                       BUFFY
                            For the dance.

                                       PIKE
                            Come again?

                                       BUFFY
                            I'm going to the senior dance.

                                       PIKE
                                (charades)
                            Second word... sound like 'dance'.

             She stops.

                                       BUFFY
                            I'm going to the dance.

                                       PIKE
                            What for?

                                       BUFFY
                            In order to dance and to drink punch 
                            and to be with my friends.  
                            Comprende?

                                       PIKE
                            I don't believe this.  The world's 
                            under attack by the legions of the 
                            undead and you're going to a mixer?

                                       BUFFY
                            It's not a mixer.  It's the senior 
                            dance.  And it's important.  You 
                            wouldn't understand.

                                       PIKE
                            You got that right.  I thought you 
                            wanted to kill vampires.

                                       BUFFY
                            I don't want to kill anybody, and I 
                            don't want to talk about it anymore.

                                       PIKE
                            Listen, I know you're bummed about 
                            your friend, and I'm really sorry...

                                       BUFFY
                                (offhand, almost disdainful)
                            He did what he was supposed to.

                                       PIKE
                            But, Buffy, you're the guy, the 
                            chosen guy.

                                       BUFFY
                            Right.  I'm the chosen one.  And I 
                            choose to be shopping.

                                       PIKE
                            I should have known.

             Buffy raises her fist at him; he starts back, involuntarily.

                                       BUFFY
                            Leave me alone.

                                       PIKE
                            Benny was right.  You guys are all 
                            exactly the same.

             Buffy walks away, leaving Pike alone.

                                       PIKE
                                (continuing; calls after 
                                her)
                            I'm not disappointed, I'm just angry.

             As Pike walks off, the camera TILTS UP the lamp post behind 
             them.  Benny is perched upon it.

                                       BUFFY
                            Buffy?  Buffy?

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. BOILER ROOM - NIGHT

             Vampires are gathered around.  Lothos stands with Benny.  Benny 
             is beaming.

                                       LOTHOS
                            Buffy...

             Lothos laughs, long and hard.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. THE MALL - NIGHT

             Buffy looks at dresses, most of them fairly tight and fairly 
             out there.  She holds one in front of her, looks in a mirror.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. ZEPH'S AUTO REPAIR - ANOTHER NIGHT

             Pike sits, fiddling with his crossbow.  Looks out the window, 
             discontented.  Laid out next to him we see wooden shafts, 
             garlic, and a cross.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. BUFFY'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

             Buffy lays her dress on the bed.  We cannot see exactly what 
             it looks like.

             She stuffs some blood-stained clothes into a duffel bag along 
             with some stakes.  She tosses the bag in the closet.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             EXT. THE GYM - PROM NIGHT

             Dozens of limos pull up.  Kids pour inside.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. THE GYM - NIGHT

             The party is underway.  Streamers everywhere, tables by the 
             windows.  Couples dance, a D.J spins the tunes.  There is a 
             setup in one corner for taking prom pictures.  The kids are 
             all very elegant and hip.  Every shade of black is represented.

             ANGLE - PUNCH BOWL

             Nicole and Kimberly stand by the punch bowl, chatting.  They 
             are both wearing slinky little black dresses.

             ANGLE - THE DOOR

             There are two: at one end, leading to the house (it's closed) 
             and one leading outside.  Gary Murray stands by the outside 
             door, on guard, as students enter.  He is looking disdainfully 
             at Andy and holding a flask he has confiscated.

                                       ANDY
                            Well, it came with the tux.

             Buffy enters the gym.  She is wearing a long white strapless 
             gown.  It is lovely, but very conservative for this crowd.  
             Over her shoulder is a purse that goes with the dress.  She 
             enters hesitantly, looking around her for Jeffrey.  She passes 
             Andy, who is moving away from Gary Murray.

                                       ANDY
                            Buffy!  Looking tasty.

                                       BUFFY
                            Thanks.  Have you seen Jeffrey?

             But Andy has moved on.  Buffy works her way through the crowd 
             to the punch bowl, sees Nicole and Kimberly.  They stop 
             whispering real quick.

                                       BUFFY
                                (continuing)
                            Hi, guys.

                                       NICOLE
                            Hi.

                                       BUFFY
                            Have you guys seen Jeffrey?  The 
                            limo never showed, I thought he 
                            might be here.

             Nicole and Kimberly look at each other significantly.

                                       NICOLE
                            I haven't seen him tonight.

                                       BUFFY
                            Oh.

             She picks up a glass of punch.

                                       BUFFY
                                (continuing)
                            I'm glad you guys are here.  It's 
                            good to see you.

                                       KIMBERLY
                                (miss sarcasm)
                            Yeah, whoops I came.

                                       BUFFY
                                (tries again)
                            You look way pretty, Kim.

                                       KIMBERLY
                            I know.  I like your little outfit.

                                       NICOLE
                            It's amazing what you can do with a 
                            parachute and some starch.

                                       KIMBERLY
                            As long as there's room for three 
                            in it.  What, didn't you bring your 
                            new friends?

             Buffy is startled by this attack.  Nicole giggles.

                                       BUFFY
                            I guess you guys are mad at me.  
                            I'm sorry.  I've been really --

             Jeffrey suddenly appears between them.  Jennifer is on his 
             arm.

                                       BUFFY
                                (continuing)
                            Jeffrey!  There you are.  I --

             She stops, as everybody assesses the situation.  Buffy is 
             shocked, doing a slow fade to hurt.  Jeffrey is uncomfortable.  
             Jennifer is apoplectic with embarrassment.  Kimberly is in 
             serious giggle, Nicole a bit more restrained, checking it out.

                                       JEFFREY
                            Buffy, what are you doing here?

                                       BUFFY
                            I thought we were meeting here.

                                       JEFFREY
                            I'm here with Jenny.

             -- who is practically hyperventilating, pulling at his arm 
             like a dog on a leash.

                                       BUFFY
                            I don't understand.

                                       JEFFREY
                            Oh, come on, Buffy.  You know what's 
                            going on.  It's not working out at 
                            all.  I've got to move on.  I mean, 
                            I've got needs, too.  I told you 
                            about all this.

                                       BUFFY
                            No, you didn't.  When?

                                       JEFFREY
                            Didn't you get my message?

                                       BUFFY
                            You broke up with my machine?

                                       JEFFREY
                            You weren't home.  Like always.

                                       BUFFY
                            You left me a message?

                                       JEFFREY
                            I'm out of here.  Jenny.

             At the mention of her name Jenny jumps, and in her haste to 
             get away, she bumps into Buffy's arm, spilling bright red punch 
             on Buffy's chest.  She flees, Jeffrey in tow.  They leave the 
             gym.  Kimberly finds it all pretty funny.  Nicole is silent.

             Buffy turns away, toward the wall.  A soft BALLAD come on over 
             the SPEAKERS.  Tears are forming in Buffy's eyes, as she wipes 
             futilely at her dress.  Finally she turns, looks toward the 
             door.

             BUFFY'S POV

             Pike is there, walking in on his own.  He wears a leather jacket 
             and baggy old tux pants, accented by chains, earring and unlaced 
             Doc Martins.  He looks great.

             He walks directly toward Buffy, and does turn a few heads.

                                       PIKE
                            I crashed your party.

                                       BUFFY
                            Pretty shallow of you.

                                       PIKE
                            That's me.

                                       BUFFY
                            I'm glad you came.

                                       PIKE
                            Yeah, you look like you're having a 
                            swell time.

             Pike picks up a glass of punch as he notices the stain on 
             Buffy's dress.  He looks about him a bit, then without 
             hesitation dumps some punch on his lapel, matching stains.  
             Buffy smiles at him.

                                       PIKE
                                (continuing)
                            Will I get the shit kicked out of 
                            me if I ask you to dance?

                                       BUFFY
                            I don't actually think Jeffrey's 
                            gonna notice.

             They begin slow dancing, not too close.

                                       PIKE
                            Yeah, well, you're the one I'm afraid 
                            of.

             They dance for a while, closer and closer.

                                       PIKE
                                (continuing; gee-whizzically)
                            You know, you're not like the other 
                            girls.

             Buffy pulls him closer, holds him, whispers almost weakly in 
             his ear.

                                       BUFFY
                            Yes, I am.

             We see couples dancing, kissing... Gary Murray watching them.

             ANGLE - KIMBERLY

             Sitting by the window with her bovine date, she watches Buffy 
             dance disdainfully.

                                       KIMBERLY
                            I can't believe it.

             The window SHATTERS by her head, a vampire's hand reaching for 
             her.  She screams, starts back.

             Other windows shatter, vampires appearing all around.  A couple 
             of students run for the inner door but it is locked shut from 
             the other side.

             Gradually the party stops as everybody becomes aware of the 
             situation.  They vaguely herd to the middle of the room.

             ANGLE - BUFFY AND PIKE

             Looking around, assessing the situation.

             ANGLE - OUTER DOOR

             A STUDENT runs staggering in, blood spurting from his neck.

                                       BLOODY STUDENT
                            They're out there!  They're vampires!  
                            God, help me!

             He falls to the ground, a few feet in front of the doorway.  
             Nobody moves for a second.  Then one of the students starts 
             toward the body.

                                       BUFFY
                            Don't go near the door.

             Buffy does instead, checking the lifeless body and listening 
             as a number of figures begin to lumber toward the door through 
             the mist.

             Buffy steps back as three 17-year-old vampire come to the door.

                                       1ST VAMPIRE
                            It's party time.

                                       BUFFY
                            Don't worry!  They can't come in 
                            here.  They can't come in unless 
                            they're invited.

                                       KIMBERLY
                            I already invited them.

             Everyone looks at her.

                                       KIMBERLY
                                (continuing; defensively)
                            They're seniors!

             Pike reaches into an inner pocket and pulls out a number of 
             small stakes he has made, hands them to Buffy.  She opens her 
             purse.

             ANGLE - INSIDE THE PURSE

             Cosmetics, hair spray, etc.  She fits the stakes in.

                                       BUFFY
                            The first thing we should --

                                       1ST VAMPIRE
                            Buffy... You wanna dance?

                                       PIKE
                                (to Buffy)
                            Looks like you're busted.

                                       2ND VAMPIRE
                            We want her!  We want Buffy.  Send 
                            her out.

                                       1ST VAMPIRE
                            Or we come in.

             They fade back, almost out of sight.  Pike looks out the window.  
             More are gathering.

                                       GARY MURRAY
                            All right, everybody stay calm.
                                (to Buffy)
                            What's going on?

                                       PIKE
                            Looks bad, Buffy.

                                       SENIOR GIRL
                            Send her out.

                                       BUFFY
                            What?

                                       KIMBERLY
                            They'll kill us!  She's the one 
                            they're mad at.

                                       SENIOR BOY
                            Yeah!  Send her out!

                                       GARY MURRAY
                            Everybody be quiet!

                                       ANDY
                            What, are you kidding?  They'll 
                            kill her!

                                       KIMBERLY
                            They'll kill us!

                                       PIKE
                                (moving toward Kimberly, 
                                fist raised)
                            You want some punch?

                                       GARY MURRAY
                            I got detention slips here, I'm not 
                            afraid to use them...

             But other students have picked up the cry, are clamoring to 
             sacrifice Buffy.  Pike crosses to his bag, sitting by the door.

             Two guys move toward Buffy, Andy intervenes.  Pike steps in 
             front of Buffy, holding his custom made cartridge-load crossbow.  
             Trains it on the others.  They quiet down.

                                       PIKE
                            There's gotta be a back way out of 
                            here, or something.

             Buffy looks at the partygoers.  Her friends.  They stare back 
             at her, scared, angry.  She looks out the door.  Back at her 
             friends.

                                       BUFFY
                            I'm going out the front.

                                       PIKE
                            Are you nuts, Buffy?  There's a 
                            hundred of them out there.  They'll 
                            rip us apart.

                                       BUFFY
                            You're staying here.
                                (before he can speak)
                            Some of them might not come after 
                            me.  If they don't this place is 
                            gonna turn into a total stain.

                                       PIKE
                            You say that like it's a bad thing.

                                       ANDY
                            Buffy, this is crazy.  What do these 
                            guys want?

                                       BUFFY
                            Andy, start breaking up some chairs.  
                            You'll need weapons.

             Andy looks at her a moment, moves off.  Buffy goes to Pike's 
             bag, starts pulling out stakes.

                                       BUFFY
                                (continuing)
                            Good thing one of us was prepared.

                                       PIKE
                            Buffy, there's no way you're going 
                            out there alone.

             Buffy stands up.  She kisses Pike very hard on the lips.

                                       BUFFY
                            Don't piss me off.

             She kneels down, begins to rip the hem of her dress.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             EXT. OUTSIDE THE GYM - NIGHT

             We see the doorway to the gym.  A mist has risen around the 
             entire house, swirling about the feet of the undead who stand 
             clustered about it.  Some have keen and eager expressions, 
             some vacant, half-conscious with bloodlust.  They wait.

             A figure appears in the doorway, walking slowly out.  Buffy.  
             Her torn dress now comes to just above her knees.  She wears 
             Pike's leather jacket over it.  She wears her purse strapped 
             across her chest under the jacket.  In one hand she holds his 
             crossbow; in her other hand is a cross.  As she steps further 
             away from the doorway, the vampires slowly begin to close around 
             her.

             The door shuts behind her.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. THE GYM - SAME TIME

             Kimberly and some of the others are anxiously barricading the 
             door.  Pike looks out the window after Buffy.

                                       PIKE
                                (to himself)
                            Come on, move.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             EXT. THE GYM - SAME TIME

             The vampires move closer and closer.  They circle her.  She 
             waits, apprehensive.  When they are about eight feet from her 
             she whips out a bottle of Perrier.  She sprays it all around, 
             searing the inner circle.  Screaming, they clutch their faces.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                            Yes!

             Others are watching as well.  Andy comes up with some chair-
             made stakes, hands some to Pike.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             EXT. THE GYM - SAME TIME

             Buffy is defending herself in an astounding blur of gymnastics 
             and martial arts.  Leaping, throwing kicks, punches, and the 
             odd stake, she manages to scatter them enough to make a run 
             for it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. THE GYM - SAME TIME

             Everyone is watching through the windows as the vampires follow 
             after Buffy.

                                       KIMBERLY
                            It's okay!  I think they're going 
                            after her!

                                                                    CUT TO:

             EXT. THE GYM - SAME TIME

             Almost as if it heard that, one of the vampires turns toward 
             the gym, grinning hugely.  It and at least half the others 
             turn back toward the easy pickings inside.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                            Let's get away from these windows!  
                            Find something to cover them with.

             Students start mobilizing.

                            Bring round the table.

                            There's nails and stuff we used to 
                            put everything up.

                            Get 'em.

             Andy and some others drag a table forward.  Pike helps hoist 
             it up against the window.  He looks one last time outside, 
             then covers it up.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             EXT. CAMPUS LAWN - SAME TIME

             Buffy runs.  She heads toward the nearby cluster of school 
             buildings.  Close behind are the undead.  She passes a line of 
             parked cars.

             ANGLE - CAR

             Jeffrey and Jennifer are in the back of his parked BMW, making 
             heated, clumsy love.  We can see them through the window.

                                       JENNIFER
                            Oh, yes!  Yes!

                            woman!

             As they are spouting this nonsense, Buffy zooms IN and OUT OF 
             the FRAME behind the car.  After a second she walks back INTO 
             the FRAME, staring at the two of them.

                                       BUFFY

                            Oops!

             She books out again, the horde on her heels.

             JEFFREY'S POV

             Vampires swarm about the car in pursuit of Buffy.

             Jeffrey goes wide-eyed at the sight.  Starts climbing off 
             Jennifer and into the driver's seat.

                                       JEFFREY

             INT. THE GYM - SAME TIME

             Windows and the boards covering them begin to smash inward.  A 
             student pounding in nails is caught, pulled out the window.  A 
             vampire crawling in is spiked by Pike.  Another makes it in 
             and is smashed on the head repeatedly by Andy.  It staggers, 
             smilingly, and turns toward him.

                                       PIKE
                            The heart!  Stab them in the heart!

             Andy manages to shove the two-by-four in its heart just as it 
             gets its fingers around his throat.

             Kimberly screams.  One of them has hold of her, starts pulling 
             her out the window.  Nicole runs to her, starts pulling the 
             vampire's hands off her.  Suddenly, the vampire grabs Nicole 
             instead.  Off balance, she is almost out the window before 
             Kimberly can react, and all Kim can do is scream.  Andy and 
             Pike make it to the window too late; Nicole is pulled out, and 
             they swarm over her.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             A vampire catches up to Buffy.  She shoots the last crossbow 
             shaft at it.  Shucks the bow away as another reaches her.  She 
             wrestles with it, fights it off but doesn't kill it.  Moves on 
             as more approach.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             Students are still holding most of them at the windows.  One 
             or two have gotten in.

             ANGLE - THE RECORD PLAYER

             A junior vampire has snuck behind it and is going through the 
             records.  He stops, finding one he likes, and starts to put it 
             on.  MUSIC: "Teen Angel".  It wafts over the carnage in the 
             gym, lending it a surreal and dreamy quality.

             Hearing the music, another vampire grabs Kimberly and starts 
             dancing with her.  She screams a lot.

             It's about to plant one on her neck when Pike stabs it in the 
             back.  Pike turns from the dying vampire and is face to face 
             with Benny.

             Pike is frozen for a moment.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             Buffy approaches the nearest building to the gym.  The vampires 
             are several feet behind her, some twenty of them.

             The door is locked.  She smashes it in with her shoulder.  
             Runs inside.

             A few vampires are about to follow Buffy into the building 
             when a hand is suddenly raised before them, stopping the.  
             Slowly they start fading back.

             It is Amilyn.  He smiles at the other vampires, and raises his 
             fingers to his lips.

             Shhhh....

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. THE GYM - CLOSEUP ON A TABLE - SAME TIME

             Pike is slammed down onto it, Benny's face inches from his.  
             "Teen Angel" has been replaced by some hard rock.

                                       BENNY
                            Isn't this great, Pike?  Isn't it 
                            great?  Finally got those bitches 
                            on the run.

             He hoists Pike up and backhands him in the jaw, sends him flying 
             against a wall.  Pike shakes his head as Benny comes at him 
             again, no longer smiling.

                                       BENNY
                                (continuing)
                            Of course I'm angry!  I leave you 
                            alone for five minutes, and look 
                            who you're hanging out with!

             He turns suddenly and grabs a girl, yells in her face.

                                       BENNY

                            I want a girl that tastes good!

             She faints and he drops her, turns back to Pike.  Pike is 
             getting shakily to his feet.  Blood trickles down his forehead.

                                       BENNY
                                (continuing)
                            I was gonna change you, man.  I was 
                            gonna give you life!  Do you know 
                            what that means?

             Gary Murray, yelling orders at student, holding a board against 
             a window as vampires pound on it.  The exposed part of the 
             window above him shatters, raining glass on his head.

             ANGLE - THE PHOTO SETUP

             A vampire is clutching a helpless girl as another vampire takes 
             their picture with an Instamatic.  He expresses confusion and 
             dismay when his image does not come out in the photo.

             ANGLE - PIKE AND BENNY

             Pike is backing away from Benny, who is approaching him.  Pike 
             passes an overturned table, the stubs of its broken legs 
             sticking up at the ceiling.

                                       BENNY
                            Never die.  Never get kicked around, 
                            never get busted.

             Benny grabs him with hateful force.  His fingers dig into Pike's 
             arms enough to draw blood.

                                       BENNY
                                (continuing)
                            It means never having to say you're 
                            sorry!  And you blow it all off for 
                            that slut?!  What about my needs?!

             Pike suddenly grabs Benny, holds him tightly in a brotherly 
             embrace.  Benny is thrown slightly by this.

             Still holding him, Pike pitches onto the table, driving the 
             leg-shard through Benny's back.  Pike still holds Benny as he 
             twitches and screams, dying.  Finally, he lets go, gets up.  
             He looks a little dazed, a little lost.  A window shattering 
             far behind him pulls his eyes back into focus, and he goes to 
             help.

             ANGLE - KIMBERLY

             Sitting by a wall, tiny and silent amid the carnage.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. HALL - SAME TIME

             Buffy moves quickly along, crouching near a window and peering 
             out.  Nothing.  She looks about her, waiting for an attack.  
             She checks her purse.

             ANGLE - BUFFY'S PURSE

             Cosmetics and hair spray.  A small cross.  No stakes left.

             Muttering under her breath, she moves swiftly into a classroom.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. CLASSROOM - SAME TIME

             Still moving cautiously, she heads for the window and pulls 
             down the shade.  She crouches behind the teacher's desk and 
             pulls the chair down to her, laying it on its side.

                                       BENNY
                                (cattily, to herself)
                            'Ooh, make me a woman, Jeffrey... 
                            oh, Jeffrey, you're so atheletical... 
                            I love you...'

             She slams her elbow down on the chair leg -- very controlled, 
             efficient motion -- and snaps it off.  Looks around to see if 
             anyone is around to hear as she picks up the leg, now a weapon.

             She goes softly to the door, peers cautiously out.

             CLOSEUP - BUFFY

             Looking out.  Amilyn's face appears right next to her, also 
             looking out.

                                       AMILYN
                            All clear?

             Buffy screams, turns, and Amilyn decks her, sends her flying 
             back into the classroom.  The stake flies out of her hand.  It 
             lands on a desk by the window.

             Buffy does not land nearly as well, crashing into a pile of 
             desks and twisting her leg badly.  Amilyn laughs repulsively, 
             advancing.

                                       AMILYN
                            Pleased to meet you!  Won't you 
                            guess my --
                                (kicks her hard)
                            -- name?

                                       BUFFY
                                (defiantly, through the 
                                pain)
                            It wouldn't be 'Dick,' would it?

             He kicks her again.

                                       BUFFY
                                (continuing)
                            'Lefty'?

                                       AMILYN
                            You're a fool, bloodbag.  Die a 
                            fool and go to hell!

             He grabs her by the neck with his one arm and pins her against 
             the wall in the corner.  She reaches for the stake but it is 
             just out of reach.  He is squeezing the life out of her, his 
             face inches from hers.

                                       AMILYN
                                (continuing)
                            The chosen one.  You're just another 
                            bloodbag -- not even fit to die for 
                            the Master.  When will you ever 
                            learn?

             Buffy looks about for succor.

             ANGLE - THE WINDOW SHADE

             Buffy eyes the bottom of the shade, the pull dangling aimlessly.

                                       BUFFY
                                (with difficulty)
                            I do know... one thing...

                                       AMILYN
                            What?

                                       BUFFY
                            I know... what time sunrise is.

             She pulls down hard on the shade pull and lets go.

                                       AMILYN
                            No!

             He turns in horror, letting go of Buffy, trying to catch the 
             shade.  The instant he releases her, Buffy grabs the stake and 
             in one swift motion, buries it in Amilyn's back.

             The shade goes up, flapping loudly as it spins.  It is still 
             pitch black out.  Amilyn stare, wide-eyed and silent, at the 
             night as he dies.

                                       BUFFY
                            It's in about four hours, Dick.

             Amilyn spins, dying rage in his eyes.  He grabs her.  His 
             strength is formidable even as his body begins to smoke.  
             Suddenly screaming, he forces her over suddenly with such power 
             that the two of them go crashing through the floorboards.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. LOTHOS' CHAMBER - SAME TIME

             The two of them fall through the ceiling directly into the 
             blood pool.

             Amilyn's body surfaces first, now just a husk.

             Buffy pops up from the waist-deep blood, soaked and wounded.  
             She stays a moment, breathing hard.  Suddenly her eyes go wide.

                                       BUFFY
                            Oh, god, no... not yet...

             Lothos rises from the pool, smiling.  Buffy is clearly paralyzed 
             by fear.

                                       LOTHOS
                            I knew you'd come.

             He moves toward her.

                                       LOTHOS
                                (continuing)
                            You knew it, too, didn't you?  All 
                            your life, dreaming... waiting to 
                            feed me.

             Buffy is suddenly galvanized into action.  She throws a few 
             punches at Lothos, but he takes them without flinching.  She 
             grabs at the stake in what remains of Amilyn's chest.  Lightning 
             quick, Lothos closes his hand around her and squeezes till the 
             stake splinters and she screams with pain.  He knocks her back 
             on her ass.

             She starts moving backward, away from him, but it is hard enough 
             for her to make her way through the thick gore.  Lothos 
             contemplates Amilyn's corpse, and his face darkens.

                                       LOTHOS
                                (continuing)
                            Ah, my fool is dead.  He was 
                            careless, always.  Still, I'll pull 
                            out your tongue for that.
                                (coming toward her)
                            Don't you understand?  I've killed 
                            you a dozen times.  Your life is 
                            not a blink of my eye, not a single 
                            breath.  I have lived in the shadows, 
                            in the pulsing filth behind men's 
                            eyes.  A thousand years, and more.  
                            I have conversed with the worms 
                            that fed on my corpse and I have 
                            bathed in the blood of emperors.

                                       BUFFY
                                (breaking the spell)
                            Have you ever thrown up in the front 
                            row of a Richard Marx concert?

                                       LOTHOS
                            What?

             And she is up, turning to run.  He is thrown momentarily by 
             her insolence.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. LOTHOS' CHAMBER - THE BOILER ROOM - SAME TIME

             But he is on her the moment she emerges from the chamber, 
             grabbing her by the hair and throwing her to the ground.

                                       LOTHOS
                            You waste time.  That is a sin.

             He kneels over her prostrate body.  She is reaching frantically 
             into her purse.  He runs his hand along her body, a gesture 
             both lustful and disdainful.

                                       LOTHOS
                                (continuing)
                            You're even weaker than the others.

                                       BUFFY
                            I think you've forgotten something.

             She pulls out a small cross, holds it in front of him.  He 
             snarls at it, then grabs it, his hand around her.  The cross 
             bursts into flame.  He holds her hand onto it.

                                       LOTHOS
                            This?  This is you only weapon?  
                            Your puny faith?

                                       BUFFY
                            No...

             With her other hand, Buffy holds up her hair spray.

                                       BUFFY
                                (continuing)
                            ... my keen fashion sense.

             She squeezes it at him, the spray catching fire form the cross 
             and whooshes a jet of flame right into his face.  He screams, 
             letting her go and backing up.  Hey, his head is on fire!

             Buffy turns and hobbles away.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. LOTHOS' CHAMBER - SAME TIME

             Lothos stumbles about, head all aflame, till he finally pitches 
             into the pool.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. LOTHOS' CHAMBER - HALL - SAME TIME

             Buffy comes out of the boiler room and hobbles along, moving 
             as fast as she can.

                                       BUFFY
                            This is the suckiest party I have 
                            ever been to.  It's not even a 
                            contest.

             She reaches a locked door that says "Gymnasium -- Authorized 
             Personnel Only".  Puts her shoulder to it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. LOTHOS' CHAMBER - CLOSEUP ON LOTHOS - SAME TIME

             As he pulls himself out of the pool, we are treated to a good 
             look at his new head.  It is charred and torn almost beyond 
             recognition.  It is so inhuman looking, that we are almost 
             surprised when it screams!

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. LOTHOS' CHAMBER - HALL - SAME TIME

             The SCREAM fills the hall.  Buffy is still working on the heavy 
             metal door.  She turns, wide-eyed, at the SOUND.

                                       BUFFY
                            Oops.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. LOTHOS' CHAMBER - LOTHOS' POV - SAME TIME

             We TRACK rapidly through the cave, through the boiler room, 
             the hall.  We're moving much too fast to be running.

                                                                    CUT TO:

             INT. GYM - SAME TIME

             Buffy pulls herself up through a trap door in the corner.  
             Everything stops.  For a moment there is silence.

             Buffy gets shakily up.

                                       KIMBERLY
                            Don't let her in!  Don't let her 
                            in!

             Pike and the others see her.  Pike and Andy run to her to help.

                                       KIMBERLY
                                (continuing)
                            They'll kill us!  Get her out!

             Gary Murray stops in front of Kimberly, takes her face in his 
             hand and lightly pops the back of her head against the wall.  
             Cross-eyed, she slides back down into comatic silence.

                                       PIKE
                            Are you okay?

                                       BUFFY
                            Get away from me!

             She pushes them away.  Lothos crashes through the trap door 
             behind her, ugly and crazed.  He picks her up, floating a good 
             two feet off the ground.

                                       LOTHOS
                            You bitch!

             He hurls her the length of the room.  She hits a locker, which 
             opens, spilling out someone's notebook.  The binder falls open, 
             inside it is a plastic pen case with pens and pencils within.

             Buffy looks, by this time, like shit.  She props herself up as 
             best she can, looks about her.  There is nothing wooden, nothing 
             sharp, within reach.

                                       LOTHOS
                                (continuing)
                            You would challenge me?

             Andy charges Lothos from behind.  Pike tries to stop him, but 
             is too late, as Lothos grabs him by the face without even 
             looking at him.

                                       LOTHOS
                                (continuing; to Buffy)
                            I'll rip the flesh from your stinking 
                            bones!

             Squeeze Andy's head until we hear something crack.  Lets him 
             drop.  Looks around at the cowed students.

                                       LOTHOS
                                (continuing)
                            I am a God!  A God!

                                       BUFFY
                            I am so sure.

             Lothos roars.  Furious, he charges Buffy, his feet just skimming 
             the ground, racing toward her, violently fast, upon her...

             She spins, on her feet in a flash, one quick motion.  She 
             thrusts her palm forward and stops him, cold, like Superman 
             stopping a train, palm at his chest.

             Silence.  Buffy looks directly into his eyes, the mad rictus 
             of his face.

             Lothos stops, almost wide-eyed, as he looks down at his chest.

             Sticking out of the middle of his chest is a small eraser, and 
             a #2.

             He steps back, staring at Buffy.  The expression on his horrible 
             face seems to have changed to one almost of respect.  Her look 
             is unfathomable.

             Lothos smiles, graciously.

                                       LOTHOS
                            It doesn't... hurt... as much as I 
                            had imagined.

             He falls gently to the ground.  He's dust before he hits it.

             Silence.  One by one the vampires, stricken, slip out into the 
             night.

             ANGLE - PIKE

             Kneeling by Andy's body.  He gets up, and walks toward what's 
             left of Lothos, warily keeping his eye on the spot.  In the 
             background we see Gary Murray, running out after a vampire.

                                       GARY MURRAY
                            Just a minute, you!  I'm not finished 
                            with you!

             Pike kneels by the pile of dust with a pencil in it.

             Everybody is looking at Buffy.  She stares back at the students 
             who cast her out.  Turns and walks out.  Pike follows her.

             We see the direct aftermath; the gym, police cars, people 
             helping the wounded.  Over this is the voice of a reporter.

                            The death toll now reaches twelve

                            High School.  It was at the Senior 
                            Prom five days ago that the school 
                            was beset by a roving gang of crack-
                            crazed gunmen.  Survivors say some 
                            two hundred of the ruffians laid 
                            the school gym under a kind of siege, 
                            claiming several lives in the 
                            process.  Said one administrator, 
                            'Things here will never be the same.'

             Kim climbs out and joins Jeffrey, Jennifer and a boy and girl 
             we don't know.  They are all in bathing gear, with fluorescent 
             zinc on their noses.

                                       JENNIFER
                            She was even crazier after that.  I 
                            mean it, you wouldn't even have 
                            recognized her.

             Jennifer nods.  Kimberly wrinkles her nose in distaste.

                            She didn't even hardly talk to anyone 
                            in school.  All year.  She didn't 
                            even go to the prom.

                            The worst is, her parents -- this

                            send her to the Bahamas for 
                            graduation, and she refused.  True 
                            story.  She said she didn't want to 
                            go.  It is to vomit.

             EXT. A COURTYARD - LATE EVENING

             Buffy and Pike are walking up the elaborate stone drive toward 
             us.  We can't really tell where they are, but there are trees, 
             hills in the background.

             Buffy leads the way.  She is confident, at ease.  She wears a 
             large old sports jacket, a baseball cap pulled backward.  Skirt 
             and sneakers.  Casual, cool, but disarming.  She carries a 
             knapsack.

                                       PIKE
                            I didn't say it was a bad idea, I 
                            just said the timing was off.  We 
                            could maybe wait till later.

                                       BUFFY
                            Don't be such a fraidy-cat.

                                       PIKE
                            Who's afraid?  Besides me, I mean.

                                       BUFFY
                            We've come all this way.  We just 
                            have to check it out.  I got a hunch.

                                       PIKE
                            You're the boss, boss.  I just 
                            thought maybe we should wait.

             Buffy stops at a large, elaborately carved door.  She turns to 
             Pike.

                                       BUFFY
                            Trust me.

             ANGLE - DOOR KNOCKER

             Buffy grabs the large metal knocker, ringed through a gargoyle's 
             mouth.

             And on the boom of the knocker, we see:

             WIDER ANGLE - THE CASTLE

             The castle.  Archetypal, turreted, terrifying.  Standing lonely 
             on the craggy hill, drenched in the light of the rising moon.

                                                                 BLACK OUT.

           FINN (INTO RADIO)
           Leland, it's Finn. Please respond.
           Over.
                         
          AN ACCESS DOOR OPENS LOUDLY below. A boxy, monacle-wearing
          German car enters. This is PROFESSOR OTTO ZUNDAPP.
                         
                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           (in German and English)
           Too many cars here. Out of my way!
                         
                          FINN
           Professor Zundapp?
                         
           PACER (O.S.)
           Here it is, Professor.
                         
          Zundapp approaches a NOSY PACER who idles next to a CRATE.
                         
                          NOSY PACER
           You wanted to see this before we
           load it?
                         
                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           Ah, yes. Very carefully...
                         
          A forklift opens the crate -- inside is a TV CAMERA, packed
          carefully in foam. Finn SNAPS PHOTOS FURIOUSLY.
                         
                          NOSY PACER
           Oh. A TV camera. What does it
           actually do?
           4.
                         
                         
                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           This camera is extremely dangerous.
                         
                          FINN
                          (TO HIMSELF)
           What are you up to now, Professor?
                         
          Finn, angling for a better view, FIRES SUSPENSION WIRES ---
                         
          --- which sail clear to the other side of the derrick ---
                         
          --- THOK! They hook tightly onto a steel girder.
                         
          Finn slides out ONTO THE WIRE like an acrobat, then expels
          another cross-wire for support.
                         
                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           This is valuable equipment. Make
           sure it is properly secured for the
           voyage.
                         
                          NOSY PACER
           You got it.
                         
          Finn LOWERS HIMSELF. He snaps more pictures.
                         
           GREM (O.S.)
           Hey, Professor Z!
                         
          Zundapp turns as a CRANE LOWERS A CAR-SIZED CRATE. GREM and
          ACER, an orange Gremlin and a green Pacer, flank it.
                         
                          GREM
           This is one of those British spies
           we told you about.
                         
                          ACER
           Yeah. This one we caught sticking
           his bumper where it didn't belong.
                         
          Finn PRODUCES SEMI-AUTOMATIC GUNS from his side, readies
          himself for a tag-team spy fight with his buddy Leland.
                         
                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           Agent Leland Turbo.
                         
          The crate is lifted, revealing a CRUSHED, CUBED Leland Turbo.
                         
          Finn's eyes go wide. Suddenly --- WHOOOSHHH! Another derrick
          flame rises behind him, casts a Finn-shaped SHADOW over the
          Professor. He looks up.
           5.
                         
                         
                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           It's Finn McMissile! He's seen the
           camera! Kill him!!
                         
          Finn UNLOADS with bullets as he starts to retreat --- He
                         STOPS:
                         
          BAD GUY CARS are waiting for him on the catwalk where he just
          came from - BLOWTORCHES ready.
                         
          Finn, stuck in midair, notices an angry CRANE. Finn GRINS,
          having just found his escape.
                         
          THWAPTHWAPTHWAP!!! Finn releases three of his four cables,
          swinging, Indiana Jones-style on the last one TOWARD THE
                         CRANE ---
                         
          --- where he lands on its BOOM, drives UP and LAUNCHES OFF IT
          where he LANDS - MOVING - onto another deck!
                         
          Finn now DRIVES, spraying oil and screeching around corners.
          A GREMLIN in pursuit hits the oil patch, loses control ---
                         
          --- and PLUMMETS OFF the side of the rig!
                         
          The Gremlin FALLS... it's like an eternity...
                         
          He smashes into the water and breaks into a million pieces.
                         
          ON FINN - Now set upon by 20 or 30 MORE pursuing cars. He has
          nowhere to go but UP UP UP a ramp toward the helipad. He
          spies some GASOLINE BARRELS, fires a SINGLE BULLET which cuts
          through its leather straps, sending barrels DOWN the ramp,
          PAST FINN ---
                         
          --- PAST the pursuing CARS ---
                         
          --- to the bottom where they EXPLODE in a CHAIN REACTION back
          UP THE RAMP, taking out at least 15 CARS!
                         
          ON THE HELIPAD - Finn blasts into view, pulls to a stop. No
          more road. Nowhere else to go.
                         
          The 20 BAD GUY CARS that are still in pursuit surround him,
          fire up their blowtorches. About to pounce.
                         
          Finn GRINS. The second time we've seen this grin. It means
          he's got something cooking.
                         
          Finn's REVERSE LIGHTS appear. He DRIVES BACKWARD off the edge
          of the helipad to the SHOCK of the other cars.
                         
          Finn falls. He turns himself so he's grill first, cleanly
          cutting into the water.
           6.
                         
                         
          He EMERGES, now sprouting HYDROFOIL and speeds away.
                         
                          GREM
                          (NONPLUSSED)
           Get to the boats.
                         
          THE BOATS - an army of combat ships quickly DROP into the sea
          and CHURN WATER with unprecedented fury as they quickly make
          up the distance between them and Finn, FIRING BULLETS as they
          do so.
                         
                          ACER
           He's getting away!
                         
                          COMBAT SHIP
           Not for long.
                         
          The LEAD COMBAT SHIP quietly drops a TORPEDO into the water.
          It skips along, connecting with Finn in his rear and
          EXPLODING with such force that water skyrockets into the
          night clouds.
                         
          UNDERWATER - McMissile SINKS. Then, he blinks. He GRINS.
          We're starting to like this grin and what follows it. He now
          CONVERTS into a submarine. From his trunk he releases four
          DECOY tires which float to the surface like body parts.
                         
          ON THE DERRICK - Professor Zundapp watches it all from far
          away.
                         
           GREM (OVER RADIO)
           He's dead, Professor.
                         
                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           Wunderbar. With Finn McMissile
           gone, who can stop us now?
                         
          EXT. RADIATOR SPRINGS - DAY
                         
          TOW MATER, a rusty tow truck, putters into view.
                         
                          MATER
           Mater. Tow Mater, that's who... is
           here to help you!
                         
          He approaches a broken-down sedan on the side of the road. He
          drives around to the front, catching OTIS' face for the first
          time.
                         
                          MATER
           Hey, Otis!
           7.
                         
                         
                          OTIS
           Hey, Mater. Gosh, I'm so sorry. I
           thought I could make it this time,
           but...
           (he tries to start his
           engine, stalls)
           Smooth like pudding, huh? Ah, who
           am I kidding? I'll always be a
           lemon.
                         
          Mater hooks his friend and starts towing him.
                         
                          MATER
           Well dadgum, you're leaking oil
           again. Must be your gaskets. Hey,
           look on the bright side: This is
           your tenth tow this month, so that
           means it's on the house.
                         
                          OTIS
           You're the only one that's nice to
           lemons like me, Mater.
                         
                          MATER
           Don't sweat it. These things happen
           to everybody, Otis.
                         
                          OTIS
           But you never leak oil.
                         
                          MATER
           Yeah, but I ain't perfect. Don't
           tell nobody, but I think my rust is
           starting to show through.
                         
          Mater and Otis drive past THE RADIATOR SPRINGS WELCOME SIGN.
          It has been amended to say: "Home of Lightning McQueen."
                         
                          OTIS
           Hey, is Lightning McQueen back yet?
                         
                          MATER
           Not yet.
                         
                          OTIS
           He must be crazy-excited about
           winning his fourth Piston Cup.
           Four! Wow!
           8.
                         
                         
                          MATER
           Yeah, we're so dadgum proud of him.
           But I sure wish he'd hurry up and
           get back `cause we got a whole
           summer's worth of best friend fun
           to make up for. Just me and --
                         
          Ahead of them, a half-mile off, a RED RACE CAR is visible.
                         
                          MATER
           --- McQueen!
                         
          Mater FLOORS IT, dragging poor Otis behind him.
                         
                          OTIS
           Uh, Mater? I'm in no hurry. You
           don't need to go so fast!
                         
          Boom! They hit a bump. Otis catches air.

                          MCQUEEN
           Mater, it's so good to see you.
                         
                          MATER
           You too, buddy.
                         
          Mater and McQueen do an ELABORATE TIRE BUMP (fist bump
          style).
                         
                          MATER
           Oh, man. You ain't gonna believe
           the things I got planned for us.
                         
          Everyone watches as the tire bump continues.
                         
                          MACK
           (to Lizzie, an aside)
           These best friend greetings get
           longer every year.
           10.
                         
                         
                          MATER
                          (TO MCQUEEN)
           You ready to have some serious fun?
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Well, actually I've got something
           to show you first.
                         
          INT. RADIATOR SPRINGS MUSEUM - DAY
                         
          CLOSE ON THE PISTON CUP. It has now changed, been adorned
          with a small likeness of Doc. It says "Hudson Hornet Piston
          Cup."
                         
                          MATER
           Wow. I can't believe they renamed
           the Piston Cup after our very own
           Doc Hudson.
                         
          McQueen and Mater are alone, the museum closed to the public.
          McQueen approaches a "Hudson Hornet" wall with Doc's three
          Piston cups, framed articles, other racing ephemera.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           I know Doc said these things were
           just old cups, but to have someone
           else win it just didn't feel right,
           you know?
                         
                          MATER
           Well, Doc would've been real proud
           of you. That's for sure.
                         
          McQueen takes this in.
                         
          EXT. RADIATOR SPRINGS - LATER
                         
          McQueen and Mater exit the Doc Hudson Museum.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Alright, pal. I've been waiting all
           summer for this. What've you got
           planned?
                         
                          MATER
           You sure you can handle it?
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Come on, you know who you're
           talking to? This is Lightning
           McQueen. I can handle anything.
           11.
                         
                         
          EXT. RADIATOR SPRINGS - DAY
                         
          Mater and McQueen roll on an old train track, their tires
          off. They're on their rims.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Uh.... Mater?!
                         
                          MATER
           Just remember, your brakes ain't
           gonna work on these!
                         
          As they head INTO A DARK TUNNEL ---
                         
           MCQUEEN (O.S.)
           Mater!
                         
           MATER (O.S.)
           Relax, these train tracks ain't
           been used in years!
                         
          From inside the tunnel a loud TRAIN HORN. The two friends
          emerge, going as fast as they can on train tracks, uphill,
          with no tires.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Come on, come on! Faster, faster!
                         
          Moments later a harmless GALLOPING GOOSE appears, oversized
          horn visible, cackling and laughing at his prank.
                         
          EXT. FIELD - OUTSIDE RADIATOR SPRINGS - LATER
                         
          An ENORMOUS EARTH MOVER sleeps. McQueen and Mater sneak up.
                         
                          MATER
           This is gonna be good!
                         
          They blow their horns and he TIPS OVER, tractor-tipping
          style. They LAUGH at the gag, but soon realize the earth
          mover's GIANT EXHAUST PIPE is directly above them.
                         
                          MATER
           Uh-oh. This ain't gonna be good.
                         
          The exhaust pipe BELCHES. McQueen and Mater are BLASTED out
          of view.
                         
          INT. RADIATOR SPRINGS - DUSK
                         
          The sun sets. McQueen and Mater roll into town. McQueen looks
          exhausted. Mater is still full of energy.
           12.
                         
                         
                          MATER
           Boy, this was the best day ever!
           And my favorite souvenir?
                         
          Mater proudly shows off a dent.
                         
                          MATER
           This new dent!
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Boy, Mater. Today was, uh...
                         
                          MATER
           Shoot, that was nothing. Wait til
           you see what I got planned for
           tonight.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater, Mater. Whoa. I was kind of
           thinking of just a quiet dinner.
                         
                          MATER
           That's exactly what I was thinking.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           No, I... I meant with Sally, Mater.
                         
                          MATER
           Even better! You, me and Miss Sally
           going out for supper.
                         
          McQueen pulls around in front of Mater, stops.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater, I meant it would be just me
           and Sally.
                         
                          MATER
           Oh.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           It's just for tonight. We'll do
           whatever you want tomorrow.
                         
                          MATER
                          (DISAPPOINTED)
           Okay.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Thanks for understanding.
                         
                          MATER
           Yeah, sure. Y'all go on and have
           fun now.
           13.
                         
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Alright, then. See ya soon, amigo!
                         
          McQueen drives off. Mater watches him go.
                         
          EXT. THE WHEEL WELL - NIGHT
                         
          It's been converted into a white-tablecloth restaurant, with
          cars dining al fresco and a hopping gastropub inside.
                         
          MCQUEEN AND SALLY have a prime table with a view of Radiator
          Springs and the starry night sky.
                         
                          SALLY
           This is so nice.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           I can't tell you how good it is to
           be here alone. Just the two of us.
           Finally, you and me ---
                         
           MATER (O.S.)
           Good evening.
                         
          Mater is at their table, dressed as a waiter.
                         
                          MATER
           My name is Mater and I'll be your
           waiter.
                          (TO HIMSELF)
           Mater the waiter. That's funny
           right there.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater, you work here?
                         
                          MATER
           Well yeah I work here. What'd you
           think, I just snuck in here when
           nobody was looking and pretended to
           be your waiter, just so I could
           hang out with you?
                         
          McQueen and Sally exchange a look.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Oh, yeah. How ridiculous would that
           be?
                         
                          MATER
           Now, can I start you two lovebirds
           off with a couple drinks?
           14.
                         
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Yes. I'll have my usual.
                         
                          SALLY
           You know what? I'm going to have
           that too.
                         
          Mater blinks.
                         
                          MATER
           Uh, right. Your usual.
                          CUT TO:
                         
          INSIDE AT THE BAR - Fillmore and Sarge watch as Guido mixes
          drinks, ala "Cocktail." Mater arrives.
                         
                          MATER
           Guido! What's McQueen's usual?
                         
                          GUIDO
           (in Italian, subtitled)
           How should I know?
                         
                          MATER
           Perfect! Give me two of `em.
                         
                          SARGE
           Quiet! My program's on.
                         
           MEL DORADO (O.S.)
           Tonight on "The Mel Dorado Show"!
                         
          ON THE BAR TV - "THE MEL DORADO SHOW," a cable talk show,
          begins with file footage of MILES AXLEROD, a sleek SUV.
                         
           MEL DORADO (ON TV)
           His story gripped the world! Oil
           billionaire Miles Axlerod, in an
           attempt to become the first car to
           circumnavigate the globe without
           GPS, ironically ran out of gas and
           found himself trapped in the wild!
                         
          We see images of newspaper headlines, search crews.
                         
           MEL DORADO (ON TV)
           Feared dead, he emerged 36 days
           later, running on a fuel he'd
           distilled himself from the natural
           elements! Since then he's sold his
           oil fortune, converted himself from
           a gas-guzzler into an electric car,
           and has devoted his life to finding
           a renewable, clean-burning fuel!
           15.
                         
                         
          Images of oil derricks torn down; Miles Axlerod getting
          converted to electric; lab scientists testing chemicals.
                         
           MEL DORADO (ON TV)
           Now he claims to have done it with
           his Allinol.
                         
          Images of fields, rivers, vegetables, and mountains all
          combining to form the Allinol logo.
                         
           MEL DORADO (ON TV)
           And to show the world what his new
           superfuel can do, he's created a
           racing competition like no other,
           inviting the greatest champions
           from around the globe to battle in
           the first ever World Grand Prix.
           Welcome Sir Miles Axlerod.
                         
          SIR MILES AXLEROD arrives, parks across from Mel's desk.
                         
           MILES AXLEROD (ON TV)
           Thank you, Mel. It is very good to
           be here. Now listen to me: Big Oil.
           It costs a fortune. Pollution is
           getting worse. I mean, come on.
           It's a fossil fuel. Fossil. As in
           dead dinosaurs. And we all know
           what happened to them. Alternative
           energy is the future. Trust me,
           Mel, after seeing Allinol in action
           at the World Grand Prix, nobody
           will ever go back to gasoline
           again.
                         
                          MATER
                          (TO FILLMORE)
           What happened to the dinosaurs,
           now?
                         
           MEL DORADO (ON TV)
           And on satellite, a World Grand
           Prix competitor and one of the
           fastest cars in the world,
           Francesco Bernoulli.
                         
          Across the screen: LIVE FROM ROME, ITALY. We meet Formula

           FRANCESCO (ON TV)
           It is an honor, Signore Dorado. For
           you.

           McQueen?
                         
          Mater, collecting his drinks, looks up, half-intrigued.
                         
           MILES AXLEROD (ON TV)
           Of course we invited him. But
           apparently after a very long racing
           season he is taking some time off
           to rest.
                         
           FRANCESCO (ON TV)
           Lightning McQueen would not have a
           chance against Francesco!
                         
          Mater doesn't like this.
                         
           FRANCESCO (ON TV)
           I can go over 300 kilometers an
           hour! In miles that is like, uh...
           way faster than McQueen.
                         
           MEL DORADO (ON TV)
           Let's go to the phones. Baltimore,
           Maryland, you're on the air.
                         
           CALLER (ON TV)
           Am I on? Hello?
                         
           MEL DORADO (ON TV)
           You're on. Go ahead.
                         
           CALLER (ON TV)
           Hello?
                         
           MEL DORADO (ON TV)
           Go ahead, caller.
                         
          Dial tone.
                         
           MEL DORADO (ON TV)
           Let's go to Radiator Springs.
           You're on, caller.
                         
           MATER'S VOICE (ON TV)
           Yeah, that Italian feller you got
           on there can't talk that way about
           Lightning McQueen. He's the bestest
           race car in the whole wide world.
                         
          Fillmore and Sarge look around. Mater is visible in the back
          of the bar on an office phone.
           17.
                         
                         
                          SARGE
           Uh-oh...
                         
           FRANCESCO (ON TV)
           If he is, how you say "the bestest
           race car," then why must he rest,
           eh?
                         
           MATER'S VOICE (ON TV)
           Cause he knows what's important.
           Every now and then he prefers just
           to slow down, enjoy life.
                         
           FRANCESCO (ON TV)
           Ah, you heard it! Lightning McQueen
           prefers to be slow! Of course, this
           is not news to Francesco. When I
           want to go to sleep I watch one of
           his races. After two laps I am out
           cold.
                         
          Audible RXNS from the bar. A crowd has been forming ever
          since Mater started talking.
                         
           MATER'S VOICE (ON TV)
           That ain't what I meant.
                          CUT TO:
                         
          MCQUEEN AND SALLY - They hear the commotion inside.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Hey, what's going on over there?
           CUT BACK TO:
                         
          THE BAR - Sally and McQueen push through the crowd, see that
          they're watching Francesco on the television.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
                          (TO SALLY)
           Oh, it's that Italian Formula car.
           His name is ---
                         
                          SALLY
           Francesco Bernoulli. No wonder
           there's a crowd.
                         
          When Sally says his name, she enunciates each part, as if
          Italian were her mother's tongue.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Wait, why do you know his name? And
           don't say it like that. It's three
           syllables, not ten.
           18.
                         
                         
                          SALLY
           What? He's nice to look at. You
           know, open-wheeled and all.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           What's wrong with fenders? I
           thought you like my fenders.
                         
           MATER'S VOICE (ON TV)
           Well let me tell you something else
           there, Mr. San Francisco ---
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater?
                         
           MATER'S VOICE (ON TV)
           McQueen could drive circles around
           you.
                         
           FRANCESCO (ON TV)
           Driving in circles is all he can
           do, no?
                         
           MATER'S VOICE (ON TV)
           No! I mean yes. I mean he could
           beat you anywhere, anytime, any
           track.
                         
          On McQueen - he looks at Guido who gives a nod over to ---
                         
          --- Mater, turned away from the crowd, still on the phone.
                         
           FRANCESCO (ON TV)
           Mel, can we move on? Francesco
           needs a caller who can provide a
           little more intellectual
           stimulation. Like a dump truck.
                         
          ON MCQUEEN. He doesn't like this at all.
                         
                          MATER
           Ha ha! That shows what you know.
           Dump trucks is dumb.
                         
          Suddenly, Mater is YANKED from the booth and replaced by
          McQueen.
                         
           MCQUEEN (INTO PHONE)
           Yeah, hi, this is Lightning
           McQueen. Look, I don't appreciate
           my best friend being insulted like
           that.
           19.
                         
                         
           FRANCESCO (ON TV)
           McQueen! That was your best friend?
           This is the difference between you
           and Francesco. Francesco knows how
           good he is. He does not need to
           surround himself with tow trucks to
           prove it.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Those are strong words from a car
           that is so fragile.
                         
           FRANCESCO (ON TV)
           Fragilé!? He calls Francesco
           fragilé? Not so fast, McQueen!
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           "Not so fast." What is that, your
           new motto?
                         
          Francesco goes ballistic in Italian. They cut his mic.
                         
           MILES AXLEROD (ON TV)
           Well, this sounds like something
           that needs to be settled on the
           race course. What do you say,
           Lightning McQueen? We've still got
           room for one more racer.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Well, I would love to. The only
           thing is my crew's off for the
           season so ---
                         
          A sound O.S. McQueen turns to see Fillmore, Sarge and Luigi
          flank a tablecloth which is hanging off the bar. Ramone backs
          away, having spray painted "TEAM LIGHTNING MCQUEEN" on it.
          Guido quickly uncorks three wine bottles.
                         
                          GUIDO
           Pit stop.
                         
          McQueen turns back to the phone.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           You know what? They just got back.
           Deal me in, baby. Ka-chow!
                         
          The place ERUPTS IN CHEERS.
                         
          MOMENTS LATER - General excitement as McQueen exits the phone
          booth where Sally waits. Off her look:
           20.
                         
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           I know, I know. I just got back.
           But we won't be long and ---
                         
                          SALLY
           Oh, no, don't worry about me. I've
           got enough to do here. Mater's
           going to have a blast though.
           (off McQueen's silence)
           You're bringing Mater, right? You
           never bring him to any of your
           races.
                         
          McQueen turns to the bar where Mater privately tries their
          drinks, hates it, spits it back in the glass.
                         
                          SALLY
           Just let him sit in the pits, give
           him a headset. C'mon, it'll be a
           thrill of a lifetime for him.
                         
          Mater arrives.
                         
                          MATER
           Your drinks, sir.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater.
                         
                          MATER
           I didn't taste it!
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           How'd you like to come and see the
           world with me?
                         
                          MATER
           You mean it?
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           You got me into this thing. You're
           coming along.
                         
                         BEGIN MONTAGE:
                         
          - McQueen is given a new paint job and headlights by Ramone.
          Mater, now sporting a "Team McQueen" emblem, seems psyched as
          well.
                         
          - An airport DEPARTURES SIGN advertises the next flight:
          Tokyo, Japan.
                         
          - Mater waves goodbye with his hook alongside McQueen, Guido,
          Luigi, Fillmore and Sarge as ---
           21.
                         
                         
          --- the rest of Radiator Springs watches them board a plane.
          Red bawls.
                         
          - IN THE JET, LATER. McQueen and Mater are the only ones
          awake, watch an insane Japanese game show.
                         
          - JAPAN AT NIGHT. A stylish Tokyo cityscape of neon, glamour,
          scrolling billboards, vending machines and high-tech
          skyscrapers.
                         
          - INSIDE A SOUVENIR SHOP loaded with McQueen toys: Mater and
          McQueen enter. A tourist sees McQueen and faints.
                         
          - A KABUKI THEATER. Team McQueen watches a methodical dance.
          Mater, dressed in Kabuki makeup, arrives. He looks insane.
                         
          - A SUMO MATCH - Two SUZUKI SAMURAI CARS wrestle over a
          parking space. Mater, now in his element, cheers.
                         
          The MONTAGE ENDS on this high note as we CUT TO ---
                         
          EXT. MUSEUM - TOKYO - NIGHT
                         
          ---- TEAM MCQUEEN, as they roll up the red carpet. Press is
          held at bay behind ropes. WORLD GRAND PRIX and ALLINOL logos
          are strategically placed for maximum press exposure. RACERS
          are interviewed by press behind the red-carpet ropes.
                         
          INT. TOKYO MUSEUM - NIGHT
                         
          Team McQueen enters via a second floor landing which
          overlooks a massive indoor party in a converted museum. As
          they roll down a ramp to the party, they are awed.
                         
                          LUIGI
           Guido, look! Ferraris and tires!
           Let's go!

                          (IMPRESSED)
           Hey, look at this. Okay now Mater,
           remember: best behavior.
                         
                          MATER
           You got it, buddy. Hey, what's
           that?
                         
          He sees something, peels away.
                         
                          MCQUEEN

          It's fellow racers JEFF GORVETTE and LEWIS HAMILTON. McQueen
          now has no choice but to let Mater go.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Hey, Jeff. Lewis!

          MATER as he approaches a GLASS-ENCLOSED ROCK GARDEN where a
          pitty RAKES rocks with precision. He knocks on the glass with
          his hook.
                         
                          MATER
           Hey! You done good! You got all the
           leaves!
                         
          People turn at the noise he's making.
           CUT BACK TO:
                         
          MCQUEEN, JEFF and LEWIS.

          He zips over to Mater's side, quickly pulls him out of sight.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater, listen. This isn't Radiator
           Springs.
                         
                          MATER
           You're just realizing that? Boy,
           that jet-lag really done a number
           on you.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater, look -- things are different
           over here. Which means maybe you
           should, you know, act a little
           different too.
                         
                          MATER
           Different than what?
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Well, just... help me out here,
           buddy. I ---
           23.
                         
                         
                          MATER
           You need help? Shoot, why didn't
           you just say so? That's what a tow
           truck does. Hey, looky there, it's
           Mr. San Francisco!
                         
          FRANCESCO is visible across the room, holding court.
                         
                          MATER
           I'll introduce you.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater, no.
                         
                          MATER
           (already on his way)
           Look at me -- I'm helping you
           already!
                         
          On FRANCESCO - MOMENTS LATER. Mater approaches, giddy.
                         
                          MATER
           Hey Mr. San Francisco, I'd like you
           to meet ---
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           Lightning McQueen! Buona sera.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Nice to meet you, Francesco.
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           Yeah, nice to meet you too. You are
           very good-looking. Not as good as I
           thought, but you're good.
                         
                          MATER
                          (TO FRANCESCO)
           Excuse me. Can I get a picture with
           you?
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           Anything for McQueen's friend.
                         
          As Mater poses for a photo with Francesco:
                         
                          MATER
           Miss Sally is gonna flip when she
           sees this. She's Lightning
           McQueen's girlfriend.
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           Oooh.
           24.
                         
                         
                          MATER
           She's a big fan of yours.
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           Hey, she has good taste.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater's prone to exaggeration. I
           wouldn't say she's a "big" fan.
                         
                          MATER
           You're right. She's a huge fan. She
           goes on and on about your open
           wheels here.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mentioning it once doesn't qualify
           as going "on and on."
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           Francesco is familiar with this
           reaction to Francesco. Women
           respect a car that has nothing to
           hide.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Yeah, uh...
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           Let us have a toast.
                         
          McQueen doesn't like where this is going, covers.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Let's.
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           (raising a drink)
           I dedicate my win tomorrow... to
           Miss Sally.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Oh, sorry. I already dedicated MY
           win tomorrow to her. So if we both
           do it, it's really not so special.
           Besides, I don't have a drink.
                         
                          MATER
           I'll go get you one. You mind if I
           borrow a few bucks for one of them
           drinks?
           25.
                         
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           (could kill him)
           They're free, Mater.
                         
                          MATER
           Free? Well, shoot, what am I doing
           here?
                         
          Mater ZIPS OFF.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           I should probably go keep an eye on
           him. See you at the race.
                         
          McQueen starts to leave.
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           Yes, you will see Francesco. But
           not like this.
                         
          Francesco does a 180, so his rear end now faces McQueen.
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           You will see him like this, as he
           drives away from you.
                         
          Francesco wears a bumper sticker that says "Ciao, McQueen!"
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           That's cute. So you had one of
           those made up for all the racers?
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           No.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Okay.
                         
          He rolls off.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           He is so getting beat tomorrow.
                         
          INT. PARTY - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          Lights caress the main stage where a crowd has formed.
                         
                          VOICE
           Ladies and gentlecars... Sir Miles
           Axlerod!
                         
          MILES AXLEROD drives through an infinity fountain, appears.
           26.
                         
                         
                          MILES AXLEROD
           It is my absolute honor to
           introduce to you the competitors in
           the first-ever World Grand Prix.
           From Brazil. Number eight...
                         
          ON FINN MCMISSILE. He appears from the shadows, keeps a
          careful distance from the stage. He ZEROES HIS GAZE ON ---
                         
          --- THE WORLD GRAND PRIX TV CAMERAS which roll, catching
          Miles Axlerod's speech for publicity and posterity.
                         
          Finn's ONBOARD COMPUTER ANALYZES each one, compares to the
          photos we saw him snap on the oil platform. Each one is "NOT
          A MATCH." His view is suddenly disrupted by A BEAUTIFUL
          SPORTS CAR. She approaches Finn. Meet HOLLEY SHIFTWELL.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           A Volkswagen Karmann Ghia has no
           radiator.
                         
                          FINN
           That's because it's air-cooled.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           I'm Agent Shiftwell, Holley
           Shiftwell from the Tokyo Station. I
           have a message from London.
                         
                          FINN
           Not here.
                          (LOUDLY)
           You must try the canapes on the
           mezzanine!
                         
          He moves her onto an elevator. The doors close on them.
                         
          IN THE ELEVATOR, GOING UP.
                         
                          FINN
           So the lab boys analyzed the photo
           I sent? What did they learn about
           the camera?
                         
                          HOLLEY
           It appears to be a standard
           television camera. They said if you
           could get closer photos next time,
           that would be great.
                         
                          FINN
           This was London's message?
           27.
                         
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Oh -- no, no. No sir. Um, the oil
           platforms you were on? Turns out
           they're sitting on the biggest oil
           reserve in the world.
                         
                          FINN
           How did we miss that?
                         
                          HOLLEY
           They'd been scrambling everyone's
           satellites. The Americans actually
           discovered it just before you did.
           They placed an agent on that
           platform, under deep cover. He was
           able to get a photo of the car
           who's running the entire operation.
                         
          The doors OPEN and they exit onto the Mezzanine.
                         
                          FINN
           Who is it? Has anyone seen the
           photo yet?
                         
                          HOLLEY
           No, not yet. The American is here
           tonight to pass it to you. He'll
           signal you when he's ready.
                         
                          FINN
                          GOOD ---
                         
          Finn suddenly STOPS COLD.
                         
                          FINN
           Oh no.
                         
          Professor Zundapp is visible below them. He talks with a few
          Pacers and Gremlins. Finn quickly retreats into the shadows.
          Holley follows suit.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           What is it?
                         
                          FINN
           Change of plan. You're meeting the
           American.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           What, me?
           28.
                         
                         
                          FINN
           Those thugs down there were on the
           oil platform. If they see me, the
           whole mission is compromised.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           No, no. I'm technical, you see. I'm
           in Diagnostics. I'm not a field
           agent.
                         
                          FINN
           You are now.
                          CUT TO:
                         
          MATER as he grabs a drink, keeps moving.
                         
                          MATER
           I'll take one of them.
                         
          He snatches it, drops it in the back where we now see a large
          assortment of drinks balanced.
                         
                          MATER
           Never know which one McQueen'll
           have a hankering for.
                         
          He approaches a sushi bar.
                         
                          MATER
           Hey, what you got here that's free?
           How about that pistachio ice cream?
                         
          He refers to wasabi, of course.
                         
                          SUSHI CHEF
           No, no. Wasabi.
                         
                          MATER
           Oh, same ol', same ol'. What's up
           with you? That looks delicious.
                         
          The chef starts to carve a small scoop aside for Mater.
                         
                          MATER
           Uh, a little more, please.
           It is free, right?
           (the chef adds more)
           Keep it coming. A little more. Come
           on, let's go, it's free! You're

           ... and now, our last competitor ---
           Number 95, Lightning McQueen!
                         
          MCQUEEN approaches the microphone, flashes his headlights.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Thank you so much for having us,
           Sir Axlerod. I really look forward
           to racing. This is a great
           opportunity.
                         
                          MILES AXLEROD
           Oh, the pleasure is all ours,
           Lightning. You and your team bring
           excellence and professionalism to
           this competition.
                         
          As if on cue, Mater arrives with a piercing scream of pain.
          Everyone turns as he charges head first toward the stage,
          making a bee-line for that FOUNTAIN.

          He laps up water from the fountain like a diabetic cat.

          Miles Axlerod is shocked. The crowd can't believe it.
          Francesco cackles. Mater, now sated, approaches the mic.

           No, thank you. This trip's been
           amazing.

          TILT DOWN to reveal a pool of oil beneath Mater.

           But wait, I... oh, shoot.
                         
          McQueen quickly pulls Mater aside, out of earshot of Miles
          Axlerod and the others. McQueen is beside himself.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater, you have to get a hold of
           yourself. You're making a scene.
                         
                          MATER
           But I never leak oil. Never.

           Coming through! Excuse me, leakin'

           you. I gotta go!
                         
          Someone points Mater down a hallway. He whips around the

          --- and STOPS. Finds himself in front of TWO BATHROOM DOORS,

          zips out.

          IN THE STALL - Mater enters, looks up.

           Wowee...
                         
          The stall is a complicated apparatus with buttons and lights.
          High-tech Japanese. It suddenly GRABS MATER, hoists him up as
          if he's going to get an oil change.
                         
                          MATER
           What in the---
                         
          A Japanese style cartoon CARICATURE appears on a TV MONITOR,
          followed by images of waterfalls and rivers.

          The caricature starts talking in Japanese. Suddenly WATER
          FIRES UP underneath Mater's undercarriage, goosing him. He
          freaks out.
                         
          OUTSIDE THE STALL - With Mater's yells audible we see a
          GREMLIN enter, furtive. Suddenly, inexplicably, his frame
          BREAKS APART like an egg, revealing an AMERICAN MUSCLE CAR
          underneath. The pieces of the Gremlin disappear under him,
          clearly his disguise. This is ROD REDLINE - American Agent.

          GREM and ACER have entered, hesitate briefly when they see
          Rod Redline.
                         
          Rod Redline, careful, slides a gun out of his tire. He is
          suddenly CHARGED by the AMCs --- Rod SPINS AROUND and gets a
          shot off but is SLAMMED HEAD FIRST. A TIGHT, CLOSE-QUARTERS
          FIGHT begins ---

          if in a car wash. He is helpless.
                         
          OUTSIDE THE STALL - Rod is being pulverized. Just when he
          scrambles away from one car, the other one takes over.
                         
          IN THE STALL - Mater is mercifully released, but when he
          backs out ---

          ACER burns rubber, ready to finish him off. Just as he shifts

          It's settled. Holley takes one more nervous breath, quickly
          closes the distance between her and Mater, cuts him off. He
          is forced to STOP.

                          MATER
           Well of course it doesn't. That's
           `cause it's air-cooled!

           Course, Karmann Ghia's weren't the
           only ones. Besides the Beetles you
           had your Type-3 Squarebacks, with

          Rod Redline dangles from a car magnet. He's been beaten up,
          clings to consciousness.

           I gotta admit ---
                         
          Grem, Acer, and a bunch of nasty looking troublemakers look
          up at Rod amidst crates and shipping containers.
                         
                          GREM
           --- you tricked us real good.

           And we don't like being tricked.
                         
          Rod Redline laughs to himself.
                         
                          ACER
           Hey, what's so funny?
                         
                          ROD REDLINE
           Well, you know, I was just wearing
           a disguise. You guys are stuck
           looking like that.
                         
          This doesn't help him. They DROP HIM onto a TREADMILL, lock
          him down. A container is wheeled forward and Rod is plied
          with Allinol brand gasoline.
                         
                          ROD REDLINE
           Allinol? Thanks, fellas. I hear
           this stuff is good for you.
           38.
                         
                         
           PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP (O.S.)
           So you think.
                         
          The Professor emerges from the darkness, behind Rod.
                         
                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           Allinol by itself is good for you.
                         
          Zundapp hits a button and the TREADMILL starts Rod's wheels
          spinning at a high rate of speed.
                         
                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           But after microscopic examination,
           I have found that it has one small
           weakness. When hit with an
           electromagnetic pulse, it becomes
           extremely dangerous.

          Grem pushes a World Grand Prix CAMERA - the same one that
          was in the box back at the oil derrick. He points it at Rod
          Redline.
                         
                          GREM

                          ROD REDLINE
           Is that all you want? I got a whole
           act.
                         
                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           You were very interested in this
           camera on the oil platform. Now you
           will witness what it really does.
                         
                          ROD REDLINE
           Whatever you say, Professor.
                         
          Acer pushes a TV MONITOR toward Rod. On it, surveillance
          footage from the party. Clearly, they were watching and
          recording him there.
                         
                          ACER

                          ROD REDLINE
           Your mother. Oh no, I'm sorry. It
           was your sister. You know, I can't
           tell them apart these days.

                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           Fifty percent power.
           (to Rod Redline)
           This camera is actually an
           electromagnetic pulse emitter.
                         
                          ACER

                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           The Allinol is now heating to a
           boil, dramatically expanding,
           causing the engine block to crack
           under the stress, forcing oil into
           the combustion chamber.
                         
          Rod Redline's engine starts to CRACK and BREAK.

                          ROD REDLINE
           (to Professor Zundapp)
           What do I care? I can replace an
           engine block.
                         
                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           You may be able to, but after full
           impact of the pulse, unfortunately,
           there will be nothing to replace.
                         
                          ACER

          down the hall.
                         
          Rod Redline, seeing this, does the world's most subtle double
          take. We caught it, but there's no way anyone else in the
          room could have ---

          As Grem turns up the machine even MORE, the Professor makes a
          call.
                         
           PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP (INTO PHONE)
           Yes sir. We believe the infiltrator
           has passed along sensitive
           information.

           I will take care of it before any
           damage can be done.

          Zundapp kicks the camera's power into the RED.
                         
                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP

           David, how exactly does this

           GT and Touring cars like Spain's
           Miguel Camino should make up some
           ground but I doubt it'll be enough
           to stop Francesco from absolutely
           running away with it.
                         
           DARRELL CARTRIP (V.O.)
           Woah, now just hold your
           horsepower. You're forgetting the
           most important factor here. That
           early dirt track section of the
           course! The dirt is supposed to be
           the great equalizer in this race.

           French Rally car Raoul ÇaRoule is
           counting on a big boost headed
           through there.
                         
           DARRELL CARTRIP (V.O.)
           And don't forget Lightning McQueen!
           His mentor, the Hudson Hornet, was
           one of the greatest dirt track
           racers of all time. In my opinion,
           McQueen is the best all-around
           racer in this competition.

           Really, Darrell, I think you need
           to clean your windshield. You're
           clearly not seeing this for what it
           is: Francesco's race to lose.

           It's time to find out. The racers
           are locking into the grid ---
                         
          Engines rev as everyone gets ready to go. Everyone's bright
          eyed and alert except for McQueen who we find in the back of
          the grid. He CLOSES his eyes.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
                          (TO HIMSELF)
           Speed. I am speed.
                         
          A LAUGH O.S. McQueen opens his eyes. Francesco is next to him
          on the grid.
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           Really? You are "speed"? Then
           Francesco is triple speed.
           (closes his eyes)
           Francesco. Is. Triple speed.
           Francesco likes this, McQueen. It's
           really getting him into the zone!
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           He is so getting beat today.
                         
          The starting lights click down from RED to YELLOW to GREEN.
          The race begins. Francesco quickly grabs the lead. He's
          pulling away within seconds.

                          HOLLEY
           Why is he in the pits? He's so
           exposed.
                         
                          FINN
           It's his cover. One of the best
           I've seen, too. Look at the detail
           on that rust. It must have cost him
           a fortune.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           But why hasn't he contacted us yet?
                         
                          FINN
           There's probably heat on him. Be
           patient.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Right, of course. He'll signal us
           when he can.

                          MATER
           McQueen! It's time to make your
           move. Get on the outside and show
           'em what Doc done taught you.
                         
           MCQUEEN (OVER RADIO)
           Ten four, Mater.
                         
          ON THE TRACK - Francesco hits the dirt section and loses all
          control. He SLAMS to a halt, his tires getting no traction.
                         
           DAVID HOBBSCAP (V.O.)
           Francesco is brought to a
           screeching halt!
                         
          MCQUEEN skids into view, turning right to go left, passing
          Francesco, followed by other cars ---
                         
           BRENT MUSTANGBURGER (V.O.)
           Lightning McQueen is the first to
           take advantage. And just like that,
           folks, Francesco's lead is left in
           the dust.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Nice call, Mater. Keep it up!
                         
          McQueen now leads the pack, zooming out of the dirt now
          starting to relax.
                         
           DARRELL CARTRIP (V.O.)
           Who-hoo! Man, McQueen looks happier
           than a rollbar at a demolition

           Everyone's jostling for position as
           we hit the asphalt again.
                         
          Francesco crests the hill, in last place. He bites down,
          determined, then CHASES.
                         
           BRENT MUSTANGBURGER (V.O.)
           Francesco lost a lot of momentum in
           the dirt. He's got some serious
           work ahead of him if he wants to
           get back in this race.

           DARRELL CARTRIP (V.O.)
           Oh! Miguel Camino has blown an

           BRENT MUSTANGBURGER (V.O.)
           Very unusual, Darrell. He's been so
           consistent all year.
                         
          Camino quickly pits, passing McQueen's pit where Mater is

           I'm trying.
                          (TO MATER)
           Get out now!
                         
          We CUT BACK TO ---
                         
          --- MATER. He gives in, exits the pit.
                         
                          MATER
           Well, all right but I usually like
           to have a proper detailing done
           before I meet a lady friend.
                         
          He moves toward the back PIT DOOR, is about to open it.
                         
          OUTSIDE THE PITS - ACER and another Pacer approach McQueen's
          pit door on the other side. Ready to pounce. The doors OPEN,
                         REVEALING ---
                         
          --- Finn, holding a fire extinguisher.
                         
                          ACER
           Finn McMissile? But you're dead!
                         
                          FINN
           Then this shouldn't hurt at all.
                         
          He empties the extinguisher in their eyes, speeds past. They
          try and follow, but have been blinded. One of them crashes
          right into a COP.
                         
          ON FINN - Already on the move, along a side street.
                         
                          FINN
           Miss Shiftwell?
                         
          ON HOLLEY - Tracking everything on a grid map. Mater looks
          like Pac Man, weaving through the streets as bad guys close
          in all around him.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           I've got him in the back alleys
           east of the garages. Multiple
           assailants are closing in quickly.
                         
           FINN (OVER RADIO)
           Keep him moving. I'm on my way.
                         
          ON MATER - He turns a corner, sees a flower shop.
           49.
                         
                         
                          MATER
           Hey, new lady friend? You like
           flowers?
                         
          ON THE TRACK - McQueen, hearing this, is taken aback.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           What?
                         
          ON MATER - Slowing at the flower shop.
                         
           HOLLEY (OVER RADIO)
           No! Don't go 'in' anywhere. Just
           keep moving.
                         
                          MATER
           Stay outside. Gotcha.
                         
          ON THE TRACK
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Outside?
                         
          McQueen drifts outside allowing Francesco to slip past!
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           Grazie and arrivaderci!
                         
           DARRELL CARTRIP (V.O.)
           I cannot believe what I just saw,
           Brent. That was a bonehead move.
           You don't open up the inside like
           that!
                         
          IN THE BACK ALLEYS - As Mater moves on he's followed by
          Pacers and Gremlins. Suddenly ---
                         
          --- CABLES whip in front of them, pulling over flower vending
          machines and sending the shop's owners into a frenzy. They
          direct their attention to the AMCs, who try and explain.
                         
          ON FINN, admiring his handiwork as he appears. Just as he
          turns to leave he's BROADSIDED and pushed INTO A DARK ALLEY.
                         
          IN THE ALLEY - Finn finds himself boxed by two Pacers and
          pushed toward ---
                         
          --- ACER, who now holds a FLAME THROWER.
                         
                          ACER
           This time I'm gonna make sure you
           stay dead.
                         
          He hits the flame. WHOOOSSSH!!
           50.
                         
                         
          ON ANOTHER STREET - Mater clicks along, still looking for
          Holley. Just as he passes the alley entrance where Finn
          stares down death:
                         
           HOLLEY (OVER RADIO)
           You're doing brilliantly. Now just
           stay focused.
                         
                          MATER
           What's that? You want me to head
           toward that ruckus?
                         
          Mater turns INTO the alley.
                         
           HOLLEY (OVER RADIO)
           No! Don't go down that street!
                         
          IN THE ALLEY - Finn, now nearly pushed completely into the
          flame thrower, leaps into the air. He FIGHTS BACK, using his
          wheels, axle, indeed his entire car frame as if he were
          human, kicking and tossing and shooting his enemies.
                         
          Mater witnesses the whole thing.
                         
                          MATER
           Wow! A live karate demonstration!
                         
          ON THE TRACK - McQueen, now playing catch-up again, scowls.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Stop it, Mater. Just sign off.
                         
          IN THE BACK ALLEY - Finn polishes off the AMCs by firing a
          bullet into a gas main line, causing an EXPLOSION that tosses
          Acer through the air where he lands in a NOODLE SHOP'S SIGN.
                         
          ON THE TRACK - The end of the race is nigh ---
                         
           BRENT MUSTANGBURGER (V.O.)
           They're bumper to bumper as they
           approach the finish line!
                         
          The Formula car gets there first.
                         
           BRENT MUSTANGBURGER (V.O.)
           Francesco's the winner, McQueen's
           number two!
                         
          IN THE ALLEY - Finn heaves breaths, surveys his damage.
                         
                          MATER
           That was cool! Hey, can I get your
           autograph?
           51.
                         
                         
          Mater approaches when a MASS OF RACE FANS burst out a door,
          momentarily blocking Mater's view of Finn. Once the fans have
          past, Finn has disappeared.
                         
                          MATER
           Hey, where'd he go?
                         
           HOLLEY (OVER RADIO)
           Our rendezvous has been
           jeopardized. Keep the device safe.
           We'll be in touch.
                         
                          MATER
           Dadgum, did I miss our date?
                         
          EXT. PRESS STAGE - LATER
                         
          Post race press conference. Francesco is center stage.
                         
                          DARRELL CARTRIP
           Francesco, over here! Hey, what was
           your strategy today?
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           Strategia? Francesco needs no
           strategy, it's very simple. You
           start the race, wait for Lightning
           McQueen to choke, pass him, then
           win. Francesco always wins. It's
           boring.
                         
          McQueen, waiting in the wings, rolls his eyes. He suddenly
          notices something O.S.
                         
          McQueen's P.O.V. - It's MATER, appearing from a side street,
          moving toward the pits, oblivious of the press conference.
                         
                          DARRELL CARTRIP
                          (TO FRANCESCO)
           I gotta tell you, dude. You were in
           trouble for awhile. That dirt track
           section had you crawling!
                         
          As McQueen SNEAKS AWAY ---
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           To truly crush one's dream, you
           must first raise their hopes very
           high.
                         
          IN MCQUEEN'S PIT GARAGE - Mater looks around for everyone as
          McQueen approaches.
           52.

                          MATER
          Hey McQueen! What happened? Is the
          race over? You won, right?
                         
                          MCQUEEN
          Mater, why were you yelling things
          at me while I was racing?
                         
                          MATER
          Yelling? Oh, you thought... that's
          funny right there. Nah, see that's
          `cause I seen these two fellers
          doing some sort of karate street
          performance. It was nutso. One of
          them even had a flamethrower ---
                         
                          MCQUEEN
          A flamethrower? What are you
          talking about? I don't understand.
          Where were you?
                         
                          MATER
          Going to meet my date.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
          Your date?
                         
                          MATER
          She started talking to me as a
          voice in my head, telling me where
          to go ---
                         
                          MCQUEEN
          What?
                         
                          MATER
          Wait a minute -- I didn't screw you
          up, did I?
                         
                          MCQUEEN
          I lost the race because of you!
                         
                          MATER
          Well, I'm sorry. I didn't mean ---
                         
                          MCQUEEN
          An imaginary girlfriend,
          flamethrowers. This is exactly why
          I don't bring you along to these
          things.
           53.
                         
                         
                          MATER
           Maybe if I, I don't know, talked to
           somebody and explained what
           happened I could help.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           I don't need your help. I don't
           want your help.
                         
           PRESS (O.S.)
           Hey, there he is!!
                         
          The press finds McQueen, swarms him. Mater is pushed
          backwards as the questions fly again.
                         
                          PRESS
           - McQueen, you had it in the bag!
           - Yeah, what happened?
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           I made a mistake. But I can assure
           you, it won't happen again.
                         
          On Mater. He takes this badly.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Look, guys. We know what the

           lap to Francesco Bernoulli in the
           first race of the World Grand Prix
           and three, count em, three cars
           flamed out leading some to suggest
           that their fuel, Allinol, might be
           to blame.

           Allinol is safe! Alternative fuel
           is safe! There is no way my fuel
           caused these cars to flame out!

                          DARRELL CARTRIP
           Well the jury may still be out on
           whether Allinol caused these
           accidents, but one thing's for
           sure: Lightning McQueen blew this
           race.

          tires, move through the metal detector. Mater waits in line.
          A SECURITY CAR approaches Mater.
                         
                          SECURITY CAR
           (in Japanese and English)
           Come with me please, sir.
                         
                          MATER
           But I'm gonna miss my plane.
                         
          IN THE ADMIRAL'S LOUNGE - MOMENTS LATER. The Security Car
          leads Mater inside.
                         
                          SECURITY CAR
           Right this way.
                         
          As they move past us the Security Car covertly drops a BALL
          BEARING which rolls into a corner. The ball bearing then
          sprouts MECHANICAL LEGS, tripods itself and IRISES out,
          revealing itself to be a tiny CAMERA.
                         
          IN THE MAIN ROOM - ADMIRAL'S LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Mater follows the Security Car in, nervous.
           55.
                         
                         
                          MATER
           Doggone it. This is about my hook,
           isn't it? I know I should've
           checked it, but I can't really,
           look -- it's attached to me.
                         
          ZWAPPPPPP!! The Security Car suddenly DECLOAKS himself,
          reveals himself to be Finn McMissile!
                         
                          MATER
           Hey, I know you. You're that feller
           from the karate demonstration.
                         
                          FINN
           I never properly introduced myself.
           Finn McMissile. British
           Intelligence.
                         
                          MATER
           Tow Mater. Average intelligence.
                         
                          FINN
           Who are you with? FBI, CIA?
                         
                          MATER
           Let's just say I'm triple-A
           affiliated. You know, I know some
           karate. I don't wanna brag or
           nothing, but I've got me a black
           fan belt.
                         
          BEEP! Finn's rearview alarms. His camera has picked up Grem
          and Acer. They've just entered the lounge, are right around
          the corner.
                         
                          MATER
           Hey, you wanna see some moves I
           made up?
                         
                          FINN
           You're being followed.
                         
          Finn quickly turns, fires a tiny GLASS CUTTING BEETLE at the
          window. As Mater talks, oblivious, the beetle cuts out a
          round hole.
                         
                          MATER
           This first one I can reach into a
           car's hood, pull out his battery,
           and show it to him before he
           stalls. I call it, "What I
           accidentally did to my friend Luigi
           once."
           56.
                         
                         
          Mater does his best (worst) karate moves as Acer and Grem
          turn the corner.
                         
                          GREM
           There he is!
                         
          The glass drops away, leaving a car-sized hole.
                         
                          MATER
           (eyes the clock)
           Look, I probably ought to go. I'm
           about to miss my flight.
                         
                          FINN
           Don't worry.
                         
          Finn HOOKS Mater from behind. He YANKS HIM forward ---
                         
                          FINN
           I've taken care of that. Hang on.
                         
          --- and LEAPS OUT THE WINDOW!
                         
          EXT. TARMAC - AIRPORT - JAPAN
                         
          Finn pulls Mater down HARD onto the tarmac, towing him away
          from the terminal.
                         
                          MATER
           This is First Class service. You
           don't even have to go through the
           terminal.
                         
          ACER and GREM appear, chasing them. Mater, who is facing
          backward as he is being pulled along, faces them. They're
          about a hundred yards back.
                         
                          MATER
                          (TO FINN)
           Your karate partners are back here.
           They kinda look like they're trying
           to catch up!
                         
                          FINN
           Drive forward. Whatever you do,
           don't stop.
                         
          Finn SKIDS around, whipping Mater in a 180 so that Mater is
          now towing Finn.
                         
          Grem produces a ROCKET, lines up Finn as his target.
           57.
                         
                         
          Finn, without hesitation, fires a MINI ROLLING-JACK. The jack
          DRIVES ITSELF toward Grem, anchors itself under his frame and
          flips him like a turtle but not before Grem gets the rocket
                         OFF ---
                         
          THE ROCKET - it flies toward Mater and Finn.
                         
          FINN aims and launches a MISSILE back.
                         
          THE ROCKET AND MISSILE COLLIDE IN MID-AIR, EXPLODE.
                         
                          MATER
           (only hearing this)
           Is everything okay back there?
                         
           SIDDELEY (O.S.)
           Finn, it's Sid. I'm on approach.
                         
          A GULFSTREAM JET wings into view overhead. This is SIDDELEY.
                         
                          FINN
           Roger that.
                         
          Mater looks up: ACER screeches into view up ahead, dragging a
          long row of luggage carts in Mater's path, attempting to
          create an accident.
                         
                          MATER
                          (TO FINN)
           You remember that whole thing about
           me not stopping no matter what?
                         
          Just as it looks dire --- RATATATATATATAT!!! SIDDELEY
          descends, hawklike, fires bullets and blows the luggage carts
          sky-high. Mater and Finn burst through them, luggage now
          raining down from above.
                         
                          MATER
           I knew I should've done carry-on!
                         
                          FINN
                          (TO SIDDELEY)
           Thanks, old boy!
                         
          Siddeley LANDS HARD on the tarmac ahead of them. No time to
          stop, he DROPS his back open, revealing HOLLEY.
                         
                          MATER
           Hey, doggone it. It's my imaginary
           girlfriend!
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Come on! Get in here!
           58.
                         
                         
          Mater SPEEDS UP toward Siddeley's ramp, Holley.
                         
                          MATER
                          (TO HOLLEY)
           Boy I tell you what, you really do
           want this first date, don't ya?
           That's a no-quit attitude right
           there.
                         
          Just as Mater's wheels touch the ramp, BULLETS PING around
          him in a spray. Siddeley is HIT, a tire BLOWN. He yells in
          pain.
                         
                          FINN
           Hold on, Sid!
                         
          Siddeley peels off the runway onto the grass.
                         
          A gunfight ensues between Finn and Acer. Finn SHOOTS ACER'S
          TIRE, blowing it and throwing him off-course.
                         
          Acer CAREENS out of control, drives up and THROUGH A JET ---
                         
          --- OUT THE OTHER SIDE where he lands in an oil tanker.
                         
          ON SIDDELEY - He's headed toward the edge of the tarmac,
          where the grass and runway meet WATER. He HITS THE GAS, his
          only hope.
                         
                          SIDDELEY
           Finn, it's now or never!
                         
          Finn BRAKES, 180s and grabs the ramp just as Siddeley gets
          air.
                         
                          SIDDELEY
           Hold on!
                         
          Mater, the only thing not in the jet, dangles and recedes
          from our view as Siddeley climbs toward the clouds. As he's
          PULLED in through the back hatch:
                         
           MATER (V.O.)
           By the time you read this, I will
           be safely on an airplane, flying
           home.
                         
          INT. LOBBY - HOTEL - TOKYO - DAY
                         
          CLOSE ON a handwritten (er, tire-written?) NOTE in childish
          scrawl. We don't see all of it, only a bit. Mater's voice
          O.S. begins the note with the first sentence, but we DISSOLVE
          into McQueen's voice.

           "I'm so sorry for what I did. I
           don't want to be the cause of you

           already know - that you are the
           greatest race car in the whole wide
           world. Your best friend, Mater."
                         
          McQueen takes this in.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           I didn't really want him to leave.

                          (SCANNING MATER)
           I hope that device didn't fall off.

           That's the closest I ever been to

          With a ROBOTIC ARM, Holley grabs the THE DEVICE that Rod
          Redline hid under Mater. She yanks it out with a GOOSE.

           Still in one piece, great.
                         
          Holley drops the device into a mainframe computer. It starts

           airport whatchamacallit. And Finn,
           this here's my date.

          AN IMAGE is blasted between the three of them. It's of a

           engines ever made. It's an old
           aluminum V8 with a Lucas electrical
           system and Whitworth bolts. Shoot,
           them Whitworth bolts is a pain,

           Holley, in how many makes and

           appear?
                         
          Holley has these stats in seconds. Kid's play.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           It was standard in seven models
           over a 12-year period. At least
           35,000 cars were made with this
           engine.
                         
          Mater MOVES HIS SEAT FORWARD, through one part of the

           You might not be happy, but I bet
           this feller is. See how he's had
           most of his parts replaced? And see

           Tomber was doing 20 to life in a
           Moroccan impound the first time I
           saved him, if I recall correctly.

           Speaking of recalls, you're getting
           up there in mileage aren't you,

          Holley shoots a HOLOGRAPHIC PHOTO of the engine in front of

          Tomber eyes the photo. He recoils, unimpressed.
                         
                          TOMBER
           That is the worst motor ever made.
                         
          Suddenly, Tomber narrows his gaze.
                         
                          TOMBER
           Wait. That oil filter... those

           No idea. He's my best customer, but
           he always does his business over
           the phone. I was always wondering
           why he needs so many parts. Now I

          Holley complies and suddenly PHOTOS OF CARS FROM THE OIL
          PLATFORM hang suspended in the air in front of them.

           He's my best friend.
                         
                          UNCLE TOPOLINO
           Then why would you ask him to be
           someone else?
                         
          McQueen considers this - a realization.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           What did I do? I said some things
           during our fight...
                         
                          UNCLE TOPOLINO
           You know, back when Guido and Luigi
           used to work for me, they would
           fight over everything.
                         
          IN THE SQUARE - Guido dances with a girl. Luigi suddenly CUTS
          IN. They begin to ARGUE.
                         
                          UNCLE TOPOLINO
           They fight over what Ferrari was
           the best Ferrari; which one of
           them look more like a Ferrari...
           There were even some non-Ferrari
           fights.
                         
          Guido now LIFTS Luigi, cuts BACK in.
                         
                          UNCLE TOPOLINO
           So I tell them, va bene. It's okay
           to fight. Everybody fights now and
           then, especially best friends.
                         
          McQueen takes this in. Seems to take some small comfort.
                         
                          UNCLE TOPOLINO
           But you gotta make up fast.
                         
          McQueen's comfort quickly evaporates.
                         
                          UNCLE TOPOLINO
           No fight more important than
           friendship.

          Guido and Luigi now dance together with the girl and her
          friend who has just arrived. All having a great time. They
          dance past us, crossing in front of MCQUEEN AND UNCLE
          TOPOLINO. We STAY WITH them.

          as, in the background, Uncle Topolino and Mama Topolino talk,
          then argue, then make up (all in Italian) all while we stay
          on McQueen's pensive face ---

          Holley turns back to her work. The disguise's cloaking is
          larger than Mater. As a result, Holley must dial it back to
          fit his body. As she carefully calibrates the hologram:
                         
                          HOLLEY

          but dents SHOW THROUGH.

           position, numero uno...
                         
          The crowd is cheering already, knows who this is.
                         
           ITALIAN TRACK ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
           ... Francescoooooo!
                         
          The Italian crowd roars and chants for their hometown hero.
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           (to the crowd)
           Bellissima! Thank you for your
           support.
                          (TO MCQUEEN)
           And your big mistake, McQueen!
                         
          McQueen missed this comment. He approaches his grid position,
          lost in thought.
                         
           ITALIAN TRACK ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
           In the secondo position. Numero
           novantacinque. Lightning McQueen!
                         
          Cheers (not so thunderous, obviously) from the crowd. McQueen
          doesn't seem to notice.

           McQueen? Is everything okay?
                         
                          FILLMORE
           If you're worried about your fuel,
           man, don't. It's perfectly safe.
                         
          BACK ON THE STARTING GRID
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           No, guys, I just really wish Mater
           were here.
                         
           FRANCESCO (O.S.)
           Francesco understands, McQueen.
                         
          Francesco parks next to him, grinning.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Oh, great. Here it comes. What've
           you got, Francesco?
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           For famous race cars like Francesco
           and well... you, to be far away
           from home is not easy.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           I think you forgot the insulting
           part of that insult.
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           Is no insult. When Francesco is
           away from home, he misses his mama
           just like you miss your tow truck
           amico.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Gee, I maybe misjudged you, because
           that's exactly how I ---
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           Of course, I am at home. And my
           mama is right here.
                         
          Francesco refers to his MAMA who sits in a special box in the
          crowd, cheering him on, blowing him kisses.
                         
                          FRANCESCO
                          (YELLS)
           Mama! Don't worry, Mama!

                          FRANCESCO (CONT'D)
           McQueen is very sad! I will beat
           his cry-baby bottom today!
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           And there's the insult we were
           missing. Grazie!
                         
          THE LIGHTS - CLICK FROM RED TO GREEN ---
                         
          THE RACERS TAKE OFF!
                         
          EXT. PORTO CORSA - DAY
                         
          SHOTS of the racers making the first few turns through the
          city streets. We PAN to the CASINO DI PORTO CORSA. The Beaux
          Arts-style architecture towers atop a hill, overlooks the
          course.
                         
          EXT. THE CASINO - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          A group of thuggish HUGOS - ugly Eastern European cars - wait
          impatiently at the front. A LIMOUSINE-STYLE car carrier rolls
          up to the roundabout.
                         
          An esteemed, elderly GREMLIN rolls past with a group of
          GREMLIN THUGS who usher him into the casino.
                         
                          ALEXANDER HUGO
           Gremlins. Man, those are some ugly
           cars. Look like someone stole their
           trunks.
                         
          The THUGS all SNICKER.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Scusatemi, tutti! Signori!
                         
          Holley arrives, sporting a decent Italian accent.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Mio nonno, my grandfather, has
           broken down. If one of you would
           help I would be so thankful.
                         
          IVAN, AN EASTERN EUROPEAN TOW TRUCK (the one Holley and Finn
          prepped Mater to impersonate), drives forward.
                         
           IVAN THE TOW TRUCK
           Sounds like you need some "roadside
           assistance".
                         
                          ANOTHER HUGO
           She was talking to me, Ivan.
           82.
                         
                         
           IVAN THE TOW TRUCK
           Oh really? Prove it.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           No, no, don't fight over me.
                         
          Holley directs her interest toward Ivan.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Signore Tow Truck, per favore?
                          CUT TO:
                         
          MATER - He watches this from a safe hiding spot around a
          corner.
                         
           FINN (V.O.)
           Get ready, Mater.
                          CUT TO:
                         
          FINN, at an outdoor cafe on the casino grounds.
                         
                          FINN
           You're on any moment now.
           CUT BACK TO:
                         
          MATER, now looking a bit nervous. He backs out of sight.
                         
                          MATER
           I don't know about this, Finn.
           What if I screw things up?
                         
           FINN (OVER RADIO)
           Impossible. Just apply the same
           level of dedication you've been
           using to play the "idiot tow truck"
           and you'll be fine.
                         
                          MATER
           It's just that them guys look
           pretty tough and --- Wait, did you
           say "idiot"? Is that how you see
           me?
                         
           FINN (OVER RADIO)
           That's how everyone sees you. Isn't
           that the idea? I tell you, that's
           the genius of it. No one realizes
           they're being fooled because
           they're too busy laughing at the
           fool. Brilliant.
                         
          While Finn talks, Mater takes this in. He catches his own
          reflection in a nearby window. Seems to be seeing himself
          with new eyes.
           83.
                         
                         
          ZZZZATTT! Mater jumps at the sound, turns in time to see Ivan
          SHOCKED UNCONSCIOUS by Holley's ZAPPERS.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Why aren't you in disguise?
                         
                          MATER
           I, uh---
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Come on, there's no time. Go!
                         
                          MATER
           Okay, okay. Computer: disguise.
                         
                          MATER'S COMPUTER
           Request acknowledged.
                         
          EXT. AROUND THE NEXT CORNER - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Mater, now disguised as Ivan the Tow Truck, approaches the
          Hugos. Another LIMO CAR CARRIER arrives.
                         
                          ALEXANDER HUGO
           It's the boss! He is coming!
                         
          The carrier parks and the back opens. VICTOR HUGO waits.
                         
                          VICTOR HUGO
           Ivan!
                         
          Mater realizes Victor is talking to him. He hops to it.
                         
                          VICTOR HUGO
           Ivan, why do you insult me so by
           making me wait?
                         
          Mater, now with Victor hooked, tows him in the front doors of
          the casino.
                         
          ON FINN - now joined in the cafe by Holley who monitors
          everything and SEES EVERYTHING MATER SEES on her display.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           He's in.

           BRENT MUSTANGBURGER (V.O.)
           The racers are now making their way
           around the hairpin, and headed
           downhill toward the casino bridge.

          INT. CASINO - DAY
                         
          Cars play craps with FUZZY DICE; slot machines with odometers

           sparkplugs...
                         
          ON MATER - He tows VICTOR. They are flanked on all four
          corners by Hugo thugs, ala a presidential motorcade. The
          largess of the interior design seems to finally snap Mater
          out of his funk.
                         
                          MATER
                          (WIDE-EYED)
           Wow, this place looks like it's
           made out of gold.
                         
          The Hugos on either side of Mater exchange a look.
                         
           HOLLEY (OVER RADIO)
           That's because it is, Mater. Now,
           be careful what you say.
                         
                          MATER
           Why is that? What do you mean don't
           talk to you?
           (more talking from Holley
           which we cannot hear)
           So you want me to stop talking to
           you. Right now?
                         
                          ALEXANDER HUGO
           You are acting strange today, Ivan.
                         
                          MATER
           I have no idea what you're talking
           about...
                         
          MATER'S P.O.V. - A digital readout isolates the Hugo and

           Hey, you got a lot of aka's, Alex.
           But I guess that makes sense
           seeings how you's wanted in France,
           Germany, the Czech Republic...

           Mater! Stop it!
                         
          Alexander Hugo, unaware of Holley's interruption, whispers to
          Mater as they turn a corner.
                         
                          ALEXANDER HUGO
           Okay, okay. Keep your voice down.
           You're gonna make me arrested.
           (to the other Hugos)
           Don't mess with Ivan today. He's in
           a bad mood.

                          BRENT MUSTANGBURGER
           Sir Axlerod! Is the final race in
           London still going to take place?
                         
          PULL BACK to reveal we are watching this on monitors in the
          PRIVATE CASINO ROOM with the Lemonheads, Zundapp and Mater.
                         
           MILES AXLEROD (ON TV)
           I suppose that... Look, "the show
           must go on" as they say. But now is
           not the time to talk about...
                         
           J. CURBY GREMLIN
           I can't believe this is really
           happening.
                         
                          VLADIMIR TRUNKOV
           Shh, quiet!
                         
           BRENT MUSTANGBURGER (ON TV)
           And Allinol? Will you require all
           the racers to still run on Allinol?
                         
                          VLADIMIR TRUNKOV
           Here it comes.
                         
          On Miles Axlerod: He's devastated.
                         
           MILES AXLEROD (ON TV)
           I cannot in good conscience
           continue to risk the lives of any
           more race cars. The final race will
           not be run on Allinol.
                         
          WILD WHOOPING CHEERS fill the room. Lemonade corks are
          popped.
                         
           BRENT MUSTANGBURGER (ON TV)
           There you have it. A clearly
           devastated Sir Miles Axlerod
           announcing that he will not require
           the cars to use Allinol for the
           final race.

           and alternative fuel forever!

          Holley is already on the run. Speeding away.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Mater. Abort the mission. They've
           got Finn. Get out of there. Get out
           of there right now!
                         
          She turns a corner and STOPS.
                         
          Her escape is now blocked by the same HUGO THUGS she tricked
          before. Another vehicle appears BEHIND HER, LOOMS.

          The Lemonheads celebrate, chant "Long live lemons!" Mater,
          scared, turns to leave. He's stopped by ALEXANDER HUGO.
                         
                          ALEXANDER HUGO
           Isn't this a great party, Ivan?
                         
                          MATER
           Oh yeah, it's unbelievable.
                         
                          ALEXANDER HUGO
           You are not leaving, are you?
                         
                          MATER
           Uh, of course I ain't leavin'.
                         
           MCQUEEN (O.S.)
           I'm just in shock like everybody...
                         
                          MATER
           McQueen?
                         
          He turns, sees that McQueen is being interviewed on the
          monitors.
                         
           MCQUEEN (ON TV)
           Crashes are part of racing, I know.
           But something like that shouldn't
           ever happen.

           They're letting you choose your
           fuel for the final race. Do you
           have any idea what it's going to
           be?

           Allinol.
                         
          The excitement suddenly DRAINS from the room.
                         
                          LEMONHEADS
           - What?! - Did he just say
           Allinol? After today?
                         
           MCQUEEN (ON TV)
           My friend Fillmore says the fuel's
           safe. That's good enough for me. I
           didn't stand by a friend of mine
           recently. I'm not gonna make the
           same mistake twice.

           So a surprising revelation from
           Lightning McQueen...
                         
          Zundapp is already on the phone with their Big Boss who,
          based on his angry O.S. voice, sounds ticked off.
                         
                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           Yes, sir. Of course.
                         
          Zundapp hangs up, turns to the room.
                         
                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           Allinol must be finished for good.
           McQueen cannot win the last race.
           Lightning McQueen must be killed.
                         
          Mater's eyes open wide.
                         
                          MATER
           No!
                         
          Mater backs up, KNOCKING his emergency light against one of
          the monitors. ZZZZZAT! His holographic disguise flickers away
          then quickly SCROLLS THROUGH all of his previous disguises,
          finally revealing rusty old Mater.
                         
                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           It's the American spy!

           Whoa!!
                         
          The Lemons and Lemonheads hit the deck and RETURN FIRE ---
                         
          Mater is THROWN BACKWARD by the force of the guns, back
          through some double doors and onto a BALCONY.
                         
                          MATER

          catches air and is YANKED INTO THE SKY!
                         
          The Lemonheads watch him float away, amazed.
                         
          ON MATER, out of the frying pan but still toasty. He looks
          around, notices:
                         
          LIGHTNING MCQUEEN, far away, leaving the press podium.

           McQueen!
                         
          Mater looks down at the harbor, over which he flies. He spots
          a MOTORBOAT. Mater WHIPS his hook down, steals a ride behind
          the boat TOWARD MCQUEEN.

          The motorboat isn't happy about this, tries to shake him.
          Mater is THROWN INTO A "HOTEL" sign, then SMASHES down
          through a Francesco souvenir stand. As he CRASHES onto the
          ground hard, we SMASH CUT TO ---

           Lemme through! Lemme through!
                         
          MATER barrels around a corner. He's now covered in Francesco
          memorabilia and palm leaves. The word `HOT' now dangles off
          him like the world's biggest bling. He looks INSANE.

          antennae things that spindle toward the sky...
                         
          BACK AT THE SECURITY BARRICADE - Mater, like a nimble running

          McQueen pushes through the press.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Scusi. Mater! Scusi...
                         
          McQueen tracks the tow hook, gets closer. He pushes through
          the last few vehicles ---
                         
                          MCQUEEN

           Lightning McQueen! I am a huge fan.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
                          (CONFUSED)
           Oh, I'm sorry. I thought I heard---
                         
           IVAN THE TOW TRUCK
           Yes, but that was me. I said, "You
           killed out there today." You're
           the best.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           What? Oh. I mean, thanks.
                         
                          PRESS LIAISON
           Right this way, signore ---
                         
          Now the Press Liaison and his assistants are pushing McQueen
          back in the other direction ---
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           (as he's pulled away)
           I really thought I heard my friend.
                         
          As he's pulled away, press and onlookers start to come
          between him and Ivan, who hasn't moved.
           99.
                         
                         
           IVAN THE TOW TRUCK
                          (TO MCQUEEN)
           In England you'll be finished. At
           the finish line.
                         
          Ivan is now obscured again.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Wait, what?
                         
          The ITALIAN PRESS being to swarm.
                         
                          PRESS LIAISON
           Please, the world press is waiting.
           You come with me, please.
                         
          McQueen is pulled back ---
                         
          EXT. STREET - PORTO CORSA - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          --- just as Mater, now BOUND and with HIS MOUTH TAPED, is
          pulled away and thrown into the back of a transport vehicle.
          He lands hard on his side, spits out his TAPE.
                         
                          MATER
           Let me go!
                         
                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           You actually care about that race
           car. A pity you didn't warn him in
           time.
                         
          As the doors close on Mater --- PHHHHHSSSSSSTTTTTTT! A
          thick, noxious gas starts to fill the truck.
                         
          On MATER as the knockout gas works its magic. HIS EYES CLOSE.
                          CUT TO:
                         
          BLACK SCREEN.
                         
           MATER (V.O.)
           Idiot? Is that how you see me?
                         
           FINN (V.O.)
           That's how everyone sees you. I
           tell you, that's the genius of it.
                         
          FADE IN on Mater, back at the Casino, eyeing his reflection
          in the glass window. It's the same moment from before except
          now we are watching it from a DETACHED, FLOATING PERSPECTIVE.
           100.
                         
                         
           FINN (OVER RADIO)
           No one realizes they're being
           fooled because they're too busy
           laughing at the fool.
                         
          - IN THE KABUKI THEATER IN JAPAN - Again, from before. Mater
          makes a spectacle of himself, WHOOPING AND HOLLERING in the
          stands with the face paint on.
                         
                          MATER
           Domo arigato!
                         
          McQueen, Fillmore, Guido, Luigi, Sarge and patrons eye Mater,
          embarrassed and angry.
                         
          - IN THE JAPANESE MUSEUM - The moment of Mater banging on the
          Zen rock garden's glass. Except that now we see all sorts of
          disappointed and eyebrow raising reactions.
                         
                          MATER
           You done good! You got all the
           leaves!
                         
                          JEFF GORVETTE
           Check out that tow truck.
                         
                          LEWIS HAMILTON
           I wonder who that guy's with?
                         
                          MCQUEEN
                          (HUMILIATED)
           Will you guys excuse me just for
           one little second?
                         
          We now REVEAL that this FLOATING, THIRD PERSON PERSPECTIVE is
          MATER. He's INSIDE his past, watching it from others' points
          of view. He doesn't like what he sees.
                         
          - ON MATER, now at the sushi bar.
                         
                          MATER
           Now that's a scoop of ice cream!
                         
          Mater swallows the wasabi with one big bite. He SCREAMS! The
          sushi bar patrons blanch with revulsion at his wail.
                         
          - ON THE FOUNTAIN, as Mater peels into full view of everyone
          else at the party. As Mater laps up water from a fountain:
                         
                          MCQUEEN
                          (EMBARRASSED)
           Mater?!
           101.
                         
                         
          ALL THE RACERS, with FRANCESCO front and center, guffaw at
          Mater.
                         
          - On MCQUEEN, now scolding Mater moments later.
                         
                          MATER
           I never leak oil. Never.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater, you have to get a hold of
           yourself. You're making a scene!
                         
          - IN MCQUEEN'S PIT GARAGE, after the Japanese race.
                         
                          MATER
           Wait a minute. I didn't screw you
           up, did I?
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           I lost the race because of you!
                         
                          MATER
           Maybe if I talked to somebody, or---
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           I don't need your help. I don't
           want your help!
                         
          - Now BACK AT THE PARTY, a moment we didn't see before but
          which presumably happened. Mater is BANGING a ceremonial
          GONG, to the horror of Japanese guests.
                         
                          MATER
           Bang a gong, get it on!
                         
          GONNNNNNG!!! ---
                         
          On the PARTYGOERS, RACE CARS, PARTY STAFF - they're all
          laughing at Mater as McQueen's final words blend in, making a
                         DISSATISFIED CACOPHONY
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Listen, this isn't Radiator
           Springs. This is exactly why I
           don't bring you along to these
           things!
                         
          Off the GONG at the party ---
                         
          INT. BIG BENTLEY - DAY
                         
          --- to the GONG of a CLOCK.
                         
          CLOSE ON MATER as he OPENS HIS EYES.
           102.
                         
                         
          All around him, all he sees are GIANT PIECES OF MECHANIZED
          CLOCKWORK.
                         
          HOLLEY and FINN are here too, strapped bumper to bumper in
          the divots of large clock movements.
                         
                          MATER
           Holley! Finn! Where are we?
                         
                          FINN
           We're in London, Mater. Inside Big
           Bentley.
                         
          EXT. BIG BENTLEY - CONTINUOUS
                         
          The BIG HAND finishes ADVANCING one minute. It's 3 PM.
                         
          INT. BIG BENTLEY - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Suddenly Mater DROPS QUICKLY down toward ---
                         
          --- whirring, scary machinery.
                         
                          MATER
           Woaaaah! ---
                         
          WHAP! The chain yanks to a STOP.
                         
          Mater, instead of being 30 feet from death, is now 20.
                         
          Finn and Holley are only a few clicks closer to being crushed
          themselves. The clock ticks to 3:01.
                         
                          MATER
           This... this is all my fault.
                         
                          FINN
           Don't be a fool, Mater.
                         
                          MATER
           But I am, remember? You said so.
                         
                          FINN
           When did I... Oh. Mater, I was
           complimenting you on what a good
           spy you are.
                         
                          MATER
           I'm not a spy!
                         
          This echoes throughout the clock.
           103.
                         
                         
                          MATER
           I've been trying to tell you that
           the whole time. I really am just a
           tow truck.
                         
          Finn and Holley take this in.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Finn, he's not joking.
                         
                          FINN
           I know.
                         
                          MATER
           You were right, Finn. I'm a fool.
           And what's happened to McQueen is
           `cause I'm such a big one. This is
           all my fault.
                         
          GREM and ACER arrive on a lift, roll into view on a catwalk.
                         
                          GREM
           Good, you're up!
                         
                          ACER
           And just in time!
                         
                          GREM
           Professor Z wanted you to have a
           front row seat for the death of
           Lightning McQueen.
                         
                          MATER
                          (HOPEFUL)
           He's still alive?
                         
          Acer whips a sheet away, revealing the WGP CAMERA, turns it
          toward the clock face.
                         
                          ACER
           Not for much longer.
                         
          He pushes the camera through an open small window, turns it
          toward the course. Mater DROPS down again ---
                         
          FINN and HOLLEY CLICK FORWARD.
                         
          EXT. LONDON - DAY
                         
          Big Bentley's big hand CLICKS ahead another minute. But we're
          a bit farther away from it than before.
                         
           SALLY (O.S.)
           We came as soon as you called.

          INT. MCQUEEN'S PIT - LONDON
                         
          Sally, flanked by Red, Flo and Ramone, are in front of ----
                         
          --- McQueen and the rest of the team.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           I called to talk to Mater. It never
           occurred to me that he wouldn't be
           there.
                         
                          RAMONE
           Sheriff is talking to Scotland Yard
           right now.
                         
                          FLO
           And Sarge is in touch with his
           friends in the British military.
                         
                          SALLY
           You just need to focus on the race.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           I know, but Sal, with everything
           going on I'm not sure I should---
                         
          A HORN O.S. Someone's entering the pit. Everyone parts,
          revealing MILES AXLEROD.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Sir Axlerod.
                         
                          MILES AXLEROD
           I'm sorry to interrupt.

           they planted it in your air filter.

          THUNK! It all sticks to the magnet, right next to Finn's
          bullets. They're BOMBS, GRENADES, ROCKETS and one little
          detonator with a flashing, beeping light.
                         
          Off the boat's RXN ---
                          CUT TO:
                         
          ANOTHER PART OF LONDON, AT STREET LEVEL
                         
          KA-BOOOOOOM! A distant explosion (miles away) festoons into
          the air, visible over the rooftops. Holley suddenly WINGS
          into view. She sees ---
                         
          Mater and McQueen, speeding up the street.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Mater, stop!
                         
                          MATER
           No way! You could get hurt!
                         
          Then she looks over, catches a glimpse of GREM AND ACER,
          bearing down on them from a side street. They're going to
          broadside Mater and McQueen.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Oh no.
                         
          ON MATER AND MCQUEEN - They're not aware of the impending
          impact.
                         
          Holley DROPS FROM THE SKY, hits the pavement, SKIDS into the
          path of the AMCs and DEFLECTS THEM. They FLIP OVER Holley,
          Finn and McQueen and sail ---
                         
          --- INTO A PUB ---
                         
          --- where they skid across the room and SLAM into the bar,
          knocking a ROW OF BEER MUGS to the ground.
                         
          IN THE PUB - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          Grem and Acer are pulverized by the bar patrons.
                         
          EXT. LONDON STREET - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          Holley, McQueen and Mater are now stopped.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Mater, we've got to get that bomb
           off you.
           118.
                         
                         
          She's already SCANNING the bomb, working away.
                         
                          MCQUEEN

                          MATER
           Yeah, they strapped it to me to
           kill you as a back-up plan.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Back-up plan? Mater, who put a bomb
           on you?
                         
           PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP (O.S.)
           Ahhhhh!
                         
          Professor Zundapp suddenly ROLLS to a stop next to (a now
          totally freaked) McQueen, entangled in grappling hooks care
                         OF ---

                          (TO MCQUEEN)
           You. Why didn't my death ray kill
           you?
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Death ray?
                         
                          FINN
           Turn off the bomb, Zundapp!
                         
                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           Are you all so dense? It's voice-

          The BOMB suddenly TRANSFORMS into a TIME BOMB, now complete
          with a countdown mechanism from 4:59... 4:58... Mater GASPS.
                         
                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           Oops. Did I forget to mention that
           it can only be disarmed by the one
           who activated it?
                         
          Holley immediately shoves a GUN in Zundapp's grill.
           119.

           Would anyone else like to try?
                         
          ZZZZZZATTT! Holley shocks him unconscious.
                         
                          FINN
                          (TO HOLLEY)
           You read my mind.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           He was getting on my nerves.

           It's very simple.
                         
          VICTOR HUGO blocks the entrance to a side street. He's
          surrounded by Hugo relatives.

           You blow up.
                         
          The four streets surrounding them are now blocked by each of
          the Lemonheads and their families.

          McQueen turns to Mater - he wasn't expecting that.
                         
          The Lemons all eye each other, considering Mater's words.

          WHOOM!!! He's BROADSIDED by a blast of water from O.S.
                         
          It's Red! He's sitting outside an underground entrance,
          followed by Sally and the rest of the Radiator Springs gang.
                         
          ALL OUT WAR ensues between the LEMONS, RADIATOR SPRINGS along
          with FINN and HOLLEY.
                         
          FINN attaches his four-way cable hooks to the thugs and
          springs high in the air, crushing the four of them together.
                         
          HOLLEY SPROUTS her wings, and knocks out two cars on her

          Flo hits VLADIMIR TRUNKOV with her high-beams, BLINDING HIM.

           people aren't taking you seriously,
           then they need to change. Not you.
           I know that, because I was wrong
           before. Now you can do this. You're

                          QUEEN'S GUARD
           Back up! Back away!
                         
                          QUEEN
                          (STAR-STRUCK)
           It's Lightning McQueen!
                         
                          QUEEN'S GUARDS
           Get back!
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           No, no, it's okay! Tell them,
           Mater. Explain.
                         
                          MATER
           Okay! Somebody's been sabotaging
           the racers and hurting the cars and
           I know who. Oh wait... Your
           Majesty.
                         
          Mater BOWS to the Queen. In doing so, the TICKING TIME BOMB
          angles into view. The clock's at T-minus 1:53.
                         
                          QUEEN'S GUARDS
           - Bomb! - It's a bomb! - Everybody
           down! - Look out!
                         
           FINN (O.S.)
           Hold your fire! He can't disarm it!
                         
          Finn dives onto the platform and rolls between the Queen and
          Mater.
                         
                          FINN
           Mater, I don't know what you're
           doing but stand down now!
                         
                          MATER
           (aside, to McQueen)
           This ain't nothing at all like
           Radiator Springs.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater, just cut to the chase!
                         
                          MATER
           Okay.
           124.
                         
                         
          He turns to Miles Axlerod.
                         
                          MATER
           It's him.
                         
                          MILES AXLEROD
           What? Me? You've got to be crazy.
                         
          Everyone exchanges confused looks, including Finn and Holley.
                         
                          MATER
           I figured it out when I realized
           you all attached this ticking time
           bomb with Whitworth bolts. The same
           bolts that hold together that old
           British engine from the photograph.
           Holley! Show that picture.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           O-kay...
                         
          Holley projects the much discussed PHOTO OF THE ENGINE.
                         
                          MATER
           And then I remembered what they say
           about old British engines - "If
           there ain't no oil under `em, there
           ain't no oil in `em."
                         
                          MILES AXLEROD
           What is he talking about?
                         
                          MATER
           It was you leaking oil at the party
           in Japan. You just blamed it on me.
                         
                          MILES AXLEROD
           Electric cars don't use oil, you
           twit.
                         
                          MATER
           Then you're faking it. You didn't
           convert to no electric. We pop that
           hood we gonna see that engine from
           that picture right there.
                         
          Mater moves toward Miles Axlerod to pop his hood.
                         
                          MILES AXLEROD
           This lorry's crazy. He's going to
           kill us all!
                         
          Miles Axlerod BACKS UP to the edge of the stage.
           125.
                         
                         
                          MILES AXLEROD
           Stay away!
                         
                          HOLLEY
           But Sir Axlerod created the race,
           Mater. Why would he want to hurt
           anyone?
                         
                          MATER
           To make Allinol look bad so
           everybody'd go back to using oil. I
           mean, he said it himself with that
           disguised voice.
                         
                          MILES AXLEROD
           "Dee-sguised voice?" What are you
           talking about? You're nuts, you
           are!
                         
          The QUEEN'S GUARDS have had ENOUGH. As has the PRINCE.
                         
                          PRINCE WHEELIAM
           This is going nowhere fast. We
           really should go, Grandmother.
                         
                          QUEEN
           One moment. I'd like to see where
           this is going.
                         
                          FINN
           Mater, he created Allinol.
                         
                          MATER
           Yeah, but what if he found that
           huge oil field just as the world
           was trying to find something else?
                         
          Mater sticks his ticking bomb-nose into Miles Axlerod's
          grill.
                         
                          MATER
           What if he came up with Allinol
           just to make alternative fuel look
           bad?
                         
                          MILES AXLEROD
           "What if?" You're basing this on a
           "What if"?!
                         
                          GUARD
           Okay, that's it.
                         
          And the QUEEN'S GUARDS spirit the Queen and Prince Wheeliam
          out of there FAST ---
           126.
                         
                         
                          MILES AXLEROD
           Wait! Somebody save me! The lorry's
           crazy!
                         
          Now it's just Miles Axlerod, Mater, McQueen, Finn and Holley.
          Miles Axlerod's back tires slip on the edge of the podium as
          he is cornered by Mater.
                         
                          MILES AXLEROD
           Keep away, you idiot!
                         
          00:00:08...
                         
                          FINN
           Mater!
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Mater!
                         
          00:03...00:02...
                         
                          MILES AXLEROD
           Someone do something!
                         
          Everyone FLINCHES, DUCKS or DIVES FOR COVER except McQueen,
          Mater and Axlerod ---
                         
                          MILES AXLEROD
           You're insane, you are!
           Deactivate!!
                         
          The bomb FREEZES at 00:01.
                         
           THE BOMB'S COMPUTER VOICE
           Bomb deactivated. Have a nice day,
           Sir Axlerod.
                         
          General shock all around. Miles Axlerod realizes what he's
          done, looks terrified. Police surround him.
                         
          Mater FLINGS Miles Axlerod's hood open with his hook,
          revealing AN INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE, oil dripping from
          all sides. It MATCHES the photo.
                         
                          FINN
           The engine from the photo.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           It's a perfect match!
                         
                          MILES AXLEROD
           How did the tow truck figure it
           out?
           127.
                         
                         
                          MCQUEEN
                          (TO MATER)
           It's official. You're coming to all
           my races from now on.
                         
                          MATER
           Now you're talking!
                         
          Tire bump.
                         
          EXT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY
                         
          A massive crowd packs the adjacent streets and parks.
                         
          INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY
                         
          Mater does the requisite "silly faces" in an attempt to break
          the composure of a Buckingham Palace Guard. It isn't working.
          McQueen approaches.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater, let's go. You're on.
                         
          INT. QUEEN'S CHAMBER - BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY
                         
          The Queen sits in attention at the front of the Main
          Ballroom. As Mater and McQueen approach:
                         
                          LORD STEWARD
           Your Majesty. May I present for the
           investiture of honorary Knighthood
           of the British Realm. Tow Mater of
           Radiator Springs.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Go get `em, buddy.
                         
          McQueen joins his friends from Radiator Springs. Mater rolls
          forward. He bows, as if he's practiced it all day.
                         
                          QUEEN
           I hereby dub thee "Sir Tow Mater."
                         
          Applause from all around.
                         
                          MATER
                          (LOOKS UP)
           "Sir?" Shoot, you can just call me
           Mater, Your Majesty. I don't wanna
           hear none of this "Sir" business.
           By the way, have y'all met each
           other? Queen? McQueen. McQueen,
           Queen. McQueen? McMissile.
                          (MORE)
           128.
                         
                          MATER (CONT'D)
           McMissile, McQueen. Queen?
           McMissile.
                         
          He continues introducing everyone as we CUT TO ---
                         
          EXT. RADIATOR SPRINGS - DAY
                         
          The town sign now reads "WELCOME TO RADIATOR SPRINGS - HOME
          OF LIGHTNING MCQUEEN AND SIR TOW MATER."
                         
          EXT. FLO'S - DAY
                         
          Cars surround Mater and McQueen. The rest of the Radiator
          Springs gang is here too, watches. VAN and MINNY are front
          and center.
                         
                          MATER
           So there I was: rocket jets going
           full blast, McQueen hanging on for
           dear life when suddenly them two
           nasty lemons come out of nowhere,
           guns drawed. We was goners. But
           then out of nowhere, this beautiful
           spy car swoops in from the sky to
           save us!
                         
                          MINNY
           That's a very entertaining story,
           young man.
                         
                          VAN
           Oh, Minny, please. Come on, none of
           this happened. Rocket jets? Flying
           spy cars?
                         
                          HOLLEY
           No, you're quite right. It does
           sound a bit far-fetched.
                         
          The crowd turns, sees HOLLEY, wings out, swooping in. FINN is
          right below her, driving up the street.
                         
                          MATER
           Holley! Finn!
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Hello, Mater. It's so nice to see
           you again.
                         
                          MATER
           What're you doing here?

           I'm Mater's girlfriend. It's so
           nice to meet you all.
                         
          Everyone is shocked. Including Mater. Guido's jaw drops.

           Whoa, honey. You got a nasty dent
           there.
                         
          Indeed, Holley still wears the dent from when she saved Mater
          from Grem and Acer.

           Don't you worry, sweet pea. My baby
           Ramone can get that fixed up for
           you in no time.

           Oh no no. I'm keeping that dent.
           It's way too valuable.
                         
          Mater takes this in.

           You know, there's one thing I still
           don't get. The bad guys hit me with
           the beam from the camera, right? So
           why didn't I, you know...
                         
                          MATER
           Explode in a fiery inferno?

           Yeah.

           We couldn't figure that one out
           either.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Our investigation proved that
           Allinol was actually gasoline. And
           Miles Axlerod engineered it so that
           when it got hit by the beam it
           would explode.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Wait a second. Fillmore, you said
           my fuel was safe.
                         
          McQueen turns to Fillmore. Everyone does.

           If you're implying that I switched
           out that rotgut excuse for
           alternative fuel with my all-
           natural, sustainable, organic
           biofuel just because I never
           trusted Axlerod, you're dead wrong,

                          FRANCESCO
           Is good, McQueen. Very funny. It
           was funnier when I did it, but
           it's very funny. What are you going
           to do next? Are you going to take
           off your fenders? Try it. You'll

TITLES OVER YELLOW BACKGROUND.
We PULL BACK to reveal we're looking at THE SUN. In the
distance lie the gorgeous San Gabriel Mountains and the
Downtown Los Angeles skyline.
In ONE LONG TRACKING SHOT, we CRANE PAST some trees to reveal
the vast expansive homes scattered in the hills of Brentwood.
HOMEOWNERS walk dogs, a PAPERBOY chucks papers fr9m a
gleaming mountain bike... It's early in the morning, and the
landscapers haven't come with their leaf blowers yet.
CONTINUE BOOMING DOWN to road level to face    the resplendent
Martin residence. We STEADICAM down the fr    ont walk, able to
admire the manicured hedges and the black E   scalade in the
driveway, to the front door decorated with    a whimsical
placard that reads, "The Martins" -- and we    pass THROUGH THE
KEYHOLE into the foyer.

INT. JESSICA'S HOUSE - MORNING
We TRACK through the living room, passing framed photos of an
athletic eleven year old boy, and we hear a WOMAN'S VOICE as
she comes down the stairs with a GOLDEN RETRIEVER at her
side.

                     WOMAN
               (into phone)
          Yes Donna, I'm out the door.
We TRACK over the Woman's shoulder and follow her into the
kitchen, unable to see her face.

                     WOMAN (CONT'D)
          Just inform Kayleigh that
          anesthesia is on the way to prep
          the epidural and I'll be there as
          soon as I can.
Still looking over her shoulder, we watch her absently
straighten a PHOTOGRAPH of her son on the fridge as she
talks.

                    WOMAN (CONT'D)
          And promise her she's about to have
          a woooonnderful labor.
As the woman pours herself a fresh cup of coffee, her
HOUSEKEEPER enters the kitchen with a full laundry basket.
They give each other a silent wave.

                    WOMAN (CONT'D)
          Right, I'll see you in twenty.
She hangs up her cordless and takes a breath as we COME
AROUND to finally REVEAL JESSICA MARTIN; slightly weary, but
ready for the day ahead.

                     JESSICA
          Buenas dias, Rosario.



                      ROSARIO
           Good morning Miss Jessica.
Jessica sees her answering machine blinking, hits PLAY.
In the background, a cheerful Rosario enters frame and heads
for the back door carrying the basket of laundry.

                 MALE VOICE
           (on machine)
           Honey? Honey, wake up.   Pick up the-
And as she brings the coffee cup to her lips--
SLAMM!! The door EXPLODES open and a squad of FIVE GUNMEN
storm in, wearing SKI-MASKS. Everything is a whirlwind of
quick cuts, noise and confusion.
Jessica's DOG starts to lunge at the men and -- thup! -- is
stilled by a silenced pistol before its second bark.
Rosario runs for the ALARM SYSTEM --

                     LEAD GUNMAN
          Get away from there! Don't touch
          that -- !!
-- but as she reaches out for the PANIC BUTTON -- BLAM!!     He
blows her away, too. The Gunman curses, then turns on
Jessica.

                 LEAD GUNMAN (CONT'D)
          (dire)
          Where is he?
Jessica cringes.

                     JESSICA
          Where is who?

                     LEAD GUNMAN
          Wrong answer.
The bastard hauls back and -- WHAM I -- punches her in the
face, knocking Jessica cold.
Then he turns to his men.

                     LEAD GUNMAN (CONT'D)
          Search the house.
And as the answering machine fills the silence:

                CRAIG VO
          (on machine)
          -I'll call back later.
The LEAD GUNMAN spins around, and we PUSH INTO the blackness
of his masked face.

                                            MATCH CUT TO:



EXT. KIDNAPPERS' SAFEHOUSE - DAY
The BLACKNESS of a BLACK VAN and ESCALADE passing below us.
We quickly CRANE DOWN to see the vehicles traveling through:
An IRON GATE at the edge of an aband9ned property. They
bounce down a long lonely driveway lined with barren trees--
ANGLE ON: THE KIDNAPPERS' VAN as it arrives at its
destination; an isolated HOUSE in the Hills. The grass is
dead. The trees are dead. It's the kind of place you could
scream for a week and no one would hear a thing.
As the van stops--

                                     WE PUSH INTO ITS DOORS:

INT. DARKENED ATTIC - KIDNAPPERS' SAFEHOUSE
A door CRASHES open. Light slices through the dark revealing
the dusty, skeletal interior. Jessica is hurled into the
room and falls to the floor. With bound hands, she
frantically pulls her blindfold off to see--

THE LEAD SKI-MASKED KIDNAPPER
Standing in front of her.    Sturdier than the rest.   Solid.
Imposing.

                     JESSICA
          Wh... what do you want?
Unsettlingly, the Kidnapper says nothing, staring at her.
Jessica tries to remain calm under his angry gaze...
Then suddenly, the Kidnapper turns and exits the room.
Jessica breathes a sigh of relief...but it catches in her
throat as he returns ten seconds later -- with a BASEBALL BAT.
Grim as death, he stalks toward her --

                       JESSICA (CONT'D)
          No, wait..
And reaching.her, he hauls back and SWINGS --

                     JESSICA (CONT'D)

          NO!   PLEASE--//
SMASH! The bat connects with a wooden beam an inch above
Jessica's head, OBLITERATING the ROTARY DIAL TELEPHONE that
hung there.
As phone guts shower down on her, the Lead Kidnapper turns
and stomps away, slamming the attic door shut and locking
Jessica in the darkness.
Only now that they're gone does Jessica allow her fear to
show through. Trembling, tears running down her face,
Jessica finally breaks down, pleading to the empty attic--



                       JESSICA (CONT'D)
            Wha... what the hell is happening?!
The attic's suffocating silence is the only answer she gets.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

THE OCEAN
Skimming along the water.
And we TILT UP to reveal the majestic beaches of Southern
California, and at the center of it all, the SANTA MONICA

PIER.

EXT. SANTA MONICA PIER - MORNING - ESTABLISHING
It would be a typical day, except for that some PEOPLE are
preparing for a "HEAL THE BAY" rally at the end of the pier.
VENDORS set up, preparing for the daily grind ahead.
BIKERS gather around a bad-ass HELLCAT G2 CONFEDERATE
MOTORCYCLE and admire its cutting-edge design.
HOT CHICKS in bikinis try on sunglasses at a stand.
FISHERMEN crack beers while awaiting the next bite.

INT. SANTA MONICA PIER - ARCADE - MORNING

ANGLE ON - ARCADE GAME SCREEN.
The screen displays a car-race arcade game. A computer
generated hot-rod passes other racers at breakneck speed.
Playing the sit-down game, DAYTONA USA, is:
RYAN ACKERMAN, early twenties, looks like he grew up on the
beach without so much as a pot to piss in. His lethal
reflexes and bold recklessness, however, have made him a Jedi
Master of the game.
Ryan's score approaches the HIGH SCORE at the top of the
screen.

                       RYAN
            You recording this?

                       CHAD (OS)
            Yeah, sure...
CHAD, his best bud, aims a BLUE TOOTH VIDEOSTREAMING
CELLPHONE at some CUTE GIRLS instead. We can see their faces
on the tiny SCREEN of the cellphone.
Ryan's car gets caught behind a blue speedster, then passes
on the shoulder.



                       RYAN
            Move, bitch.
He gets an EXTENDED PLAY and the screen flashes "NEW RECORD."
Nearby, a KID watching the game nods.

                        KID
            Nice.
The HIGH SCORE starts rising to match Ryan's score.

                        RYAN
            Get that?
Ryan turns around to see Chad has shoved the cellphone down
the front of his tattered shorts. And he's freeballing it.

                       CHAD
            Check it; Attack of the Bubblegum
            Monster in Hi-Def videostream-

                      RYAN
            C'mon Chad, I gotta put my mouth on
            that.
Holding a cup of soda between his teeth, Chad pulls the
cellphone out of his pants and hits "SEND".

                        CHAD
                 (through cup-holding
                  teeth)
            Sweet. It's going to my email
            right now.
S9me soda inadvertently SPILLS onto the cellphone and Chad
wipes it dry on his pants.

                       RYAN
            Watch it dude, I gotta return that
            thing in seven days.

                       CHAD
            They aren't giving you shit yet?

                       RYAN
            Nah, whenever I return it, I just
            list off why the phone sucks and
            they give me a new model. Figure
            by the tenth time I'll have to go
            somewhere else.
Ryan's car finally CRASHES in a wall of flames.       Game Over.

                                            CUT TO:

THE OCEAN
As seen looking over the rail of the pier.      The tide is in,
but it's still a forty foot drop.


RYAN stares over the railing like a death row inmate
contemplating his last meal.

                      CHAD
           Go already. No one's looking.
His left hand holds his WALLET.

                 CHAD (CONT'D)
           (re: wallet)
           Need me to hold that?
Ryan sticks it in the pocket of his surfer shorts -- he zips
a zipper, tucks a Velcro flap. Pats his pocket proudly.

                     RYAN
          Waterproof.
But as soon as Ryan covertly CLIMBS ONTO THE RAIL, his left
leg starts trembling like crazy.

                     RYAN (CONT'D)
          This is stupid. I could get
          killed. Pick another dare.
Chad lowers the phone, irritated.

                     CHAD
          My ass. Not after you made me
          march in the Gay Pride Parade
          wearing a thong.

                     RYAN
          Screw it then. In one... Two...
          Two and a half--

                     CHAD
          Whole numbers only, Rabbitfoot.
Ryan stares at the waves crashing below. His leg starts
snaking like crazy... And he chickens out, hopping back to
the deck.

                    CHAD (CONT'D)
          Just so you know, I'm emailing this
          to every chick you ever met.
But suddenly Ryan's oblivious to the dare.   His eyes are
glued to something else--

                CHAD (CONT'D)
          (speaking like HAL 900)
          Transmitting pussy file now.
CHLOE, early 20s, a head turner, confident, funny; she can
pull you in like a tractor beam. She and some CUTE FRIENDS
carry heavy cardboard boxes toward a table set up for the
"Heal The Bay" rally.
Ryan walks over like he owns the place.



                      RYAN
           Got any more? I'm here to help.

                      CHLOE
           Thanks, but no, we got 'em all.

                      RYAN
           What's in 'em?
Chloe opens the box.    Hands him a "Heal The Bay" pamphlet.

                      RYAN (CONT'D)
           Cool, you're handing these out
           during the concert?

                     CHLOE
          Yeah, wanna help?
Ryan tries to ignore his thundering heart.

                       RYAN
          Hell yeah.     I'm all about "Heal the
          Bay. "
His eyes ricochet off the pamphlet in his hand.

                     RYAN (CONT'D)
          Me an Chad do the monthly cleanup
          thing, of course...
An awesome wing-man, Chad appears over Chloe's shoulder,
pretending to read a pamphlet, but really holding it up so
Ryan can see it. Piece of cake, now.

                     RYAN (CONT'D)
          We've collected water samples with
          the Stream Team, raised money on
          the Promenade... I'm surprised I
          haven't seen you.
He offers his hand.

                       RYAN (CONT'D)
          Ryan.
She takes it.

                       CHLOE
          Chloe.
The handshake lingers a second longer than necessary, and
they both smile at each other. Chad splits.

                     CHLOE (CONT'D)
          I can't tell if you're full of it.
Ryan stops posturing, gets real.

                     RYAN
          You ever go up to Santa Barbara?
          My dad used to take me there all



                      RYAN (CONT'D)
           the time. Their pier is amazing,
           clear water, huge crabs everywhere,
           oysters right there on the rocks,
           starfish... Hard to believe it's
           the same ocean sometimes.
He's managed to win her back.

                     CHLOE
           Maybe you and I can take a break
           later when Pat Benatar goes on.

                      RYAN
           Sounds like a plan.
There's a moment...     Then --

                     CHLOE
          Oh no -- I forgot. I still have to
          pick up a box of T-shirts at the
          Kinkos on Venice.

                     RYAN
           I'll do it for you... if you want.

                    CHLOE
          Seriously, you would?

                       RYAN
          Sure.     How much is the bill?

                       CHLOE
          Nothing.    It's been paid up front.

                    RYAN
          Do you promise not to go anywhere?

                       CHLOE
          Done.
Ryan makes a graceful exit.       Turns back.

                     RYAN
          Okay, I won't be long.

                CHLOE
          (laughing)
          Bye.
Ryan grabs Chad, and as they walk out of earshot:

                    RYAN
          Dude, does Santa Barbara have a
          harbor or a pier?

                                                CUT TO:

EXT. VENICE - DAY
A short time later, Ryan cruises through a Venice
neighborhood.


Ryan drives an early 70's Ford Bronco; clothes are strewn
across the backseat, and a box of "Heal the Bay" T-SHIRTS now
sits on the shotgun seat.
Ryan reaches into the glove box and pulls out a toothbrush.
He sips warm soda from a bottle and begins brushing.
Checking himself out in the mirror, he sniffs his pits, whoa,
and grabs the cellphone.

                      RYAN
                (into phone)
           Dex, wassup? You won't believe the
           hotties I just met at the pier.
           Smoking. You wanna meet them?
           Yeah? Well don't get too excited
           'cause I need my money.
Ryan stops at a red light.

                      RYAN (CONT'D)
           Bullshit, you're not going
           anywhere,
                (quickly adding)
           I'm pulling up right now.
Some AMBULANCES SPEED BY, SIRENS BLARING.   It's deafening.
Ryan lays on the horn.   When the light changes, Ryan peels
away angrily.

                    RYAN (CONT'D)
              (covering his ear)
          What? Yeah, you better be. And I
          need your shower, I'm talkin' code
          red stankage-
The CELLPHONE begins to CRACKLE with STATIC just as Ryan
drives under an OVERPASS.
Suddenly --
The car ahead of him STOPS in the middle of the street. Ryan
notices too late and has to jam on the brakes. The car
skids, he SCREAMS... and comes to a stop an inch before
hitting the other car's bumper.
He lifts the phone receiver to his ear but the call is WASHED

WITH STATIC.

                RYAN (CONT'D)
          (into phone)
          Dex? You still there...?
And as has happened to all of us, he loses the call.

                    RYAN (CONT'D)
          Damn.

EXT. HIGHWAY OVERPASS - MOMENTS LATER                           10
As traffic resumes and Ryan clears the overpass--


ID                                                                   iu





     SFX:   THE CELLPHONE RINGS.
     Ryan picks up the phone.

                           RYAN
                Sorry, got cut off.      Hey -- what's
                my Caller ID say?
     But there's no voice on the other end, only shuffling sounds.

                             RYAN (CONT'D)
                Yo Dex...?

                                                   MATCH CUT TO:

11   INT. KIDNAPPERS' ATTIC                                          11

     ECU - A TANGLE OF PHONE WIRES
12   Their insulation picked off and spliced together. PAN ALONG 12
     the attic floor, past the rubble of the shattered phone,
     foll9wing the crudely repaired wires to JESSICA'S HANDS,
     tapping the dialer wires together. She's trying so hard to
     simulate a NUMERIC PULSE that she almost doesn't hear:

                             RYAN (VO)
                Hello...?
     Jessica's hands go suddenly still, then -- WHOOM! -- her head
     slams down INTO FRAME on top of the crushed earpiece, a
     desperate hope filling her eyes.

                                                   CUT BACK TO:

13   INT. FORD BRONCO - CONTINUOUS                                   13
     With still no answer, Ryan pulls the phone from his ear --

                             RYAN
                Whatever.    Signing off-
     -- and is just about to hit END CALL when he hears a tiny
     female voice on the other end.

                            JESSICA (VO)
                Wait!    Don't hang up!
     Ryan puts the phone back to his ear.

                             RYAN
                Hello?

                           JESSICA (VO)
                There's not much time! I need you
                to go to the police. My name is
                Jessica Martin; I've been kidnapped!

                           RYAN
                     (not buying)
                Oh really? Kidnapped, huh?


13                                                                          j.j





                             JESSICA (VO)
                  Please. I know what you're
                  thinking, but it's real! I'm in an
                  attic somewhere. I think they're
                  going to kill me! You need to-

                  Awfully polite kidnappers to give
                  you a phone...
     Jessica's voice TREMBLES uncontrollably.        Desperate, fearful
     and frustrated.

                              JESSICA (VO)
                  No!   You don't understand!
     Suddenly, the cellphone BLIPS twice in Ryan's ear.          He pulls
     it away and looks at its faceplate.

14   INSERT SHOT - THE CELLPHONE                                            14
     The LCD reads:     CALL WAITING.   ACCEPT?

                             RYAN
                  If you were really in trouble, you
                  would've called the cops, not me.
                  Now I've got a real call on the
                  other line--

     A WIDER SHOT so we see Jessica's bound hands. Her bruised
     face. Whispering frantically into the DEMOLISHED TELEPHONE
     she's JERI-RIGGING back together as she talks.

                             JESSICA (VO)
                  Goddamn it, listen to me! The

                  There's no dialer! I've been
                  clicking wires together for hours
                  trying to get someone, anyone, and

     SFX: Ryan's call waiting BLIPS again.        He considers
     everything Jessica has said, then:

                            RYAN
                  Hmm. Sucks to be you. Try crank
                  yanking someone else. Late.

     But -- CLICK!       Ryan flashes over to the next call.

     A TELEMARKETER checks Ryan's name on a list, then glances at
     the script.

                            TELEMARKETER
                 Hello, Mr. Ackerman. My name is
                 Mark and I'd like to discuss with
                 you the benefits of Mastercharge
                 Credit Union's-

                           RYAN (VO)
                 Awesome, I can totally use a credit
                 card. Tell me more.

                               TELEMARKETER
                 Absolutely.     We've lowered our APR-

                           RYAN
                 -Shucks, now's really not a good
                 time, but why don't I get your
                 number and get back to you later.

                            TELEMARKETER
                 Sure, it's 818...

                           RYAN
                 That's the office number?

                              TELEMARKETER
                 Yes.

                            RYAN
                 Why don't you give me your number
                 instead. That way I can call you
                 when you're having dinner with your
                 family.
     A beat.

                            TELEMARKETER
                 Sorry to have bothered you.
     Click!    The Telemarketer hangs up.

                            RYAN
                 Damn skippy.
     And that's when he notices the message flashing on the
     phone's faceplate: CALL ON HOLD. Ryan clicks the FLASH
     button to pick it up...and Jessica is still there.



INTERCUT CALL - RYAN IN CAR/JESSICA IN ATTIC                    19

                      JESSICA (VO)
           --an you hear me?!

                     RYAN
           You still there? You're getting
           kinda creepy, lady. See ya.

                       JESSICA
          No!    Don't! They're going to kill
          me!    They're going to kill me!!
A silent beat.   A calculated look in her eyes...
RYAN pulls the phone from his ear and is about to hang
up...when he hears the one sound that stops all men cold.
On the other end, Jessica begins to CRY.

                    RYAN
          Oh, it's like that, huh?     Nice with
          the fake tears, lady...

                      JESSICA
          Please...   I just need help.
But Ryan won't be manipulated.

                    RYAN
          You need acting lessons. Now go take
          your meds and bug someone else.

                    JESSICA
          These men!!!--
Jessica stops herself short, quieting the rising hysteria in
her voice before it gives her away. She glances anxiously at
the attic door, then continues, more in control.

                     JESSICA (CONT'D)
          These men killed my housekeeper.
          My dog. You have to help me.
Ryan bristles at being saddled with anything, much less this.

                    RYAN
          No, actually( I don't. Not with a
          hot chick waiting for me at the
          pier.

                      JESSICA
          Please...you're my only hope.
               (beat)
          What's your name?
That catches Ryan off-guard.   He stalls, not wanting to make
this personal.

                     RYAN
          Why, you writing a book--?


19                                                                  x?





                           JESSICA
                --Please, just tell me your name!
     Ryan glances around the street, his eyes falling on a stone
     fountain outside a French Restaurant.

                           RYAN
                Uh...Johnny. Johnny Fountain.

                           JESSICA
                Johnny... What if it was your
                mother who was calling for help?
                How would you feel?

                           RYAN
                Well, I'd be damn impressed,
                considering she's dead.

                           JESSICA
                Goddamn it, how difficult is it to
                hand this phone off to the police?!
                I'll pay you!

                           RYAN
               How much?

                          JESSICA
               Five thousand dollars.

                          RYAN
               Sure you will. I'm hanging up now.

                          JESSICA
               No, wait! WAIT!! Even if there's
               a eighty percent chance I'm lying,
               you nave a one in five chance to
               make five grand f9r a lousy twenty
               minutes of your life.
                    (panics as Ryan is silent)
               Haven't you ever bet on a horse or
               bought a Lottery ticket? I'm
               talking one-in-five odds, twenty
               minutes.
     Ryan slaps the radio off.

                          RYAN
               What do you want me to do?

                                                CUT TO:

20   INT. 15TH PRECINCT - STATION DESK - DAY                        20

     SOMEONE'S POV.
     In EXTREME SLOW-MOTION, chaos unfolds around us like a
     nightmare --
     OFFICERS manhandle a drunk toward the back, a HOOKER screams
     at us with unholy rage, in the far corner, a JUNKIE spits on



20                                                                     ^


     an OFFICER'S FACE and there's a lethal race for disinfectant
     through invisible soup.
     Sounds are distant, eerily muffled.      A HIGH-PITCHED WHINE
     lets us know we're in hell.
     CLOSE UP:    BOB MOONEY'S EYES.    Concerned, but not panicked.
     MOONEY'S POV. Still surreal, SLOW-MOTION, as an Officer with
     a CREWCUT responds by spinning the Junkie's face into a wall,
     legal but hard.
     SFX:   A HEARTBEAT.    OURS.    FAST... And possibly IRREGULAR?
     CLOSE UP - SLOW MOTION - The RIGHT THUMB presses into the

     LEFT WRIST.
     MOONEY'S EYES.      Watching.   Counting... Suddenly --
     WHAM!! Back to reality when a YOUNG GANGBANGER is slammed
     into the station desk by a ROOKIE.

                            ROOKIE OFFICER
                 Problem, Mooney. If I put this one
                 in with the others, there's gonna
                 be a bloodbath.

                            GANGBANGER
                 Put me in there! I'll waste all
                 them pussies!
     REVEAL SERGEANT BOB MOONEY -- a tough, fifty-something beat
     cop who's fighting growing old every step of the way. He
     rolls his eyes at the situation and takes a bite of PIZZA.

                            MOONEY
                 Come on Powell, put the Sharks with
                 the Sharks, the Jets with the Jets
                 and make room.
     Rookie Powell suppresses his irritation and roughly yanks the
     Gangbanger back over to the holding cells.
     Mooney puts down the pizza, no appetite, and stares at the
     news story playing on the TV mounted in the corner.

21   ON THE TELEVISION                                                 21
     a NEWS REPORTER is in the middle of a segment. Over him,
     FOOTAGE rolls of six guilty-looking cops testifying in court;
     being led away in handcuffs.

                            NEWS REPORTER
                 ...was somber when the indictments
                 came down this afternoon in the
                 23rd Precinct corruption scandal.
                 Though the names of six police
                 officers were read aloud, the
                 District Attorney stated that this
                 was merely the "tip of the iceberg"
                 and that unfortunately many other
                 arrests are likely to be coming as
                 the investigations proceed.



'2    BACK TO POLICE STATION                                      22
     As DETECTIVE JACK TOMLIN passes Mooney, he nods toward the TV.

                           DETECTIVE TOMLIN
                Sucks for the fellas at the Two-
                Three right now, huh?

                          MOONEY
                Dirty pricks deserve what they get.
                Public hates us enough without this
                shit.

                      DETECTIVE TOMLIN
                (leaving)
                There's good men over there.
     A FEMALE OFFICER passes Mooney and reaches for his box of
     pizza.

                          FEMALE OFFICER
               Mooney? What are you doing?      You can't
               be eating this crap.
     Mooney plants his own firm grip on the box.

                         MOONEY
               Keep walking, Shelly.   Nothing to
               see here.
     A friendly tug of war.

                          FEMALE OFFICER
               You sure you wanna do that?     What
               would your wife say?
     That's it. Mooney snatches his lunch back and turns to
     lecture this little girl.

                          MOONEY
               She'd say nothing, 'cause she's not
               gonna know about it! Christ, Shel,
               my old man had eleven heart
               attacks. Eleven! I have one
               little infarction and you guys
               start treating me like an invalid!
               I'm a grown man! Leave me alone,
               will you?!

                          FEMALE OFFICER
                    (abashed)
               I was merely referring to your
               cottage-cheese ass.
     Mooney sighs and lifts his pizza to his mouth when --
     WHAMM! The station doors burst open and two dozen GANG
     MEMBERS are bum-rushed into the room by a squad of COPS in
     riot gear. The screaming is deafening.



                                                               17.

                           MOONEY
                I hate this place.

                                               CUT TO:

23   EXT. 15TH PRECINCT - CONTINUOUS                                 23
     The Ford Bronco roars up; snags the handicapped spot. Ryan
     hops out and limps theatrically the first few steps until
     he's far enough away from the car to start running.

                          RYAN
                    (into phone)
               I'm here.

24   INT. 15TH PRECINCT - CONTINUOUS                                 24
     Cops try to wrangle the dozens of shouting GANG MEMBERS who
     cram the Station Desk, waiting to be booked.
     Ryan takes a deep breath and shoves his way through the
     mayhem to the extremely shorthanded Station Desk where:

     MOONEY
     is busy doing ten things at once. Signing release papers.
     Booking a DRUNK whose wife-beater Tee is drenched in blood,
     Etc.

                         RYAN
               Excuse me, officer --
     But Mooney ignores him in favor of the three cops that
     suddenly need arrest sheets signed.

                         RYAN (CONT'D)
               Hey, I've got an emergency here --
     Just then, CREWCUT OFFICER shoulders his way through with a
     cuffed CRACKHEAD TRANNIE in tow. The Trannie's wrists ache.

                          CRACKHEAD TRANNIE
               Loosen these, man, please?! Jus'
               gimme a chance--

                         CREWCUT OFFICER
               Hey, Moon! Where do you want me to
               put Whitney Houston?

                          MOONEY
               Christ, I've only got two hands here!
               Stick him in the can, will ya?
     Crewcut nods and moves off towards the bathroom.

                          RYAN
                    (shoving forward)
               Come on, man! I've got some lady
               on the phone here who says she's
               been kidnapped!



                                                                     18.

     Ryan holds up the phone.         Mooney looks around.

                           MOONEY
                Nice try, kid, but I got no time
                for pranks.

                           RYAN
                Seriously, a lady was murdered!

                          MOONEY
                Which is it, a kidnapping or a
                murder?

                           RYAN
                Take the phone and find out moron!
     A COP snickers somewhere.

     Jessica holds her breath. She stares apprehensively at the
     attic door, praying for Mooney to just take the damn phone.

                             JESSICA
               Please. . .

     Ryan looks sincere.     Mooney deliberates, then sighs.

                           MOONEY
               Okay.   Give it here.
     Ryan thrusts the phone at him, happy to get rid of it.

                          JESSICA (VO)
                    (barely audible whisper)
               Oh thank God! You've got to help
               me. My name's Jessica Martin and
               I've been kidnapped. This morning
               five men broke into my home in
               Brentwood and kidnapped--
     Mooney strains to hear.     His eyes go wide and he quickly jots
     notes on a pad.
     Mooney's eyes shift as three TWEAKERS, wide eyed and sweating
     profusely, are led inside by their ARRESTING OFFICERS.

                             MOONEY
               Ah shit.
     Mooney holds out the phone.

                          MOONEY (CONT'D)
               Hurry kid, take this upstairs to
               Robbery/Homicide and ask for
               Detective Tomlin.



                                                              19.

     Ryan reluctantly takes the phone back as more people converge
     on the Station Desk.

27   INT. KIDNAPPERS' ATTIC                                          27
     Jessica hears the phone being shuffled around.

                             RYAN (VO)
                Where?

                            JESSICA
                Hello?    Officer? Hello?!

28   BACK TO POLICE STATION                                          28
     Mooney, recognizing an emergency when he hears one, ignores
     the incoming CROWD him long enough to assist Ryan.

                          MOONEY
               Up the stairs, Tomlin!
     Ryan turns away, and as he returns the cellphone to his ear,
     he's startled to hear--

                     JESSICA (VO)
               (terrified)
               Oh my God...

               What? What is it?

     Jessica hears:

     SFX: FOOTSTEPS.     RIGHT OUTSIDE HER DOOR.

                          RYAN (VO)
               Lady, what's going on?!
     Jessica drops the phone. Has just enough time to shove it
     behind her before -- SLAM! -- the attic door swings open and
     two of the masked kidnappers stride in. When they reach her,
     they stand silently, trying to unnerve her.

                         LEAD KIDNAPPER
               Where's your husband?

                            JESSICA
               What?     I don't-
     The masked leader SLAPS HER SHARPLY across the face! Jessica
     wants to collapse to the ground, but remains sitting TO KEEP
     THE PHONE HIDDEN behind her.
     The Leader bends down and yells right in her face.



                                                                     20.

                           LEAD KIDNAPPER
                 Where is he!?

                              JESSICA
                 At work!     Why, what do you want--?
      SLAP!!!   This one's even nastier than the first.

                              LEAD KIDNAPPER

                 NEGATIVE!    WHERE WOULD HE RUN?!

      Phone to his ear. Wide-eyed. Hearing it all.         For the first
      time, starting to believe Jessica's story.

                              RYAN
                 Oh shit...
      Panicking, Ryan turns and walks, then jogs, then all-out runs
      for the station stairwell.

      The Lead Kidnapper stands ominously over the trembling
      Jessica -- Oh God! Does he see the phone cord?

                           JESSICA
                 Please, he should be at work!
                 That's all I know.
      The Leader nods, then turns away. Jessica exhales with
      relief that he didn't spot the phone. But her victory is
      short-lived as:

                              LEAD KIDNAPPER
                You have a little boy, right? Ricky?
                The Wyman School in Westwood?
      Jessica gasps like a sledgehammer just hit her in the chest.

                              JESSICA

                NO! NO--.'.' STAY AWAY FROM MY SON!

                LEAVE HIM ALONE!!
      But -- the men silently head out the door -- SLAM!       The door
      locks. Jessica scrambles back to the phone.

32    INTERCUT CALL - RYAN RUNNING UP STAIRWELL/JESSICA IN ATTIC           32



                            RYAN
                I know.    I'm trying to get help.



                                                               21.

                            JESSICA
                My son --
     Suddenly, as Ryan reaches the first landing -- STATIC starts
     breaking up the call.

                     JESSICA (CONT'D)
               (worried)
               Oh my God! What's happening?!

                         RYAN
               It's just static. I'm running
               upstairs to the detectives. Hold
               on, I might lose you for a sec--

                          JESSICA (VO)
                    (realizing)
               No, don't! Stop. You can't lose
               me--

                          RYAN
                    (still running)
               Wait, we're almost there.

                         JESSICA
                   (panics, losing her cool)
               Stop! Johnny, goddamn it, stop!

               STOP! IF YOU LOSE ME, I'M DEAD!!
     Hearing her fearful tone, Ryan stops reluctantly.

                         RYAN
               Well, what the hell am I supposed
               to do?!
     Ryan looks at himself, standing on the stairs like an idiot.

                           RYAN (CONT'D)
               Jesus!   I'm almost there!
     Ryan checks the SIGNAL STRENGTH INDICATOR on the phone.
     There's only one bar left. Defiantly, Ryan takes a step
     UP...and the bar DISAPPEARS. He quickly hops BACK DOWN.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)
               Crap!
                    (shouts up stairs)

               HELLO? DETECTIVE TOMLIN! WILL

               SOMEONE GET TOMLIN FOR ME, PLEASE?!
     There's no response.   Ryan can't believe this.

                         RYAN (CONT'D)
               You're shitting me.

                          JESSICA
               Johnny, what time is it?! Johnny!

               Who? Oh -- one-twenty.

     Jessica calms herself, resolving to save her child's life.

                          JESSICA
                Johnny, listen to me. My son's
                school lets out at 1:45.

                          RYAN
                Good, then if I get a cop--
     Ryan exits the stairwell to find Mooney -- but Mooney's not
     there anymore! There's some NEW GUY -- and he's SWAMPED!

                         JESSICA
                No. There's not enough time. You
                have to pick him up before they--

                          RYAN
               Pick him up? Hell no, lady!     I
               ain't goin' nowhere else--
     Ryan tries to get the NEW GUY's attention, in a dream.

                          JESSICA
               Please please stop standing there!
               He 's just a little boy!

                          RYAN
               But I'm in a police station!

                          JESSICA
               Go!
     Ryan grunts in frustration.

     The furniture in this abandoned house is all covered with

     FOLLOW the LEAD KIDNAPPER as he descends a nearby stairwell
     and pulls off his mask--

     REVEAL GREER
     Forties, salt and pepper hair.    He looks to his crew:

                                                                 23.

     They're all trim. Athletic. In good shape. They're
     UNMASKED, watching the TV with interest. The news on the
     corruption scandal.
     Greer snaps the TV off.     Checks his watch and nods grimly.

                          GREEK
               Go get the kid.
     Instantly, a hulk of a man (DEASON) and an arrogant, red-
     headed prick (ELLIS) stand and exit the house.
     As Greer stalks away( BOOM DOWN the bar to REVEAL a telephone
     sitting there, unnoticed by the men -- and on its face, the
     LINE-IN-USE INDICATOR LIGHT is lit.
     PUSH IN on the flashing orange light that threatens to give
     Ryan and Jessica's call away. Closer and closer, until we
     ENTER the phone and TRAVEL THROUGH THE WIRES to --

35   A MATCHING LIGHT ON RYAN'S CELLPHONE                              35
     As we PULL BACK we see that we're in the Ford Bronco, racing
     through:

     Ryan guns the engine as Jessica panics on the other end of
     the phone. We can hear her hyperventilating.

               Where the hell is a cop hiding in a
               speed trap when you need one?
     Ryan takes a hard right, tires squealing.    Pushing it against
     his better judgment.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)
               What do these guys want, anyway?

                          JESSICA
               I'm an obstetrician. They don't
               want anything from me.

     Ryan slaloms around other cars like a racecar driver.

                          RYAN
                So your husband's like, uber-rich?

                          JESSICA (VO)
                What--? No. He's an accountant.
                I make more money than he does.

                           RYAN
                Could they've mistaken you for
                someone else?

                           JESSICA
                No! I don't know.    None of this
                makes any sense.
     Jessica starts losing it completely, upsetting Ryan so much
     that he takes the next corner too fast and -- SKKRRASH! --

37   EXT. ROAD CONSTRUCTION - CONTINUOUS                                37
     The BRONCO EXPLODES through an orange-and-white "ROAD CLOSED"

     CONSTRUCTION BARRIER!
     And dead ahead is a CONSTRUCTION CREW resurfacing the road!

                          RYAN
               Oh...SHIT!!
     Ryan SLAMS on the brakes and SWERVES to avoid hitting a group
     of workers -- and OBLITERATES THE BRONCO'S PASSENGER SIDE
     MIRROR against another BARRIER --
     Ryan cringes with every muscle!
     And the mirror ricochets off the ground -- and smashes
     through the windshield of a recently waxed Acura Legend!

                     RYAN (CONT'D)
               (smirking)
               ...Ain't that a bitch.
     As the heavily-muscled workers start running to beat the shit
     out of him, Ryan floors the gas, sending a shower of wet
     asphalt all over the cursing workers as he peels away,
     CRASHING through a FINAL BARRIER.
     More cautiously, Ryan rounds the next corner and --

                         RYAN (CONT'D)
               There's the school.
     Ryan's right.   Just ahead, we see:

                                                 boys. Ryan
     pulls over and hops
     out,

                           RYAN
                Okay, I'm here.

                           JESSICA (VO)
                How much time do we have?
     Ryan checks his watch.     It reads:   "1:40 PM".   He enters.

                          RYAN
               Five minutes. What's your kid's name?

                            JESSICA (VO)
               Ricky.

                          RYAN
               Ricky what?

                            JESSICA
               Martin.

                          RYAN
               Ricky Martin? You named your kid
               Ricky Martin?! Why didn't you
               tattoo "kick me" on his ass while
               you were at it?

                         JESSICA
               He was named before the singer ever-

                            RYAN
               Forget it.     What does he look like?

                          JESSICA (VO)
               He's eight years old. Blonde hair.
               Green eyes. Small for his age.
               He's wearing a light blue shirt and
               dark blue pants--

                         RYAN
               They're all wearing blue shirts and
               pants!
     Ryan turns down a hallway and we see that he's right.      It's
     filled with IDENTICALLY-UNIFORMED LITTLE BOYS.
     As a TIMID BLONDE BOY passes in front of him, Ryan grabs him
     and wheels him around.

                         RYAN (CONT'D)
               Ricky Martin?
     The Boy's eyes get huge.     He tries to pull away.

                          TIMID BOY
               Don't touch me!

                          RYAN
               No, kid, it's okay!    I didn't mean
               to--



                                                                26.

38                                                                    38





                            TIMID BOY
                Help!   Don't touch me!   Don't touch!!
     Ryan quickly moves on... aware that other ADULTS are now
     beginning to take notice of him.

                          RYAN (INTO PHONE)
                Does he have anything else? A
                jacket? A backpack? What's his
                lunch box look like?

                           JESSICA (VO)
                I don't remember.

                           RYAN
                You don't remember your own kid's
                lunch box?!

                          JESSICA
               I don't pack it! Rosario, our
               housekeeper does! Sometimes Craig,
               but...
     Jessica begins to sob, which causes Ryan to panic further.

                          RYAN
               Ricky Martin, where are you!?
     None of the Stepford kids respond.

                     JESSICA (VO)
               (through tears)
               I wish I could give you more.
     Now Ryan's running.    He yells into a BATHROOM.

                         RYAN
               Ricky Martin?

                         MALE VOICE (OS)
               Can I help you, sir?
     Ryan turns to see a MUSCULAR GYM TEACHER looming there.
     Clearly, the guy thinks Ryan's peeping into the boys' room.

                          RYAN
               I'm looking for a little blond boy--
                    (off his shocked look)
               --No, no! Not like that!

                          GYM TEACHER
               Sir, come with me, please!
     Ryan isn't going anywhere. And that's when the BELL RINGS.
     Like a nightmare, HUNDREDS OF UNIFORMED LITTLE BOYS come
     racing out of their classes.

                            RYAN
               Oh shit...



                                                                27.

38                                                                    38


     As the boys stampede by, Ryan yanks the WHISTLE from around
     the Gym Teacher's thick neck and starts blowing it like
     crazy.

                           GYM TEACHER

               HEY--11

                           RYAN

               RICKY MARTIN! DOES ANYONE KNOW
               WHERE RICKY MARTIN IS?1 I can't
               believe I'm yelling this at an all-
               boys school.
     All hell is breaking loose. The kids ignore him. The huge
     Gym Teacher races after him. Jessica yells in his ear.

                          JESSICA (VO)
               Was that the bell? Was that the
               bell?!

                            RYAN
               Yes.    RICKY! RICKY MARTIN!!
     Ryan wades through the sea of uniforms.

                         JESSICA (VO)
               He'11 go to the parents' pick-up
               spot. Oh God, they're going to get
               him!

"\
     Ryan turns around and starts bulling through.    The Gym
     Teacher violently grabs his arm and yanks--

                          GYM TEACHER
               Where do you think you're going?
     --causing the phone to fly out of Ryan's hand and --crack!--
     hit the pavement.

                           RYAN
               No--!
     Ryan tugs his arm free and races to the phone.   The LCD
     display GLASS is cracked into a SPIDERWEB.

                     RYAN (CONT'D)
               (desperate into phone)
               Jessica? You still there?!

                           JESSICA (VO)
               Yes?
     Relieved, Ryan turns and races for the front of the school.

                          RYAN
               No one's gonna get your kid!    He's
               not slow, is he?

                           JESSICA (VO)
               What--?   No!



                                                                28.

38                                                                    38





                          RYAN
               Then he won't go anywhere with
               strangers.

                          JESSICA (VO)
               Unless they have our Escalade. Ricky'11
               think it's Rosario and hop right in!
     She's got a point. Ryan picks up the pace and arrives at the
     pick-up spot. Scans the lot.

                         RYAN
               What color?

                          JESSICA
               Black!

                     RYAN
               (looks)
               Of course it is.
     PAN AROUND to see what Ryan sees -- three black Cadillac
     Escalades.

                         RYAN (CONT'D)
               There's three of them.    What's your
               plate?

                          JESSICA (VO)
               4..7..wait, no...3 -- Oh my God, I
               don't remember!

                         RYAN
               Like you don't remember the lunch
               box? Or anything else about your
               kid--
                    (stops, realizing)
               Oh, man. This is a prank, isn't
               it?

                         JESSICA (VO)
               No!

                         RYAN
               Bullshit! Oh, you're good lady.
               Your friends too. Getting me to
               scream out 'Ricky Martin' at a boys
               school. Damn, you really nailed
               me.

                         JESSICA (VO)
               No--


               This is great, the police think I'm
               a whack job. The school thinks I'm
               some kind of perv child molester.
               I'll probably get the Herpes from
               the gym teacher's whistle --



                                                              29.

38                                                                   38





                            JESSICA (VO)
                No, Johnny, you have to listen to
                me-- /.'
     But Ryan's had enough.     He turns to leave --

                          RYAN
               I'm done being your entertainment for
               the day. I'm going back to the pier
               while I still have a chance --
     -- and passes right by a blonde-haired, green-eyed, EIGHT-
     YEAR-OLD BOY carrying a Lord of the Rings lunchbox. Ryan
     hesitates and is about to stop the kid...but then decides
     "screw it", and keeps on hoofing.
     Ryan rounds a corner to leave -- and is confronted by the Gym
     Teacher and a RENT-A-COP SECURITY GUARD.

                          GYM TEACHER
               Here he is! He's the one that's
               been stalking the students.

                            RYAN
               Stalking?!     No, I can explain--
     The Rent-a-Cop mumbles into his walkie.

                          RENT-A-COP #1
               Okay, we got him. We're at the
               front of the school.
                    (then, to Ryan)
               Sir, come with us.

                         RYAN
                   (as they grab him)
               Hey, HEY RENT-A-DUDE--!!    Hang on a
               sec! This is a huuuge
               misunderstanding--
     A little RENT-A-COP CAR (think geeky, wanna-be cop car) pulls
     up in the driveway below. The Security Guard starts forcibly
     leading Ryan toward it, but as he gets close--

                          JESSICA (VO)
                    (interrupting)
               Lord of the Rings! I forgot his
               father bought him a Lord of the
               Rings lunchbox last week!
     Ryan's heart stops in his chest. He turns to see the Boy
     with the Lord or the Rings lunchbox racing down the school
     steps and up to one of the waiting Escalades.

                         RYAN
                   (struggling)

               RICKY MARTIN!!
     The Boy opens the car door...but turns as he hears his name
     called. For the briefest moment, Ricky and Ryan lock eyes--





                                                        [CONTINUED)



                                                                    30.

    38                                                                    38


         --and that's when a HAND reaches out, snags his backpack and
         YANKS Ricky into the dark of the car! Instantly, the door
         slams shut and the Escalade begins to take off.
         WHIP PAN to Ryan's shocked reaction. He's the only one who's
         seen it. He tries to struggle free of the Guard.

                                 RYAN (CONT'D)
                    Oh shit!    You just see that?!
         Losing control of Ryan, the Rent-a-Cop calls to his partner
         in the car.

                               RENT-A-COP #1
                    Roy, some help over here!
         Below, the Escalade is leaving the driveway.

                              RYAN
                        (struggling harder)
                   Goddamn it, that little kid was
                   just kidnapped!! Do something!!

                                RENT-A-COP #1
                   Roy--! !
         The second Rent-a-Cop, hops out of his car and runs over, but
         as he gets near -- Ryan breaks free!

^

                                RENT-A-COPS

                   HEY--! !
         They chase after him, but Ryan hops over the hood of the
         idling RENT-A-COP CAR and throws himself into its driver's
         seat.
         Rent-a-Cop #1 reaches through the open window and grabs
         Ryan's collar -- and is dragged twenty feet as Ryan throws
         the little car in gear and burns away.

39       INT. RENT-A-COP CAR - RACING DOWN A RESIDENTIAL STREET           39
         Trying to catch the Escalade, a quarter-mile ahead. Ryan
         feels completely conspicuous in the security car as he
         slaloms through the streets of East Hollywood.

                              JESSICA (VO)
                   What's happening, Ryan?!

                              RYAN
                   Don't worry, I can fix this.

                                JESSICA (VO)
                   Oh my God.
         There are three cars between Ryan and the Escalade.

                             RYAN
                   It's okay, I can see them ahead.



                                                                    31.

                             JESSICA (VO)
                  Don't lose them! If you follow them
                  back here, you can tell the police
                  where they're holding us!

                              RYAN
                  Okay.

                                                    CUT TO:

40    INT. THE KIDNAPPERS' ESCALADE                                       40
     The mountainous Deason drives as Ellis sits shotgun. In the
     back sits Jessica's son, RICKY; who eyes the two men
     suspiciously. CCR plays on the RADIO.
      Ellis, turns down the radio.       Faking sincerity, he turns to
      face Ricky.

                             ELLIS
                       (gesturing to the radio)
                  Do you want me to change the
                  station to something else?
     Ricky refuses to answer.        Ellis turns around, his fake smile
     quickly vanishing.

                              ELLIS (CONT'D)
                  Yeah.   I like Creedence too.
     He's about to turn the radio volume up when --

                             RICKY
                  Where's Rosario?

                             ELLIS
                  I told you, kid, she had a doctor's
                  appointment, so your mother asked
                  us to pick you up. Don't worry,
                  you'll see your mommy in a few
                  minutes.
     Ricky nods... but we can tell by the look on his face that
     he's not buying their story one bit.

                                                    CUT BACK TO:

41   EXT. RENT-A-COP CAR                                                  41
     Cautiously, so as not to give himself away, Ryan PASSES one
     commuter car. Then the next. Narrowing the gap between the
     rent-a-cop car and the Escalade to one last auto.
     It takes Ryan literally standing on the gas pedal to get up
     enough speed to get around the final car. Now the Escalade
     is dead ahead. Ryan begins gently closing the distance
     between them, and is just starting to relax, when--

     A CITY BUS
     merges into traffic from a Bus Stop right ahead of him!



                                                                  32.

                              RYAN

                 SHIT!
       Ryan SLAMS on his breaks and is forced to crawl along at a
 ainful 25 m.p.h.. Worse, he has his view of the Escalade
glocked by the bus' titanic silver ass.

                              JESSICA (VO)
                Johnny!

                             RYAN
                Damn!     There's this stupid bus--
      Ryan jags left and right, catching glimpses around the bus of
      the Escalade still ahead.

                      RYAN (CONT'D)
                (taps his horn)
                Come on!
      But the bus doesn't pull over. Ryan tries flashing the
      security car's CLEAR BUBBLE LIGHTS on the roof, but who the
      hell would pull over for that? The bus sure doesn't.

                             RYAN (CONT'D)
                Jesus.'

                           JESSICA (VO)
                Can't you go around it?
      There's an ungodly amount of opposing traffic--
      But suddenly there's    a break in the  flow! Seizing the
      moment, Ryan SLAM-SH   IFTS the rent-a -cop car's uni-cylinder
      engine into gear and    starts to tear  around the bus -- but has
      to SWERVE BACK as a    SPEEDING TRASH  TRUCK rounds a bend and
      almost creams him!

                           RYAN
                Goddamn it!

                             JESSICA (VO)
                What?!    Did you lose him? !

                           RYAN
                No, I just almost got killed, is
                all.

                           JESSICA
                Oh thank God!

                           RYAN
                Thank God?
                     (irritated)
                That's nice.
     Just then, the bus signals that it's pulling over.

                           RYAN (CONT'D)
                Hey, here we go!



                                                                 33.

     As the bus pulls aside, Ryan floors the wanna-be cop car
     around it...but directly in front of him is a HOMELESS MAN,
     dressed like a sheik, dragging his caravan of TWO COVERED

     SHOPPING CARTS.

                             RYAN (CONT'D)

                SON- OF- A-- II
     Ryan SLAMS on    the brakes, SWERVES HARD to avoid a collision --
     and loses cont   rol of the car! The rent-a-cop car goes POWER
     SLIDING across    oncoming traffic, HORNS BLARING AT HIM and
     heads straight    for a the FLOOR TO CEILING WINDOW of a CAR

     DEALERSHIP.

42   INT. CAR DEALERSHIP                                               42
     SMASH!!! The car goes through the window and RACES down the
     center aisle. CAR SALESMEN and PATRONS are forced to dive
     out of the way as the rent-a-cop car MOWS DOWN DISPLAYS and
     everything else in its path.

                                                 CUT TO:

     Jessica's son, RICKY, who eyes the two men suspiciously.
     CREEDENCE CLEARWATER REVIVAL plays on the RADIO.

               Anyone following us?
     Deason checks:

     We see the bus about five car lengths behind, but the rent-a-

     Deason flashes an evil grin.

     The rent-a-cop car exits the dealership, SMASHING through
     another GLASS WINDOW!
     Ryan quickly regains control of the car and steers it back on
     the street. Only to find that the Escalade has disappeared!

                          JESSICA (VO)
               What's happening?! Are you okay?!

                No, No!    just give me a second--
     As Jessica goes off, Ryan tosses the phone down and focuses
     on finding the Escalade. He floors the rent-a-cop car, engine
     CLATTERING, to the intersection.
     Ryan franticly searches in every direction, but the Escalade
     is nowhere to be seen. He floors it.

                            RYAN (CONT'D)
                Jesus!    Where the hell did they go?
     Dreading talking to Jessica, Ryan slowly picks up the
     receiver.

                         RYAN (CONT'D)
               Jessica, I--

                          JESSICA (VO)
               You let them get away.
     Ryan wants to snap at her, but guilt crushes it right out of
     him. He knows she's right.

     Mooney changes out of his blues, his ears glued to THREE COPS
     in the corner, boasting about an arrest.

                         COP ONE
               -- so of course everyone's playing
               dumb to what kind of drugs he's on.
     The cops start to snicker; they've all heard that one before.

                          COP ONE (CONT'D)
               So I start searching the place.
               I'm about to open a closet door
               when a kid with a Mac 10 jumps out
               of the bathroom. He shoots.
               Misses me and hits one of the
               E.M.T's. Fires again, but the gun
               jams and BAM! Blows half his face
               off. Had enough black tar heroin
               in the closet to resurface the 405.
     Mooney tries to join in on the conversation.

                         MOONEY
               It must've been around '84, when...
     The Cops turn around, while grabbing their stuff.

     Mooney waves them on, but looks disappointed for not being
     able to join in.

               I'll bet in your day you had some

     Mooney whips his head around to see DETECTIVE JACK TOMLIN.

                          MOONEY
               Hey Tomlin.

                         DETECTIVE TOMLIN
               Taking off?

               My anniversary. You know, duty

               crap-ass play.
                    (beat)
               Hey, I sent some college kid down
               to see you this morning. Had some
               rap about a kidnapping --

                         DETECTIVE TOMLIN
               I haven't seen anyone, but I'll ask
               around. Kidnapping, huh?

                          MOONEY
               I thought it was a prank at first,
               but the kid was so worked up--

                          DETECTIVE TOMLIN
               Well, don't you get worked up.
                    (slaps Mooney's chest)
               If the kid comes back, page me, and
               I'll be sure to see him.

                          MOONEY
                    (swallowing his pride)
               Yeah. Okay, Jack. Thanks.

                              RYAN
                 What now?
     Ryan pulls the phone away from his ear and checks it out.

     INSERT SHOT - CELLPHONE FACE PLATE
     The BATTERY INDICATOR is flashing:         LOW BATT.   LOW BATT.

     SFX:   BEEP-BEEP!    The battery indicator has lost another bar.
     Ryan fumbles around in the armrest. Finds nothing. Opens

     Just then, Ryan rounds a corner -- and sees traffic GRIDLOCKED
     to a halt ahead. He tries to maneuver around it, but is

     The phone starts a STEADY BEEPING now, dying imminent. And
     traffic isn't going anywhere. Ryan looks around desperately.
     Nothing. No emergency lane. No shoulder. Just a long drop
     down a HILL to a strip mall below--
     STRIP MALL?! Ryan scans it and does a double-take on one of
     the store's signs: "VERIZON WIRELESS".
     Traffic inches forward. Now he sees an OFF-RAMP a quarter-
     mile ahead -- but at this rate, it'll take forever to make it

     And with that, Ryan CRANKS the steering wheel hard right and
     HITS THE GAS!   Despite other drivers' protests, the little
     Rent-a-Cop vehicle blasts across the gridlock, TEARS through
     the rusty GUARD RAIL and -- VROOOOM! -- flies off the side of

     Ryan lets out a frightened yell as he SAILS through the clear

                HOOOOLLYYY SHIIII--
     THUMP! The Rent-a-Cop car touches down on a steep downslope.
     Ryan struggles to control the bucking automobile,
     miraculously avoiding the minefield of ROCKS and TREE STUMPS.
     He needs both hands for the job and holds the phone by its
     antenna in his teeth.
     There's so much noise, the only thing Jessica could possibly
     hear is a CACOPHONY OF NOISE and Ryan HYPERVENTILATING.

     Ryan is bounced around like a corn kernel in a popper until
     the car hits a jutting rock and -- WHOOOOM! -- goes up on two
     wheels. It looks like it's going to roll but gravity brings

                Shit!
     Ryan scrabbles for the phone -- but gives it up when he
     bounces over a rise and sees A BILLBOARD DEAD AHEAD!

                             RYAN (CONT'D)

                WHOAAAAAA!
     Ryan whips the wheel and navigates the little car between the
     billboard's concrete posts, but -- WHAM! -- obliterates the
     rent-a-cop's BUBBLE LIGHTS on the billboard's lower edge.
     Somehow, Ryan muscles the bucking econocar safely down the
     rest of the hill and into the strip mall parking lot, where
     it SKIDS OUT.

                      RYAN (CONT'D)

     And of course, they're having a sale and the place is packed.
     Every SALESPERSON is beyond busy in the feeding frenzy.

     Panicking, Ryan pushes his way to the front of the counter --

                           IRATE CUSTOMERS
                Hey, what do you think you're
                doing? There's a line!
     -- to the OVERLY-PERKY SALESMAN helping someone else.

     The salesman makes a playful paw swipe with his hand.

                           EASILY-EXCITABLE CUSTOMER
                Oh, how fun!

                         RYAN

                  will be with you shortly.
       Ryan glances at the dispenser. A BIG YELLOW SMILEY FACE with
       tickets ejected from the mouth. The next ticket it offers is
       "#97"...and the Now-Serving Display on the wall reads "#71".

       Just then, a BUSY SALESWOMAN walks by.     Ryan grabs her.

                               RYAN
                  Hey! Hey!      I've got an emergency

                  Take a number and one of the sales

       Ryan breaks out in a cold sweat. Can't catch his breath. As
       a SALESWOMAN rushes by, Ryan reaches for her.

       The room starts spinning around him. It's clear no one's
       going to help him. Like the clap of doom, the NOW-SERVING
       DISPLAY on the wall flips happily to "#72"

       SFX:   BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP!!!


       Frantic, Ryan glances at the phone. And just as the last
       BATTERY BAR on the power indicator FLICKERS and DISAPPEARS --

     Mooney exits the mayhem of the s   tation and walks to a SQUAD
     CAR. Gets in. As he pulls his      seatbelt on, something
     CRINKLES in his breast pocket.     He pulls it out -- the SCRAP
     OF PAPER where the scribbled the    words "JESSICA MARTIN" and
     "BRENTWOOD" when Ryan handed him    the phone.
     Mooney crumples the paper and is about to throw it away...but
     stops himself. He stares at the words, then unable to let it
     go, punches keys on the MOBILE DATA TERMINAL. A name and
     address appear on the screen:

     JESSICA KATE MARTIN.   327 ELMWOOD ESTATES, BRENTWOOD.


     Mooney stares at the name. Then, after a moment, he sighs
     and pulls a LA LAKERS cellphone from his coat. Dials.

                         MOONEY
               Hi, honey. Yeah, I'm gonna be a

     Just as the phone literally dies -- Ryan rips a new CHARGER
     from its packaging, slaps it into the phone and voila, it
     begins CHARGING.

               Thank you for doing all this,

               Good, it sounded like a porn star
               name.
                    (then softly)
               It's okay. I know. You don't have

     Jessica is moved with emotion by his honesty.

     Jessica JUMPS with a start. Tries to push the PHONE GUTS
     behind a beam with her foot as Greer enters -- but fails.
     The receiver sits in front of the beam, EXPOSED!
     Greer crosses the room and sits on a box next to Jessica.    He
     stares at her for long, uncomfortable moments. Then:



                                                                     42.

     Greer's question still hangs in the air.

                           JESSICA
               N-no...
     Jessica scoots away, trying to draw Greer's eyes in another
     direction from the phone that lies OUT IN THE OPEN.

                          JESSICA (CONT'D)
                ...but I am going to, aren't I?

     Greer winds up and BAM! Hits Jessica in the stomach, knocking
     the wind out of her and causing her to fall to the ground.

               Shut up!!! Which field?! He
               wouldn't leave a message that
               didn't make sense to you!
     Greer tightens his fist and is about to hit Jessica again--

                          JESSICA
               Wait! The bleachers behind left
               field at Dodger Stadium! That's
               where we first met.

      Greer stares at Jessica for a long uncomfortable moment,
      searching her soul. She's lying.

                             JESSICA (CONT'D)
                  Please! Believe me. That has to
                  be where he means. I swear to God.
     Then he stands, looking away for just a moment -- but long
     enough for Jessica to NUDGE the phone back behind the beam!

     Jessica, trembling, hangs on Greer's every word.

                      (turning back)
                  Go to the window, Jessica. There's
                  something I want you to see.
     Relieved at hiding the phone, Jessica gets up and moves to
     the attic window -- and GASPS.

55   JESSICA'S POV - THE YARD BELOW                                    55
     Down in the yard below, Jessica's eleven-year-old son Ricky
     stands uncomfortably in the middle of a basketball half-court
     as one of the kidnappers (a severe-looking ex-con named
     HODGES) stands nearby, watching.

     Hodges looks up and sees Jessica's face in the window.   Then
     turns and tosses a basketball to Ricky.

                             HODGES
                  Shoot hoops.

                       (threatening)
                  Shoot.
     Nervously, Ricky begins to bounce the ball.

     Jessica sees her son start shooting the ball -- completely
     oblivious to Hodges, who flicks open his coat, revealing
     SILENCED PISTOL tucked into his waistband.

     Frantic, Jessica locks eyes with Hodges, silently pleading

       across the yard. Once he's inside and out of view, Jessica
       collapses in a heap on the floor.
       Greer is about to exit the attic -- when Jessica speaks.

      Jessica hears it first. The pumping cacophony coming from
      the phone behind the beam. It's subtle at first, but grows
      increasingly louder. She closes her eyes, praying Greer
      won't hear it--
      But Greer does hear it. On the verge of leaving the room,
      Greer stops. Cocks an ear. Instantly, Jessica tries to

               someone was pulling a prank on him.

               Mooney doing an investigation?
               What's are you really up to?
     The man swivels around in his chair and we see clearly it's--

                          DETECTIVE TOMLIN
               And no bullshit. Right now you're
               entire department's hot, so if I'm
               gonna get in the tub, I've got to
               know how deep it is.

               Jessica, this car has a sewing

SI   INTERCUT PHONE CALL - RYAN IN RENT-A-COP CAR/JESSICA IN ATTICS 1
     Jessica's voice trails off as she catches a glimp se of
     herself in an OLD MIRROR standing in the corner.  Bruised.
     Clothes torn. Staring at her own cracked reflect  ion, she
     breaks down, but silently this time, locked in he r own
     personal hell.
     For Ryan, the silence is deafening. Despite his frantic
     driving, he feels her pain. And hates being unable to help.

                          RYAN
               Jessica... ?
     There's an emotional beat, then--

                          JESSICA
               Do you think God will forgive me?

                          RYAN
               What do you mean--?

                          JESSICA
               For what I've done...   For giving
               up Craig...
     Ryan is moved by the emotion in her voice.

                          RYAN
               Jessica, they have your kid. You
               had no choice.

                          JESSICA
               I don't know. I don't know...

                         RYAN
               1 know. I heard what they were
               doing to you over there. You held
               out for as long as you could.

                          JESSICA
                    (grim beat)
               My son and I are going to die here,
               Ryan. They already have us. But
               maybe I could've saved Craig...
     The truth of this has a profound effect on Ryan. And just
     when Jessica is about to lose herself to despair --
     Ryan finds a resolve within himself even he didn't know he
     had.

                          RYAN
               Jessica, listen to me. I promise
               you, I'm not going to let that
               happen. I could care less about
               your money. I'm risking my life
               cause I know I'm gonna get you and
               your family out of this. You hear
               what I'm sayin'?

     There is a moment between them, two people connecting on a
     human level...
     But the moment is suddenly cut short as a STATICKY VOICE
     start bleeding into their phone call -- some BRITISH ASSHOLE
     having his own phone call.

                           BRITISH ASSHOLE (VO)
                -- Yeah, the show just bought me a
                Cadillac XLR convertible. No, you
                can't ride in it. Not until you do
                something with that road kill you
                call hair. And what's with your

                     (interrupting)
                Jessica? Are you still there?

                             BRITISH ASSHOLE (VO)
                Hey, hey?!    This is a private call!
     Jessica's voice starts fading as the CROSSTALK gets worse.

                     JESSICA (VO)
               (washed in static)
               I'm..ere, but y...reaking up!

               --That's not my problem, lady.
     Lady?! Suddenly, STATIC starts drowning out Ryan's side of
     the call.

                          RYAN
                    (yelling over the static)
               Jessica, don't hang up! You hear
               me?! Whatever happens --

                          BRITISH ASSHOLE (VO)
               Look woman, tell your kidnapping
               story to someone who gives a shit.
     Ryan can't hear Jessica's side of the conversation; only the
     British Asshole's, which comes in loud and clear.

                             RYAN
               Jessica?!     Jessica?!
     As Ryan goes mental, a CAR PASSES HIM on the opp9site side of
     the road -- a new Cadillac XLR convertible! Inside is an
     appropriately asshole-ish looking guy. He could only be the
     British Asshole.

                 Gotcha.
     Ryan pulls a HARROWING 180 DEGREE TURN, barely missing an
     oncoming car by inches.
     He RACES up to the Cadillac, which has a VANITY PLATE that
     reads, "IDOL MKR." Ryan looks through the window at --

     The driver, who in a typical LA celebrity sighting, turns out
     to be none other than SIMON COWELL, host of American Idol.
     Simon continues his spittle-spraying rant -- at no one.      It
     appears he's using the car's SPEAKERPHONE.

                that invented it you stupid COW!
     Ryan sees Simon Cowell MOUTH THE WORDS "STUPID COW" in synch
     with the conversation. BINGO!
     Ryan floors the Rent-a-cop car ahead of the Cadillac and
     PULLS A 90 DEGREE turn at an intersection; cutting Cowell
     off!
     SCREEEECH! Cowell, trying to avoid a collision, SLAMS on the
     brakes, causing the Cadillac to SKID twenty feet.
     Ryan jumps out of the rent-a-cop car he's left in the middle
     or the intersection and runs over to the Cadillac, banging on
     the window with the .38 Special.
     Cowell practically jumps out of his skin at the sight of the
     gun and the kid with the crazy look in his eyes.

     EXPLODES into tiny pieces of junk as the semi PLOUGHS THROUGH
     IT! Flaming debris rains down around Ryan, and he covers his
     mouth, unable to believe his shitty luck.

                           RYAN
                Ain't that a bitch!
     Ryan turns back to Simon Cowell.

                Out of the car! Now!
     Cowell all but dives out.

               Where's your phone?!

                           SIMON COWELL
                It's on speaker!
     Ryan turns to the car.    Calls out.

               Jessica?

                            JESSICA (VO)
               Ryan?!    I'm here!
     Her voice says she can't believe her ears.
     Relieved, Ryan jumps in the Cadillac XLR and tosses his phone
     on the passenger seat, next to a LAPTOP computer. Guns the
     engine and STOMPS the gas.
     As he passes the ruins of his rent-a-cop car, he slows just
     enough to open the Cadillac's door and snatch up his bag of
     Verizon goodies laying on the pavement -- then peels away.
     Practically frothing at the mouth, Simon Cowell chases after
     on foot, cursing as his beautiful new Cadillac disappears in
     the distance --

     phone's controlled through the radio. He turns it up.

                    I'm here... Oh shit!
         SCREEEECH! Ryan steps on the brakes, seeing something ahead.
         WHIP PAN AROUND to see what Ryan's staring at. Just ahead,
         JESSICA'S ESCALADE is pulling up to the curb.

         Ryan pulls along side the red curb and watches as four tough-
         looking men exit the vehicle. We recognize them as Greer,
         Deason, Ellis and Hodges.

                   Wait, Ryan! What about me--?!
         Ryan searches the car and finds the HANDSET in the armrest.
         As he grabs it and races after Greer into the airport, a
         Traffic Cop comes up to the car.

                              TRAFFIC COP

                   HEY, YOU CAN'T PARK HERE!!

         Greer and his men stride through the airport like sharks
         honing in on bleeding prey.
         Soon, the Kidnappers break up into two groups: Greer and
         Ellis heading for the DEPARTURE GATES; Deason and Hodges go

         Ryan heads toward the --

R9   INT. SECURITY CHECKPOINT - LAX                                  89
     Greer, who waits in the LINE OF PASSENGERS waiting to pass
     through airport's METAL DETECTORS. This is Ryan's chance.
     He cuts through the line.

                         RYAN
               Oops. Excuse me. Pardon me. My
               grandmother needs her walker...
     Soon, he makes his way to the front, right behind Greer and
     BUMPS into him. As he does, NOTICE --
     ECU of Ryan slyly slipping the rent-a-cop's tiny .38 Special
     into Greer's heavy motorcycle jacket.
     Greer turns, glaring -- But no one's there.
     Greer looks around, and there's a heart-stopping moment that
     we're afraid he's going to notice Ryan, who now stands
     innocently the next line over--
     --but Greer's eyes pass right over him as he scans the crowd.
     Ryan breathes a sigh of relief as Greer finally turns away to
     walk through the metal detector and...

     SFX:   BZZZZZZZTTH
     ...sets off the alarm.

                          DETECTOR OPERATOR
               Excuse me, sir. Would you mind
               emptying your pockets over here?
     Confused, Greer does. He lays his wallet on the table, then
     his keys... Then looks baffled as he pulls out -- the GUN 1

                            DETECTOR OPERATOR (CONT'D)
               Code red!     Code red!
     The response she gets is stunning. SECURITY GUARDS jump out
     of the woodwork with guns drawn. ALARMS go off. SECURITY
     GATES start coming down. Travelers start SCREAMING and

     PANICKING!

                            SECURITY GUARDS

               GET DOWN!    GET ON THE GROUND!!

               Wait, this is a mistake--

               HANDS/     HANDS!!
     As one, the entire security force POUNCES on Greer and Ellis,
     TACKLING them to the ground and IMMOBILIZING their limbs.



                                                                58.

     And while that chaos is going on, Ryan slowly backs through
     to the metal detector...and starts running for Left Field.

               security problem, all persons are
               required to clear the terminal and
               return immediately to the security
               checkpoint at the entrance to
               Concourse B...
     At once, everyone begins filing out of the terminal. Ryan
     looks like a salmon swimming upstream, the only figure moving
     against the tide of people rushing to get out.

                          JESSICA (VO)
               "Left Field" is in Terminal C.

                         RYAN
               Listen to me! They're clearing the
               terminal. Before your husband passes
               me, what does he look like?

                         JESSICA (VO)
               He's thirty-eight. Six feet.     Trim
               build. Thinning hair...

                          RYAN
                    (scanning the passengers)
               That's not enough! What's he
               wearing?

                          JESSICA (VO)
               I don't know! We have completely
               different schedules. I was fast

               -- A suit... He wears glasses,
               thick rims, like Buddy Holly or--
     Bingo! The Buddy Holly glasses is what did it. Ryan sees a
     man in the distance hurrying in his direction -- CRAIG.

                            RYAN
               Found him!



                                                                      59.

        And just as Ryan bee-lines it towards Craig--

                  VOICE (OS)
        Excuse me, sir--
        Ryan turns and finds a NATIONAL GUARDSMAN right behind him.

                              NATIONAL GUARDSMAN
                   You can't be here now. You have to
                   leave the area.

         WITHDRAWS A BADGE. A Los Angeles policeman's badge...
       Ryan's jaw drops.      He can't believe it -- they're cops?!

                He's clean. Badge matches his I.D.

     Ryan looks relieved when the airport's alarms SHUT OFF._ The
     P.A. system cheerily thanks everyone for their cooperation
     and, all around, security gates begin to rise.

                          RYAN

               Hey, can I go now? Can I go?!
     The Guard nods, and Ryan takes off like a shot, racing back
     towards the bar.
     Ryan spots Craig Martin outside the Left Field sports bar.
     Ryan grabs him by the elbow and starts hustling him through
     the concourse.

                         CRAIG

                          CRAIG
               What--?

                          RYAN
               Your wife sent me.

                          CRAIG
               She did?   But how--?

               need to hide. They're here, and
               they're looking for you. They
               already have your family.
     Craig looks at him, growing terrified.

                            CRAIG
                 Goddamn it, what the hell are you
                 people going to--

                               JESSICA (OS)
                 Craig?
      Craig stops dead, hearing the voice. Scans the cobweb-filled
      room, seeing nothing -- then from the depths of the shadows,
      Jessica materializes looking haunted and lifeless as a ghost.

                               CRAIG
                Jessica?
      Jessica races for the safety of Craig's arms, but just as
      she's about to be embraced, Greer steps forward and YANKS
      Jessica back by her hair. She squeals in pain.

                              CRAIG (CONT'D)

                HEY --/ /
      Craig moves to object, but -- OOF! -- Deason sends him
      gasping to the floor with a sledgehammer fist to the gut.

                           JESSICA
                No, don't hurt him!
      Jessica struggles and, with an annoyed shove, Greer sends her
      spilling into Craig. She hugs tightly against him.
      When Craig gets his wind back, he comes to his knees and
      manages to croak out--

                              CRAIG
                Ricky...?
      Jessica nods gravely. He's here, too. Craig looks at his
      wife's face, bruised and hurt, and tears rise in his eyes.

                           CRAIG (CONT'D)
                Oh, God, Jess... What have they
                done to you?
      But Jessica won't let this moment be about pity.

                           JESSICA
                Who are they, Craig?
      Craig doesn't know what to say.

                          JESSICA (CONT'D)
                Tell them, Craig. Tell them they
                have the wrong family. Tell them
                they've made a mistake--
      But something in his eyes disagrees.

                              JESSICA (CONT'D)
                What?!      What is it?

                 This isn't a mistake, Jess.
      And that's all it takes for Jessica's world to shatter.
      GREEK emerges from the shadows, startling them, and backhands
      Craig's jaw with the butt of his gun.

                 Where is the disc now?
      Blood trickles from the corner of Craig's mouth.

                           CRAIG
                 You have to promise. If I give it
                 to you... you'll let my family go.

                            GREER

                 --and I won't blow her brains all
                 over you right now.
      Greer traces the barrel of the gun down Jessica's cheek.
      Craig looks utterly helpless.

      Greer lowers the gun to her neckline( pulls her shirt

      finally breaks.

      knows this is going to be their last time together.

                              CRAIG
                   I love you.
      Craig squeezes the good years of their marriage into a
      strong, loving embrace. Jessica hugs him closer. Leans into
      his ear to seemingly whisper her love in return -- but what
      she actually whispers takes Craig by surprise.

                   what they want, we're dead.
      Jessica kisses her husband on the lips and withdraws, leaving
      Craig with an utterly confused expression on his face. But
      before his look can betray him--

      The cabbie tries, but is hopelessly locked in by cars pulling
      up behind him. Shrugs.
      About a hundred yards up the road, Ryan sees the 4th
      Street/Figuroa Exit. He's so close...

      office building in the distance --

109   EXT. FEGAN SECURITIES, INC. BUILDING - ESTABLISHING           109

      As Ryan huffs and puffs toward the building, he sees a BIKE
      MESSENGER bullshitting with a HOT DOG VENDOR. Ryan stops and
      stares at the PACKAGE POUCH on the seat and a flashy red BIKE
      HELMET hanging on the handlebars.
      The helmet is futuristic, like something The Flash might
      wear. Ryan eyes the Messenger, grabs the bike, hops on and
      peddles for dear life toward Craig's building with the
      Messenger hot on his heels.

111   EXT. FEGAN SECURITIES, INC. BUILDING                              111
      As Ryan arrives at the building, the Escalade pulls up in
      front of him and Greer, Hodges and Ellis file into the
      building.

      N9W inside, STATIC starts playing hell with their connection.

      Ryan fights his way through the tourists to the elevator bay.
      Quickly scans the DIRECTORY. Among the long list of CPAs,
      there's a MAILROOM on the 3rd floor.

      Ryan tried to tell him about this morning.

      Marilyn smiles, realizing he's really talking to himself.
      Mooney hangs up, thoughts racing. He reaches behind him, and
      without looking he grabs his wallet and keys.
      He then walks over to Marilyn and kisses the top of her head.
      She knows him, and knows something's up.

      A wide COUNTER separates Ryan and a few BUSINESS MEN and
      WOMEN from the MAIL CLERKS that busily work the other side.
      Ryan leans against the wall, pretending to be an ordinary
      bike messenger waiting for a package as Craig and the dirty
      cops enter, brushing right past him.
      Craig scans the faces of the other patrons as they enter,
      desperately trying to figure out who is his secret ally. He
      ignores Ryan completely, whose face is mostly hidden by the
      tinted plastic VISOR attached to the helmet.
      Craig notices an AGING SECURITY GUARD stationed in the area,

                           CRAIG
                Hey, Benny. This might sound
                ridiculous, but I dropped a DVD
                mailer into the chute this morning
                and I forgot to put down an
                address.

                           MAILROOM SUPERVISOR
                Happens all the time. Let me see
                what's back there. Gimme a sec'.
      The Supervisor disappears into the back room.
      Greer and Hodges take a seat only a few feet away from Ryan.
      The moment is uncomfortable...and gets infinitely worse as--



                                                               73.

116                                                                  116



                          MAIL CLERK ,
                Excuse me, sir? Sir? Sir?
      Ryan turns, realizing with horror that another MAIL CLERK is
      speaking to him.

                           RYAN
                Me?

                          MAIL CLERK
                You waiting for a package?
      Now everyone's looking at Ryan.     Including Greer.

                           RYAN
                     (facing away)
                Sure, uh... I'm supposed to pick
                something up for Mr. Fountain over
                at the Bonaventure.

                           MAIL CLERK
                From what department?

                           RYAN
                I'm not sure... They said it was a
                contract, though, I know that, so
                what would that be, Legal?

                          MAIL CLERK
                What's the tracking number?

                           RYAN
                     (patting himself down)
                Uh... Right. Tracking number.
      It's looking grim.   Thankfully, the Supervisor reappears.

                           MAILROOM SUPERVISOR
                Mr. Martin? I found a number of
                things that could be what you're
                looking for. Mind coming back to
                take a look?
      Hodges shoots Craig a look, "go".

                           CRAIG
                Sure.
      The Supervisor leads Hodges and Craig away to the back room.
      Unfortunately, Greer stays behind.

                           RYAN
                     (patting himself)
                I might... Maybe it's on the
                clipboard on my bike?
      Ryan watches Greer out of the corner of his eye as Hodges and
      Craig disappear inside the vault.



                                                                 74.

116                                                                    116





                           RYAN (CONT'D)
                 I, uh, may need to call somebody.

                                                  CUT TO:

117   INT. MAILROOM - BACK ROOM                                        117
      There's an entire shelf that serves as a dead letter office.
      One plastic bin is filled with reusable interoffice
      envelopes, another bin is overflowing with small mailers,
      computer disks, unlabeled video tapes, Etc...

                           MAILROOM SUPERVISOR
                Help yourself.
      HODGES cautiously watches Craig shuffle through the mailers,
      opening two or three before finding -- he turns one upside
      down -- and a DVD case slides out!
      A quick glance at the label, "ADT Digital Surveillance'.
      5/19/05 06:00 - 07:00" confirms it's the disc.

                           CRAIG
                This is it.
      Hodges seems uncomfortable with the Supervisor hovering over
      his shoulder.

                            HODGES
                Let's go.

                                                  BACK TO:

118   INT. MAILROOM - CONTINUOUS                                       118
      Ryan now sits by the window, cellphone pressed to his ear.
      Feigning frustration.

                          RYAN
                You believe this? Everyone's got
                their head up their ass over there.
      The Mail Clerk ignores him almost as much as Greer wants to.
      Greer opens his cellphone to make a call, but when the signal
      is no good, he wanders outside the mailroom toward the window
      at the end of the hall.

                          MAIL CLERK
                    (impatiently)
                Sir? You think you could just go
                outside and get your clipboard?
      Just then, Hodges and Craig come marching out of the vault.

                            MAIL CLERK (CONT'D)
                Sir?
      Ryan glances at Greer, momentarily distracted on the phone.
      At Hodges, almost out of the bank. As he and Craig near the
      door --



                                                                  75.

118                                                                     118




      A moment where Craig finally locks eyes with Ryan -- and
      suddenly realizes: This is the guy!
      It's now or never.   Ryan has to do something.

                           MAIL CLERK (CONT'D)
                 Sir!?

                            RYAN
                      (to Clerk)
                 Screw the package.
      Ryan stands and, unable to find anything better, snatches a
      metal HAND TRUCK sitting by the door, and as Hodges walks by--

                           MAIL CLERK

                 WHAT ARE YOU DOING--?!
      -- swings it full-force into Hodges' face -- WHAMM!!   Hodges
      drops like a slaughterhouse cow.
      Instantly, employees hit the ground; scream; run for their
      lives. Craig dives for the DVD case. The Security Guard has
      come to life; drawing down on them.

                           SECURITY GUARD

                FREEZE!
      Craig does.   But Ryan grabs him and moves, racing out of the
      bank.

                           RYAN

                COME ON, LET'S GO!

119   INT. HALLWAY - OUTSIDE MAILROOM - CONTINUOUS                      119
      At the end of the hall, GREER sees Craig and Ryan running out
      of the mailroom. Drops his phone, draws his gun --

                           SECURITY GUARD (OS)

                FREEZE!!
      -- just as the Guard comes running out. His gun was fixed on
      Ryan, but now that he sees Greer with a piece, he trains his
      gun on him instead.

                          SECURITY GUARD (CONT'D)

                DROP YOUR WEAPON!
      Ryan and Craig are struck in the middle of the crossfire.

                           GREER
                     (flashing his badge)

                L.A.P.D.! I'M A COP!

                           SECURITY GUARD

                DROP IT NOW!!
      The instant Ryan and Craig try to escape into a nearby
      stairwell -- Greer turns his gun on the SECURITY GUARD --

      BANG! BANG!



                                                                     76.

119                                                                        119


      -The Security Guard drops and Greer aims his weapon at Craig
      again!
      BANG! -- Greer fires.
      Craig, SHOT IN THE BACK, slams against Ryan with the impact.
      They fall half-in/half-out of the stairwell. Craig weakly
      shoves the DVD into Ryan's hands.

                             CRAIG
                 ..run...
      But Ryan is overwhelmed.       His legs feel like a thousand
      pounds of jelly.

                           CRAIG (CONT'D)
                 ..ruuuUUUUNNNNNN!!
      As Craig slumps to the ground, Ryan stares in shock -- but
      when Greer starts sending a hail of bullets toward them, he
      DIVES into:

120   INT. STAIRWELL - DAY                                                 120
      He starts flying down the stairs...but when he sees four
      BUILDING SECURITY GUARDS racing up from below--

                             RYAN
                Damn!
      --he turns around and starts RUNNING UP instead.

121   INT. MAILROOM - DAY                                                  121
      Hodges gets to his feet. Stumbles out, holding his gushing,
      broken nose. Yells at Greer, who's racing into the stairwell.

                             HODGES
                The kid!!

                             GREER
                No shit.

122   INT. STAIRWELL - DAY                                                 122
      With the Guards and Greer only a floor behind, Ryan thinks
      fast and CHUCKS HIS BIKE HELMET down the corridor, ELBOWS the
      In-Case-Of-Emergency Glass, setting off the FIRE ALARM -- and
      starts running UP.
      Seconds later, when they reach that level, one of the Guards
      sees Ryan's helmet and the broken glass leading away.

                             GUARD
                     (racing down the hall)
                This way!
      The other Guards follow...but Greer isn't convinced.       On a
      hunch, he turns and continues running UP also.
      Peeking over the edge from the floor above--



                                                                  77 .

122                                                                      122



      RYAN
      Sees Greer and Hodges coming.     Big-ass guns out and ready.
      Shit.'
      THE ALARM BELLS SCREAM.     PEOPLE start filling the stairwell
      on every floor.
      Forcing his body to its very limits, Ryan bolts up the stairs
      until he sees the ROOF EXIT on the next floor up. He shoves
      open the nearest door and continues running up to the roof.
      He slips out and silently closes the door behind him just as--

123   INT. STAIRWELL - DAY                                               123
      GREER and HODGES reach the floor beneath. See the door
      swinging shut -- but neither fall for the bait. They runs up
      toward the-

124   EXT. ROOF - DAY                                                    124
      Ryan's eyes SCAN the rooftop. Construction is in progress up
      here; tarpapering. Huge ROLLS OF TARPAPER lie about,
      PALATTES holding supplies covered with TARPS, an industrial

      AIR CONDITIONER...
      Ryan quickly shoves a 2"x4" under the doorknob to jam it.
      Heart pounding, he races to the building's edge and looks
      down. Nothing but a straight drop 60 feet down.
      Footsteps are approaching! POUNDING on the door! Ryan darts
      behind a tarp-covered mass of supplies just as --

125   EXT. ROOF - DAY                                                    125
      GREER shakes the 2"x4" loose.     He and Hodges explode out onto
      the roof, looking for Ryan.
      Greer encircles the huge air-conditioner while Hodges hunts
      behind a large SATELLITE DISH. No Ryan.

                           GREER
                     (to Hodges)
                Here.
      Cop-instincts crackling, Greer stands on one side of the tarp-
      covered stockpile and waits for Hodges to secure the other.
      This is it; they signal go at each other and spring around --
      But Ryan's nowhere to be found!

                             GREER (CONT'D)
                Dammit!
      No, wait! Greer turns and sees a LARGE ALUMINUM CHUTE that
      leads from the roof and elbows down toward a DUMPSTER on
      ground level.



                                                                      78.

125                                                                         125




      Greer peers down the chute for long seconds...but nothing can
      be seen from this angle. It all falls to blackness.

      THE ALARM STOPS.
      Greer cocks his head in the sudden eerie silence. The only
      sounds are INCOHERENT SCREAMS coming from the stairwell. He
      eyes where the chute empties into the dumpster, thinks...

      REVEAL --

126   INT. METAL CHUTE - CONTINUOUS                                         126
      RYAN, wedging himself against the sides of the chute, tries
      to be as still as possible. Every slight movement makes the

      ALUMINUM BUCKLE AND GROAN.
      From his shirt pocket, Jessica's tiny desperate voice pleads.

                             JESSICA (VO)
                  Ryan... ? Ryan, please answer me I
      But Ryan just sits there.    Afraid to move.     Terrified to
      discuss Craig.

127   EXT. ROOF - CONTINUOUS                                                127
      Greer picks up a large roll of tarpaper and starts lugging it
      toward the open mouth of the chute...

.28   INT. METAL CHUTE - CONTINUOUS                                         128
      Ryan holds his breath.    Trembling.   His leg threatening to
      rabbit-foot again.
      Straining to hear Greer, it's impossible not to hear:

                             JESSICA
                  You have to talk to me! Ryan,
                  please you have to talk to me--.'
      The sweat from his hands causes the tiniest SLIP -- and as he
      catches himself, there is a soft metallic BOOOONG from the
      stressed metal.
      Unable to ignore her pleas any longer, Ryan carefully pulls
      the cellphone from his pocket and presses it to his ear.
      Desperate to console her, Ryan --
      BANG!! The TARPAPER ROLL flies down the chute. Ryan looks
      up to see it angrily launching itself right at him!
      He has to let go of the walls to avoid being hit.      He presses
      himself to one side but --
      WHAM!! The bloodthirsty roll bashes his wrist -- and he DROPS

      SIMON COWELL'S CELLPHONE!



                                                                       79.

128                                                                          128




      Ryan reaches out, but the phone goes sliding down the chute!

                                                     CUT TO:

129   INT. ATTIC                                                             129
      Jessica hears a loud SCRAAAAPE, CRASH and a wash of STATIC.

                               JESSICA
                   Ryan?!    OH MY GOD, RYAN?!   RYAN--?!

130   INT. KIDNAPPERS' SAFEHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME                   130
      The hulking Deason hears Jessica's PANICKED VOICE and stands
      with a start. As he moves toward the attic, he notices a
      small RED LIGHT FLASHING behind the bar. As he passes, he
      checks it out and--

                              DEASON

                   WHAT THE--?!
      WHIP PAN DOWN to what Deason sees: The red light is on one
      of the house phones. The LINE-IN-USE INDICATOR.
      And it's lit.
      Shaking like a bear pissing pineapples, Deason rages away
      toward the attic...

                                                    CUT TO:

131   INT. ATTIC - CONTINUOUS                                                131
      Jessica is curling herself into a tiny sobbing ball on the
      floor when -- WHAMM! -- the attic door crashes open. Jessica
      jumps. Deason looms there. Sees the phone.

                              DEASON

                   YOU STUPID BITCH!
      Jessica hurls the phone receiver away.

                             DEASON (CONT'D)

                   WHO HAVE YOU TOLD?! WHO HAVE YOU

                   TOLD?!

                              JESSICA

                   NO, DON 'T H URT M E--
      Deason roars up and grabs Jessica's neck with one hand.
      HURLS her across the attic and into the OLD MIRROR,
      shattering it in a million pieces around her.
      Desperate for anything, Jessica PALMS a TINY SHARD as she
      struggles to her feet. A two-inch chip.

                             DEASON

                   YOU AND YOUR KID ARE DEAD!
      She lowers her arm, defeated, out of breath...        You win.



                                                                         80.

       131                                                                     131





                                    JESSICA
                        Don't hurt me, and I'll do
                        anything... Anything.. .
             There is a promise in what Jessica offers that Deason
             responds to. His fist FLASHES toward her throat, making her
             flinch. But rather than hitting her, he wraps his meaty
             fingers around her throat, almost daring her to stop him.
             Jessica trembles, but that is all, and just as Deason begins
             to enjoy his work, Jessica JABS at his face, but he predicted
             as much and easily moves to deflect it -- SNICKK! -- she
             flicks her wrist up and SLICES the underside of his upper
             arm.
             Deason flinches a little bit, like a bee sting, then laughs
             as he notices the tiny SHARD in her hand--

                              DEASON
                        (sarcastic)
                        Oooh.
             --but that's when he HEARS it. A DRIPPING SOUND. Deason
             looks down at his arm and is confused to see his entire shirt
             sleeve SOAKED IN BLOOD. It literally pours from his arm onto
             the floor like a river.
             Deason drains white; dizzy.      He looks at Jessica, confused.

                                   JESSICA
                        Brachial artery. Pumps up to 30
                        liters of blood per minute...and
                        there's only five liters in the
                        human body.
             Three seconds later, Deason crumbles...and Jessica leaves the
             attic.

                                                         BACK TO:

             RYAN'S still trapped. Sounds of approaching SIRENS in the
             distance. Ryan listens for Greer; is he still there?
             BANG!!   BANG!!   Two more heavy TARPAPER ROLLS come right at
             him!
             The first one he gets lucky with, but the second NAILS HIM
             before bouncing furiously away and Ryan loses his grip
             completely and slides out of control.

 133         EXT. ROOF - DAY                                                   133
             GREER watches amazed when Ryan actually tumbles out of the
             ass-end of the metal chute into the dumpster. He drops the
             next roll of tarpaper ready to go and reaches for his gun --

-434    EXT. INSIDE DJUMPSTER - CONTINUOUS                               134
       RYAN is in serious pain.    He frantically fishes through the
       refuse to find:

       SIMON COWELL'S CELLPHONE
       Or rather, what's left of it:      A million shattered pieces
       scattered everywhere.
       Ryan sifts through the plastic debris as if he had secretly
       hoped he could still use it. Yeah, right... He's barely able
       to sit up when --

       BLAM!! BLAM!! BLAM!!
       He ducks back down as bullets ricochet off the steel
       dumpster.
       As SIRENS get louder, closer, Ryan's got to make his move --
       he jumps out of the dumpster, landing on his ass on the
       opposite side of Greer.

       BLAMM-BLAMM-BLAMM!!


       Bullets ricochet off the steel dumpster and Ryan summons his
       courage -- and takes off limping!

135    EXT. ROOF - CONTINUOUS                                            135
       BLAMM-BLAMM-BLAMM!! Greer's pistol is ill equipped for long-
       range shooting. The kid's too far away by now. He grabs his
       walkie --

                            GREER
                      (into walkie)
                 The kid's outside, headed toward
                 the front of the building--

                            HODGES
                 -Gotta go, boss. The Guard's dead.
       Hodges waits by the rooftop door, looking concerned
       as COPS spill out around him onto the roof.



                            COPS
                 Who the hell's shooting up here?
       Greer points to Ryan bolting around the corner.

                           GREER
                 Sonofabitch shot the poor bastard
                 right in front of us!

       Jessica races across the dead brown lawn toward the guest
       house/prison that holds her son. Getting her first good look



                                                                  82.

      at the secluded premises she's on confirms that screaming
      would do no good. She's on her own.
      When she reaches the guest house, she's shocked to find a
      HUGE LOCK on the front door. Frantic, she makes her way
      around the structure to a BIG BAY WINDOW. Though it's
      protected by SECURITY BARS, she can see Ricky through the
      glass.
      Jessica pounds on the glass, and Ricky turns.    When her son
      sees her, he races to the bars.

                              RICKY
                   Mom!

                               JESSICA
                   Baby!   Are you okay?!

                              RICKY
                   I can't get out!
      Jessica looks around for something to bend the bars with.
      There's nothing.

137   EXT. THE MARTIN HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON                            137
      A gold FORD TAURUS pulls up in front. The driver door opens
      and Mooney gets out. Walks to the front door and KNOCKS.
      But this time, there's no answer.
      Mooney rings the bell. Still nothing. Suspicious, he checks
      around the side...and sees the back door SWAYING in the wind.

138   INT. MARTIN HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY                                 138


      Mooney's cop senses scream as he walks inside. A POLICE
      SCANNER chatters in the background. The place is a shambles.
      Someone's been looking for something. He then sees-
      BLOOD STREAKS the floor. It leads from over by the telephone
      to underneath the pantry door.

                             MOONEY
                       (calling into house)
                   Hello? L.A.P.D. Anybody home?
      No answer.    Drawing his gun, Mooney stalks carefully into--

139   INT. MARTIN HOUSE - THE ENTRYWAY - DAY                            139


      A SMALL STAIRCASE leads up to the second floor. As Mooney
      starts up the steps, BOOM UP to the top to REVEAL:

      THE IMPOSTER JESSICA MARTIN (BAYBACK)
      Hiding in ambush at the top of the stairs, gun in hand. She
      listens to Mooney's footsteps and when she thinks he's neared
      the top -- she springs out, blasting away down the staircase!
      But Mooney's not there.



                                                                  83.

139                                                                     139



                            MOONEY
                 Drop your gun, now.   I got you.
      Now we see him. Still down in the entryway, behind some
      cover, gun aimed and steady.

                            MOONEY (CONT'D)
                 I said drop it.'
      Bayback relaxes -- then WHIRLS around, disappearing down the
      hall! Mooney curses and quietly jogs up the stairs,
      following her into--

140   INT. SHADOWY CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS                                140
      A narrow hallway with multiple OPEN DOORWAYS on each side.
      The Imposter Jessica could be hiding in any one of them...
      Taking care not to give himself away, Mooney inches down the
      hallway. And just when he's thinking that he may have
      successfully created an element of surprise for himself--
      SFX: SQUEEEEAK -- the floorboards of the old house groan
      softly -- GIVING HIS POSITION AWAY!
      Instantly Bayback swings out from a doorway right next to
      Mooney, taps her gun to his chest pulls the tang--
      But Mooney DIVES OUT OF THE WAY! BLAMM-BLAMM-BLAMM!!   Two
      miss, but the third shot NAILS HIS SHOULDER!
      OOF! Mooney lands hard. Blood spreading out under his white
      dress shirt. He cocks his head... listening for the sound of-
      BAYBACK EJECTS A MAGAZINE and is about to reload--
      Mooney JUMPS UP, RETURNS FIRE -- slamming Bayback against the
      wall with two .38 caliber slugs. She collapses to the floor.

                            MOONEY
                Damn it!   DAMN IT!!
      Angry, the adrenaline drowning out the pain, Mooney turns to
      the kidnapper laying in the hall, bleeding out. Kicks her
      gun away and kneels.
      But for the first time, Bayback isn't tough.   Just scared.

                          BAYBACK
                ..a-ambulance...

                          MOONEY
                Tell me where Jessica Martin is or
                you bleed to death right here.

                          BAYBACK
                ..p-please..call.. I.. I'm a--
      Fuck this, Mooney kicks her ribs.



                                                                   84.

                            MOONEY

                  WHERE IS SHE?!
       Bayback struggles for air, reaching for him--

                            BAYBACK
                  ...I'm a cop...
       Bayback squeezes her eyes shut against a wave of pain -- and
       DIES. Mooney stares at her. What did she say? Starts
       patting her down.
       And that's when he finds her BADGE.     L.A.P.D.   23rd Precinct.
       She is a cop.

                              MOONEY
                 Oh shit...
       Mooney grits his teeth against a fresh wave of pain and picks
       up the phone, dials 911.

       Ryan wanders the streets. Checks his wallet -- a measly four
       bucks. Despair overtakes him and he almost gets CRUSHED as a-
       TOW TRUCK speeds by -- An old Hyundai mounts it like a hippo!
       A lightbulb clicks on for Ryan.

                              RYAN

       Ryan bolts to the nearest BUS STOP just as a BLUE LINE BUS

       Jessica SMASHES A REAR WINDOW with a long thick branch and
       uses it to try to pry the bars apart. The limited leverage
       won't enable her to bend them enough for Ricky to squeeze
       through.

       SFX: GRAVEL CRUNCHING IN THE DRIVEWAY
       Jessica leans her head around the back corner of the
       guesthouse -- and sees the Escalade pulling in!

143    EXT. KIDNAPPERS' SAFEHOUSE / INT. ESCALADE                     143
       Pulls into the driveway.
        Greer and his team are going over surveillance photos taken
        from the cameras at the Fegan Securities Building. The
  hotos are useless, though, as Ryan's face is obscured by his
E helmet and visor.

                 These are the best pictures you
                 could get of him?!

                 He was wearing a visor.
       Greer glares at him -- no shit -- and throws the pictures .

                 Useless!
       The car parks and Greer storms out, followed by Ellis and
       Hodges. They head for the house, and the moment they enter --
       Jessica reappears. But now she's STARING at something.
       The Escalade.

                            JESSICA
                      (to son; through window)
                 Baby, listen to me. I want you to
                 get away from this window. I want
                 you to go to the other side of the
                 room as far away from the door as
                 you can --

                            RICKY
                 No, don't leave me!     Don't leave
                 me!!
       The terror in his voice breaks Jessica's heart.

                            JESSICA
                 Honey, I'm getting you out of
                 there!

                 Where are you going?!

                 I'm only gonna be gone a second,
                 and then we're gonna go home, but
                 you have to do this first. It's
                 gonna be loud, but don't be scared,
                 okay? Now go find somewhere safe
                 like I told you.



                                                                  86.

      PARAMEDICS apply a bandage to Mooney's shoulder.      Mooney's
      pretty shaken up.

                           PARAMEDIC #1
                You're lucky. Shot went clean

      Mooney watches other PARAMEDICS carry sheet-covered corpses
      into awaiting ambulances. Flashbulbs POP from inside.
      A sedan pulls up and Mooney's relieved to see Tomlin get out.

                What the hell, Moon? It's all over

                           MOONEY
                I shot a cop!
                     (lowering his voice)
                Dana Bayback. From the 23rd.     She
                was one of the kidnappers.
      Tomlin looks stunned by the revelation.

                           DETECTIVE TOMLIN
                Let me call the tw9~three. See
                what the hell's going on.
      Tomlin pulls out a cellphone.

                          MOONEY
                I hate to think more cops are
                involved, but--

                           DETECTIVE TOMLIN
                Did she say anything about the
                Martin woman?

                          MOONEY
                ...Never got the chance.
      Detective Tomlin frowns.

                                                 CUT TO:



                                                                  87.







145   EXT. POLICE. IMPOUND YARD - LATE AFTERNOON - ESTABLISHING         145
      A GONZOLEZ TOW TRUCK drives up (like the one we saw at the
      airport), and stops temporarily beside:
      Simon Cowell, from the CADILLAC XLR incident, who stands at
      the window, screaming at the JADED CASHIER.
      His car idles just on the other side of an IMPOSING FENCE.

                               SIMON COWELL
                    Just give me my goddamned car!

                               JADED CASHIER
                    Don't take that tone of voice with
                    me, sir. I've already told you, we
                    do not release vehicles until all
                    impound fees are paid.
      In the E.G., NOTICE Ryan skulking closer, behind the GONZALEZ

      AUTO TOW TRUCK.

                          SIMON COWELL
                But I didn't cause it to get
                impounded! Can't you understand
                that?! It was stolen from me!

                           JADED CASHIER
                Sir, do you want the car back or
                not?
      Noticing Cowell standing at the window, Ryan presses further
      into the shadows, not wanting to be noticed.

                              SIMON COWELL
                Yes!     But I'm not paying for it!
      The Cashier signals a GRUNGY YARD WORKER on the other side of
      the fence.

                           JADED CASHIER
                Nevermind, Howie. Take 'er back.
      Howie nods, and just as he's about to drive the Cadillac back
      into the yard --

                           SIMON COWELL
                Wait, wait! All right you bloody
                fascist, I'll pay. But if there's
                even the slightest scratch on it...
      Howie smiles, thought so, gets out and splits. As Cowell
      angrily starts making out a check, the Cashier flicks the
      switch to open the gate, and as it opens--
      Ryan slips in. He sneaks behind the wheel of the idling
      Cadillac. And the moment Cowell hands over his check --
      VRRRROOOM!!    Ryan burns rubber out of there.



                                                                  88.

                            SIMON COWELL (CONT'D)
                 Hey, that's my car!
       Cowell chases it -- and watches in horror as Ryan takes a
       speed bump too fast and TEARS THE REAR BUMPER OFF THE

       CADILLAC XLR CONVERTIBLE IN AN EXPLOSION OF SPARKS!

                            SIMON COWELL (CONT'D)
                 NOooooooo...!!

146   EXT. SURFACE STREETS - LATE AFTERNOON                             146
      As he zooms away, Ryan searches the passenger seat with his
      free hand. He hunts through the car and finds -- HIS BLUE

      TOOTH VIDEO CELL PHONE!

                              RYAN
                 Thank you!
      As he flips it open, his eyes spot THE LAPTOP on the floor of
      the passenger seat.
Ryan thinks, pulls out his SECURITY DVD and pops it in.
At first, the SCREEN is a mere wash of digital gobbledygook--
And as Ryan grunts with frustration --
--a Hi-Res QUICKTIME MOVIE suddenly fills the screen:

47    ANGLE ON LAPTOP MONITOR - FOUR WAY SPLIT SCREEN                   147
      The Fagen Securities Building parking lot. A police pursuit
      in progress. Three Police Cars skillfully box in a BMW with
      TWO HISPANIC YOUTHS, forcing it to come to a dead stop.
      GREER and HODGES explode from their cars, guns drawn.
      BAYBACK and ELLIS come from the back. DEASON appears, and he
      and HODGES yank the teens out of the car, who struggle
      frantically to avoid vicious baton blows. When one decks
      Hodges and tries to run, ELLIS SHOOTS HIM in the back!

      WE QUICKLY PAN TO ANOTHER ANGLE:
      Inside the building, CRAIG gets up from his chair, hurries
      into-

      WE PAN DOWN TO ANOTHER ANGLE
      As Craig enters frame inside the Security Office.   And
      watches live-

      ANOTHER ANGLE:
      GREER wastes no time in SHOOTING the second man execution
      style!



                                                                   89.





-148    IN THE CADILLAC XLR CONVERTIBLE                                  148
       RYAN watches in horror. He PULLS OVER, too riveted to drive
       and watch simultaneously. Finally understanding the
       magnitude of this disc.

149    ANOTHER ANGLE:                                                    149
       And as BAYBACK drags a DEAD HISPANIC YOUTH out of the frame,
       legs disappear off-screen in short bursts.

       PAN DIAGONALLY TO ANOTHER ANGLE:
       And more terrifying, GREER stops picking up shell casings,
       turning his head ominously toward the CAMERA! Noticing us!
       Greer motions to several others; DEASON and BAYBACK, who rush
       OUT OF FRAME toward the front entrance.
       ANGLE ONE: At the SIDE DOOR, ELLIS and HODGES start kicking
       in the door with full force.
       ANGLE TWO: GREER, outside, unholstering his GUN at the

       DELIVERY ENTRANCE.

                                                   BACK TO:

151    ANGLE ONE: Ellis and Hodges finally kick open the door and 151
       rush inside--
       ANGLE THREE:     The COPS rush inside the building, consult the
       Directory...
       ANGLE FOUR:    Craig, panicked, reaches over to the DVD
       Recorder --

152    EXT. SURFACE STREETS - AFTERNOON                                  152
       THE LAPTOP MONITOR -- ALL STATIC.    The recording has stopped.

                            RYAN
                 I'm so screwed.
       As Ryan speeds away from the curb, he fingers his cellphone.

       nearing the attic that Jessica's supposed to still be in...

      -- JESSICA quietly opening the door of the Escalade(
      trying not to give herself away. She climbs in behind the
      wheel, and says a silent prayer of thanks when she sees that
      the keys are still dangling in the ignition.

155   EXT. SURFACE STREETS - DAY                                        155

      CALL on the cellphone. Holds his breath.

156   INT. KIDNAPPERS' SAFEHOUSE - STAIRWELL LEADING TO ATTIC       156
      As Greer reaches the first landing, the HOUSE PHONE starts
      RINGING. Ignoring it, Greer continues on and is about to turn
      the corner to the attic when --

                           HODGES (OS)
                Boss, you better take this.
      Greer stops, a footstep away from seeing the open attic door.
      From the bottom of the steps, Hodges tosses him a CORDLESS
      PHONE. Greer puts it to his ear.

                             GREER
                What?

                          RYAN
                Shut up and listen to me, asswipe.
                I got what you want.

      same TELEMARKETER that called him earlier.

                           TELEMARKETER
                Look, sir, we can take your name
                off our list if you want, but you
                don't have to get nasty--

                             RYAN (VO)
                What--?    Who is this?

                 just hit "Last Incoming Call"--
       Ryan suddenly puts it together.

                            RYAN (VO) (CONT'D)
                 You bastard.
       The Telemarketer quickly hangs up before it gets ugly.

       the phone? Tomlin.

                            TOMLIN (VO)
                 Look, Captain, we've got to do
                 everything we can to protect this

                 Said something about a kid who came
                 into the station earlier--
       Greer grimaces, putting it together.

                            GREER
                 Early twenties? Stumbled out of
                 Brian Wilson's hamper?

                             TOMLIN
                 Yeah.   Something like that.

                            GREER
                 Tomlin. Take care of him.      No
                 witnesses.
       That's more than Tomlin bargained for.

                            TOMLIN
                 Are you sure that's necessary, sir?

                            GREER
                 You know once the shitstorm starts,
                 there's nothing I can do to save
                 you.

                            TOMLIN
                 Sure. That's what I thought.        I'll
                 tell him.



                                                                   92.

        Greer slips the cordless into his jacket pocket, continuing
        up the stairs. Hodges follows, staring expectantly.

                              HODGES
                  Well?   What'd he say?

                  -- HOLY SHIT!
        Greer sees Hodges gaping up the stairwell. Following his
        look, Greer turns...and sees the attic door WIDE OPEN!
        Further in, he can make out Deason's bloody body and the
        rigged-together phone...
        In fact, the only thing Greer doesn't see is Jessica.

                             GREER

                  NO!
        Greer turns and pounds down the stairs.

        She TWISTS the key and STOMPS the gas, sending the monster
        SUV on a collision course with -- SMASHHH -- the guest house
        window! The bay window SHATTERS and the security bar SNAP
        LIKE TWIGS as the Escalade BULLDOZES through!

        Unable to open the door because of all the debris, Jessica
        rolls down the window and yells to her son --

       shakes his head. No.

                  Baby, please! It's okay now.

                       (glances back nervously)
                  Ricky, please!
       Somehow, the kid digs deep and finds the courage to run to
       the Escalade, where his mother scoops him up into the cab
       just as--
       The kitchen door bursts open and Greer's team spills out into
       the yard. They spot her instantly.

                            ELLIS
                  Get out of the car!    Get out of the

       Jessica throws the big car in reverse and tries to back out --
       but the Escalade's stuck! Caught by the debris, the wheels
       just spin.

                              JESSICA
                 Come on!    COME ON!!
       Jessica rocks the car forward, and back. Forward, and back.
       And just as it finally comes loose -- KRRRAAASHHH!!
       The window next to Jessica's head EXPLODES in a shower of
       tempered glass, shocking us. Two arms snake in and wrap
       around Jessica's neck. Greer.
       But Jessica STOMPS ON THE GAS, hoping the big car will pull
       her free.
       It doesn't. As the Escalade surges away across the lawn,
       Greer's vice-like grip holds, PULLING JESSICA OUT the broken
       window and -- THUMP! -- to the guest house debris below.
       As Jessica watches in horror:

       THE DRIVERLESS ESCALADE
       Careens down the driveway and crashes into a pillar.    Hodges
       races over and yanks Ricky out.

       GREER
       Balls his fist in Jessica's hair and yanks her around hard.

                             RICKY
                 Stop it!   Don't hurt her!!
      Seething mad, Greer rips his gun from its holster and is
      literally about to blow Jessica's brains out when--

      SFX:   THE CORDLESS PHONE IN GREER'S POCKET STARTS RINGING!
      The entire world stops. There's an awkward moment: Jessica
      cowering, Greer recovering, the phone just ringing and
      ringing... The telephone is the only sound in the world,
      getting louder and louder with each ring until--
      Greer answers it.

                Fine.     Your loss.   Nice talking to
                you.

                Ring.     C'mon, damn it, ring!   RING!
      Then it does. Ryan waits a couple rings, slowing his
      speeding heart, then nonchalantly picks up.

                          GREER
                So, how do you want to do this?

                               RYAN (VO)
                     No. Put them on the Ferris wheel.
                     I want to see them safe first.

                                GREER
                     That wasn't part of the deal.

                                RYAN (VO)
                     Deal's changed.

                                                        MATCH CUT TO:

          The top of the bluffs, overlooking the pier below.       Among the
          crowd, some SKATE RATS scare the ELDERLY.

                                  RYAN (VO)
                    I've been thinking. Does me no
                    good to hand over the DVD and then
                    you and the funky bunch take us
                    out.

                               GREER (VO)
                    I swore I wouldn't do that.

                               RYAN
                    Like you swore to protect and
                    serve?
          The reference brings Greer up short.       There's a moment, then:

                               GREER
                    You know a lot...

                              RYAN
                    And I'll forget a lot, too. But
                    not until they're both out of
                    danger.
          Now PAN AROUND TO REVEAL Ryan among the crowd, wearing a
          SURFING WINDBREAKER; HOODED with WATERPROOF POCKETS -- but
          where's his cellphone?
          Moving closer, we see Ryan's wearing the EARBUD MIKE from the
          Verizon store. With the earbud concealed under the loose
          hood, Ryan looks like anyone else just watching the show.

                               RYAN (CONT'D)
                    Your choice, man. The Martins or
                    the DVD. Either way, I'm not
                    hanging around any longer. You got
                    five seconds, then I disconnect
                    your ass.

179   EXT. CAROUSEL ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS                                179
      GREER wrestles with his better judgment--

                              RYAN
                 Three...    Four...
      --but Ryan's got him by the balls.     Angrily, Greer lifts his
      walkie.

                           GREER
                Okay! Okay.
                     (into walkie)
                Hodges, put 'em on the Ferris

                What? I

                           GREER
                Shut up and do it!

                          RYAN
                Not bad. Most people never get
                past two.
      Greer flinches as his own taunts are used against him.

                           GREER
                     (to Ellis)
                Keep an eye on them. As soon as we
                make the trade, take the woman and
                her kid out.

      RYAN watches from a distance as Hodges exits the van.

                          GREER (VO)
                Don't screw me kid, y9u won't live
                long enough to enjoy it.

                           RYAN
                Oooh, I think I just pissed myself.
      Ryan looks optimistic when Hodges gets out and opens the back
      door. And just as he's on the brink of success--

                              FEMALE VOICE (OS)

                HEY--!



                                                                   102.

        A woman's HAND grabs the hood of Ryan's windbreaker and rips
        it away from his face. Wheels him around. It's:

                             CHLOE
                  There you are! Where the hell were
                  you! ?

                               RYAN
                  Chloe!    Get away from here!

                            CHLOE
                  Know how many hours I waited for
                  you to bring back those stupid
                  shirts?! What'd you do? Sell them
                  on the Prominade yourself--?
        But Ryan's got no time for this.

                                 RYAN

                  GO!    NOW!!

181     EXT. SANTA MONICA PIER - NIGHT                                    181
       A sickly-looking MOONEY glances at the commotion -- and sees
       the hoodless Ryan.

                             MOONEY
                       (motioning to Tomlin)
                  That's him! There he is!

 12     EXT. SANTA MONICA PIER - BLUFF - NIGHT                            182
       Ryan desperately tries to shoo Chloe away.

                            RYAN
                  It isn't safe to talk, get it? I --
                  People are after me!

                             CHLOE
                      (shrugs free)
                  What -- are you high?
       Suddenly, Mooney steps up beside Ryan and grabs him.

                        MOONEY
                  (winded)
                  I've been..looking for..you, kid--
       But Ryan struggles, thinking Mooney is with the bad guys.
       Mooney grabs him as he tries to make a break for it.

                            RYAN
                 Let go of me! Sonofabitch, let go!

       GREER's pissed.     Pacing on the roof, when:

                Hodges, do not let them go! Do you

      RYAN struggles with Mooney. The crowd completely ignores
      them in favor of the raucous concert.
      In the heat of battle, Ryan's cellphone clatters by Chloe' s
      feet.

                          MOONEY
                    (sweating profusely)
                Jesus, kid, calm down!!
      Trying to break Mooney's stronghold, Ryan SHOVES him
      backwards, SLAMMING his injured shoulder into the PIER

      RAILING.
      Mooney SCREAMS out in pain and grabs his shoulder, releasing--
      Ryan, who BREAKS AWAY and turns to see Mooney COLLAPSE to the
      ground, holding his blood-soaked shoulder. Ryan looks over
      to Chloe, whose face is a combination of shock and confusion.

                           CHLOE
                Oh my God--
                     (checking Mooney)
                Someone call 911!
      A CROWD starts to gather when --
      Ryan feels the barrel of a gun nudging his back.     Tomlin's
      gun.

                           TOMLIN
                It's over kid.
      Fuck! Ryan's got no choice but to slowly walk toward the end
      of the pier.
      MOONEY - From his prone position, he catches a glimpse of
      Tomlin backing Ryan quietly into the crowd. Not trying to
      help. Not calling for an ambulance. In that instant, Mooney
      knows he's been betrayed. Tomlin's in on this.



                                                                 104.

                              TOMLIN (CONT'D)
                   For all the trouble you've caused,
                   you'd better have that goddamned
                   disc. Where is it?
      Just then, Greer appears through the crowd ahead of him.
      Like a nightmare, he closes in.
      Ryan slowly slips his phone into a waterproof pocket in his
      windbreaker and zips it up.

                                RYAN
                   Aw shit...
      Ryan's world is spinning -- the NOISE, the CROWDS, the

      TENSION...
      He KICKS BACK hard into Tomlin's SHIN. It is enough for
      Tomlin to release his grip and Ryan bolts.
      Tomlin recovers and raises his GUN to get a bead on Ryan, but
      it causes the crowd around him to PANIC.

                              CROWD GOER (OS)
                   Dude's gotta gun!
      Ryan navigates through the fleeing crowd and turns to see
      Greer and Tomlin quickly gaining ground.
      He has to make a choice, either go over the railing, or deal
      with Greer and Tomlin. Ryan decides on the ocean. He runs
      to a MAN FISHING WITH HIS SON and uses their ice chest as a
      step. Just as he JUMPS THE RAIL -- Tomlin gets off a SHOT!
      SLIIIIIICEE!!! The bullet tears through Ryan's shoulder as
      he spins headlong into the Pacific!
      TOMLIN AND GREER run to the railing and see Ryan HIT the
      CHOPPY WATER below.

                              GREER
                   Under the pier. Go! Go!

      Ryan flails, panicking, exhaling all his air and sucking in
      the dark water of the ocean --

      Ryan is struggling. Bleeding. Sinking. Dying. His lungs
      convulse, trying to breathe, burning like a thousand red-hot
      needles are pushing their way through his chest.
      The WAVES POUND against the thick pylons below the pier. Just
      as Ryan comes up for air he's SLAMMED into a wooden pylon!
      Ryan fights for his life as the surge churns him underwater,
      BASHING him repeatedly against the pillars. It's not pretty.



                                                                  105.

       As he struggles toward the shore, he's constantly thrown back
       and forth underwater like a rag doll.

       up the sand, out of breath, blood trailing behind him.
       He unzips the waterproof pocket of his shorts, pulling out
       the cellphone, which thank God is actually dry. Ryan forces
       himself into action; stumbling, exhausted into a --

       The place is dark. Empty. An array of rowing shells covered
       in ghostly, flapping tarps make the place look vaguely haunted.
       This place is also filled with storage equipment, such as
       buoys and safety netting used by the beach patrol.

       RYAN - sees Tomlin coming.   Ryan's trapped like a rat -- and
       dripping blood everywhere.
       He looks for anything that'll save him, but finds only
       useless boating tools (sanders, saws, box cutters, etc.)

       Chloe hands Mooney a cup of water and frantically looks
       around for the paramedics. Mooney starts rising to his feet.

                            CHLOE
                 You better lie still. The
                 paramedics should be here shortly.
       But Mooney's obstinate.   He rises despite her best efforts.



                                                                 106.

      And as he stumbles off--

194   INT. THE DORY ENTRANCE - NIGHT                                     194
      TOMLIN - By the time his eyes adjust to the dark, Ryan is
      nowhere to be seen. TARPS undulate over jumbles of boxes and
      equipment everywhere -- a hundred places to hide.
      Alone, Tomlin stalks among the equipment.     Gun out.   Hunting
      Ryan like a snake on the scent or prey.

                            TOMLIN
                 You're wounded kid, just give me
                 what I came for, and I'll let you
                 all go.
      Police sirens in the distance grow louder.
      Tomlin's offer goes unanswered.    That's when he notices the
      BLOOD on the ground. Tomlin smiles, following Ryan's trail
      to a PILE OF BLOOD-SMEARED TARPS -- where the trail ends!
      It's obvious Ryan used these to staunch his wound. Shit!
      He's gonna have to search this whole place--
      Then, suddenly, Tomlin gets an idea. He pulls out his phone,
      making sure it's concealed from view, and writes a TEXT
      MESSAGE to--

      Greer pulls out his ringing cell phone. On the text screen
      it says, "CALL HIM". Greer flashes an wicked grin, and dials
      the last number on his call log.

                                                  CUT TO:

      Tomlin's ready to pounce.
      SFX:   Nearby, Ryan's cellphone starts to RING, betraying him!
      Instantly, Tomlin hones in on the noise -- coming from under
      a bulky tarp along the far wall -- and EMPTIES HIS GUN at it!
      The tarp shreds. Nothing could survive the assault.
      Tomlin walks calmly across the room to stand before the tarp.

                            TOMLIN
                 Shoulda stayed at home this
                 morning, kid.
      And just then, Tomlin throws off the shredded tarp exposing--
      Ryan's cellphone.   And nothing else.



                                                              107 .

                Funny. I was about to say the same
                to you.

                             TOMLIN
                What the--
      And in the instant Tomlin realizes he's been tricked, he
      turns and--

      WHAM!


      RYAN HITS TOMLIN in the face with a 2x4, SMASHING his TEETH
      and sending him backwards. Before Tomlin has time to
      rec9ver, Ryan swings again. CRACK! -- And his KNEE CAP is
      obliterated. Ryan, looking like a psychotic Babe Ruth, gives
      Tomlin two more vicious WHACKS before grabbing his cellphone
      and high-tailing it out of there.

                    hold his location. Hodges, parking

         Just as Hodges reaches for the door handle -- Jessica wraps
         her cuffs around his throat, throws her legs against the back
         of his seat and pulls like her life depended on it.
         Hodges chokes, flails, digs, and claws at the cuffs, but his
         fingertips are no match for Jessica's muscular legs.

         Mooney looks to the roof of the carousel and sees Ellis.

      gun shot. He turns around only to find --
      A PISTOL pointed right at his face -- Greer's pistol.
      He PUSHES Ryan behind a SUV so as not to be seen by the cops.

                           GREEK
                No more bullshit!     Just give me the
                goddamn disc!
      Ryan slowly unzips his front jacket pocket and removes the

      DVD.
      Greer snatches it and SMASHES it to pieces. Fragments fall
      through the cracks in the pier, to the ocean below.
      Ryan, pale as ghost, knows he's seconds from meeting his
      maker.

                           GREER (CONT'D)
                This is about to be the most
                enjoyable part of an extremely
                shitty day.
      And just as he's about to pull the trigger --
      BLAM!! Jessica fires a WARNING SHOT. Greer( startled, spins
      around to see Jessica pointing Hodges' gun in his face.

                           JESSICA
                Tell me why I shouldn't kill you.
      For the first time, Greer actually looks frightened.
      Recognizing the homicidal look in her eyes, he SPUTTERS, but
      nothing comes out.
      Ryan, weak and pale with blood loss, looks up at his guardian
      angel.

                Jess... Jessica?     Don't.
      Jessica trembles with rage, a tear falls.

                           JESSICA
                I... I have to.

              Jessica looks behind her and sees Mooney, surrounded by EIGHT

              POLICE OFFICERS.

                         Ricky's safe. It's all going to be
                         okay. Put it down.
              Jessica slowly lowers the gun and looks into Ryan's face.

                                    JESSICA
                         Thank you for keeping your promise.
              As the cops move in and drag Greer to his feet, Ryan calls
              out to him.

                                   RYAN

                         to get a whole lot shittier.
              Ryan flips open his phone and on the SCREEN plays the
              SECURITY FOOTAGE of the murder in the parking lot. We see
              that Ryan must've copied the DVD with his videophone.

                        Ain't that a bitch?
              And through the tears, Jessica manages a laugh. A small one.
              But enough to let us know everything's going to be okay. And
              as we PULL BACK on the scene--

                a cane, but that's the worst of
                it... I'm just thankful.

      Ricky down the hall.

      A shared laugh, then as they turn to the television--

     CLOSE ON...   A BRONZE PLAQUE which reads, "PEARL STREET
     BRIDGE."

     ON THE BRIDGE... RAIN POURS DOWN. An SUV steers out of
     control and CRASHES into a STALLED OUT VEHICLE.

     It's quiet NOW, EXCEPT FOR THE INCESSANT pounding rain.    IN
     THE DISTANCE, police lights approach.

     FRENETIC. A HEAVY RAIN POURS DOWN on a MELEE OF ACTIVITY.

     POLICE CARS block either end, their LIGHTS ignite the sky in
     a dizzying RED and BLUE design. The attention centers on...

     The SUV and the CRASHED VEHICLE lay in the middle of the
     bridge. A MAN, 30's, madness on his face, his right hand
     holds a HOSTAGE, a woman, 20's, racked with fear, tight to
     his body. His left holds a GUN!

     Two DETECTIVES, slowly approach the Man.   ONLY SEE THE
     DETECTIVES FROM BEHIND.

     A News Reporter, KAREN CROSS, 30's, blond with energy to
     burn, shields herself from the rain, steps in front of the
     camera...

     A loft apartment, scarcely furnished, except for BOOKS,
     HUNDREDS OF THEM, fill stacks of shelves. Hearing but not
     watching the television, METICULOUSLY preparing a GIN AND
     TONIC, is...

     DETECTIVE QUENTIN CONNERS, a grizzled, intense veteran. His
     charisma, which he has in spades, gets him into as much

                After a two month investigation, Det.
                Jason York has been relieved of duty
                for his role in the Pearl Street Bridge
                shooting deaths of Lisa ReAnn and John
                Curtis. Key testimony against York
                came from Det. Bernard Callo, who was
                on scene that night. The Seattle
                Police Department is handing this case
                over to the King County District
                Attorney's office. Criminal charges
                are expected.

     The IMAGE cuts to an earlier interview with... CAPTAIN
     MARTIN JENKINS, 50's, chronically tired and unsympathetic.

                          JENKINS
                In a civilized society, the men and
                women entrusted with serving and
                protecting the community are to be held
                accountable just like everyone else.
                Simply put... Just because you are a
                cop, doesn't mean laws don't apply to
                you. This is no longer the wild, wild
                west.

                "not responsible" for the same

     stares at the photo, finishes his drink.

4    EXT.   SEATTLE - DAY - ESTABLISHING                               4

     A COOL, CRISP Pacific Northwestern day. MOUNT RAINIER looms
     in the distance. The SPACE NEEDLE overlooks downtown. While
     the sun shines now, the OVERCAST SKY on the horizon
     FORESHADOWS AN IMPENDING STORM. In the heart of the city...

5    EXT.   AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY                               5

     An IMPRESSIVE STRUCTURE on a BUSY CITY CORNER. TRAFFIC,
     street and pedestrian, go about their business.

     ACROSS THE STREET...   A BLACK TRUCK screeches to a stop.

     LORENZ, 40's, sits behind the steering wheel. His EYES cold,
     merciless. He's joined by FOUR OTHER MEN, ALL BLACK CLAD -
     HEAVILY ARMED with BODY ARMOR!

     Lorenz stares out at the bank, a last moment of peace.
     Simultaneously, ALL FOUR DOORS OPEN and...

7    EXT.   AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY                               7

     Lorenz and the Black Clad exit, quickly cross the street,
     heading for the bank! Each carries a LARGE BLACK BAG.

7A   INT.   LOBBY - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                             7A

     PATRONS in line, wait impatiently. A SECURITY GUARD in the
     corner yawns. TELLERS count out cash, access accounts on
     COMPUTERS.

     GRAINY SECURITY CAMERA IMAGES depict an average, business
     day. THE CALM BEFORE THE STORM.

     Lorenz and the Black Clad arrive at the doors.     They RAISE
     THEIR MASKS and...

8    INT.   LOBBY - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                             8

     Off the CROOKED EYEBROW of a BANK TELLER...

     AT THE FRONT DOORS--

     The BLACK CLAD STORM THE BANK! Four of the Black Clad move
     into position. Lorenz stands center stage. Gun in hand, he
     aims at the ceiling, PULLS the trigger... BAM! A GUNSHOT
     RINGS OUT!

                          LOREN
                Drop to the floor! Slowly! No sudden
                moves!
                    (to the Tellers)
                You! Hands on heads, drop to your
                knees. Now! Do it!

     PATRONS and TELLERS HIT THE GROUND, TERRIFIED!     Lorenz is in
     COMPLETE and UTTER CONTROL.

     BLACK CLAD #4 and #3 keep watch on the tellers behind the
     counters! One on one side, one on the other.

     BLACK CLAD #2 ushers people out of side offices, gun-points
     them into the lobby!

     BLACK CLAD #1 races upstairs, gathers people from the 2nd
     level, forces them downstairs.

     From the corner of Lorenz's eye...      The SECURITY GUARD's hand
     creeps toward his gun.

                          LORENZ
                That... you don't want to do.

     The Security Guard reluctantly obeys. BLACK CLAD #1 DISARMS
     the Guard, then GUN BUTTS HIM over the head! The Guard
     drops, unconscious! CUSTOMERS, EMPLOYEES scream out.

     Black Clad #1 rips keys from the Guard's belt, tosses them to
     Black Clad #2!

                           LORENZ
                Y'all picked the wrong day not to use
                the ATM.

                 take your chances if you choose not to
                 listen.

      BLACK CLAD #2, keys in hand, flies across the counter,
      carrying a large duffel bag... Heading to the vaults!

                           LORENZ
                 No one will say I didn't give you a
                 choice.

      Black Clad #2 arrives, drops his bag, unzipping...

10    INT.   THE LOBBY - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                       10

      Lorenz gets the message, finds THE BANK MANAGER cowering
      behind his desk.

                           LORENZ
                 You, up.
                     (the Bank Manager obeys)
                 You understood what I just said?

                              BANK MANAGER
                 Yes.

                           LORENZ
                 Your security system, you can
                 electronically lock all entrances...

                            BANK MANAGER
                 Yes.   Right-right away.

                           LORENZ
                 With that attitude, you and I are going
                 to get along famously. Now go.

      The Bank Manager nods nervously.

      BLACK CLAD #4 holds open his bag. He strides by the
      CUSTOMERS who deposit CELLPHONES, PAGERS, inside.

10A   INT.   BANK MANAGER'S OFFICE                                10A

      The Bank Manager taps on his computer keyboard.

      BLACK CLAD #1 flips the "BANK CLOSED" sign around.

11    INT.   MOTEL BEDROOM - DAY                                       11

      Jenkins fastens his cufflinks.   In the bed behind him...

      HEATHER "TEDDY" GALLOWAY, 30's, normally a force to reckon
      with, appears vulnerable with only a sheet wrapped around
      her.

                           JENKINS
                 Have you seen my watch?

      Teddy gestures to the night stand. Jenkins retrieves the
      watch. He also slides his WEDDING RING back on. This ain't
      love, this is a relationship of convenience.

      Jenkins slips on his jacket, secures his tie and, after one
      last check in the mirror...

                           JENKINS
                 This was fun. You should get out of
                 bed. You'll be late for work.

      And with that, Jenkins exits. Teddy waits for the door to
      close, then collapses back onto the bed.

12    INT.   SAFETY DEPOSIT VAULT - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK             12

      PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES line the walls, connect all the safety

      the detonation device and...

      He FLIPS A SWITCH and... KA-BOOM!    AN EXPLOSION RIPS THROUGH
      THE VAULT!

13    INT.   LOBBY - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                            13

      A PILLOW OF SMOKE BLOWS into the lobby! Lorenz stands
      UNFLINCHING. The explosion was expected.

      BEHIND THE CUSTOMER SERVICE WINDOWS--

      An EAGER TELLER, 30's, seizes the moment.    He reaches up and
      PRESSES THE SILENT ALARM BUTTON!

      BLACK CLAD #4 turns just in time to see it, quickly FIRES his
      weapon! The Eager Teller slumps against the wall, BLEEDS
      profusely from his neck, not dead yet.

      Lorenz hustles over to Black Clad #4.

                           LORENZ
                 What do you think you're doing?

                           BLACK CLAD #4
                 Fucker pushed the alarm.

      Lorenz GLARES DISGUSTEDLY at his accomplice.

                            LORENZ
                 It would've made more sense to shoot
                 him before he pushes the fucking alarm.
                 Not after.
                     (looks at the Eager Teller)
                 Jesus.

      Lorenz levels, very calmly, his weapon at the Eager Teller's
      head and...

                           LORENZ
                 And... If you're going to do something.
                     (FIRES his weapon!)
                 Do it right.

      The Eager's Teller's body keels over, dead.    Lorenz checks
      his watch... 9:26 a.m.

                           LORENZ
                     (into microphone)
                 Alarm's tripped. We're on a clock.

      There's not enough soap on the planet for Teddy to feel
      clean. Doubt and fear present on her face. She turns off
      the water, and steps out... when she does HER PAGER, off
      screen, chimes!

      DETECTIVE BERNIE CALLO, 40's, a stern, by-the-book cop. Not

     BRENDAN DAX, 30's, the techno-wizard, with headphones on,

     Conners wears a T-shirt and some sweats, opens his
     refrigerator, grabs a bottle of water. When he closes the

     Conners crosses, opens the door for Jenkins and DETECTIVE
     SHANE DEKKER, late-20s. Dekker's all business when it comes
     to being a cop. Green, but eager to prove himself. After a

          There's where your shit out of luck
          because I don't need to speak to you.

                    JENKINS
          It's important.

Conners and Jenkins trade serious stares. Conners finally
relents. Jenkins and Dekker enter. Dekker notices - THE
STACKS AND STACKS OF BOOKS.

                    JENKINS
          Quentin, this is Detective Shane Dekker.

          Huh? You don't look like much of a
          Detective.

                     DEKKER
          Funny. I was going to say the same

          Save your breath. I really don't care.

Before Jenkins can respond, from the bedroom, a TALL, BLOND
WOMAN, 20s, emerges, COMPLETELY NUDE.

The men WATCH as the Woman, PAYING THEM NO ATTENTION,
retrieves a bottle of water from the fridge, then returns to
the bedroom. No words spoken at all. After the moment has
passed...

                    CONNERS
          Why don't we can the chit-chat.    Get to
          what's on your mind.

                    JENKINS
          We've got a hostage situation, American
          National Bank. The sonsabitches said
          they wouldn't talk to anyone but you.

                      CONNERS
          No shit?

                     JENKINS
          No shit.   I need you to do this.

                    CONNERS
          Why should I?

                    DEKKER
          Because people's lives are at stake.
          That takes priority over your ego.

                    CONNERS
              (to Jenkins; re: Dekker)
          You may want to put a leash on him.
              (beat; thinks)
          Saying I did want to help... I'm still
          suspended or did that slip your mind?

                    JENKINS
          The commissioner's office has ordered
          me to reinstate you. As of now, you're
          back on the force.

                    CONNERS
          Just like that?

                     JENKINS
          Just like that.
              (beat)
          I won't, however, unleash you alone.

                    CONNERS
          Always a catch.

                    JENKINS
          Shane, here, is your new partner.
          Consider him a younger version of me,
          looking over your shoulder, watching
          every move you make.

The idea of a new partner doesn't sit well with Conners.

                    JENKINS
          Don't think I endorse this. If it were
          my call, you'd be with your partner...

                    CONNERS
          You mean ex-partner.

                    JENKINS
          ... On the unemployment line with him.

     A SWAT TRUCK pulls up, the BACK DOORS FLY OPEN!     SWAT exit in
     a flurry, race into position.

     Amidst the commotion... JENKINS' CAR navigates the scene,
     stops next to... KAREN CROSS immediately recognizes Conners,
     orders her CAMERAMAN to center on him.

     Conners, Dekker and Jenkins climb out of the car, head
     towards the crime scene, when...

                Detective Conners? Detective, can we
                have a few words?

Conners, Dekker and Jenkins arrive, FIND Teddy, her hair
still wet, with her partner, DET. VINCENT DURANO, 40's, a
middle of the road, never out on a limb type cop.

Callo looks on, the RAGE boiling inside of him.

                    CONNERS
          Teddy, Vincent...
              (completely ignores Callo)
          ... Nice to see you both.

                    JENKINS
          Conners has been reinstated to full
          active duty. It's his scene.

This info comes as a surprise.   Especially to Callo.

                    CALLO
          The last hostage situation this guy
          headed, an innocent civilian died.

                    CONNERS
          I was not responsible...

                    CALLO
          You never are. That girl would be
          alive today if it weren't for your
          cowboy antics. You destroy lives.

                    CONNERS
          Fuck you. Look who's talking about
          destroying lives.

                    JENKINS
          Decision's been made, Bernie.

                    CALLO
          I was first on scene and I have seniority.
              (pleads)
          Don't do this, Martin.

                    JENKINS
          We'll talk about it later.   Take a hike.

                     CALLO
              (beat)
          Fine. I'll watch this train wreck from
          home.

Callo exits.

                    CONNERS
              (sarcastic)
          I'm going to miss him.

                SWAT, because of the special
                circumstances will defer to Conners.
                He's in charge.

                          VINCENT
                First time I've heard SWAT defer to
                anyone.

                          JENKINS
                    (pulls aside Conners)
                Second chances don't come around often.
                Don't blow it.

     Jenkins skeptically eyes Conners before stepping away.     He
     motions for Dekker to walk with him.

                          JENKINS
                Anything questionable happens today,
                you let me know.

                          DEKKER
                Yes, Captain.

     Out of earshot, Conners watches Dekker and Jenkins.

                          TEDDY
                Looks like you got yourself a baby-
                sitter.

     Conners glares at Teddy out the corner of his eye, then
     dismisses the comment.

     More SPECTATORS, more MEDIA.

     Conners, Dekker, Teddy and Vincent hover behind the first
     barricade. Conners unwraps gum, sticks it in his mouth.

                          VINCENT
                We have approximately four to seven,
                heavily armed men holding an
                unspecified number of customers and

29   EXT.   AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY                             29

     Conners and company gather outside of the Police Tech Van.
     Dekker pulls a pad and a pen, prepares to take notes.

     Dax sits, headphones donned, records the entire conversation.

                          CONNERS
                Who am I speaking with?

     Dekker writes, "Lorenz."

                          CONNERS
                Okay, Lorenz, how are we doing in there?
                Can we get you anything? Food, medical
                supplies. We heard an explosion.

                          LORENZ
                Everyone who matters is fine. Of course,
                I would've preferred not having the
                authorities involved at all. We weren't
                planning to be here this long. But, since
                Seattle's finest needs a presence on the
                scene, I'm glad it's you.

          My fame proceeds me.

                     LORENZ
          Don't be flattered. I needed someone
          who's been through the experience
          before. Hopefully this time it will go
          better for all involved. I plan on
          living a full, long and rich life. I
          didn't, however, expect them to find
          you so quickly. I thought you were
          suspended.

Dekker writes, "In The Know," on his pad.

                    CONNERS
          I was, but I'm back.   You're
          information's old.

                    LORENZ
          You never get what you pay for.
              (back to business)
          You want to know about the hostages?
          How many and are they okay?

Dekker scribbles, "Pro".

                    CONNERS
          Yes.

                     LORENZ
          Approximately forty, they're fine,
          considering. All except one. We had a
          situation.

                    CONNERS
          Someone's dead?

                    LORENZ
          Theory... put to practice isn't always
          perfect. Can't expect to keep the
          hostages in check if a bad deed goes
          unpunished or they may... randomly
          decide to revolt. Chaos... has some
          order to it.
              (Conners drifts in thought)
          Detective? Are you still with me?

Teddy SNAPS her fingers. That gets Conners attention.
There's a new intensity to his demeanor.

                    CONNERS
          What else will I be looking for?

                for you and your colleagues to pack up
                and go home?

                Safe to say.

                          LORENZ
                Stay by the phone.    I'll contact you
                shortly.

                Don't worry, I have no plans until
                sunrise tomorrow, so hunker down. It's
                going to be a long one.

                Wait, we're talking here...

                          LORENZ
                Patience, Detective. We don't want
                another Pearl Street Bridge, do we?

     Conners's thrown by the mention of Pearl Street Bridge.
     Lorenz abruptly HANGS UP.

                            DAX
                He's off.

                    DAX
          Fifteen rings.    No answer.

                    CONNERS
          Try again in five.

                    TEDDY
          What are they doing in there?

                    VINCENT
          Wasting our time.

Time. The word rings in Conners's head.     He starts to put it
together.

                    CONNERS
          Precisely. He knows police protocol,
          not to mention the shit in our own
          precinct. He's disguising his voice,
          means he's got a record and has done
          this before. He's heavily armed and
          well-connected. He knows he's
          surrounded. He hasn't asked for a
          damned thing. He drops that hint about
          sunrise, prepping us for a long wait.
          He's buying time. Why?

                    VINCENT
              (brainstorming)
          To figure out his next move.    He wasn't
          expecting us.

                    DEKKER
          No, he wasn't expecting you. He said,
          he thought you were still suspended.

                    CONNERS
          Probably thought it would take the
          whole day for you to find me. Giving
          him the time he needs.

                    TEDDY
          He's stalling.

                    DEKKER
          He almost has what he came for.

Conners nods, eyes Dekker as if for the first time.

                    CONNERS
          Or... he's got what he came for and he's
          waiting for his ticket out of here.
              (the decision)
          We're going in.

                    TEDDY
          What?

                     CONNERS
          The bank has three points of entry.
          Teddy and Vincent, take a SWAT Team,
          head to the West side. We'll have the
          SWAT Commander take the East. Dekker,
          you're with me. Where is the SWAT
          Commander?

                    VINCENT
          I'll find him.

Vincent leaves Conners with Dekker and Teddy.

                    TEDDY
              (to Conners; concern)
          That's a big call, Quentin.   Thought
          about what you're doing?

                    CONNERS
          You questioning me, Teddy?

                    TEDDY
          Unfortunately... yeah.

                    CONNERS
          I question how you can fuck that
          asshole and still manage to look in the
          mirror.

                    TEDDY
          I'm not going to get into this now.
          And you're one to talk. I hear...

                    CONNERS
              (interrupting)
          The hostages are in imminent danger.
          They've confessed to killing someone, an
          automatic murder one charge - that's a
          life sentence, maybe a needle for all of
          them. So why keep witnesses around to
          testify? Longer we wait, the greater the
          risk. We need to go in. Now.

                          TEDDY
                    (beat; then relents)
                Okay.

     Even Dekker seems to agree with that theory. Vincent arrives
     with the SWAT COMMANDER, 40's, a former Navy SEAL with a
     "Don't FUCK with me" attitude.

                          SWAT COMMANDER
                I got snipers up top and ten soldiers
                on the ground.

                          CONNERS
                What's the best way in?

                          SWAT COMMANDER
                Tear gas, blow the doors...

                           CONNERS
                Hold on. No explosives. I got forty
                civilians in there, too great a chance.    Any
                other way?

                          SWAT COMMANDER
                There's no pussy way in. The doors are
                locked electronically from the inside.
                We ain't getting in without force.

                          CONNERS
                    (beat; thinks)
                What if we cut the power? That will
                disable the system and we can open the
                locks manually, come in that way?

                          SWAT COMMANDER
                    (thinks; concedes)
                That'll work.

                          CONNERS
                So we'll take the pussy way, Commander.
                We cut the power and go in at 11:15
                sharp!

                                                          TIME CUT TO:

     SNIPERS ON ROOFTOPS ready their weapons.    SWAT TEAM moves
     into position, cover all bank entrances.

     AT THE TECH VAN--

     Conners and Dekker slip into bulletproof vests.     Teddy,
     Vincent and the SWAT Commander arrive.

                  The bank's equipped with emergency
                  generators, which once the power's
                  down, will kick back on in
                  approximately 3-6 minutes.

                            CONNERS
                  It will be over before that.
                  Commander, your men in position?

                            SWAT COMMANDER
                  Standing by.

                            CONNERS
                  I will call for the power to be cut.
                  Once down, wait for my signal and
                  enter. No one moves until I give the
                  "go", understood?

       They all nod.    They're ready.

                            CONNERS
                  You have done this before, right?
                  Wait... I don't want to know.

33     INT.   SIDE OFFICES - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                    33

       VARIOUS SHOTS of HOSTAGES. It's quiet, until... Black Clad
       #1 and #4 burst, grab TWO RANDOM HOSTAGES, drag them out!
       They put up some fight, but quickly concede.

       The hostages sit shaking, crying...    Scared beyond belief.

     Instantly...   EVERYTHING BLACKS OUT!   LIGHTS, COMPUTERS, etc.

     THE HOSTAGES grab each other TIGHTLY.   PANIC evident.   Lorenz
     and the Black Clad calmly react.

      Black Clad #3 FLIPS A SWITCH. Suddenly, a canister attached
      to the pulleys race up the ropes! The HOSTAGES have their
      feet yanked out from under them, then shoot INTO THE AIR!

      They SMASH THROUGH A GLASS HANDRAIL ON THE SECOND FLOOR,
      then...

45B   EXT.   MAIN ENTRANCE - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY             45B

                    (to the first group)
                Round up all the hostages, anyone that
                comes out, grab'em!

     Conners glares at Dekker.

                          CONNERS
                    (to the second)
                The rest of you, come with us.

     The OFFICERS rush to protect the HOSTAGES, pull them to
     safety. CAMERA CREWS and REPORTERS pounce on the
     opportunity.

     Conners and Dekker lead the charge inside, guns drawn.

51   INT.   LOBBY - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                              51

     EMERGENCY LIGHTS BURN! GLASS CRACKLES UNDER FOOT as Conners,
     Dekker and the Officers move through. Caution with each
     step.

     The lobby's clear.   Conners pulls the Officers close.

                    (whispers; to Dekker)
                We split up.

                You two with him. You two with me.
                    (to Dekker)
                Check the back.

     Dekker nods, leads his group away.      Conner proceeds...

52   BEHIND THE COUNTERS--                                              52

     Nothing. Conners spots a DOOR in the back marked, "Bank

     Dekker checks it out, but it's empty. The remnants of the

      CHEST. His Gun up and ready. Suddenly...

      A NOISE up ahead... He bares down, takes a DEEP BREATH,
      carefully proceeds until... Teddy and Vincent emerge. Teddy
      EXHALES, lowers her weapon. So does Dekker.

      The SWAT COMMANDER approaches holding a couple of the BLACK
      MASKS, some BLACK BODY ARMOR.

                           SWAT COMMANDER
                 Detectives... We found these.

      Conners takes one of the masks in his hands.

                           CONNERS
                 We let them walk right past us.

      Dekker, Teddy, the SWAT Commander, Officers, Vincent and the
      SWAT Team stand in the middle of the lobby, STUNNED.
      Conners, his anger SIMMERS TO A BOIL, until finally...

                            CONNERS
                 SHIT!

                                                         TIME CUT TO:

56    EXT.   AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - 11:48 AM - DAY                 56

      An OFFICER unfurls a FRESH ROLL of "POLICE: CAUTION" TAPE
      around the scene. Still mayhem, but gradually coming under
      control.

      Police interview HOSTAGES, so do REPORTERS. PARAMEDICS
      administer oxygen. Two CORONERS load the EAGER TELLER's body
      into their truck.

57   INT.   LOBBY - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                         57

     Vincent, covered in debris, confers with Conners.

                          VINCENT
                We got the one Teller dead, the two
                that were strung up are alive, but in
                critical condition. A few SWAT
                incurred 2nd degree burns, but that's
                the worst of it. Now, depending on who
                you talk to... there was anywhere from
                five to nine perps. And nobody got a
                good look at any of'em, wore their
                masks the whole time. Dax is rounding
                up the security tapes now. That should
                give us a firm number.

                          CONNERS
                I want background checks on every
                hostage. They're all suspects until
                they're not.

                          VINCENT
                You don't think one of them's still
                here?

                          CONNERS
                After this, nothing would surprise me.

58   EXT.   TECH VAN - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY                58

     Dax pulls cables, power cords, etc., getting set to go inside
     with them. Dekker approaches.

                          DEKKER
                Excuse me... I need to listen to the
                conversation between Lorenz and Conners
                again?

                          DAX
                It'll have to wait.

                            DEKKER
                How long?

                           DAX
                Hour.   Maybe more.

                          DEKKER

                Show me how to play it myself?

                          DAX
                Look, this isn't how it works. I don't
                take orders from you. I don't know you
                and NO ONE touches my stuff. You're
                going to have to wait.

     Dax gets his shit, starts to go. Dekker waits, then proceeds
     into the van. Dax turns, notices.

59   INT.   TECH VAN                                              59

     Dekker inspects the equipment, when...

                          DAX
                What the hell are you doing?

                          DEKKER
                Along with whatever they stole and this
                war zone they left behind... A man's
                dead, and the killers are running free.
                I don't have time to wait.
                    (looks at the equipment)
                I'll figure it out. Thanks for your
                help.

                Here. This DAT machine. Play, stop,
                rewind... It's just like using a tape
                player. Headphones are jacked in.
                Tape's already inside.

                Thank you.

60   EXT.   AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY                          60

     A CAR PULLS UP... Jenkins steps out. Stares out over the
     scene, the mess. He's a volcano ready to erupt.

61   INT.   SECURITY ROOM - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                61

     A SERIES OF EIGHT BLACK AND WHITE VIDEO MONITORS... as we
     rewind. SEVEN of the eight show recorded images of the bank.
     The eighth shows only STATIC. Dax sits in front of the
     monitors. Conners stands nearby.

                          CONNERS
                    (re: the eighth monitor)
                What's with this one?

                          DAX
                That's the camera in the vault.      It
                blew in the first explosion.

      SHOOTING SCRIPT                  MARCH 15, 2004          30.


     The SEVEN DIFFERENT MONITORS all begin in sync.

     ON SCREEN... TIMECODE burns in the corner. The HOSTAGES are
     dragged across the LOBBY, where the Black Clads hook them up
     to the pulleys. The Black Clads get into position.

     Conners CAREFULLY scrutinizes the images.

     ON SCREEN... THE TIMECODE CLOCK:    Hits "11:15:00 AM" and...
     STATIC FILLS THE SCREENS!

                          DAX
                That's when you cut the power.

                          CONNERS
                So we can't ID them.

                          DAX
                There's a four minute, fifty-two second
                gap, before the image returns. But...

                          CONNERS
                They're long gone by then.
                    (beat; thinks)
                Go to the head of the tapes, from when
                they first went in. Document each move
                they've made for the two hours they
                were inside.

                          DAX
                You got it. Hey... Awful lotta news
                cameras outside. Maybe one got a look
                at them coming out?

                          CONNERS
                    (good idea)
                Have Vincent check it out.

     Teddy enters...

     Dekker listens through HEADPHONES makes notes as he goes.

                          CONNERS (VO)
                    (beat; stern)
                What does that mean?

                          LORENZ (VO)
                Theory... put to practice isn't always
                perfect. Can't expect to keep the

                unpunished or they may... randomly
                decide to revolt. Chaos... has some
                order to it.

     Dekker, hits STOP, then REWIND.     He checks his...

     IN HIS NOTEBOOK--

     Several words and phrases fill the page. "Lorenz, sunrise,
     Pro Theory, 40 hostages, Theory, Randomly Revolt, and Chaos."

     DEKKER studies the words intently, figuring something out.
     He presses PLAY on the DAT machine.

                          LORENZ (VO)

     Dekker presses STOP. Dekker finds a pattern, circles the
     words, "Lorenz, Chaos, Theory."

     Conners, Jenkins and Teddy converse with AGENT VICTOR DOYLE,
     40's, and the BANK MANAGER still a bit rattled.

                          AGENT DOYLE
                Prince Amar Alle Alban is one of the
                wealthiest and least popular Arabs in

                countless threats on his life and
                fortune in the past. But for better of
                worse... he is an ally to the United
                States. The Prince keeps a safe
                deposit box in twenty institutions

                    AGENT DOYLE (cont'd)
          across the country. Along with this
          bank, he also had a box at Eastern
          Federal Savings in Charlotte, North
          Carolina, which was hit last month.
          Same M.O.

                    TEDDY
          What was in the box?

                    BANK MANAGER
          We don't keep records. The boxes are
          private. Since 9/11, we screen for
          live tissue, viruses or explosives, but
          if it passes those tests, we don't ask.

                    CONNERS
          This is all real fascinating shit, but
          what about the money? Bank robbers
          still like cash, don't they?

                    BANK MANAGER
          The cash drawers don't appear touched.
          Neither does the cash vault.

                    TEDDY
          So they broke into a bank and didn't
          steal any money?

Odd glances all about.

                    AGENT DOYLE
          We believe the Prince's box was the
          target. We're trying to reach him now.

                       JENKINS
          Thank you.

Agent Doyle and the Bank Manager leave.

                     JENKINS
          Helluva come back, Conners. Are you
          familiar with the term franchise-sized

          Depends, are we talking about your sex
          life? Because I've heard shortcomings.

                    JENKINS

                 That's not fair. It was by the book.
                 Everything was according to standard
                 procedure.

      Jenkins ignores Teddy.

                           CONNERS
                 You came to me. I didn't ask for this.

                           JENKINS
                 Commissioner's office is scrambling to
                 cover their ass. They need a
                 scapegoat... And I have zero problems
                 serving you up.

                           CONNERS
                 You wanted this to happen.

                           JENKINS
                 No. But if it had to happen to
                 somebody.

      Jenkins exits.

                 I think this Lorenz was trying to tell
                 us something.

                           CONNERS
                 You don't say.

                           DEKKER
                 The way he spoke... he paused before
                 certain words. Have you ever heard of
                 the Chaos Theory?

                            CONNERS
                 What?

      AT A BOOTH--

      Empty plates and crumpled napkins litter the table. Conners
      finishes a cup of coffee, enjoys a slice of pie. Dekker, all
      about work, goes over his notes.

 SHOOTING SCRIPT                MARCH 15, 2004             34.


                    DEKKER
          Edward Lorenz invented the Chaos Theory
          in the 1960's. It's the study of
          phenomena that appear random, but in
          fact have an element of regularity
          which can be described mathematically.

                    CONNERS
              (confused)
          Try that again?

                    DEKKER
          Pretty much... initial state of events
          may seem unrelated and random, but
          eventually patterns emerge and in the
          end all the pieces fit together.

The Waitress refills Conners' coffee, lays down the check.

                    WAITRESS
          Anything else, officers?

                    CONNERS
          That'll be all.
              (to Dekker)
          You're a College boy. Which one?
          Someplace I've heard of or one of those
          inbred state schools no one's heard of?

                    DEKKER
          U Dub.

                    CONNERS
          Not exactly Princeton, but not bad.
          How did you end up on the force?

                    DEKKER
          It's kind of the family business.

                    CONNERS
          Family business? What, your Dad, Dad's
          Dad and so on and so back?

Dekker squirms when it comes to revealing personal info.

                    DEKKER
          Do we really need all this "get to know
          you" crap? Couple hours ago you didn't
          give a shit.

                    CONNERS

          I know about you, Detective.      Everyone
          does.

                    CONNERS
          You don't say that with much
          enthusiasm.

                    DEKKER
          Not much to be enthusiastic about.

Conners reaches his limit.      Time to put him in place.

                    CONNERS
          Listen, my reputation often proceeds me.
          You, however, have no reputation; a fact I
          need to deal with. After you've been
          through the shit I have, then you can judge

                    VINCENT (VO)
          Got something you'll want to see.

Conners drops a TEN DOLLAR BILL on the table.

                    CONNERS
          Lastly... I don't like the Pac-10.
          It's overrated. I'm an Ivy League guy.

Conners gets up, heads for the door.

Dekker, humbled, scoops up Conners's ten, puts it in his
wallet and drops a twenty down on the table, slides out of
the booth.

66    EXT.   AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY                              66

      Conners, Dekker and Teddy approach a NEWS TRUCK. Vincent
      stands with Karen Cross and her CAMERAMAN who sports TWO
      BLACK EYES AND A BLOODY NOSE.

                           KAREN CROSS
                     (to Conners; w/ a smile)
                 Detective... Can't keep away from me,
                 can you?

      Conners ignores her, but Dekker doesn't.   He gives her the
      ONCE OVER. She notices, smiles.

                            VINCENT
                 Watch.

      He points to a monitor in the van, presses PLAY.

66A   ON SCREEN--                                                   66A

      HANDHELD IMAGES of the POST BANK MELEE. HOSTAGES scatter in
      all directions. COPS race into the bank.

      A SHAGGY BROWN HAIRED MAN, 40's, with a MOUSTACHE and an
      ANGRY EXPRESSION, CHARGES TOWARDS THE CAMERA and BARRELS OVER
      IT! KNOCKS the Camera and the Cameraman DOWN!

                           CONNERS
                     (to the Cameraman)
                 Well, that explains you.

                     (to Karen)
                 Rewind it a little bit.
                     (She does, until...)
                 Okay. There. Stop.

                Got an address?

                          VINCENT
                Only thing on file is in Spokane, but I
                recall he did have a girlfriend in
                town. Gina, I believe.

67   EXT.   BIKER BAR - LOWER CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD - 1:13 PM - DAY        67

     The streets are quiet. A ROW OF HARLEY DAVIDSONS park in
     front. Above the bar, a small, lower class apartment
     complex.

68   INT.   HALLWAY - LOWER CLASS APARTMENT                             68

     TWO POLICE OFFICERS along with Conners, Dekker, Teddy and
     VINCENT position themselves by the APARTMENT. Vincent knocks
     his fist on the door...

                          VINCENT
                Gina, it's the police.    Open up.

     There's no response.   But SOUNDS can be heard on the opposite
     side of the door.

                          VINCENT
                    (Pounds louder)
                We can hear you.

     Again no response.   It's quiet.    Too quiet.

                          CONNERS
                    (to Vincent; low)
                Step back. Clear the door.     Now.

     Just as Vincent does...

     BAM! A GUNSHOT BLOWS APART THE DOOR!     Fired from the inside
     of the apartment!

     BAM! BAM! BAM! The BLASTS KEEP COMING!          Everyone's pinned
     down, on the defensive.

     A WOMAN SCREAMS FROM INSIDE THE APARTMENT!

     Dekker gathers himself together.

     Conners TURNS INTO THE OPEN DOORWAY, FIRES A FULL CLIP INTO
     THE APARTMENT!

      Conners reloads.     Everything's quiet.   Conners looks...

69    IN THE APARTMENT--                                                  69

      A THIN LAYER OF SMOKE hovers.     But that's all.    Nobody in
      sight.

70    IN THE APARTMENT HALLWAY--                                          70

      Conners steps inside, just as he reaches the living room...

      BAM!   ANOTHER BLAST!    This one FROM THE BEDROOM!

      Conners DROPS TO THE FLOOR, falls back into the kitchen!

                              TEDDY
                 QUENTIN!

      Dekker enters the apartment.

      Dekker passes the kitchen door, looks in on Conners.

                              DEKKER
                 You hit?

                           CONNERS
                     (in pain)
                 I'm fine.

      OFF SCREEN: A Window BREAKS...      from the bedroom.   Dekker
      heads that way.

71    IN THE BEDROOM/LIVING ROOM                                          71

                 FREEZE!

      But Richards doesn't.     He FIRES another shotgun BLAST!

      Dekker DUCKS BACK into the living room. He aims his gun into
      the bedroom without looking... RAPID FIRES!

      Richards scrambles out.

71B   INT.    BEDROOM/ LIVING ROOM - LOWER CLASS APARTMENT            71B

      Dekker looks inside the bedroom, doesn't see Richards.     He
      takes one step inside when...

      GINA, 20's, Latino, wearing only a pair of red panties with
      NO BRA, runs up behind Dekker and JUMPS ON HIS BACK, FISTS
      FLYING!

      Dekker pushes her down, aims his gun at her.

                               DEKKER
                  Stay down!

      Vincent enters, grabs Gina.

                            DEKKER
                  Control her!

      He does.    Dekker runs to the bedroom window, peeks out
      over...

      DEKKER hops onto the fire escape, hoofs down the iron stairs.

      Richards... drops to the pavement.      Heads for the street.

      DEKKER, a flight from the bottom, realizes his disadvantage
      and HURLS himself over the rail! Hits the ground HARD,
      WIPES OUT!

      Jumps up, shaking it off.    STAYS IN PURSUIT!

77    EXT.   BIKER BAR - LOWER CLASS APARTMENT - DAY                       77

      Dekker races around the corner...    A FORD F-350 SPINS the
      corner. Targeting DEKKER!

      Dekker jerks out his Glock.    FIRES!

      BULLETS RICOCHET OFF THE GRILL, SPARKS FLY! Windshield
      spiderwebs. But this train ain't slowing down.

      The F-350 swerves, clips a Harley.

      Dekker JUMPS before impact, bounces off the hood and rolls
      away.

      The truck hits the street, speeds away.

      Dekker, grimacing through the pain, scrapes himself off the
      pavement. Dekker's eyes dance... spot THE HARLEYS.

                            DEKKER
                  I'm a police officer in pursuit of a
                  murder suspect. I need your bike, now!

                      (beat; tosses the keys)
                  It's all yours.

      Dekker picks up the bike, hops on.      Fires up the engine.

      Richards' Truck speeds around a SLOW MOVING VEHICLE and whips
      into an alley.

      The Slow Vehicle skids to a stop! Dekker's hog, cuts inside,
      between the vehicle and the sidewalk, rips into the alley.

78A   I/E    HARLEY-RICHARDS' TRUCK/ ALLEY #1 - DAY                    78A

      Richards fishtails down the alley. Barely maintaining
      control. GARBAGE DUMPSTERS are littered about creating an
      obstacle course. Dekker pursues.

      Richards barrels out of the alley, through the intersection
      and into another alley. Opposing traffic skids out. ANGRY
      DRIVERS let him have it.

      Dekker skids sideways, steers around the blockage.     Catches
      sight of...

      DOWN THE BLOCK...   A PATROL CAR speeds down Hastings Street.

      Dekker revs the engine, maneuvers around the ANGRY DRIVERS
      and follows Richards into the SECOND ALLEY!

78C   I/E   PATROL CAR/ HASTINGS STREET - DAY                       78C

      Conners, behind the wheel, speeds towards the scene.

78D   I/E   HARLEY-RICHARDS'S TRUCK/ ALLEY #2 - DAY                 78D

      Richards races, checks the rearview mirror...      Dekker's Hog
      closing in.

      UP AHEAD...   The alley exits onto RICHARDS STREET.

      Richards approaches the mouth of the alley, just as A STREET
      CLEANER appears, starts to block the exit.

      Richards STAMPS ON THE ACCELERATOR, speeds through the small
      opening, just past the Street Cleaner!

      Dekker's not so lucky. Sees the Street Cleaner too late...
      Lays out the hog and rolls just as... The Hog slides into
      the Street Cleaner!

78E   I/E   RICHARDS' TRUCK/ STREET INTERSECTION/ PATROL CAR - DAY 78E

      Dekker gets up, looks down the street, SEES...

      Richards getting away, speeds down the street, through
      another intersection, when...

      CRASH! Conners, in a patrol car, plows into the rear of the
      truck, spinning it around.

      Dekker races towards the crash site.

      Conners climbs out of the car.

      Richards shakes his head, clearing it. Blood squirts from
      his mouth. He sees, through the windshield, Conners coming
      for him. He scrambles for his handgun, looks up to see
      Conners, but he's not there. Richards turns as...

      Conners appears in the Driver's side window, grabs the back
      of Richards' head and SLAMS it into the steering wheel!
      Again!

      Conners reaches inside, grabs the handgun.   As Dekker
      arrives...

                           RICHARDS
                 I want... my... lawyer.

      His last words before PASSING OUT.

      Dekker smirks.

79B   INT.   LIVING ROOM - LOWER CLASS APARTMENT                   79B

      A PARAMEDIC, 30's, checks Conners out.    Teddy concludes her
      cellphone conversation.

                     (to Conners; re: Richards)
                 He's unconscious, with a nice knot on
                 his forehead, but stable. Three
                 officers are watching the room.

                           CONNERS
                 He wakes, they call.

          I'm fine.

Conners and Teddy share a look, when...   Dekker enters.

          Girl's name is Gina Lopez, twenty-
          eight. Done some time for possession,

          No.

Teddy exits.

                    DEKKER
          Gina claims she doesn't know anything
          about a bank robbery.

                    CONNERS
          Of course she doesn't.   Vincent!

Vincent trudges out of the kitchen.

          Have'em put Ms. Lopez in interrogation
          one and turn the A/C on full. Leave

          Will do.
              (To Dekker)
          Detective... I didn't realize when we
          first met who you were. I worked with
          your father. It was only for a brief
          time when I first got outta the
          academy, but it was an honor.

                    CONNERS

          Your father was Harry Dekker?

          I wish it could've been for longer.

          Thanks.

Vincent exits. Conners looks at Dekker in a new light.
Dekker starts away, until...

               Marnie, you're looking well.

                         MARNIE
               Heard you were back, Conners... and
               keep dreaming.

     Marnie gives DEKKER an amorous glance, which he returns.

                          MARNIE
                    (to Dekker)
               You, on the other hand... I gotta bike
               myself. Maybe we can go for a ride
               sometime? Or maybe I can just ride
               you.

     Conners looks at both of them.

                         CONNERS
               Can we get back to work?

                         MARNIE
               We got passports, sun tan lotion,
               Bermuda shorts, thong bikini, hopefully
               hers and this...

She opens a LARGE DUFFEL BAG. Conners and Dekker look inside
the bag... It's FULL OF CASH! All denominations.

                    DEKKER
          Must be a fifty large there easy.    His
          cut?

                    MARNIE
          You'd think, right?

                      DEKKER
          It's not?

                    MARNIE
          Don't put words in my mouth, but...
          Two things jump out here. First, each
          bank branch has their own money bands.
          This is not American National's. After
          a little checking, it belongs to
          Pacific Savings of Seattle.

                    DEKKER
          That sounds familiar.

                    MARNIE
          It should. Four months ago, a half
          million dollars was stolen in an armed
          robbery there. Just a smash-n-grab
          job. They caught the guys a day later,
          recovering about $400,000. Those guys
          have been in lock up since and their
          trial's still pending. Which leads us
          to point number two. Do you smell
          that?

                    DEKKER
              (smells the bills; grimaces)
          What is it?

                    MARNIE
          When evidence is taken in, any physical
          contact might affect the ability to
          lift prints, so, to mark it, we now
          spray a scented solution directly on
          the bill.

                    CONNERS
          Is that new?

                    MARNIE
          Wave of the future.   Gotta keep up with
          the times, Conners.

                           DEKKER
                 So this money's not from our bank.

                           MARNIE
                 No. This is the money from the Pacific
                 Savings job and our evidence room.
                     (smiling; to Dekker)
                 Now... For a list of things you can
                 put in my mouth.

81   INT.   HALLWAY - LOWER CLASS APARTMENT - DAY                   81

     Conners and Dekker confer with Teddy and Vincent.

                           CONNERS
                 Do you remember who headed up the
                 Pacific Savings case?

                           TEDDY
                 I think it was Callo.    Why?

                              CONNERS
                 No reason.     Just thinking out loud.

82   I/E    CONNERS'S CAR/ CITY STREETS - DAY                       82

     Conners and Dekker head back to the police station.   It's
     quiet between these two, until...

                           CONNERS
                 When you said it was your "family
                 business" I didn't think... I guess I
                 just didn't connect the dots.

                           DEKKER
                 Don't worry about it.

                           CONNERS
                 Your father was a hero.

                           DEKKER
                 Yes he was.

                           CONNERS
                 At first I thought maybe you were
                 related to the Captain.

                            DEKKER
                 No.   No relation.

                           CONNERS
                 The Captain, he just kind of
                 "discovered" you. Through the academy,
                 to excellent evaluation reports, while

                on the beat, to the high test scores on
                the detective's exam.

                          DEKKER
                Something like that.

                          CONNERS
                That's how he found me.

     This surprises Dekker.

                          CONNERS
                Maybe we're not as different as you
                think.

83   INT.   INTERROGATION ROOM - SEATTLE POLICE DEPARTMENT         83

     A small, cold room with a large mirror along the WEST WALL.

     Gina sits at the table, shivering. Her breath visible, so
     are her nipples through a WHITE, SEATTLE P.D. T-SHIRT.
     Conners paces around her like a CIRCLING SHARK. Dekker's in
     the corner, observing.

                          CONNERS
                We found the money.

                          GINA
                That money was Dwayne's...

                          CONNERS
                That money came from our evidence room.

                          GINA
                I told you. I don't know nothing about
                a bank robbery. Whatever Damon was
                into, I didn't know!

                          CONNERS
                So, where were you going?

                            GINA
                Vacation.

                          CONNERS
                This isn't possession or solicitation,
                Gina. This is felony-murder one. You
                could get life.

                           GINA
                Me!?   I didn't do nothing!

                    CONNERS
              (frustrated)
          It's "I didn't do anything." "Didn't
          do nothing" is a double negative,
          infers the positive. The grammar in
          this country sucks.

                    GINA
          Then I didn't do ANY-thing!

Conners takes a seat next to Gina.    His EYES BURN through
her.

                    CONNERS
          This isn't going away. You want to
          walk out of here, you tell me
          something... now.

                    GINA
          I swear I don't know. Now I'm done
          talking. I want a lawyer.

Dekker lowers his head.    Disappointed.

                    CONNERS
          You sure that's what you want?

                    GINA
          Yeah.

                    CONNERS
          Fine. Then it's two phone calls I'll
          make. The first will be to the public
          defender's office. The second to
          children's services.

                    GINA
          What?

Suddenly Gina's bravado disappears.    Suddenly a scared and
lonely girl.

                    CONNERS
          It's simple... if you insist on a
          lawyer, I take your kids.

                    GINA
          No.

                    CONNERS
          Not like you cared about them anyway.
          You were ready to fly the coop with
          "Shit-for-brains."

                No.   You can't do that.

                          CONNERS
                I can and I will.

                           GINA
                Don't.

                          CONNERS
                Tell me what I want to know!

     Dekker stares incredulously at Conners.

                          GINA
                    (broken)
                I don't know anything.     Please don't
                take my kids. Please.

     Conners stares into Gina's eyes. She's telling the truth.
     Conners wraps his coat around Gina's shoulders.

                          CONNERS
                Get her some coffee...     Something hot.

     Dekker and Conners...

                          DEKKER
                You believe her?

                          CONNERS
                I think for the first time in that
                girl's life she's telling the truth.

                          DEKKER
                You had to know, once she asked for a
                lawyer anything she told us would have
                been inadmissable.

                          CONNERS
                Who would've known? It would've been
                my word against hers. Who do you think
                the jury would've believed?

     AT THE FRONT COUNTER--

     Conners and Dekker wait. No one's working at present.
     Dekker peers inside, anxiously looking for someone.

     Dekker RINGS the service bell.

     Finally... HARRY HUME, 50's, the cop on watch, limps to the
     desk. Crotchety, with an overgrown belly, Frank's seen
     better days. There's no love loss between Harry and Conners.

                           CONNERS
                    (cold)
                Buzz us in.

                    (colder)
                You gotta sign first.

     Conners and Dekker scribble their signatures down.

                          HARRY
                I heard you were back. Kinda liked not
                having you around, Conners.

     Harry takes the clipboard, examines it until satisfied.   Then
     reluctantly BUZZES them in.

                          CONNERS
                Have another donut, Frankie.

     Dekker and Conners proceed inside. They walk ALONG THE VAST

                You'd have to have some major

                The money from Richards's place traced
                back to the Pacific Savings heist a few
                months ago, a case Callo headed up.

                          TEDDY
                Callo signed the money out of evidence
                two weeks ago.

                morning about being replaced by
                Conners. He wanted to be the point so
                everything went according to plan.

                He doesn't need another reason to be

                Pressure might've been getting to him.
                He's been getting the cold shoulder
                from cops since he testified about
                Pearl Street Bridge.

                           JENKINS
                No.   Don't buy that.

                           TEDDY
                    (beat)
                He was also getting divorced.

     This is news to everyone.

                          TEDDY
                About a month ago, he told me he and
                his wife might be splitting. Asked if
                I knew a lawyer who wouldn't clean him
                out. I didn't think it was this bad.

                          JENKINS
                    (conflicted)
                Bernie Callo is a first rate cop.     A
                boy scout. This doesn't make any
                sense.

                          CONNERS
                They never do, Captain.

                          JENKINS
                Don't act like you're not enjoying
                this, Conners. I know what you think
                of him.

                          CONNERS
                Doesn't matter what I think.      Facts
                here speak for themselves.

                          DEKKER
                No they don't. We haven't asked the
                question... Why, if Callo's involved,
                don't they ask for him at the bank?
                    (points to Conners)
                They asked for you.

     All eyes find Conners.   Then, Jenkins' PHONE RINGS...

                          JENKINS
                    (answering the phone)
                Jenkins.

                                                          TIME CUT TO:

87   EXT.   BERNIE CALLO'S HOME - 4:18 PM - DAY                       87

     The small home in a RURAL AREA is now COMPLETELY SURROUNDED
     by COP CARS.

88   INT.   BERNIE CALLO'S HOME                                       88

     A typical family-themed home. FAMILY PICTURES adorn the
     walls. Everything in its right place. Except for... MRS.
     CALLO, 40's, sits in the kitchen SOBBING. Police encircle
     her.

     In the center of the Living Room... BERNIE CALLO LIES DEAD,
     a bullet wound right between the eyes.

      SHOOTING SCRIPT                MARCH 15, 2004           54.


     SEVERAL UNIFORMED OFFICERS and CSI OFFICERS muddle through
     every nook and cranny of the tiny home. Conners, Teddy and
     Dekker are led around by a UNIFORMED OFFICER...

                          OFFICER AT CALLO HOUSE
                Wife came home approximately forty-five
                minutes ago. Found him here. None of
                the neighbors heard anything. There's
                no forced entry and no one saw anyone
                fleeing the scene.

     Vincent enters from the basement carrying a LARGE BOX.

                          VINCENT
                Blueprints from the bank, schematics,
                pictures... Also, about a dozen
                internet articles on the Saudi Prince.
                Found it behind the furnace.

     Conners nods.

                          DEKKER
                Well, that's it, right?

     Suddenly... THE HOUSE TELEPHONE RINGS! Everyone peers
     around. After the second ring, the ANSWERING MACHINE PICKS
     UP...

                          CALLO (VO)
                You've reached the Callo residence.   No
                one can get to the phone right now.
                Please leave a message.

     Then...   After the TONE...

                          LORENZ (VO)
                    (from the machine)
                Detective Conners... Are you there?

     Conners and everyone turns, listens.

     INTERCUT WITH:

89   INT.   DARK BEDROOM - NIGHT                                    89

     Lorenz stares ahead, transfixed by something.

                          LORENZ
                Are you connecting the dots? Are you
                putting it together? Is the pattern
                emerging? They wouldn't punish you,
                but I will.

     Conners GRABS the phone...

                          LORENZ
                Vengeance will be mine, Detective.

                          CONNERS
                Then come and get me you piece of shit.

     Lorenz smiles, hangs up.   He resumes staring at the wall in
     front of him.

90   EXT.   BERNIE CALLO'S HOME - DAY                                 90

     Dekker leans back against the car, Conners approaches...

                          CONNERS
                What they told Callo was the plan and what
                the plan really was may be two different
                things. Clearly this wasn't part of a plan
                Callo would've agreed with.

                          DEKKER
                You'd think a cop would be smarter.

                          CONNERS
                As cops we come across every temptation
                in the book. Money, drugs, power.
                We'd all like to think we can resist
                any urge, but... We're not saints.

                          DEKKER
                So, Callo was involved and now they're
                dragging you into it. Why?

                          CONNERS
                Man said he wanted vengeance.

                          DEKKER
                Piss anyone off lately?

                           CONNERS
                Me?

     Both can't help but smile.      Jenkins walks up.

                          JENKINS
                I just got off the phone with Agent
                Doyle. After the Charlotte break in,
                the Prince withdrew all his possessions
                from every safe deposit box in this
                country.

        SHOOTING SCRIPT                   MARCH 15, 2004       56.


                            DEKKER
                  Let me get this straight, they didn't
                  touch the cash or the safe deposit
                  boxes. So, they... break into a bank,
                  blow it up, and steal nothing?
                      (to Conners)
                  Still make sense to you?

                            CONNERS
                  Nothing about today makes sense.

       Dekker watches as BERNIE CALLO's body is loaded into the
       Coroner's vehicle. Teddy assists MRS. CALLO into a police
       car. Vincent carries the box of evidence from the home.

       Dekker's mind works overtime, then...

                             DEKKER
                  "Return to the earth now if your mind
                  is troubled and your heart is
                  uncertain. For it is by returning to
                  the beginning that we can clearly see
                  the path."

       Conners and Jenkins share a confused look.

                            CONNERS
                      (to Jenkins)
                  Don't look at me, he's your find.

                            JENKINS
                  Say that again, Detective?

                            DEKKER
                  We go back to where this all started.
                  We go to the bank.

91     EXT.   SEATTLE - 6:08 PM - NIGHT                              91

       The sun SINKS below the horizon.

91 A   EXT.   AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - NIGHT                       91 A

       As night settles, POLICE and EMT workers are still on site.

92     INT.   SECURITY ROOM - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                 92

       Dekker and Conners watch as Dax operates.

                            DAX
                  The tapes confirm five bad guys, but
                  since the vault cam blew in the
                  explosion what they did in there was a
                  mystery.

 SHOOTING SCRIPT                MARCH 15, 2004             57.


ON A COMPUTER MONITOR - The EIGHT SECURITY CAMERA ANGLES
appear.

ON THE MULTIPLE SCREENS... Just as in the opening, Lorenz
leads this crew through the bank. Immediately the group
splits up. IN THE VAULT... One of the Black Clads arrives
and radios in.

                    DAX
          I've been through these tapes twenty
          times already and nothing...

                      CONNERS
          Shutup.

MONITOR #5... IN THE VAULT, Black Clad #2 fires the
explosives! The image goes to STATIC.

                    DEKKER
          Wait, hold on a second.   Did you see it?

                      DAX
          See what?

                    DEKKER
          Go back a little.

                      CONNERS
          What?

                    DEKKER
          Notice the camera angles, they're all
          fixed. They don't rotate or pan.

Dax rewinds, to before the explosion...

                    DEKKER
          There. Stop. Play it. Look closely,
          camera five, the vault cam, dominates
          our attention because of the explosion.
          But while that's happening, check out
          Camera two, customer service.

ON SCREEN... Several BANK EMPLOYEES cower to the Black Clad.
Suddenly, another Black Clad DISAPPEARS UNDERNEATH THE
SECURITY CAMERA.

                    DAX
          Where'd he go?

ON SCREEN... As the EXPLOSION GOES OFF, CAMERA #2 PANS AWAY
FROM THE CUSTOMER SERVICE SECTION, TOWARDS THE LOBBY.

                He moved it. Changed the angle.    He
                didn't want us to see something.

                           DEKKER
                What's in that corner they didn't want
                us to see?

     Dax rewinds the tapes again, before the camera was moved and
     FREEZES FRAME ON: a lone COMPUTER TERMINAL in the corner.

93   INT.   AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                                 93

     AT THE COMPUTER TERMINAL... A FORENSICS TECHNICIAN, 30's,
     carefully dusts the computer keyboard for fingerprints.

     Dekker and Conners look on.

                          DEKKER
                Are you at all concerned that there's
                some whacko out there looking to get
                you?

                          CONNERS
                If I worried about every threat made
                against me, I'd never leave the house.

     The Technician turns on a BLACK LIGHT and... FINGERPRINTS
     APPEAR ALL OVER THE KEYBOARD!

     Conners looks to Dekker, impressed.

                          CONNERS
                    (to the technician)
                Those are priority one. If he's got a
                record, I want an I.D. yesterday.

                          FORENSICS TECHNICIAN
                I'm on my way.

                          CONNERS
                Dax, can you hack in there and find out
                what they were doing on this machine?

94   INT.   ITALIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT                             94

     The ITALIAN RESTAURANT HOST, 50's, jolly with a thick accent,
     greets Conners and Dekker.

                          ITALIAN HOST
                Detective, where you been? Much too
                long. Sit, sit. I give you best table
                in house. It'll just be the two?

                            CONNERS
                No, four.    More are coming.

                          ITALIAN HOST
                Wonderful, wonderful. Who's this young
                man?

                          CONNERS
                For all intents and purposes... he's
                Big Brother.

                          ITALIAN HOST
                    (confused)
                He's your brother?

                            CONNERS
                No.

                          ITALIAN HOST
                No matter, no matter...     I bring you
                bottle of house wine!

                          DEKKER
                We're still on duty.     No wine.

                          ITALIAN HOST
                    (insulted)
                No wine?

                          CONNERS
                A little wine.

                          ITALIAN HOST
                That's better.

     They get to the table, Conners looks at it.

                          CONNERS
                Last time I was here, you said that
                table in the corner was the "best in
                the house."

                         ITALIAN HOST
               It was. Anywhere you sit becomes best
               table in house. Now relax, I bring you
               food.

95   LATER, STILL AT THE RESTAURANT--                               95

     A PIANO PLAYER recreates the sweet sounds of Italy.   PATRONS
     sing along. Eating, drinking and being merry.

     AT THE DETECTIVE'S TABLE--

     Vincent and Teddy have joined Conners and Dekker. A MOUNTAIN
     OF FOOD still remains. A COUPLE BOTTLES OF WINE have been
     consumed, empty plates and basket rolls spread about. The
     mood is happy, light. Not thinking about their day.

     Conners tells an anecdote, something that Teddy and Vincent
     have heard before, but don't care. Dekker watches the
     Detectives, admires in their closeness.

                         CONNERS
               Shane, what was that thing you said
               back at the house about "returning to
               the beginning path" or something?

                         DEKKER
               It's a Buddhist story.

                         CONNERS
               We're all ears.

                         DEKKER
               One day the Buddha found his heart in
               turmoil. So he retreats to the forest,
               to the earth, to the base of a great
               tree and, I'm paraphrasing, but... this
               elephant comes up and tells Buddha he
               doesn't like seeing him discouraged.

                         TEDDY
               He can talk to an elephant?

                         DEKKER
               He's the Buddha. He's attained the 6th
               level of consciousness. He's capable

                       CONNERS
          Continue.

                    DEKKER
          The Buddha was troubled so he went back
          to where he came from, the beginning,
          to find the path, the answer. So when
          you hit a dead end, go back to the
          beginning to find your way. Or
          something like that.

                    CONNERS
          We have a genuine philosopher in our
          midst.

                    VINCENT
          You're a Buddhist?

                   DEKKER
          No. Just something I picked up along
          the way.

                    TEDDY
          But you're religious?

                    DEKKER
          Not particularly.

Conners stares curiously at his new partner.   Then excuses
himself to go to the men's room.

                    DEKKER
          You're all pretty tight.

                    TEDDY
          We've been through a lot together.

                    DEKKER
          I guess I just thought... I don't
          know. With all the trouble he's been
          in lately, coming back from suspension,
          everyone would treat him differently.

                    VINCENT
          You can't believe what you read or see
          on TV. If anything, our tie to Conners
          is stronger. He's one of the best.
          Even when things got pretty wild today
          and everyone else panicked, he was in
          control. That doesn't just happen.
          He's just that good.

                       TEDDY
          Excuse me.

     Teddy heads for the ladies room.

                          VINCENT
                What was the Buddha looking for?

                          DEKKER
                The divine in himself.

     Art's confused.    Dekker's cellphone rings.

                          DEKKER
                How long does it usually take to for
                fingerprints to be ID'd?

                          VINCENT
                Hours, maybe days.    We could be waiting
                a while.

                          DEKKER
                    (answering)
                Dekker./ Okay.
                    (Snapping the phone shut...)
                They got a match.

96   INT.   BY THE RESTROOMS - ITALIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT             96

     LONG CURTAINS divide the rooms.

     Conners exits the men's room, Teddy appears and before a word
     can be spoken... SHE KISSES HIM HARD, PASSIONATELY ON THE
     LIPS. Conners gives in for just a moment. He breaks the
     embrace.

                          CONNERS
                What are you doing?

                          TEDDY
                I realized something today. Being
                around you, all that's happened...       I
                can't... I think I made a mistake.

                          CONNERS
                It's too late. You've made your
                choice. Live with it.

     This jab hurts Teddy and Conners knows it.     Dekker parts the
     curtains...

                          DEKKER
                We got a match.

     Teddy separates from Conners.

                          CONNERS
                You got a name?

                             DEKKER
                Chris Lei.

97   INT.   CONNERS'S CAR - NIGHT                                 97

     Conners drives, Dekker reads Chris Lei's file. On top of the
     file is a MUGSHOT PHOTO of, "Lei, CHRIS". He's an early-30's
     Chinese-American with a "weasel factor" off the charts.

                          CONNERS
                Prick used to work for some big-time
                software company until they caught him
                dipping into the company's slush fund.
                They didn't want the publicity so they
                didn't press charges. Couple years
                later, he was busted for looting the
                pension plans of retired cops. For a
                genius... he's a fucking moron.

                          DEKKER
                This was your case. You and York. You
                made the bust. Why didn't it stick?

                          CONNERS
                His lawyer put us on trial. Said we
                were crooked, abusive, that we planted
                evidence... We were in the midst of
                the Pearl Street Bridge fallout. Jury
                bought it. They let him walk and we
                were the scapegoats.

                          DEKKER
                Was it true?

                           CONNERS
                The guy was guilty. He was scum. That
                was the truth.

                That gives you the right to break the

                 Another thing they don't teach you.

98    EXT.   CHRIS'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                    98

      Off the main road, sits a DARK, TWO-STORY HOME on a HILLSIDE.

99    INT.   CHRIS'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                    99

      The design is MODERN, FLAWLESS and COLD. Every room is
      equipped with VIDEO CAMERAS and MONITORS.

      ON THE MONITOR... The screen is divided into 16 small boxes
      showing the actions simultaneously throughout the house. Our
      concentration settles on BOX #7...

100   INT.   BEDROOM - CHRIS'S HOUSE - NIGHT                         100

      CHRIS LEI, live and in the flesh, quickly stuffs belongings
      into a suitcase. He's nervous, tense. From the top drawer
      of his dresser, he grabs an armful of underwear, socks, dumps
      them into the suitcase.

      What Chris doesn't see...

      IN THE REFLECTION OF THE MIRROR ON THE DRESSER...   LORENZ!

101   EXT.   CHRIS'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                   101

      Conners pulls the car to the curb.    He and Dekker hop out.

102   INT.   COMPUTER ROOM - CHRIS'S HOUSE - NIGHT                   102

      From his second floor window, Chris sees Conners and Dekker.

                              CHRIS
                 Shit.

      Chris turns, FINDS HIMSELF STARING DOWN A BARREL!

                           LORENZ
                 Fare thee well, Chris.

      Chris swallows, Lorenz pulls the trigger and...

103   EXT.   CHRIS'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                   103

      BAM! THE GUNSHOT ECHOES OUTSIDE. Conners and Dekker draw
      their weapons, quickly descend on the house!

104   INT.   FRONT HALL - CHRIS'S HOUSE - NIGHT                     104

      THE FRONT DOOR KICKS IN! Dekker and Conners cautiously
      enter. They move the way veteran partners would. No
      indications that these two just met today.

      The House is almost PITCH BLACK.

      Conners motions that he's going up, signals for Dekker to
      take the back of the house.

105   INT.   KITCHEN - CHRIS'S HOUSE - NIGHT                        105

      Dekker proceeds inside.   After a scan, the kitchen's clean.

      Conners emerges from the stairway.

107   INT.   LIVING ROOM - CHRIS'S HOUSE - NIGHT                    107

      Dekker steps from the back hallway into the DARKENED living
      room. Eyes straight ahead and sharp. What he doesn't see...

      LORENZ STEPS FROM THE DARKNESS.

108   INT.   COMPUTER ROOM - CHRIS'S HOUSE - NIGHT                  108

      Conners moves from the hall, into the bedroom where he
      finds... Chris's dead Body. He checks for a pulse when he
      notices...

      ON THE MONITOR... Conners sees A SHADOWY FIGURE BEHIND
      Dekker!

109   INT.   LIVING ROOM - CHRIS'S HOUSE - NIGHT                    109

      Dekker, oblivious to Lorenz's presence, continues on.    Heads
      for the front hallway.

      Lorenz raises his gun, narrows his sites on Dekker.

      Simultaneously... CONNERS DIVES, TACKLES DEKKER BEHIND the
      living room wall -- LORENZ OPENS FIRE, UNLOADS A FULL CLIP!

      A BULLET GRAZES DEKKER'S SHOULDER!    THE REST LITTER THE
      WALLS, BLOW APART A MIRROR!

      Conners and Dekker, behind the wall, regroup. Conners
      RETALIATES. FIRES FOUR ROUNDS AT LORENZ, but...

                  You okay?

       Dekker and Conners emerge from the house...     LORENZ, on the
       other end of the yard, OPENS FIRE!

       The Detectives DIVE FOR COVER!

       Lorenz exits through the fence's door...

114C   EXT.   ALLEY BEHIND CHRIS LEI'S HOUSE - NIGHT               114C

       As they get there... LORENZ'S MERCEDES, turns out of the
       alley and disappears into the night.

       Dekker stares out, deflated.

      An EMERGENCY MEDICAL TECHNICIAN, 30's, attends to Dekker's
      injured shoulder. Dekker grimaces from the pain. Conners
      approaches...

                           CONNERS
                 First day in the city and you've
                 already been shot.

                 Why don't I "just graze" you with a
                 bullet and see how you feel.

                 Your Damon Richards is awake.

120   INT.   TRAUMA ROOM - HOSPITAL                                  120

      HANDCUFFS lock Richards to his bed. Richards is hooked up to
      an IV and a tube's up his nose. A HEART RATE MONITOR chimes
      rhythmically.

      Two UNIFORMED OFFICERS look on as Conners and Dekker enter.

                           CONNERS
                     (to the officers)
                 Take five, guys.

      The officers exit. Conners LOCKS the door, walks to the bed,
      leans over Richards.

                           CONNERS
                 Hiya, Damon. How you feeling?

                           DEKKER
                     (taps Conners)
                 May I?

      Conners concedes the floor.     Dekker addresses Richards.

                           DEKKER
                 You remember me, don't you?
                     (Damon gives an EVIL GLARE)
                 Thought so.

      Dekker turns his attention to Richards' IV, the tubes which
      carry medication into his body.

       From a nearby medicine cabinet, Dekker rummages around.

                            DEKKER
                  I was skiing about three years ago.
                  Aspen. Beautiful country. Ever been?
                  Never mind. I hit a mogul, landed on a
                  sheet of ice and slammed into a tree.
                  Broke myself up pretty bad. Kinda like
                  you did today. I was in a hospital bed
                  for three months. Had it not been
                  for... Here it is.
                      (he finds)
                  Morphine. Without this stuff, I
                  wouldn't have made it.

       Dekker fills a syringe with the entire bottle.

                            DEKKER
                  Now this IV drip administers a small
                  dosage every minute. Makes you feel
                  relaxed and calm. No pain. But...

       Dekker sticks the syringe needle tip into the IV bag.

                            DEKKER
                  If I were to inject this whole thing...
                  That would be all she wrote for Damon.

                            RICHARDS
                  You don't have the balls.

       Dekker PRESSES down on the syringe, just a little, but enough
       to go into the bag. Richards can't believe it.

                            DEKKER
                  This equipment malfunctions all the
                  time. Overdoses are quite common.
                  Besides, I don't think the DA's going
                  to launch a full-scale investigation
                  over a scum like you.

       Richards attempts to signal for a nurse, but Dekker pulls the
       call button away.

                            DEKKER
                  You don't have to tell us a damn thing.
                  Plead the fifth... roll the dice.

       Dekker SQUEEZES in some more, until...   Richards gives in,
       signals that he'll talk.

                            CONNERS
                  You fuckin' hypocrite. You give me
                  shit for my interrogating skills...
                  least I don't threaten them with a
                  lethal overdose.

       Dekker holds the empty vile up, hands it to Conners.

                            DEKKER
                  There's never been a single case in
                  recorded medical history of someone
                  overdosing on 200 milliliters of
                  saline.

       Conners checks the label, smiles.

       Lorenz, AKA SCOTT CURTIS, enters his car.

                            JENKINS (VO)
                  Lorenz's true identity is Scott Curtis.
                  He's wanted in connection to three
                  other bank robberies, extorsion and
                  kidnapping.

121    INT.   BULLPEN - SEATTLE POLICE DEPARTMENT - NIGHT        121

       Jenkins stands before Conners, Dekker, Teddy, Vincent and two
       new Detectives - DET. TOMMY BRANCH, 40's and DET. JEROME
       KNIGHT, 50's.

                             JENKINS
                  He's also the brother of John Curtis,
                  the perp Conners shot at Pearl Street
                  Bridge.
                      (Moving on)
                  Richards testifies that he was hired by
                  Curtis to pull the bank job with a
                  dirty cop on the inside, Bernie Callo.
                  Curtis hoped that Conners would take
                  the fall for American National turning
                  ugly, disgracing him even further. We
                  also have the names of two more
                  accomplices, Lamar Galt and Xander
                  Harrington. Everyone was set to meet
                  tonight at ten and we have that
                  address.

                  it doesn't take a rocket scientist to
                  know Curtis is eliminating his
                  accomplices. Doesn't matter what
                  Curtis told Galt and Harrington, he's
                  going to finish them off tonight.

      Conners drives, Dekker shotgun.      Conners more intense than
      normal.

                  My father died when I was twelve. He
                  walked into a liquor store in the

                   Because he died on the job, he's a

                   still would've died. She had a chance

       Teddy moves in on Harrington.

                           TEDDY
                 Drop the gun!

       Harrington holds his gun UP AND OUT towards Teddy.   Is he
       aiming or surrendering?

                           TEDDY
                 Drop it now. Last warning.

       But he doesn't.

137    UPSTAIRS HALLWAY--                                               137

       Conners and Dekker meet by the top of the stairs.

                              CONNERS
                 Teddy!?     What's happening?

       Vincent appears at the bottom of the stairs.

                           VINCENT
                 We got one down. He's dead.

138    UPSTAIRS HALLWAY/ STAIRCASE--                                    138

       Dekker and Conners share a look, disappointed.      But then
       something catches Conners's eye.

       BEHIND DEKKER...     a door OPENS...   LAMAR GALT AIMS HIS
       WEAPON!

                              CONNERS
                 GUN!

       GALT FIRES!

       Conners PUSHES DEKKER OUT OF THE WAY, just in the nick of
       time!

       DEKKER TUMBLES DOWN THE STAIRS!    Vincent breaks his fall.

       GALT FIRES AT CONNERS, until he's out of bullets.      He ducks
       back behind a door.

       Conners FIRES!   But did he hit anyone?     Conners pursues...

138A   AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS--                                   138A

       Dekker grabs his head, in pain, but okay.

       BY!

       Conners creeps inside the partially open doorway. It's
       quiet, until... LAMAR GALT lunges, tackles Conners! His gun
       flies from his hands.

      Teddy's EYES fall to...

      ON THE FLOOR... next to the base of the door is a FUSE.         It
      runs from the wall into the vent.

      She follows it into THE KITCHEN.

      Conners and Galt struggle. Conners PUNCHES Galt, sends him
      back! He then SLAMS Galt against the wall, Galt KNEES
      Conners in the gut.

      Galt goes for the gun, Conners KICKS out his legs from
      underneath him! But before Conners can get the upper hand,
      Galt fights back! The two continue...

       Conners leans over Galt, a giant GASH across his forehead,

                  Where's Conners?

       Dekker and Teddy look to the house, when...

       STARES AT THE HOUSE, HORRIFIED!

       DEKKER gets up, watches the FLAMES CONSUME THE HOUSE!

       TEDDY runs towards the house, when...   DEKKER stops her.

                  No!   No, we have to go save him!

      FIRE TRUCKS, POLICE CARS and EMERGENCY VEHICLES surround the
      house. The LIGHTS FLASH AN EERIE RED across the scene.
      FIREMEN try to extinguish the flames.

      Several NEWS TRUCKS have arrived, always after the story.

      A CORONER, 40's, zips shut a body bag. Inside the BADLY
      BURNT BODY of Detective Conners. The BADGE ON HIS BELT still
      visible. They load him into the truck.

      TEDDY, her face drained of life, stares at the truck. A
      Fireman walks behind them, back towards the fire truck.

      JENKINS huddles with a group of Detectives.

                 Conners was right. We should've never
                 gone in. How many more mistakes can we
                 make in one day? He was eliminating
                 his accomplices. We thought he was

      Quiet, mostly dark.     A few fluorescent lights and a desk

      Dekker sits at Conners' desk. A somber moment, reflecting on

          I know what they were doing inside the
          bank.

DEKKER AND DAX--

Dax flips through the huge document.

                    DAX
          These are today's transaction records
          from the bank. An average day produces
          about 400 pages, give or take. Today,
          there were over 3,000 pages.

                     DEKKER
          Meaning?

                    DAX
          We've just witnessed the largest heist
          in history. Somewhere in the
          neighborhood of a billion dollars.

                    DEKKER
          Come again?

                    DAX
          It's a computer virus. "The Computer
          Virus." It randomly withdraws money
          from all the accounts and deposits it
          into the bad guys' account. If you
          check the transactions, no two
          withdrawal amounts are the same and
          none of'em are over $100. Most
          security systems work on the size of
          the money, not number of transactions.
          Wire out one million from a handful of
          accounts and red flags go up. Wire out
          a less than a hundred from ten million
          accounts, no flags.

                    DEKKER
          Where's the money now?

          when I finally had it... It went away.

          How is that possible?

                 temporarily, then transfers to another
                 account, then to another. It's never
                 in one place long enough to get an
                 accurate fix.

                           DEKKER
                 It's still moving the money around?

                           DAX
                 Yeah. Any deposit or withdrawal from
                 any bank doesn't usually go into affect
                 until the next business day. So it's
                 going to keep jumping around until it
                 clears at 9 AM tomorrow.

                     (realizes)
                 Or 6 AM Pacific time. Sunrise. So why
                 break in? If they're just wiring
                 money? Couldn't they do that from
                 anywhere?

                           DAX
                 That's the regional manager's computer
                 terminal. There's no outside/remote
                 access to it. There you have unlimited
                 entry to the bank's mainframe. No
                 passwords to work around, no "hacking"
                 in. It's all nice and clean.

                 A billion dollars is missing and we're

                 Ironically, when the power went out, it
                 helped hide the virus and bought it
                 time to work.

                 So they weren't trying to make   it look
                 like they were robbing a bank,   to rip

                           DEKKER
                 No. My wish is to catch you. You're a
                 murderer. A cop killer at that.

                           LORENZ/ CURTIS (VO)
                 I didn't kill anyone who didn't deserve
                 it. Callo was insignificant and
                 Conners crossed me. In years to come
                 you'll thank me for getting rid of him
                 before he corrupted you.

                           DEKKER
                 I know about the money. You steal a
                 billion dollars... They will find you.

                           LORENZ/ CURTIS (VO)
                 A risk I'm willing to take. It's
                 almost sunrise. Fare thee well.

      Lorenz hangs up. Dekker surprisingly calm, hangs up the
      phone, heads back inside the station.

153   INT.   BULLPEN - SEATTLE POLICE DEPARTMENT - NIGHT          153

      Dekker at his desk, piles through mounds of paperwork.   Not
      sure what to look for, he goes through everything.

      His notes from the bank. The file on Galt, Harrington, Chris
      Lei. He even digs through Conners and finally... Callo's
      file.

      Jenkins heads for the exit.

                 You're still here?

                           DEKKER
                     (in complete work mode)
                 Callo's insignificant.

                             JENKINS
                 What?

                           DEKKER
                 That's what he said, Callo's
                 insignificant. But he wasn't.

                           JENKINS
                 What are you talking about?

                             DEKKER
                 Lorenz...    Curtis...   Called me.

                           JENKINS
                 He called you?

                           DEKKER
                 He said he didn't kill anyone who
                 didn't deserve it. He said Callo was
                 insignificant. But without Callo he
                 wouldn't have had the knowledge of our
                 department and...
                     (grabs a clipboard)
                 ... He wouldn't have had the front
                 money to hire the crew.

                           JENKINS
                 He was screwing with your head. Go
                 home, Shane. You did good today. Your
                 Dad would be proud. Get some sleep.
                 There will be more bad guys tomorrow.

      Jenkins exits.

      Dekker falls back into his chair. Then... discovers...
      Callo's file... The Property Room Sign-Out Sheet. The
      signatures.

      Harry Hume, the evidence room cop, out of uniform, walks
      inside, sits across from... Dekker, already here, with two
      DIFFERENT FILES available to him.

                           HARRY
                 I was in bed already.     This couldn't
                 wait til morning.

                     DEKKER
              (cold)
          How did he come at you, Harry? It's
          the only thing that doesn't make sense.

                    HARRY
          What are you talking about?

                    DEKKER
          All day long we thought Callo was the
          dirty cop. All day long we were wrong.

Dekker slides some papers in front of Harry.

                     DEKKER
          That's the sign-out sheet from the
          evidence room. Here's one of Callo's
          reports. Here's another one... and
          another --

The SIGNATURES ARE DIFFERENT, but Harry doesn't even examine
them. He knows.

                    DEKKER
          They're not the same signature, Harry.
          They're not even close.

                    HARRY
              (shrugs it off)
          Maybe he had a cramp in his hand.    I
          don't know.

                    DEKKER
              (re: file #1)
          This is your file... You were
          reprimanded, a month ago after you
          confronted Callo at the courthouse.
          You punched him. That ring a bell?

                    HARRY
          And I'd do it again. Cops who testify
          against cops shouldn't be breathing the
          same air I do. There's a line you
          don't cross!

                    DEKKER
          So you set him up! You forged Callo's
          signature, you gave him the money and
          you helped him with his plan because
          you thought he got a raw deal at Pearl
          Street Bridge! Don't deny it, Harry
          cause I know.

157   EXT.   PEARL STREET BRIDGE - NIGHT - FLASHBACK                157

      Images FLASH before our eyes...

      The RAIN POURS DOWN!   An SUV CRASHES into a STALLED-OUT
      VEHICLE.

      JOHN CURTIS (THE KIDNAPPER) crawls out of the SUV! He sees
      cop's lights approaching. He drags LISA REANN (THE VICTIM)
      out of the truck. A BRIGHT LIGHT (from a helicopter) strikes
      John in the eyes!

      LIGHTS!   EVERYWHERE BRIGHT!   It's all very BLINDING!

      COPS block both sides of the bridge!   TV REPORTERS AT EITHER
      END OF THE BRIDGE!

      John holds the gun up to Lisa's head as... OVER JOHN'S
      SHOULDER... CONNERS APPROACHES, GUN DRAWN!

      Lisa struggles, tears streaming down her face.

      A FLASH OF LIGHT ENVELOPS CONNERS!

      CLOSE ON... A GUN FIRES!

      John DROPS lifeless to the pavement.

                                                               BACK TO:

      Harry pounds the table...

                 You're helping a cop killer, Harry.
                 You're a year from pension. This is

                 disappears. He's been two steps ahead
                 of Conners and me all day.

                           HARRY
                 Of course he has.   Who knows Conners
                 better than him?

                           DEKKER
                     (what?)
                 How the hell does Curtis know Conners
                 better than anyone?

      Harry goes silent.   Realizes he just let the cat out of the
      bag.

                           DEKKER
                     (realizes)
                 We're not talking about Curtis, are we,
                 Harry?
                     (still no response)
                 Who would know Conners better than
                 anyone? Who would you protect? And
                 who in your mind got the raw deal at

      REVEAL THE ENTIRE SCENE: LORENZ/ CURTIS STANDS NEXT TO
      CONNERS ON THE BRIDGE HOLDING A GUN.

      LORENZ/CURTIS IS YORK!

      NOW RESUME ACTION... Conners and York aim their guns at...
      John holds Lisa tight.

                           CONNERS
                 Drop the weapon. Let the girl go.

      John PUSHES the barrel of the gun TIGHTER into Lisa's temple.

                           YORK
                 That, you don't want to do.

      York narrows his aim on John Curtis.

                 One step closer and the girl dies.

      SIMULTANEOUSLY... YORK FIRES just as Lisa STRUGGLES, MOVES!
      The Bullet intended for John Curtis, HITS Lisa, kills her
      instantly.

      Lisa's body crumples to the ground.

      Conners and York look on in horror, knowing York's bullet
      felled an innocent.

      John turns to fire on the detectives...      Conners fires -
      KILLS John Curtis!

      John's body hits pavement.      RAIN POURS DOWN!

                 It was York who was the bad cop. He

                 York plays his old partner, knowing all

      York bends down to ONE KNEE, DRAWS A 9 MM... FIRES!

      DEKKER AND TEDDY DUCK FOR COVER!

      YORK RUSHES BACK INTO THE RESTAURANT!

      DEKKER AND TEDDY RETURN FIRE!

      THE GLASS WINDOW DOORS EXPLODE!

      CUSTOMERS SCREAM AS...

      Dekker enters, surveys the restaurant.

      A LOUD BANGING FROM THE KITCHEN!

      Dekker approaches the kitchen door, pushes it open and...

      BAM!   BAM!    BAM!   BULLETS RIP APART THE KITCHEN DOOR!

      Dekker spins out of the way. As gunfire stops, Dekker KICKS
      through the door! Leans in gun first...

170   THE KITCHEN --                                                170

      In the center of the room... York neck-holds the Pretty
      Waitress, gun to her head.

      Dekker moves in...

                              YORK
                    Was it Harry? It was Harry, right?

                    DEKKER
          Let the girl go. It's over.

York's EYES BLAZE WITH ACTIVITY!    Something brewing.

                    YORK
          Easy for you to say. I'm a plane ride
          away from a King's Ransom.

THROUGH A SIDE DOOR... Teddy slides in, unnoticed.

                    DEKKER
          Drop the weapon, let the girl go.

                     YORK
          And spend the rest of my days in a
          cage? Let me ponder...
              (beat)
          Don't think so. If you're going to
          stop me... I'm gonna make you earn it.

                    DEKKER
          That you don't want to do.

                     YORK
              (realizes)
          That's exactly what I said to him. Do
          you see the irony here? Am I the only
          one? Two months ago I was in your
          shoes. Some punk holding a gun to an
          innocent girl. What should you do?
              (beat)
          YOU'D DO EXACTLY WHAT I DID!

A GLINT sparkles in his eyes.   His teeth grind.    His gun GRIP
TIGHTENS!

Teddy moves into position from the side!    Then...

The BUS BOY enters from the same door Teddy came in.     The
door BANGS closed behind him.

York spins, FIRES in that direction!

Teddy's HIT!   The Bus Boy retreats out the side door!

YORK TURNS ON DEKKER, FIRES!

Dekker DUCKS away safely.

York drags the Pretty Waitress to the back!

Dekker runs over, checks on Teddy.

                  Shit.

                              TEDDY
                  I'm fine.    Go get him.

      Dekker looks her in the eyes, then darts away.

171   EXT.   DINER NEAR PUGET SOUND - NIGHT                          171

      Dekker exits the back.     Finds the Pretty Waitress.    Shook up.

                            DEKKER
                  Which way did he go?

                              PRETTY WAITRESS
                  That way.    Down towards the pier.

172   EXT.   HARBOR NEAR PUGET SOUND - NIGHT                         172

      York sprints across the street.        Dekker follows.

173   I/E    STEEL CONTAINER YARD - NIGHT                            173

      HUNDREDS OF GIANT STEEL CARGO CONTAINERS litter the yard...
      makes the place look and feel like a GIANT MAZE.

      York disappears into the steel maze.

      Dekker enters, slows to a walk. Carefully proceeds forward.
      Gun drawn. Second guessing each turn.

                            YORK (OS)
                  You've really screwed yourself...
                  Jenkins is going to expect these kind
                  of results from you everyday.

                            DEKKER
                  FBI's got a team of 40 computer
                  technicians figuring out Lei's virus.
                  They'll break it.

      Dekker rounds a corner...

                            YORK
                  Your conviction would be admirable, if
                  it wasn't just so sad.

      At the far end of the container, York FIRES!

      Dekker ducks back.

      York takes a look out, doesn't see Dekker.

                           YORK
                 Get it through your head... The
                 calvary ain't coming. No heroes are
                 coming to save the day. The bad guy
                 gets away at the end of this story.

      Dekker peers around the corner... York's gone.

                           YORK (OS)
                 But I'll give you credit... You turned
                 out to be quite the little thorn,
                 didn't you?

      Dekker speed-walks, continuing the search.

                           YORK (OS)
                 I think Conners would be sorry that you
                 died. But not me.

      Dekker stops, eyes a full 360. The containers all look
      alike. Dekker wonders if he's just going around in circles.
      Until...

      BAM! BAM! BAM! BULLETS RICOCHET ALL AROUND DEKKER!         He
      dive-rolls for cover as...

      ON TOP OF A CONTAINER... York UNLEASHES, until... CLICK!        Out
      of ammo.

      Dekker, hearing this, pops up, RETURNS FIRE!

      York leaps off the backside of the container!

      Dekker gives chase. As he circles the container... no York.
      Instead, he finds a DOCK.

174   EXT.   DOCK - NIGHT                                             174

      A narrow wooden dock. There's a few small boats, A TUG BOAT
      and at the end... A SEAPLANE.

      Dekker approaches the tug. Each step slow and deliberate.
      EYES TRANSFIXED on the seaplane.

      As he nears the Seaplane... A SHADOW RISES from BEHIND HIM.
      From on top of the TUG BOAT!

      Dekker turns just as...

      York throws a fishing net on top of Dekker.    As Dekker
      struggles in the net, HIS GUN DISCHARGES!

      York with a PIKE POLE in hand, leaps down, CLUBBING Dekker
      over the head with the weapon. Dekker goes down!

       SHOOTING SCRIPT                  MARCH 15, 2004              95.


      Dekker's gun SLIDES off the dock, into the water.

      York charges Dekker with the PIKE POLE, ready to stab,
      when...

      At the last second... DEKKER ROLLS AWAY! THE PIKE POLE
      BREAKS A WOODEN PLANK TO PIECES, sticks into the ground
      beneath the water.

      Dekker, still tangled in the net, KICKS OUT York's legs.        He
      falls to the planks.

      York quickly rebounds. He POUNCES on Dekker, from behind he
      wraps his arm around Dekker's throat, CHOKING HIM.

      Dekker struggles to breathe.    York SQUEEZES harder.

                           YORK
                 I have come this far...      I will not be
                 denied.

      Dekker fights, arms flailing. He REACHES blindly behind
      York, grabs a hold of the PIKE POLE. The pole SNAPS in two!

      Dekker wildly SWINGS at York who dodges easily.

      York SLAMS Dekker into the side of the TUG.       Still choking.

      Dekker, on his last gasp, PUSHES OFF THE TUG!

      York stumbles backwards, GETS HIS FOOT CAUGHT IN THE HOLE!
      He twists, spinning around, falling down onto...

      ... THE REMAINING PIKE SPEAR!    The Pike punches through his
      chest... POPS out his back!

      York, blood and life escaping him, his eyes find Dekker.
      Then go dead.

      Dekker steps close.   Holds a cold, remorseless stare at
      York's body.

                                                              DISSOLVE TO:

                    TEDDY
          We used to spend all day   Sunday just
          reading in bed. I would    read the paper
          and he would read one of   his billion
          books. I didn't deserve    him. I knew
          that. But I still loved    him.

Teddy stares out the window...

POV OF TEDDY - Jenkins speaks to Karen Cross.

                     TEDDY
          He's the only man I ever loved.
              (beat)
          Did we all get shot today?

They can't help but laugh.

                    DEKKER
          They said in the city I'd be busy.
          Every day like this?

                    TEDDY
          Pretty much.

                      DEKKER
          Great.    I wonder what's next?

                      TEDDY
          For me...    a long vacation.

Teddy excuses herself to the bathroom.      Dekker goes to pay
the check.

AT THE CASHIER...   Dekker reaches for his wallet, opens it.

                      DEKKER
          How much?

                    PRETTY WAITRESS
          Do you think I'm going to charge you
          after all that? Go on.

                      DEKKER
          Thanks.

Dekker notices the tip jar by the register. He removes a TEN
DOLLAR BILL, about to stuff it in the jar...

That's when THE SMELL hits him. A strange, but familiar ODOR
comes from Dekker's wallet or more accurately... The TEN
DOLLAR BILL! But what is it?

                 Do you smell that?

                 What is it?

                           MARNIE
                 When evidence is taken in, any physical
                 mark might effect the ability to lift
                 prints, so, to mark it, we spray it
                 with a scented solution.

      Off of Conners' LOOK.

       PAPERS and BOOKS litter the floor.

       Dekker trashes the place, looking for a clue of any kind. He
       rifles through the bookshelves, cabinets. All to no avail.

       That's when he finds... a medium-sized paperback, dog-eared
       and worn. The title of the book... "CHAOS" by James Gleick.

       Dekker flips through the book. Pages are marked, high-
       lighted. Key words we find include, "EDWARD LORENZ, CHAOS
       THEORY, BIRTH OF A NEW SCIENCE."

                                                                 TIME CUT TO:

                  maybe he's not on a flight.

       Dekker then notices - the book.     The author's name.

                  York always thought "the plan" was
                  flawless. He was cocky. I told him
                  you have to leave room for error. You
                  can't always predict how it's all going
                  to play out. A random camera catches
                  an image of Richards, the scent on the
                  money... you. You were the biggest
                  wrench of the day. The Chaos Theory...
                  When you got that... I was impressed.

                            DEKKER
                  All day long, we were trying to find
                  out who the inside source was... it
                  was you.

                  The more information you gather, from
                  as many sources as possible, no matter
                  how unpleasant the methods are, the
                  better. And while I'd like to take
                  sole credit it was a team effort.

                             DEKKER

                  Teddy's pretty devastated about your

189   INT.   UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - HOUSE - NIGHT                         189

      Conners PUSHES DEKKER OUT OF THE WAY, just in the nick of
      time!

      DEKKER TUMBLES DOWN THE STAIRS!      Vincent breaks his fall.

      Conners FIRES TOWARDS THE DOOR!      After...

      Conners takes out a small remote detonator.     Pushes the FIRST
      BUTTON!

      A VENT...   A FLASH GOES BY!

      ON THE FLOOR... next to the base of the door is a FUSE. It
      runs from the wall into the vent. Teddy follows it into THE
      KITCHEN.

      The fuse comes out of the vent... IT'S LIT! THE OVEN...
      HEAR the gas emission... The spark. The Gas.

      THE FIRST EXPLOSION!

192   INT.   UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - HOUSE                                192

      Conners leans over Galt, a giant GASH across his head, feels
      for a pulse. He's dead. Conners looks into the hallway,
      SEES THE FIRE!

      Conners gets up, and reaches INTO THE BATHTUB, drags out... a
      CORPSE, HOOKS HIS BADGE ONTO THE CORPSE'S BELT and lays him
      on the floor.

      Conners QUICKLY opens a LAUNDRY SHOOT, SHIMMIES INSIDE AND
      SLIDES DOWN...

193   INT.   BASEMENT - HOUSE                                         193

      Once settled, he pushes the SECOND BUTTON ON THE DETONATOR
      and...

      Dekker and Teddy don't see... A FIREMAN PASSES BEHIND THEM,
      turns his head slightly, REVEAL THROUGH THE VISOR IT'S
      CONNERS!

                                                                 BACK TO:

197   INT.   WESTERN AIRLINES TERMINAL - DAY                          197

      Dekker continues his search for Conners all to no avail. He
      TURNS HIS BACK, just as... A MAN WALKS RIGHT PAST DEKKER
      CARRYING A CELLPHONE!

                           DEKKER
                 So the corpse in the morgue with your

                 You're a serial killer.

                           CONNERS (VO)
                 Who got killed? Curtis? Harrington,
                 Galt, Lei. They're all hoods. The
                 world's safer with them gone. The kid
                 at the bank... that was unfortunate.
                 But... you live with your decisions.
                 You choose to take this road... there
                 is no half way. It's all or nothing.
                 That's why others fail. They don't
                 make the commitment. I won't make that
                 same mistake.

                           DEKKER
                 You said they were all hoods...     what
                 about, Callo?

                           CONNERS
                 Callo deserved his fate.      It's his fault.

                           DEKKER
                 This is Callo's fault?

                            CONNERS
                 If it weren't for him, York and I
                 would've never done this. One random
                 act, causes another, causes another,
                 and in the end... the pattern emerges.
                 That's the Chaos Theory.

         Feds will be tracing false leads for
         weeks.

                   DEKKER
         Lei... you tanked his trial on purpose.

                   CONNERS
         They should've suspended me after I
         testified. What did they expect?

                   DEKKER
         And because the "bitch that made her
         career off you" worked for Channel Two,
         that's why American National was the
         target.

                   CONNERS
         Everybody who screwed us, got screwed.
         Everything in its right place.

                   DEKKER
         Why not kill me? You had plenty of
         opportunities.

                   CONNERS
         This wasn't about killing, Shane. This
         was about standing up for what matters.
         Besides... you kinda grew on me.

                   DEKKER
         You're not going to get away.

                   CONNERS (VO)
         I already have. I'm not even here now.
         This is a very valuable lesson for you
         to learn, and it's good to have learned
         it early.

                   DEKKER
         What's that?

                   CONNERS (VO)
         You don't always win.

         All your years of service for not.
         You're a hypocrite.

                   CONNERS (VO)
         I'm an opportunist. I would've gladly
         died in the line of duty, but they took

                 this would've happened. The system
                 broke down. Good luck, Detective. It
                 would've been an interesting
                 partnership, but I have to go now.

      As Dekker continues his search, his cellphone CUTS OFF!

                            DEKKER
                 Conners?   Conners?

      Dekker doesn't notice... THE MAN walks past security and out
      of the Western Airlines terminal.

      CONNERS walks through the small area, proceeds out to...

                 Good morning, Sir. I'll let the
                 Captain know we're ready.

                 Will there be anything else?

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99


FADE IN:


EXT. THE BIG BLUE SKY - DAY

A VIRGIN AIR 747 bursts through the clouds and levels off.

INT. VIRGIN AIR 747 - DAY

We move through the FIRST CLASS CABIN. It's the regular
mix of first class people: OLD MONEY in Gucci enjoying
freshly baked cookies, a MILLIONAIRE in jeans and a T-
shirt, BUSINESS PEOPLE relaxing after a tough day, and...

...a very nervous MAN.

Shifty-eyed. Alone in an aisle seat, the emergency row.
We hold on him for a moment, but not for too long. Then
we continue moving into --

THE COACH SECTION

Stopping at the lavatory, the "OCCUPIED" sign switches to
"VACANT" and...

JAMES EARL JONES

(or actually, a James Earl Jones type, who for ease of
description, we'll simply refer to as James Earl Jones)
steps out of the restroom, in full African regalia:
multi-colored dashiki, mufti (it's a kind of hat), the
works. He heads up the aisle towards --

THE FIRST CLASS CABIN

Where he is stopped by a --

                         FLIGHT ATTENDANT
           I'm sorry, sir. This cabin is
           restricted to first cl...

Mr. Jones now removes a FIRST CLASS TICKET.

                         JAMES EARL JONES
           Is this what you're looking for?

She looks at it -- a little confused as to why he's just
handing it to her now -- but then she nods. As he passes:

                         FLIGHT ATTENDANT
           Oh, I'm sorry. Please. Is there
           anything I can get you?

                         JAMES EARL JONES
           Scotch, blended. Straight.

He continues into the first class cabin and toward --

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                              2.

THE FIRST CLASS EMERGENCY ROOM

Where he slides in past the nervous, shifty-eyed man (his
name is PASQUAL) and sits by the window.

After a moment, Pasqual quietly clears his throat and
leans, slightly, towards Jones.

                        PASQUAL
                 (tentatively)
          They say birds can't fly this high.

                        JAMES EARL JONES
          They say only angels can.

Now Pasqual nods. Nervously begins to remove something
from his pocket when they are interrupted by --

                        FLIGHT ATTENDANT
          Shall I pour your scotch?

                        JAMES EARL JONES
          No -- I'll take the bottle. Thank you.

She hands him the airplane-sized bottle -- he waves off
the glass. She shrugs, leaving...

Pasqual to resume what he was doing. Slowly, he removes
a roll of Certs. He looks to Jones -- "Well? What about
your end of the bargain?"

From within his dashiki, Jones pulls out a black velvet
pouch. He hands it to Pasqual, who opens it to find
diamonds. A helluva lot of diamonds. Pasqual smiles.

He hands the roll of Certs to Jones. It's not breath
candy at all, but a tiny roll of explosives, with a tiny,
high-tech triggering mechanism.

                        JAMES EARL JONES
          Ah, c-5. The most dangerous
          explosive material ever invented.
          Hard to believe that this little
          contraption could blow up ten city
          blocks.

                        PASQUAL
          Be careful with it, huh?

Both men smile.   Pasqual's very relieved that the deal is
done.

Then suddenly, the lights blink out.

Pasqual looks around, nervous. But it's just the in-
flight movie beginning. Clouds, and a woman holding a
torch.
                                             (CONTINUED)

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                              3.

CONTINUED:

Columbia Pictures presents... David Spade and Adam
Sandler in "BOSOM BUDDIES: THE MOVIE."

James Earl Jones shakes his head, rolls his eyes.

                           JAMES EARL JONES
             Another movie from an old TV show?

                           PASQUAL
             Well, what're you gonna do?

                               JAMES EARL JONES
             Walk out.

                           PASQUAL
             That's very funny.

But James Earl Jones is dead serious.

                               JAMES EARL JONES
             No.   It isn't.

Jones grabs Pascal in a headlock and turns toward the
back of the plane, shouting:

                            JAMES EARL JONES (CONT'D)
             EVERYONE!   FASTEN YOUR SEAT BELTS!

Now Jones does the unthinkable. Holding Pasqual tight,
he yanks open the emergency door release.

With a RUSH, the cabin decompresses.

Panic erupts as air, paper and everything not belted in
screams out of the open door, including --

EXT. THE BIG BLUE SKY - FALLING AWAY FROM THE 747 - DAY

-- James Earl Jones, still holding Pasqual in a bear hug.
They plummet, wind violently tearing at them. Pasqual's
frantic SCREAMS doppler quite nicely.

DROPPING WITH THEM

They continue to fall, gaining speed. Pasqual is
terrified, but Jones doesn't seem worried. In fact,
casually, he glances at his watch, and then looks --

FAR BELOW THEM - ACROSS THE SKY

At the tiny black speck gradually grows larger in the
distance...

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                               4.

CLOSER - ON THAT BLACK SPECK

It's a jet helicopter. Its door opens, and now a SKYDIVER leaps
out, helmet down, arms back, streaking across the
sky in aerodynamic perfection, heading directly towards

JONES AND PASQUAL

who are still plummeting toward the earth at terminal
velocity. Jones begins to let go of Pasqual, who SCREAMS
and tries to clutch onto him, desperate.

                        JAMES EARL JONES
                 (over the rushing wind)
          PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER. WE HAVE
          COMPANY.
                        PASQUAL
          WHAT?

Suddenly -- WHOMMPPPH!! -- the skydiver spread-eagles,
stopping the wild dive directly behind Pasqual, and
immediately binds his arms and straps a parachute on him.

All three are still free-falling.

James Earl Jones nods at the Skydiver who, even under the
helmet and goggles, is clearly a beautiful woman.

Meet ALEXANDRA "ALEX" MUNDAY, one of Charlie's Angels.
She's a sultry bombshell -- a classic femme fatale --
only she's playing for the good guys.

She gives James Earl Jones a wink, then jerks Pasqual's
rip cord and -- WHOOMPH. Pasqual's chute deploys. He
flies upward, leaving --

Alex and James Earl Jones, both still falling.    Below the
ocean screams up at them. Not much time left.

James Earl Jones pulls his belt -- and his mufti flies
up. It's actually a tiny drogue chute, deploying his
entire dashiki. His outfit hides a parachute rig.

Alex pulls her own rip cord and -- WHOOMPH -- her chute
unfurls, and now...

Alex and James Earl Jones gently float towards --

EXT. THE BIG BLUE SEA - DAY

A cigarette boat floats through the choppy water, a
gorgeous young woman expertly throttling up the growling
V-8.

Say hello to NATALIE THOMPSON, Charlie's second angel.
At a glance, she's the brainy-shy girl next door.

But put her behind the wheel of any vehicle, and she's
unstoppable.

Natalie glances ahead, maneuvering the boat perfectly under
Alex, who drops on deck. Alex gathers her chute, then whips off
her helmet to give her cascading mane a wild shake.

Here comes James Earl Jones. Natalie guns the boat
underneath...a perfect catch. Alex helps him with his
dashiki-chute, and then all three look up...

Here comes Pasqual. Natalie whips the boat around,
catching him as he helplessly drops into the seats, still
bound, still scared out of his wits. He gapes wild-eyed
at the two Angels, then whirls on James Earl Jones.

                           PASQUAL
             You crazy bastard!

                           JAMES EARL JONES
             I think you mean crazy bitch.

With that, James Earl Jones reaches up and pulls his face
off. Latex rips free, and standing there (without his
dashiki, James Earl Jones has a great figure) is...

... stunningly beautiful DYLAN SANDERS, angel number
three. She's the wild one.

Pasqual's jaw drops as Dylan shakes her hair free, then
reaches in her mouth --

                           DYLAN
                    (still with James Earl Jones' voice)
             Don't need this anymore.

-- and extracts a voice-modifying chip.

                           DYLAN (CONT'D)
                    (now in her real voice)
             But I sure could use this.

And she pulls from her pocket the airplane-size bottle of
Johnnie Walker Black. She twists it open and downs it.

                           DYLAN (CONT'D)
             Damn I hate to fly.

EXT. BEACH DOCK - DAY

Now, MEN IN "FBI" WINDBREAKERS haul Pasqual away, two of
them carefully handling the certs-explosive. A harmless
fellow pushes his way past them and onto the dock.

It's JOHN BOSLEY, Charlie's lieutenant.

He reaches the boat, which Natalie ties off while Alex
and Dylan neatly fold their parachutes.

                           BOSLEY
             Well, Angels, the experimental
             explosives are back in the hands of
             the government, and the free world
             can breathe just a lit-tle bit
             easier tonight, thanks to you three.

Alex, Natalie and Dylan stroll from the dock onto the sand,
each starting to unzip/unbutton/unsnap their action gear and
hand it to Bosley as they continue walking.

                           NATALIE
             And thanks to you, too, Bos.

                           ALEX
             We couldn't have redirected the
             flight path without your help.

Bosley puffs, proud. He speaks over the ever-growing
pile of chutes, body suits, goggles, the dashiki...

                           BOSLEY
             Nothing a little teamwork can't do.
             At least, that's what Charlie's
             always telling us, right ladies?

                           DYLAN
             Charlie will be joining us, won't he?

                           BOSLEY
             He sends his regrets. But he
             wanted you to know that dinner is
             on him, so feel free to celebrate.

By now, the Angels have stripped off all of their
equipment, revealing eye-popping evening gowns.

                           ALEX
             If it's on Charlie, we will.

The Angels share a laugh as they arrive in their sassy
duds at a private beach club, where a WAITER greets them
with a tray of champagne flutes.

They each take a glass, turn to each other and raise
them. Another Angels Mystery... Case Closed.

FREEZE FRAME.    And the TITLE SEQUENCE BEGINS...

                           CHARLIE (V.O.)
             Once upon a time...

THREE FOURTH GRADE SCHOOL PHOTOS FILL THE FRAME, side by
side by side. These are three very different girls.

NATALIE, with a page-boy cut and wearing a Catholic
schoolgirl's uniform, sports glasses and braces; a bit
awkward and gangly, even shy.

ALEX, formally dressed with perfect pig-tails, is
sophisticated and self-possessed; a class act, even at ten.

DYLAN, wild blond hair and faded T-shirt, has a jaded,
street-wise smirk; even at this young age, her isolation
and disillusionment are masked by seeming confidence.

                           CHARLIE (CONT'D)
             ... there were three very
             different little girls.

The triptych remains on screen.    Now it shifts into:

VIDEO TAPE - THE THREE GIRLS (STILL IN TRIPTYCH)

Now TEENAGERS, on HOME VIDEO.

NATALIE, working the A-V equipment at school, hides her
face in embarrassment, uncomfortable with the camera.
FREEZE.

ALEX, in riding gear, accepting her steeple-chase trophy.
She knows where to look for the camera. FREEZE.

DYLAN, smoking with her tough-girl friends in the girls'
room of her reform school, is caught on camera. She
flips it off. FREEZE.

                           CHARLIE (CONT'D)
             Who grew up into three very
             different women.

TRIPTYCH CONTINUES

They're all WOMEN now, in their early twenties.

NATALIE, a research fellow at MIT (and beautiful, but not
flaunting it) demonstrates a chess-playing computer
program to a room of impressed advisors.

ALEX, valedictorian at Oxford, passionately delivers her
address to a crowd of rapt students, faculty and parents.

DYLAN, in leather and a helmet, steps off a Harley. She
sees a punk with a mohawk slapping around his girlfriend.
She decks him, then enters the back door of a seedy punk bar.

                           CHARLIE (CONT'D)
             With three things in common...

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                              8.

TRIPTYCH ENDS

With photographs again. The women, as they are now:
Natalie, Alex, Dylan. All gorgeous, all self-assured.

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
           They're brilliant. They're
           beautiful. And they work for me.

Now, FIREBALL EXPLOSIONS completely fill the screen.

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
           My name is Charlie.

ANGEL SILHOUETTES appear, in flames.    New MUSIC kicks in.

                        "CHARLIE'S ANGELS"

...And a new title sequence takes over:

VARIOUS SHOTS:   MONTAGE (OVER MUSIC)

Credits continue as we watch the Angels in action (from,
presumably, previous adventures...)

-- A microscope-peering Natalie cuts a ruby, drops it in
a laser housing, shoots a red beam.

--   Dylan, wielding kendo sticks, spars with two Yakzuza.

-- Alex side-kicks two baddies, spins, drops a third.
ZOOM BACK: she is at the Parthenon.

-- A motocross race. Natalie digs in for the finish,
attacking the last jump with gusto.

-- Dylan, in traditional Islamic robes, finds a secret
switch. She pushes back a bookcase to reveal secret stairs.

-- At a ballroom dance competition, Alex wows the crowd
while keeping her eye on a nefarious couple.

-- Bosley, as "Luka, the Bad Ass Pimp," bitch-slaps a
couple of "ho's" -- actually Dylan and Alex -- then winks
at them as unsuspecting drug dealers back off, scared.

--   Natalie bites into a messy hot-dog, has to just laugh.

-- The three angels elbow their way through a roller-
derby match.

-- In orange prison jumpsuits, Alex and Dylan work in
female chain-gang.

-- Window-washer Natalie peers into a skyscraper office,
surreptitiously photographing the meeting inside.

CONTINUED:

-- On an Italian street, the three Angels buy a paper,
grin at the headline, "Mystery Women Save European
Union." As they high-five, Dylan's cone of gelato drops
to the sidewalk. The Angels look at it, look at each
other...and just have to laugh.

TITLE SEQUENCE ENDS.

OVER BLACK we hear a DIGITAL RING...

INT. TINY HOUSEBOAT BEDROOM - DAY

CLOSE ON Dylan as she wakes up in a tangle of ugly
sheets, disoriented and a bit hungover. She hears the
RINGING -- where is it coming from? Why is it drilling
into her head?

Checking the floor, she finds her jeans. Digs in the
pocket to find her cell phone. Answering...

                            DYLAN
             Hi.
                     (recognizing voice)
             Hi.   Okay. I'll be right in.

She clicks the phone off, then starts looking around.
Where the fuck is she?

From the next room, we hear a male VOICE singing "My
Sharona." She checks under the sheets. Oh God. She's
naked. She pulls her shirt from the floor, puts it on.
Closing her eyes, she prays...

                            DYLAN (CONT'D)
             Not him.   Not him, not him, not him.

                           THE VOICE
             'Morning starfish.

                            DYLAN
             Oh God no.

At the door, skinny shirtless CHAD holds a skillet of eggs.

                            CHAD
             Hungry?

EXT. CHAD'S CRAPPY BOAT - DAY

Blinded by the daylight, Dylan emerges from below,
relieved to see the boat is docked. Chad follows her
outside, pleading...
                         CHAD
          C'mon Dylan. You + Me. It's
          magic.

             It's a mistake. A horrible,
             horrible mistake.

She jumps onto the dock.

                           CHAD
             Then how come we keep getting back
             together? It's fate.

Dylan just keeps walking.

                           CHAD
                    (yelling after)
             Is it because I live on a boat?

                                                  WHIP TO:

CLOSEUP - MAN'S FACE

This is Jason Gibbons, handsome, action-movie stud.       He's
concentrating fiercely.

                           ALEX (O.S.)
             If you don't defuse this bomb,
             Logan, L.A.'s going to be a new
             underwater attraction.

A bead of sweat drops down Jason's face.

                           JASON
             Get off my back, Sanchez.   I know
             what I'm doing.

REVEAL ALEX, her face right next to his.

                            ALEX
             Which wire?   The red one or the blue one?

                           JASON
             Marix has a thing for red. Red
             cars, red boats, red-headed hookers.

                           ALEX
             So the red one.

                           JASON
             That's why I'm gonna say blue.

He makes a "snip" motion.     They both breathe a sigh of relief.

                           ALEX
             You saved the world again, Logan.

She leans forward, closer and closer, right in his face.

             That's my job.

Alex kisses him. It's a damn good kiss.          Jason's into
it, but pulls away for a second.

                           JASON (CONT'D)
             I don't think Sanchez would kiss
             me. He's a forty-year-old man.

Pull back to reveal...

ALEX and JASON are in a fully macked out Airstream,
sitting on a bed, leaning over an open screenplay. We
can tell from our surroundings that Jason is a big deal
Hollywood action star, and this trailer is his home away
from home.

She licks the bridge of his nose, then kisses him again.

                           ALEX
             Let's have it rewritten.

As she smiLes, a cell phone RINGS. Both Alex and Jason
reach for their phones. It's hers.

                              ALEX (CONT'D)
             Hello?

EXT. JASON'S AIRSTREAM - DAY

Jason stands in the doorway in his robe as Alex tosses
her stuff in the back of a very excellent car.

                           JASON
             So when you coming back?

                            ALEX
             Not sure.   Whenever I can.      I'll
             call you.

                           JASON
             Oh, great, that's helpful.
                    (watching her prepare to go)
             I don't get it, what kind of
             executive assistant is on 24 hour call?

                           ALEX
             A very good one.

                           JASON
             You ask me, your boss is an asshole.

             Yeah, well I think you should
             quit.

                           ALEX
             Charlie needs me.

                            JASON
             I need you.

Alex looks back -- that was more personally revealing
than she expected.

A P.A. comes up next to Jason.

                            P.A.
             Mr. Gibbons?   We're ready for you
             on the set.

Jason nods, then back to Alex.

                           JASON
             I gotta go save the world.

Alex smiles at the irony of that.

                            ALEX
             My hero.

She blows him a kiss and speeds off.

EXT. BEACH APARTMENT WALKWAY - DAY

Natalie KNOCKS on the door to 113.      A beat later, the
door swings open to reveal BOB.

Natalie SCREAMS in astonishment.

                            BOB
                     (freaked)

             here to identify your remains.

He has no idea what she's talking about.         She goes to

THE BATHROOM,

where she retrieves a toothbrush.

                           NATALIE (CONT'D)
             I saw your car was here, so I knew
             you weren't carjacked and brutally

Her cell phone RINGS.

                              BOB
             I'm not...

She holds up a finger, just a sec.

             But you can understand why I
             thought so. You missed our date
             last night. You didn't call or
             anything. I was just sitting
             there by myself.

ANGLE ON Bob.    What can he say?

                           NATALIE (CONT'D)
             I can tolerate a lot, but punctuality

             I can explain.

In foreground, a blender WHIRRS. Still hungover, Dylan
cringes from the sound. Natalie pours out three fruit
smoothies for the angels.

                              ALEX
             What?    I've got a great relationship.

                           DYLAN
             Your boyfriend thinks you're a
             secretary.

                           ALEX
             That way, he doesn't ask about my work.

Bosley walks in with a folder.       He eyes their drinks.

                           NATALIE
             I'm sorry, Bosley. I only made
             enough for three.

                           BOSLEY
             No, that's...That's okay.

It's not okay, but that's our Bosley. He takes his seat
behind his desk. Now we see the biggest addition to the
office, the Angels Wall of Fame.

             Good morning, Angels.

                           ANGELS
                    (sing-songy)
             Good morning, Charlie.

The angels take a seat on couches and chairs.

                           CHARLIE'S VOICE
             I'm sorry to call you back from
             vacation, but we've got a case
             that just can't wait.

As he's talking, the far blinds close themselves. A white
screen lowers from the ceiling, ready to catch the
projected VIDEO:

A handsome MAN IN HIS 20'S in a CNN profile. The sound is
muted, be we see him attending a gala; in an office surrounded
by computers; rock climbing; smiling in a sit-down interview.

                           CHARLIE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
             Meet Eric Knox.

                           NATALIE
             He's cute.

                           BOSLEY
             He is.

Oops, did Bosley say that out loud?

                           CHARLIE'S VOICE
             He's 28-years old, and in three days
             he'll be a billionaire, when his
             company, Knox Technologies, goes public.

                           DYLAN
             It's good to be him.

                           ALEX
             So what's the catch?

                           CHARLIE'S VOICE
             Last night, Knox was kidnapped
             from his own office.

                           A WOMAN'S VOICE
             They don't want money. They just
             want to sink our company.

A striking WOMAN IN A SUIT stands in the doorway.

                           CHARLIE'S VOICE
             Angels, meet Vivian Wu, vice
             president of finance for Knox
             Technologies. She's hired us to
             find Knox.

                           VIVIAN WU
                    (entering)
             The initial public offering is in
             three days. If we don't get Mr.
             Knox back, or if word gets out
             that he's missing, the company
             stands to lose a billion dollars.

She seems to direct this next sentence right to Natalie.

                           VIVIAN WU (CONT'D)
             We need your help.

                           ALEX
             Charlie, where do we start?

                           CHARLIE'S VOICE
             Alex, I want you and Bosley to
             stake out Roger Corwin.

Bosley is excited to hear his name mentioned.

ON VIDEO: Roger Corwin. He's an unpleasant-looking man,
who's even nastier when he tries to smile. We see logos
for his company, Red Star Systems

                           CHARLIE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
             For the past year, he's been
             trying to buy Knox's company and
             their new browser software. Knox
             refused to sell. His company, Red
             Start Systems, has the most to
             gain from Knox's disappearance.

                           ALEX
             Kidnap the founder and you sink
             the company.

             still alive, Corwin might lead us
             to him.

CHARLIE'S POV

We see his chalky fingers grabbing into a hand hold.
We're halfway up the face of Yosemite's El Capitan -- the
ground is hundreds of feet below.

                           CHARLIE (O.S.)
             I'd love to, angels, but I've got
             my hands full this morning.

Two beautiful and buxomly CLIMBING BUDDIES smile at him.

                                                  WIPE TO:

EXT. PALM SPRINGS SPA - DAY

Establishing...

EXT. SPA DECK / OUTSIDE WALKWAY - DAY

Built into the Palm Springs Hills, this very exclusive
spa has a fantastic view of the desert.

Dressed in a crisp spa uniform, Alex has a sidebar with a
white-robed Bosley. She shows him a tiny electronic
device shaped like a bullet.

                           ALEX
             This is a transmitter. I'll be
             able to hear everything you say.

                           BOSLEY
             Where do I hide it?
                    (leaning close)
             I'll be nude.

Alex takes a plastic cup, drops the transmitter into it.
Covers it over with ice chips from a nearby bucket.

Bosley nods, clever.

                            BOSLEY
             Understood.

She points him in the direction of the men's spa.    But he's
frozen with excitement.

                           BOSLEY (CONT'D)
             I'm going undercover.

                            ALEX
             I know.   You'll do great.

INT. MEN'S STEAM ROOM - DAY

A burst of steam clears, revealing Bosley. He waddles forward
in his shower clogs, which SQUISH with every step. He's wearing
two towels: one around his waist, and a second around his
chest.

As more steam dissipates, we see there    are SEVEN MEN sitting on
the risers. Six are gorgeous, ranging     from Calvin Klein models
to Marlboro Men. Bosley looks around,     taking a keen interest.
Maybe he's checking them out, maybe he    isn't. We just don't
know.

The seventh man is ROGER CORWIN, who we recognize from
the videotape. He's leaning forward, a gold chain
dangling. It's beside him that Bosley takes a seat.

He sets the ice cup -- and the transmitter -- in a
strategic location.

Noticing that none of the other men have towels around
their bosoms, Bosley nervously undoes his, revealing skin
the color of cooked salmon. He fluffs up his sparse chest hair,
then decides to smush it back down.

He tries to make eye contact with Corwin, working way too
hard. Annoyed, Corwin finally looks over.

                           BOSLEY
             Hot in here, isn't it?

Corwin shakes his head, idiot.

                           BOSLEY (CONT'D)
             Just came here to unwind a little.
             Business these days is go go go. My
             company just held an initial pubic offering.

Yes, he said "pubic." He's about to correct himself when
a very hot guy across from him moves his towel to wipe off
                                              (CONTINUED)

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                19.

some sweat. We don't see the promised land, but Bosley
does. It flusters him.

He sees another guy eating ice chips. Good idea.      Bosley
does the same. He eats another. And another.

                           BOSLEY (CONT'D)
                    (re-composed)
             So, what business are you in?

Corwin seems wary, but Bosley is clearly harmless.

                            CORWIN
             Computers.   Software.

                           BOSLEY
             Computers, hunh? What do you know
             about this new browser from Knox
             Technologies?

Corwin bristles at the mention.

                           BOSLEY (CONT'D)
             Word on the street is, once they
             raise capital, they'll rule the
             industry.

                           CORWIN
             I don't see that happening.

                            BOSLEY
             Really?   Why not?

The door opens, a rush of steam. ADONIS HIMSELF enters.
Picking a seat behind Bosley, he pulls off his towel as
he passes. We just see a bit of ass, but Bosley is face-
to-face with the babymaker.

One ice chip is not going to do it.    He chugs the rest of
his cup, including

THE TRANSMITTER

which BLEEPS.    Corwin and others look over.    What the hell
was that?

The device still in his mouth, Bosley has no choice but to
smile and swallow. His eyes go wide as he chokes it down.

Corwin gets up to leave.

                           BOSLEY (CONT'D)
             Nice talking with you.

Another BLEEP. He shuts his mouth tight. Smiles. Rubs
his chest a bit, trying to get the transmitter down.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                               20.

INT. PRIVATE MASSAGE ROOM - DAY

Corwin walks into a lushly-appointed private massage
room. A masseuse dressed in a skimpy robe, her back to
us, oils up her hands sensuously near the window.

                        MASSEUSE
                 (German accent)
          Please to take off clothes, Mr. Corvin.

Corwin gets under the sheet, on his stomach. The
masseuse turns around, and now we see that it's Alex.

Alex starts to work on his back. She is clearly an
expert at this. This is a legit place, but there's
something undeniably sensual about the whole experience.

                        ALEX
          You're carrying a lot of tension
          along ze fourth und fifth vertebrae.
          Let me see if I can vork it out.

Under the table, we look up to see Corwin's face in the
cradle. He's in a tortured rapture.

Alex works along Corwin's back and neck.   She pulls his
arms out to the side.

                        ALEX (CONT'D)
          The human body is an amazing instrument.
          Just by activating ze right energy
          points, you can improve ze circulation,
          alleviate pain, or...

Corwin goes limp.

                        ALEX (CONT'D)
                 (losing the accent)
          ... knock a man unconscious.

Confident Corwin is out cold, she slides the key strap
off his wrist.

INT. EXECUTIVE LOCKER ROOM - DAY

Making sure she's alone, Alex uses the key to open a
locker. She carefully sorts through Corwin's things,
finding his Palm Pilot organizer. She clicks it into a
special device, which BLIPS as it downloads all his
information.

Putting the Palm Pilot away, she shuts the locker.

INT. MASSAGE ROOM - DAY

INT. NATALIE'S EXCELLENT CONVERTIBLE - DAY

The Angels are all in the car together, cruising down
Sunset Boulevard. Dylan drives, Alex in the passenger seat,
Natalie in the back seat with her computer on her lap.

             Can you not drive my car so fast,
             Dyl? I'm trying to type.

                    (to Alex, under her breath)
             I drive too fast. Look who's talking.

She pulls into an In N' Out Burger, right up to the drive thru.

                           DYLAN (CONT'D)
             Three double doubles, animal style.
             Fries. Three chocolate shakes.

While they wait for their order, Natalie punches
something up on her computer.

             Here's Corwin's itinerary.

ONSCREEN -- we see a list of all Corwin's plans for the
next week. Two events in particular stand out:

     TUESDAY NIGHT -- INVESTOR RECEPTION, BILTMORE HOTEL

     THURSDAY -- SAN DIEGO RACEWAY

Dylan glances over the schedule.

                           DYLAN
             Alright, we'll hit the reception tonight.
             I only wish we had a clue to go on.

The food comes, Dylan takes it.

                           NATALIE
             Hold that thought.

Natalie goes back to the computer again, slipping a CD
into the drive. Dylan hands out the food, spilling a lot
of it. A big glop of chocolate shake lands on the
keyboard.

                            NATALIE (CONT'D)
             Uh, hello?   Expensive equipment.

                              DYLAN
             Sorry.

Natalie licks the shake off her fingers, tapes away at
the keyboard.

                           NATALIE
             Check this out. New program I just
             got from a friend in the Bureau. We
             take that footage from the kidnapping...

On screen, the footage downloads from the CD, into the
program. Natalie fast forwards through it until she
comes to a shot of one of the kidnappers where his mask
is partly pulled away from his face.

                           NATALIE (CONT'D)
             ... isolate the part of the suspect's
             face that's revealed, then retriangulate
             his bone structure...

The program zooms in on the revealed part of his face,
then runs a series of calculations. A new drawing starts
to appear.

                              NATALIE (CONT'D)
             ... and voila!     We've got a composite.

Natalie's portable printer spits out a simulated
composite of one skinny, bad-looking dude. Dylan grabs
it, looks it over.

             Sweet. Now we've got someone to
             look for.

She hands it to Alex to inspect.

                           ALEX
             Oh yeah. He'll be easy to spot
             with that open head wound.

She turns the composite around, revealing that Dylan has
smudged his head with ketchup.

They all just have to laugh.

INT. BILTMORE BALLROOM - DAY

A sophisticated reception is in full swing, an ocean of
smart suits and power ties.

Dressed as a catering waitress, Natalie carries a tray of
hors d'oeuvres. MOVING WITH her, we pass ROGER CORWIN, who
talks with another suit, and further on, a conservatively-
dressed DYLAN who chats up a group of WALL STREET TYPES.

                           DYLAN
             The average investor sees technology
             stocks as discrete entities, "This one is
             up 50 points, this one is down 10." It's
             only through derivative analysis that one
             sees the real power of that sector.

A few nods.    She makes a good point.

                           BROKER GUY
             Which analysis method do you prefer?

On Dylan.    Shit.     She tries to stall...

                           DYLAN
             Well, there are so many options.
             I mean, who can say what the one
             best choice is?

ACROSS THE ROOM

Still walking, Natalie talks to no one...

                           NATALIE
             Keppler-Wilson.

BACK WITH DYLAN

                            DYLAN
             For my money, Keppler-Wilson is a
             strong choice.

More nods, ad-libbed agreement.        The Broker Guy is impressed.

Excusing herself, Dylan turns and subtly touches her ear,
where she's wearing a hidden radio.

                             DYLAN (CONT'D)
             Thanks.

             Anytime what?

She looks up to see a very cute bartender, PETE (26).
She didn't realize he was so close.

                           NATALIE
                    (covering)
             Anytime, day or night, I am... excited
             ... to be handing out champagne.

Oh God.   What did she just say?       But he smiles anyway.

She heads back out into the crowd.       You can almost see
the big L on her forehead.

BY THE FOUNTAIN

Dylan has been watching this.        We INTERCUT between her
and Natalie.

                             DYLAN
             He's cute.

                             NATALIE
             I'm working.

             He's a bartender. I need dependable.
             I need reliable. I need a Volvo man.

Natalie walks past Dylan, not acknowledging her.        Dylan
snaps her fingers.

                             NATALIE
             Miss!   Miss!   I'd love some champagne.

Natalie comes back, a little annoyed. Dylan takes a
glass for herself, then foists the other glasses on
everyone around her, whether they wanted it or not.

                           DYLAN (CONT'D)
                    (to Natalie)
             Why don't you get some more?

She nudges Natalie in that direction.

AT THE BAR

We TILT UP from a Japanese comic book to Pete.       He
suddenly realizes Natalie is waiting for him.

He holds it up.

             That's the new Michio Kazura.

                           PETE
             I know. I just moved back from
             Tokyo. It was the biggest thing
             since Haikiri Nomura.

She turns and heads back.

             Listen, there's an animation festival
             at the Egyptian this week. I was

ON DYLAN

She smiles, hearing the deal close. Pushing through a
cluster of investors, she bumps into a THIN MAN.

                            DYLAN
             Pardon me.

He doesn't respond, but something about this man raises
her suspicions. Where has she seen him before? As he
moves out of earshot...

                            DYLAN (CONT'D)
             Natalie.   Nine o'clock. Thin man.

ON NATALIE

                            NATALIE
             I'm on it.

Spotting the Thin Man, she heads his way.

                    (offering)
             Vegetarian spring roll?

He waves her away, no. Oops, she drops a napkin in front
of him. She kneels down to get it.

As we move in VERY CLOSE ON her tray, we see that there's
a tiny Digital display. A metal detector is built into
the rim.

It BLIPS as she moves past his ankle. And again as she
rises up past his chest. The man just keeps walking.

                           NATALIE (CONT'D)
                    (to earpiece)

             You take point. I'll circle behind.

                            DYLAN
             Copy.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

The Thin Man is headed down the hall.    Looking back, we
see Dylan enter from the ballroom.

             Excuse me, do you know which way
             the ladies' room is?

The man takes a sudden right into a service hallway.

                           DYLAN (CONT'D)
             Why do they always run?

She slips off her heels to give chase.

INT. SERVICE HALLWAY - DAY

The Thin Man comes around the corner.       We stay TIGHT on
him, until he suddenly stops.

NATALIE

has come around from the other side. His bad guy instincts
tell him these women are working together. He's boxed in.

And then, a DING!

Elevator doors open beside him. He looks in to see the clue-
less BELLBOY, who had a funky groove going on his headphones.
In a single motion, the Thin Man yanks the guy out into the
hallway and takes his place. Hits the button.

From opposite directions, Natalie and Dylan run to the
elevator, but the doors have already shut. Checking the
panel.

                           DYLAN
             He's going down.

They take the stairs.

INT. BASEMENT SERVICE HALLWAY - DAY

Natalie and Dylan emerge from the staircase to find the
elevator empty. To the left, exit doors swing tellingly.

EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - DAY

Nat and Dylan smash through the exit doors and out into
the sun-drenched streets of beautiful, downtown Los
Angeles. Natalie immediately spots the Thin Man, booking
down the alley.

                           NATALIE
             That way.

CONTINUED:

And they take off after him.

What ensues is the fastest, wildest, two chicks and one
guy foot chase you've ever seen. Here are some highlights:

-- Thin Man pulls himself, clumsily, over a chain link
fence. Dylan and Natalie pull an old Jackie Chan trick
and run up the side wall and hop over easily.

-- Thin Man, still on foot, waits for traffic to slow,
then darts across the Harbor Freeway. By the time Dylan
and Natalie get there, traffic is roaring again.
Undeterred, they make their way through, tucking and
rolling under the wheels of a moving semi.

-- Dylan is racing down an alley, when a car comes barrelling
at her. She leaps up onto the hood of the car as it drives
underneath her, a la one of those That's Incredible! stunts.

-- They chase the Thin Man into an industrial laundromat.
The scene goes something like this:

INT. INDUSTRIAL LAUNDRY ROOM

Thunderously LOUD, with industrial washers and dryers operating
at full tilt. Natalie and Dylan are just entering when

THREE SHOTS

ring out.    They dive for cover behind a massive washer
assembly.

                           NATALIE
             There are times I wish we carried
             guns.

                           DYLAN
             Where's the challenge in that?

ANGLE ON the Thin Man, planning his next move. With no
good shot at the angels, he aims high, both guns BLAZING.
He shots out the pipes over their heads, sending down a
cascade of hot water.

Dylan and Natalie scramble back to avoid getting scalded.

Other pipes SHATTER from the change in pressure, leading
to an interior thunderstorm. Steam fills the room as an
inch of water grows on the floor.

Natalie and Dylan push rolling laundry carts in the Thin
Man's direction. He shoots at them, but quickly realizes
they're just trying to waste his bullets.

Holstering one of his guns, he dials his cell phone.

CONTINUED:

On the far wall, Natalie switches on the overhead hooks,
which circle on a wire like a ski lift. The Thin Man
looks up, distracted, not noticing --

DYLAN

As she creeps up behind the cover of the rolling laundry
carts. She's succeeded in circling behind the Thin Man
as he talks on the phone.

She clears her throat.      The Thin Man turns.   She kicks
him in the jaw.

Knocked back, he drops the phone, which CRACKS and slips
under a washing machine.

He crab-walks back, then suddenly springs back to his feet.
We weren't expecting that kind of ninja move out of this guy.

HE TURNS TO SEE

NATALIE

right behind him. With a coiled towel, she grabs his gun
arm and expertly flips him. But he reacts smoothly, rolling
over to charge at Natalie, picking her up like a sack of
potatoes. As he does, he grabs her right in the tit.

                             NATALIE
             Hey!    Hands off, assh....

Before she can finish her sentence, the Thin Man throws
Natalie at Dylan, knocking them both down. He jumps up,
and with a single motion grabs an overhead pipe and kicks
another, releasing a wall of steam -- we can't see a thing.

By the time the fog clears, the Thin Man is long gone.

                           NATALIE
             Okay, to summarize? Damn.

Lying down in the water, Dylan reaches under the washer
to fish out the Thin Man's busted cell phone.

INT. TOWNSEND AGENCY BACK ROOM - DAY

Natalie sits at a glowing computer monitor, the Thin
Man's cell phone connected by a data cable to the
Townsend Agency computers. Rapidly touching the screen,
she calls up a list of the last thirty-five phone calls
he received. They're all from the same location.

                            BOSLEY
             Well.   That was easy.

                           NATALIE (CONT'D)
             I've seen this before, he's
             scrambling his calls through a
             secondary location.

                              BOSLEY
             In English?

                           NATALIE
             We need to tap this phone line
             at the source, THEN we'll know
             where his calls were coming from.

                            DYLAN
                     (checking out the numbers)
             503?   That's not local, where is it?

             Don't bother. I know where it is.
             I used to spend every winter there.

EXT. ASPEN - NIGHT

The sign says it:     Welcome to Aspen.

VARIOUS ESTABLISHING SHOTS of the gorgeous mountain town,
still somehow quaint despite its astonishing wealth.

EXT. COWBOY BAR -- NIGHT

A rowdy establishment just outside of town.

INT. COWBOY BAR --     CONTINUOUS

The kind of place that rich weekend skiers don't come.
Lots of over-aggressive, cowboy-biker types, drinking more
than they should. There are only a few women in the place,
and they are either waitresses or biker chicks. Suddenly,
everyone stops what they're doing and turns to the door.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS have entered the room. Dressed in their
stylish ensembles, they couldn't possibly look more out of
place.

             That looks like our target.

She points to a door at the back of the bar that leads
into a glassed-in office. Two, beefy bouncer types are guarding
the door.

Dylan and Natalie smile at each other.

                           DYLAN
             I think that can be arranged.

The Three Angels split up, Bosley tagging along with Dylan.

DYLAN

sidles up to the bar. A group of three rednecks are
downing shots, one after another.

                    (Bosley whispers in her ear)
             And one Tom Collins.

The rednecks stare at Dylan, drooling.       Dylan turns to the first
one.

             Hey baby, why don't you ditch that

Bosley tries to make himself small.

             Ooh, that is an enticing offer.
             But I got a better idea. How
             about a shot contest? My treat?

The three rednecks hoot and holler.

She cranks it up, and lets

Dylan downs a shot, slams it on the table.      Countless
other glasses surround her.

REVEAL that two of the rednecks are down for the count, one
falling out of his chair, the other passed out on the table.

The third redneck is slurring badly, trying to keep up
with Dylan.

             Chair throwing? Never heard of
             it? You just pick up your chair
             and throw it as far as you can.

The redneck nods, lifts up his chair and heaves it across

OKAY, HERE'S AN OUTLINE OF WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE REST OF

Dylan and Natalie create a distraction, while Alex sneaks
into the back office with Bosley to get the phone number
of the chalet.

EXT. HIGH MOUNTAIN ROAD - NIGHT

A VW van climbs the winding road.       As we get closer, we see the
side reads, "Chalet Grams."

A DING-DONG DING-DING-DONG doorbell rings.

INT. MOUNTAIN HOUSE / GREAT ROOM - NIGHT

TWO THUGS with shoulder holsters look up, hearing the bell.
One was tending to the fire.

Thug Two shakes his head.

Checking his gun, Thug One grabs for his windbreaker.
Puts it on over.

EXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

Thug One opens the door to find Dylan and Natalie dressed
in Swiss Miss outfits, complete with blonde braids.

                           DYLAN
             Guten Tag!

             Guten Freund!

The girls lean in and hug each other, butts sticking out.
To the left, Bosley starts playing oommpa OOMMPA oommpa
OOMMPA on a wrap-around tuba. He's wearing lederhosen,
with a feather in his hat.

Natalie begins to YODEL.

Dylan hands a fancy envelope to the bewildered thug. Thug
Two is approaching from behind, curious what the hell is
going on.

Dylan begins to TALK-SING a song in German about a too-
curious goat and his worried mistress. Even with the pantomime,
we have no idea what's happening. It seems
wholesome, but occasionally one of the girls touches the
other in a weirdly coquettish, oddly sexual way.

Thug Two looks at the address on the envelope.

             Shut up.

As the angels continue their routine, the CAMERA RISES,
three quick cuts to take us to...

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                               34.

EXT. THE ROOF - NIGHT

... where a black cat-suited Alex stands at the
chimney... A ribbon of smoke curls from the stack.

Pulling the pin from a canister, she drops it down the
chimney.

INT. MOUNTAIN HOUSE GREAT ROOM - NIGHT

A cheerful fire burns in the over-sized fireplace. The
canister drops into the flames from above, suddenly
venting a HISSING cloud of halon gas. The fire dies
immediately, the logs covered with a violent frost.

INT. THE CHIMNEY - NIGHT

Alex doesn't even need a rope. Her feet pressed to the
sooty walls, she expertly slides to the bottom.

INT. GREAT ROOM - NIGHT

Alex backs out of the fireplace to find a WAITING BAD GUY
swinging

A FIREPLACE POKER

at her head. She ducks just in time.     The poker CHINGS
against the stone, making a spark.

Rolling, jumping and diving, Alex scurries as Pokerman
slashes and stabs. She ducks behind a chair, which
Pokerman catches with the hook, winging it across the
room.

Backed against the wall, Alex yanks on the heavy
curtains, pulling them down, along with the wooden
curtain rod. A spin, a flourish of velvet and the
curtain rings drop off to leave her with a trusty
quarterstaff.

She goes on the offensive.    Thrust, parry, spin.

But he's a worthy adversary. One good karate kick breaks
her staff in two. She uses both pieces to club him in
the knees, then rolls back to the fireplace.

She grabs the remaining tool: the fireplace tongs.
Pokerman swings. Alex catches his weapon in the tong
scissors, yanking it free with such force the point sticks
in the wall.

A quick kick knocks Pokerman to the floor, where Alex
rolls on top of him. She catches his head in the tongs,
squeezing his temples. His eyes bulge.

                           ALEX
          Where's Knox?

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                  35.

INT. WINDOWLESS ROOM - NIGHT

Young billionaire ERIC KNOX paces. He's grungy, with
two days of stubble, but still a darn attractive guy.

Hearing a KICK at the door, he turns.

A second KICK blows the door open.     It's Alex.

                           KNOX
          Who are you?

                           ALEX
          The calvary.     Giddy up.

EXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

Bosley is about to hyper-ventilate on the tuba, sweaty
and a little blue.

Dylan and Natalie's new song has them sharing the saddle
of an imaginary horse. When Dylan reaches back to slap
the "horse," she hits Natalie in the rump. Both women
tee-hee.

The thugs think it's pretty hot.

Dylan whispers a secret to Natalie.     Natalie WHISPERS
back.

Turning to the thugs, they each lean in to WHISPER into
a different thug's ear. As the men smile, the angels
suddenly BONK the two men's heads together. Both men
fall, knocked out.

Stepping over the bodies, Dylan heads inside.

INT. MOUNTAIN HOUSE HALLWAY - NIGHT

Looking for the way out, Alex leads Knox to a closed
door. She opens it to find...

INT. TV ROOM - NIGHT

... TWO MORE THUGS sitting in front the big-screen TV,
watching a college basketball game (Duke vs. Maryland,
in case you care.) The guards look back, spotting Alex
with Knox.

That wouldn't be so bad, if it weren't for the

FIFTEEN OTHER THUGS

watching the game with them.

ANGLE ON Alex.   It's an oh-shit moment.

             Sorry.    Wrong room.
                      (to Knox)
             Back!    Run!

The thugs are out of their seats a moment later, each of
them pulling out a firearm.

EXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

Holding down three keys on the tuba, Bosley talks into
the mouthpiece. It has a secret radio.

                           BOSLEY
             Alex, what's your status?

INT. STAIRCASE - NIGHT

Running, Alex pushes Knox ahead of her, checking their
backs. She talks into a wrist-mic.

                            ALEX
             Good news:   I found Knox.

Another THUG steps out in front of her.      She kicks him
down the steps.

                             ALEX (CONT'D)
             Bad news:    I found company.

Reaching the bottom of the steps, Knox is surprised to be
grabbed by Dylan.

                             DYLAN
             This way.

At this point, he'll do whatever they say.

EXT. FRONT OF MOUNTAIN HOUSE - NIGHT

Dylan rushes Knox across the driveway to the waiting van
-- Natalie is pulling it around. Overhead, bright
security lights switch on.

Back at the front door, Alex pulls it shut. She attaches
a carabiner clip to the handle, running a thin steel cord
from it around the porch column.

INT. FOYER - NIGHT

The first of the thugs reaches the door, tries to pull it
open but can't. The next few guards try to help him,
while the rest start smashing through the windows.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                               37.

EXT. FRONT OF MOUNTAIN HOUSE - NIGHT

Running with the tuba, Bosley stops for a moment to catch
his breath, hands on his knees. Okay, ready to run
again.

He's the last to be pulled into the van.    A spray of
gravel and they're off.

INT. THE VAN - NIGHT

Everyone is piled on top of each other. Dylan and Knox
have a few awkward moments as they get untangled. Bosley
keeps making inappropriate TUBA NOISES.

At the wheel, Natalie is fierce and focused, in total
control.

Looking out the back windows, Alex sees the kidnappers
piling into jeeps to give chase. From the side of the
house, more thugs appear on motorbikes.

                        ALEX
          They're coming after us.

                        DYLAN
                 (to Knox, confident)
          We were expecting that.

                        NATALIE
          Okay, new problem.

Everyone's attention WHIPS FORWARD to see the headlights of

GIANT LOGGING TRUCK

coming up the high mountain road. It straddles the
center line, blocking both directions. There's no way
around it.
                         NATALIE (CONT'D)
           Thoughts, suggestions, points to
           consider?

                        BOSLEY
          I don't suppose giving up would
          be a...

No, it wouldn't.   Then --

                         DYLAN
          Right!

                        NATALIE
          There is no right.

                         DYLAN
          There!

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                   38.

CONTINUED:

She points to a faded "CLOSED" sign that hangs from a
chain. In the darkness, who knows what it's blocking.
But as we hear the THUNDEROUS HORN from the oncoming
truck, we know there's no choice.

Natalie cuts a hard right, SMASHING through the sign.

The van THUMPS AND BUMPS its way across the low grass,
its headlights only showing ten feet ahead. At any
moment, the ground could stop in a cliff.

Like now.

The van leaps into empty space.      Tires spin, helpless.
The van falls.

Everyone SCREAMS.    Bosley is the loudest.

And then, touchdown. The van hits the ground, hard but
not catastrophically. Natalie hits the brakes, cuts the
wheel hard to avoid hitting

A CONCRETE WALL

in front of them.    Everyone takes a beat to acknowledge
they're alive.

                             DYLAN
             Where are we?

Suddenly, a BRIGHT LIGHT goes on overhead.

EXT. THE MOUNTAIN - NIGHT

One by one, a series of arc lights switches on, forming a
snake all the way to the bottom of the mountain.

INT. THE VAN - NIGHT

Looking out the back windows...

                           ALEX
             It's a bobsled run.

They're facing backwards.

Up ahead, the kidnappers are charging down the access roads.
The first of two jeeps makes the jump into the bobsled chute.

                           NATALIE
             If it goes down the mountain,
             that's all I need.

Throwing it into reverse, Natalie peels out.

The jeeps follow.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                               39.

EXT. BOBSLED RUN - NIGHT

The VW Van leads the way down the mountain, tail-first.
As it builds speed, it starts to climb the wall, each turn
getting steeper and steeper.

The two jeeps are following. Facing the right direction,
they have a much easier time of it.

INT. VAN - NIGHT

Everything is shaking so violently, it looks like a NASA launch.

                         ALEX
                  (looking out the back)
           Hard left! HARD LEFT!

Natalie makes the turn. The van rises up, nearly tilting
over. But they make it through the turn.

                         KNOX
                  (to Dylan)
           Is this part of the plan?

                         DYLAN
           Yes. Except for the bobsled run,
           and the backwards part, it's
           going exactly according to plan.

A beat.   He smiles at her.   He has a nice smile.

EXT. BOBSLED RUN - NIGHT

One of the jeeps makes a move, closing the distance to
the van. A RIFLEMAN leans out the passenger window,
lining up a shot. He FIRES.

INT. THE VAN - NIGHT

The shot blasts cleanly through the top of the windshield,
through the horn of Bosley's tuba, then out the back window.   It
missed hitting somebody by millimeters.

Natalie is still focused, making each turn as Alex calls it.

EXT. BOBSLED RUN - NIGHT`

The front jeep gets even more aggressive, building speed.

It hits the next turn too fast, rising up too high along
the wall. It tips further, and further, finally rolling
over onto its back. It SCRAPES across the concrete, a
shower of sparks as it slows down.

With nowhere to go, the second jeep brakes hard, but can't stop.
It SMASHES into the first jeep, a tangle of steel.
                                              (CONTINUED)

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                              40.

CONTINUED:

The combined mass continues sliding down the run, like a
jagged pinball in the chute.

INT. THE VAN - NIGHT

Dylan looks out through the windshield as the jeep combo recedes
farther and farther away.

                           DYLAN
             I think we're in the clear.

Just then, two MOTORBIKES race up along the chute walls, passing
the crippled jeeps. Two more MOTORBIKES jump in from above.

                             DYLAN
             Or maybe not.

Suddenly, Natalie GASPS, remembering something.

                             NATALIE
             Oh God, no.

                             DYLAN
             What is it?

EXT. EGYPTIAN THEATRE - NIGHT

A dejected Pete stands in front of the sign for the anime
festival, two tickets in hand.

WHIP BACK TO:

INT. THE VAN - NIGHT

                           NATALIE
             I have a date with Pete.   Right now.

                             DYLAN
             Ouch.

                             ALEX
             HARD RIGHT!

Natalie makes the hard right. The motorcycles are gaining on
them, but Natalie and Dylan have to talk through this first.

                           DYLAN
             Call him, he'll totally understand.

                           NATALIE
             "Gee, sorry Pete. I had to rescue a
             billionaire."

She makes the left.

                           NATALIE
             I'll sound like a flake.   I can't
             stand flakes.

                           DYLAN
             He will so give you the second chance.

                           NATALIE
             You think?

                           DYLAN
             Hello, I saw the way he looked at you.

One motorcycle charges, coming up just feet from the
windshield. Natalie taps on the brakes. The freaked out
guy can't slow down in time. He SMACKS into the windshield,
then goes flying.

                           ALEX
             We're at the bottom!

Indeed, we are. The concrete walls end, leaving open ground.
Slamming on the brakes, Natalie turns the van around.
Everyone goes flying. Bosley is still on the phone with
Charlie.

EXT. BASE OF THE MOUNTAIN - NIGHT

Back facing the right direction, the van charges onward.
The motorcycles race up to the passenger side, grabbing
for the door.

INT. THE VAN - NIGHT

Dylan SLAMS open the door, knocking one RIDER off.

The sliding door opens, another RIDER outside trying to get
in. Thinking fast, Knox grabs Bosley's tuba and shoves it
at the motorcyclist, who tumbles, taking out the fourth
rider in the process.

                           DYLAN
                    (genuinely impressed)
             Well done.

INT. THE HELICOPTER - NIGHT

Natalie is at the controls, Bosley beside her.      Alex leans
forward from the second row.

                           BOSLEY
             I think that went very well. Charlie
             should send me on more missions.

                           ALEX
             We couldn't have done it without
             you, Bos.

Natalie pats him on the arm. She and Alex exchange a quick
glance. They have to just laugh.

In the back row, Knox is looking out over the gorgeous lights
of Aspen.

                           DYLAN
             Cocktail?

She offers him an airplane-sized bottle of Johnnie Walker
black. He takes it and toasts. They both down their drinks
in a single shot. A smile, and then...

MUSIC rises.

THE ANGELS TRIPTYCH descends.

The act is over.    After a beat, we

             Good work, Angels. Not only did you

             Sorry, Angels.     Our work is only

Knox enters. Clean-shaven and neatly pressed, he's still a
darn good-looking man. Vivian Wu follows him.

             Meet your new client, Eric Knox.

             First off, thank you. You rescued
             me, for which I am eternally grateful.

He's talking to all the angels, but his gaze seems to fall
most upon Dylan. She notices it.

                           KNOX (CONT'D)
             But there's still a problem. Whoever
             kidnapped me wasn't just trying to
             screw up our IPO. They also stole
             the proprietary software for our new
             web browser. I'm sure it was Roger
             Corwin, but I need proof.

             That's where you come in, Angels.

             Sounds like a plan.

                           CHARLIE'S VOICE
             Not as easy as that, Natalie. Red
             Star's headquarters are as tightly
             guarded as a military facility.
             We're going to need reconnaissance
             on their mainframe computer system,
             and the best way to get that is
             through Mr. Corwin himself.

He moves to help her down, but she does a reverse-pullup to
handle it by herself. She leads the way...

INT. KNOX'S BEDROOM - DUSK

The room is huge. Through the floor-to-ceiling windows, we see
that we're up in the hills.

Knox follows her as she walks.

                           DYLAN
             I've got surveillance on all the windows.
             Don't answer the door, don't answer the phone.

We continue...

INT. KNOX LIVING ROOM - DUSK

Just as big, just as beautiful. Knox, or his decorator, has
great taste. Everything is top quality, but unpretentious.

                           DYLAN
             Also, stay away from the windows.

                           KNOX
             They're bullet-proof.   The last
             owner was paranoid.

                    (a smile)
             Lucky for us.

She takes a marker-sized device off the table.

             This is a panic button.
                    (tosses it to him)
             Press it and one of us can be here

             Which one of you?

                           DYLAN
             Whoever's closest.

She takes her jacket off the couch, ready to go.

                           KNOX
             I have a better idea.

             I'm a pretty good cook.

                           DYLAN

                    (quickly)
             I'm scared.

Dylan is surprised by this.

                           KNOX (CONT'D)
             Look, I didn't want to admit it, but I
             am. I was kidnapped once, and it wasn't
             fun. I know, you probably have other
             plans, but it would be very reassuring.

Dylan looks him over. Normally, she'd be suspicious, but
the guy WAS just kidnapped, and he seems sincere.

                           KNOX (CONT'D)
             Come on, don't make me beg. I'm
             embarrassed already.

She smiles.

                            DYLAN
             Don't be.

She throws her coat back on the sofa.

INT. KNOX LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

We PAN OFF a half-played Scrabble game to find Dylan and
Knox at the windows. Dylan picks up a family photo, Knox
as a little boy with a father in a military uniform.

                           DYLAN
             That's you, hunh? Cute kid.    Cute

             Thanks.

             It's the only picture I have of me with
             my parents. They died a week later.

             Please, don't apologize. I was too
             young to understand.
                    (looking at the photo)
             I never knew how they died. When I
             was a kid, when I got shuffled from
             one foster home to another, I always
             thought they just disappeared.

                            DYLAN
             But...?

                           KNOX
             I only found out later, my father was
             in the military. He and my mother were
             killed while he was on assignment,
             somewhere in Eastern Europe.
                    (mostly to himself)
             The files were classified, but I
             read enough to know that he was a
             good man. Apparently, he was
             betrayed by one of his own team.

                            DYLAN
             Wow.   That's a lot for a kid to live with.

                           KNOX
             Yeah, but it motivated me, losing my
             family. It still does. I don't take
             anything for granted.

Dylan nods.

                           DYLAN
             Boy did I have you pegged wrong.

                           KNOX
                    (intrigued)
             How do you mean?

                           DYLAN
             Well, to be honest, I thought you
             were a rich kid who inherited
             everything. But that's pretty typical.
             I've got instincts for the job, but
             when it comes to men? Well...

                           KNOX
             I'm glad you don't see me as just a client.

He brushes his hand against hers.     She brushes back, fingers

FORMULA-ONE RACE CARS

ROARING past on the track.       It's all thunder, smoke and
asphalt. We are...

EXT. SAN DIEGO SPEEDWAY - DAY

With a ROAR, another blur of racers whips past, with heat
and noise and speed. The lead car bears the familiar
markings of RED STAR INDUSTRIES. Roger Corwin is at the
wheel, steering calmly to a comfortable lead, when he is
suddenly BUMPED.

                              CORWIN

The racer pulls off her helmet as the pit crew surrounds her.
Of course, the racer is Natalie, aka BETTY LOU HOBERT, the Texas
Tornado.

             AND BACK ROADS! THIS ALL'S A PIECE A CAKE!

Natalie shakes out her hair, winks at the pit boss.

The Pit Crew races in to make repairs. DYLAN, dressed in a
pit suit, kneels by Natalie's front tire. Natalie crouches
down next to her so they can talk.

                           NATALIE (CONT'D)
             I nicked him. Should give you
             enough time to do the deed.

                             DYLAN
             I'm on it.

Dylan steals away, heading for...

CORWIN'S PIT CREW --

Corwin is seething mad as he pulls into his pit.

                             CORWIN
             LET'S GO!    WE'RE LOSING TIME HERE!

The pit repairs his car as Corwin is approached by another
racer, also wearing a Red Star racing suit. He leans into
Corwin's car and now we see that's it's... THE THIN MAN.

                           THIN MAN
             You okay, Boss?

The Thin Man peers over at Natalie, but she's got her
back to him.

                            THIN MAN
             Don't know.   I'll keep an eye out.

                            CORWIN
             Yeah.   You do that.

Corwin peels out onto the track again, almost crushing
the Thin Man in the process.

AS CORWIN PULLS OUT

Dylan sneaks in. In all the cacophony, no one notices
as she grabs CORWIN'S SUITCASE out of the back seat of
his regular car, a bitching Mercedes. She checks both
ways to see if she's being watched.

                           BOSLEY (O.S.)
             Coast is clear, Dylan.

             Let's make the switch.

BACK IN THE PIT --

Dylan pulls a briefcase out of her jumpsuit, and swaps
it with one in Corwin's car. She carefully switches all
his files from the old briefcase to the new one, then
gives Alex a thumbs up.

MEANWHILE BACK IN THE RACE --

NATALIE roars back onto the track, keeping Corwin in her
sights. Then she spots another Red Star car, coming up
right next to her. She locks eyes with the Thin Man.

The two of them recognize each other at the exact same
instant.

The Thin Man, realizing he's been made, jams on the
brakes and skids off to the right, which leads to a ramp
that heads out of the stadium.

Natalie, not wanting to lose him, does something crazy.
Even though she's at the front of the pack, she brakes
hard, swerves into a full 180 degree U-turn, and starts
heading the WRONG WAY on the race track.

Startled drivers pull off to the left and right as she
follows the Thin Man out of the racetrack.

EXT. SPEEDWAY ACCESS ROAD - DAY

To a chorus of CAR HORNS, the Thin Man's blue racer weaves
through the spectator traffic entering the speedway.

Looking back, we see Natalie is gaining on him.

Finally clear of the traffic, both cars let it rip.

HELICOPTER VIDEO FOOTAGE

Looking down on a freeway, where a ubiquitous police
pursuit is in progress.

             If you're just joining us, we're

             that has lead us all across the
             Southland, at speeds up to 80
             miles an hour.

A beat-up gray Chrysler leads a phalanx of police cars
down the empty freeway. It's oddly calm and hypnotizing.

                           FEMALE ANCHOR VOICE
             Chuck, time and again we hear the

             ram the other car, or shoot out the
             tires?" The LAPD has a policy of
             hanging back and following unless...

Suddenly, the blue Formula One car comes screeching past
the cops and the suspect, over 200 miles per hour.

He looks back at her. A beat later, she's passed him,
just taillights on the freeway.

EXT. FREEWAY - DAY

With the lanes cleared for the other chase, there is
nothing preventing the Formula One cars from hitting top
speed -- which they do.

Natalie is catching up to the Thin Man.

As they head under an overpass, we see KIDS CHEERING.

INT. BLUE CAR - DAY

The Thin Man checks his gauges. The gas dial is perilously
close to empty -- these cars are meant to be refilled often.

Up ahead, he sees an exit.   He starts to slow down...

EXT. FREEWAY - DAY

... but when you're going 200 miles per hour, that can
take a while. He misses the exit.

Natalie is trying to match his speed.

The Thin Man pulls over to the side, stops fully.
Braking as hard as she can, Natalie still passes him.

The Thin Man throws a U-turn, heading up the freeway on-ramp.

Natalie follows.

EXT. SAN DIEGO SHIPYARD - DAY

We catch glimpses behind fences and between train cars --
the two racers gliding slowly down the narrow roads, like
lions pacing.

INT. NATALIE'S RED CAR - DAY

Pulling off her helmet, Natalie scans right and left for
the blue car -- she's lost sight of him. The narrow
windshields of these racers doesn't make it any easier.

EXT. SHIPYARD - DAY

We LOOK DOWN on Natalie's car as she rounds a corner,
still searching.

EXT. PIER - DAY

Natalie spots the blue racer reaching the end of the
long pier. It pulls a U-turn to face her, then stops,
engine idling. There's only way off the pier, and it's
past Natalie.

The Thin Man REVS his engine.

Natalie REVS hers.

ANGLE ON a white seagull, pecking at something on the
pier, halfway between the two racers. The bird looks up,
hearing the engines.

ANGLE ON the Thin Man. He pulls his harness tighter.
REVS his engine higher.

ANGLE ON Natalie. If it's a game of chicken he wants,
she'll give it to him. She REVS her engine higher still.

The noise scares the bird, who suddenly flies off. Like
a flag being dropped, that's the signal for both racers
to peel out.

A cloud of SMOKE.    Rubber on asphalt.

Already reaching a tremendous speed, the racers are on a
collision course. The Thin Man isn't going to turn away.
Neither is Natalie.

Racing faster, and faster still, there's only one way
this can turn out. But then, at the very last moment,
the Thin Man wusses out. He cuts the wheel right,
missing Natalie and careening off the edge of the pier.

In SLOW MOTION, we watch as his racer hangs in mid-air,
wheels still spinning. Back-heavy, the tail hits the
water first.

Natalie brakes hard, cuts the wheel to avoid going off
the far end of the pier. She finally stops, the rear
tire just 1/4 inch from the edge.

CRANING UP along the side of the pier, we find Natalie
looking into the water where the blue racer went in.
There's just a slick of oil and a steady stream of bubbles.

                           ALEX
             Even if we do get inside, there won't
             be time to search for it. There's got
             to be a hundred terabytes of
             information there. It could take days.

                           NATALIE
             So you install a transmitter.

All eyes go over to Natalie.

                           NATALIE (CONT'D)
             Patch in directly to the relay,
             broadcast on a high frequency.
             That way, you can have access to
             the mainframe from the comfort of
             your own home. And they have no
             idea that you can peek inside.

Knox is impressed.    The other angels nod.   It's a good idea.

                           VIVIAN WU
             That's all fine in theory. But you
             still have to get inside that room
             to install it. What about security?

                           ALEX
             Red Star has a lot of Government
             contracts, so security is tight. Key-
             card badges throughout. Redundant
             security at all red-line areas with
             biometric scanners and weekly keycodes.
             Pervasive video surveillance, lasers,
             air-displacement sensors. Plus a hard-
             wired fail-safe at the relay to prevent
             exactly this kind of tapping.

                           VIVIAN WU
             It sounds impossible.

Alex checks with her fellow angels.    They're in agreement.

                           DYLAN
             It sounds like fun.

With a subtle RUSH, we move into a stylized MONTAGE that
shows How They Do It. It features WHIP PANS, FREEZE
FRAMES and ZOOMS to show us only the highlights.

                           NATALIE (V.O.)
             Only the two directors can disengage the
             fail-safe. We have to get their keys.

WHIP CUT TO:

INT. NUDE NUDE NUDE GIRLS - DAY

ANGLE ON DIRECTOR #1, 40's, part of the lunchtime crowd.
Alex and Natalie are on the catwalk, in the middle of a
grinding routine. Paying for his drink, he fumbles with
his wallet. His waitress helps him find the right bill.

As she walks away, we see the waitress is Dylan. FREEZE FRAME.
We ZOOM IN on the orange key-card she's grabbed from him.

EXT. BACK YARD BIRTHDAY PART - DAY

ANGLE ON Bosley, done up in full clown makeup. He tries
to twist a balloon animal, but no luck. Finally it POPS.
The CHILDREN CRY.

Entertaining the ADULTS, magician Alex whips open her silk
handkerchief to reveal that the "item" has disappeared.

ANGLE ON DIRECTOR #2, who looks very worried. Magician's
assistant Dylan takes off her giant hat to reveal the director's
billfold is underneath. Getting it back, he's
relieved.

Passing behind Dylan, Natalie takes the orange keycard
Dylan hands off. FREEZE FRAME. ZOOM IN.

                           ALEX (V.O.)
             Then we have to get back into Red
             Star. Problem is, their biometric
             sensors are too good.

                           DYLAN (V.O.)
             We need someone's help.

                                                 WHIP TO:

EXT. STREET OFF MULHOLLAND - DAY

ANGLE ON Roger Corwin, driving his Mercedes.     He slows,
a road crew working ahead.

ANGLE ON Dylan, dressed in an orange vest, manning the
slow/stop sign. She makes Corwin stop, leans in to
apologize for the delay.

Behind the Mercedes, Natalie sneaks up. She quickly
picks the trunk lock, then quietly climbs in. She hoists
in a large duffel bag, then shuts herself inside.

INT. TRUNK OF CORWIN'S MERCEDES - DAY

We HEAR the car moving again.

Stripped down to a bra, Natalie attaches an illuminated mirror
to the underside of the trunk lid. Starts to pull more items
from her duffel bag: black shoes, a dress shirt, a tie.

EXT. RED STAR - DAY

Establishing. We see Corwin's Mercedes pull into the
parking garage.

INT. PARKING GARAGE / RED STAR - DAY

Walking away from the car, Corwin hits the remote.    The
Mercedes BWOOPS.

A beat later, a hand comes out from under the trunk lid.
Natalie climbs out, only she's not Natalie anymore.

She's become Corwin -- identical to the last detail.

She tucks the last of the latex mask under her collar as
she walks. FREEZE FRAME.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                 57.

INT. SECURITY STATION - DAY

Corwin puts his right hand on the sensor grid.    A laser
scans it. Approved.

The Security Guard hits the button, releasing the gate.
He goes back to his magazine as Corwin passes through.
A beat, then...

                       A VOICE
          Tommy? You gonna let me through
          or what?

Tommy the Guard looks up, sees Corwin is still at the
counter.

                           TOMMY THE GUARD
                    (confused)
          Oh.     Yeah, sorry Mr. Corwin.

He hits the button again, letting Corwin through. Tommy
goes back to his magazine, still a little perplexed.

INT. SECURE HALLWAY - DAY

The same places we saw on the videotape. Natalie-as-
Corwin swipes the two stolen failsafe cards in a reader,
sending the lights from red to green. FREEZE FRAME.

She splices in a transmitter the size of a cigarette pack.
Pulls up a tiny antenna. FREEZE FRAME.

INT. SECURE HALLWAY - DAY

Corwin walks down the hall, still talking with his
colleague. Natalie-as-Corwin is walking right towards
them. She turns away as she passes. He didn't even spot
her.

She smiles.

EXT. POSH BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - DAY

Establishing...

INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

As a group, the angels move through the upscale lunch
crowd to find Knox and Vivian Wu at a booth.

Alex opens a slim Sony laptop, sets it on the table.

                        ALEX
          It's done. Red Star's mainframe
          is open for business.

they say is true.

                    (to a passing waiter)
             Champagne, please. Your best.

Smiling, Knox motions for them to take a seat.

                           KNOX
             Now I know why I hired you.   You're
             the best.

A look between the angels.      They know it's true.

                           VIVIAN WU
                    (to Knox, re: laptop)
             I'll have Systems get to work on
             this right away.

She reaches for the laptop.      Bosley snatches it away.

                           BOSLEY
             Uh, actually Miss Wu, WE will get to
             work on this right away. Any evidence
             we find will be turned over to you AND
             the proper authorities.

                           VIVIAN WU
             I don't think you understand how
             important that data is, Mr...

                           BOSLEY
             Oh, indeed I do. And that's why I'll
             take very good care of it when I find it.

                             VIVIAN WU
                      (reaching for the laptop)

                           KNOX
             Vivian, please. Do as the man says.

Reluctantly, Vivian Wu pulls her hand away. Bosley tucks
the laptop into a steel briefcase, then stands.

                           DYLAN
             Where you off to, Bos?

                             BOSLEY
             Vacation.

                           NATALIE
             Uh oh, lemme guess. You're off to
             chase bikinis at some tropical resort?

Dylan does a spit take, the other two Angels roll their eyes.

                            BOSLEY (CONT'D)
             Goodbye, Angels. Mr. Knox.
                     (coldly)
             Ms. Wu.

As Bosley exits the restaurant, Vivian Wu eyes him
carefully. Knox raises a glass to toast the Angels.

                           KNOX
             More champagne?

                            NATALIE

                    (to Dylan)
             And you?

She notices the other Angels staring at her.        She doesn't answer
at first.

                             DYLAN
             Um... well...

Natalie quickly picks up what's going on.        She glances at
Alex, then clears her throat.

                           NATALIE
             Hey Dylan, can we talk to you
             for a second?

THE LADIES ROOM

Natalie, Alex, and Dylan kibbitz near the sinks.

                           NATALIE
             What? She doesn't have ANY point, Alex,
             I can't believe you're siding with her.

                           ALEX
             I'm not siding with anyone, but
             technically, he is no longer...

                            DYLAN

They turn to look at her.

INT. PARKING GARAGE / BEVERLY HILLS - DAY

Bosley hums "In the Navy" to himself as he walks through
a parking garage. He's alone in the echo-y garage, and
everything we know about movies tells us This Means Trouble.

BWEEP BWEEP as his alarm shuts off. Just as he's about
to lift the handle, he stops. Looks back over his shoulder.

Did he hear something? He scans the empty garage.         No
one in sight. Must've been his imagination.

INT. BOSLEY'S MERCEDES - DAY

Bosley climbs in, shutting the door behind him.        He's
putting the keys in the ignition, when...

A HAND clamps a chloroformed rag over his mouth. It's
the Thin Man. Bosley struggles, but in moments, he's
unconscious.

THE THIN MAN stuffs Bosley in the trunk, slams it shut,
revealing...

                          VIVIAN WU (O.S.)
          Sweet dreams.

Vivian Wu, standing beside the Thin Man. She's holding
the case Bosley refused to give her before.

                        THE THIN MAN
          So, now we have the transmitter, what
          do we do with fat boy? Dirt nap time?

                        VIVIAN WU
          NO! Not until I've got the
          information I need. We'll take
          him to the compound, hold him there.
                 (beat)
          In the meantime, we've got to tie
          up some loose ends.

                        THIN MAN
          Whenever you say something like
          that, it means more work for me.

                        VIVIAN WU
                 (ignoring him)
          The Angels will figure out they
          were duped. We can't afford them
          jeopardizing our plans.

scene just outside the soundstage, visible through the
open loading door.

                           JASON (CONT'D)
             Fake guns, too. They're just
             setting up for the next scene.

He helps her up.

                           ALEX
             Sorry about that, I...

                           JASON
                    (smiling)
             God, I loved that. The way you
             yelled and everything? Baby, you
             been watching too many movies.
                    (he kisses her on the nose)
             Alright, I gotta go reset these.
             DON'T GO ANYWHERE. I want to
             finish this conversation.

As he walks out of the soundstage, Alex is left behind,
alone. She cleans herself off, shaking her head at her
own paranoia.

                            ALEX
             Nice, Alex.   Real nice.

THIPP!

A wall next to her sprays a cloud of plaster.     Alex looks
at the hole. That's strange.

THIP, THIP!

Two more little explosions, these barely missing her face.

                           ALEX (CONT'D)
             Hey, is someone firing more squibs
             or...

Suddenly, without warning, the wall is plastered with
SILENCED GUNFIRE. It's only Alex's instincts that let
her duck in time to avoid being turned into Swiss cheese.

She tucks and rolls behind a Styrofoam set as...

TWO GUNMEN with silenced SNIPER rifles fan out on the
fake city street.

ON ALEX --

crouched behind a wall.

She looks both ways. If she tries to break for the open
loading door, she'll lead the gunmen right back to Jason.
Only way out of here is to head for the far wall, all the
way across the building, where there's a fire exit.

Taking a deep breath, she darts across the fake street.

THE GUNMEN

fire at her, one of them pulling off his silencer and going
to machine gun mode. The sound of the gunshots are covered
by the sound of the effects guy, test firing guns outside.

ALEX --

Sees that the sets are held up by wooden support beams.
She lifts her leg and delivers a solid blow, cracking the
two-by-fours in half.

THE GUNMEN

move slowly through the fake street set. Suddenly, they
hear a creaking sound. They look up to see the whole,
fake building set collapsing!

They dive out of the way, just in time to see Alex race
through the fire doors.

EXT. BACKLOT - NIGHT

Alex races out of the soundstage and jumps into her car,
parked nearby. The Gunmen emerge from the stage and spot
her, just as she gets the car started. She peels out as
a hail of gunfire just misses her windshield.

EXT. OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE SOUNDSTAGE

Jason has just gotten his squibs refitted. He's facing
the opposite direction, so he doesn't see Alex's car
whizz away in the background.

INT. SOUNDSTAGE

Jason walks into the Soundstage, followed by the effects crew.

                            JASON
          Alex?     ALEX?

Of course, she's nowhere to be found. While he looks
around, one of the effects guys fingers a bullet hole in
the set wall. He presses against it and a FLATTENED
BULLET FALLS OUT.

He thinks for a moment, then shakes his head.   Couldn't be.

                                                CUT TO:

INT. EGYPTIAN THEATRE - NIGHT

A passing FILMGOER reveals Natalie and Pete. Seated near
the aisle, they share a giant tub of popcorn. The movie
hasn't started yet, but there's a slide show of various
anime heroes and villains.

                        NATALIE
          Thanks for the second chance. I
          swear, I'm really not a flake.

He shrugs it off.

                        PETE
          How can I deny any woman who's
          seen all 23 "Lords of Wind and
          Power"?

                        NATALIE
          I bet there's a dozen women here
          who fit that description.

She's right.

          Honestly -- there's a looks
          component as well.

             You're the most beautiful woman
             I've ever seen this close up.

How can she not be flattered by that? She would say
something back, but the moment has gotten so electrified
that each little glance just brings on more goofy-in-
loveness.

The only solution is to leave...

                             NATALIE
             Ladies room.    I'll be back in two minutes.

                             PETE
             I'll be here.

INT. LADIES ROOM - NIGHT

A wee bit smitten, Natalie enters as the last WOMAN leaves.

We hear just the DRIP DRIP DRIP of a faucet and the Muzak
version of Power Station's "Some Like It Hot."

NATALIE

IN A STALL

Natalie shuts the door behind herself, then sets to work
putting down a tissue-paper seat cover.

SWEEPING ACROSS THE FLOOR

We look under stall doors to find a pair of black men's
boots stepping down from inside. Natalie is not alone.

IN HER STALL

Natalie is about to hoist her skirt when she stops.         Her
Spider Sense is tingling.

A DOOR LATCH

CLICKS open. We TILT UP to see a WELL-DRESSED MAN.          He's
at least 6'3".

He stops at Natalie's stall door, drawing his gun.      A
beat, then he KICKS the door open, revealing...

AN EMPTY STALL.

The automatic toilet FLUSHES itself.      The Man takes a
half-step in, confused. Suddenly --

CONTINUED:

The door swings back, SMASHING into his right hand.     He
drops the gun, looking up to see

NATALIE,

Who is perched atop the stall walls.     She pushed the door
with her foot.

Grabbing an overhead pipe, she performs an acrobatic
swing, landing both feet on the guy's head. He falls
into the next row of stalls.

Natalie reaches for the gun, but the Man grabs her ankles.
He pulls her back across the tile floor, flipping her over.
That just makes it easier for her to kick him where it counts.

With a scissors lock around his neck, Natalie is pulled
up while the Man falls. She lands a knee on his windpipe.

                           NATALIE
             Who do you work for?

He tries to pull her off.    She leans in harder.

                           NATALIE (CONT'D)
             Speak now or never again.

                            THE MAN
                    (motioning with eyes)
             Jacket pocket.

Suspicious, she digs inside his coat to pull out a leather
billfold. Flips it open to reveal an I.D. that reads...

                           NATALIE
             National Security Agency?   You're with the NSA?

                           THE MAN
             I've been following you. I didn't
             know which side you were on.
                    (beat)
             This is bigger than you think.

INT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT

The anime classic is playing. Pete keeps looking back
towards the door. He's been ditched again. Just when he's
about to give up hope, Natalie is there.

                            NATALIE
             I'm so sorry, but I have to go. I
             can't explain.

EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT

Dylan and Knox walk hand in hand up a quaint, woodsy path
behind Knox's home. We can hear music drifting up from
the hill in front of them.

                           DYLAN
             Where's that music coming from?

                             KNOX
             You'll see.    Just a little farther.

He helps her up a steep part of the path.       As she comes
over the crest of a hill.

                              DYLAN
             Oh...
                       (taking in the view)
             Oh wow.

DYLAN'S POV --

The hill behind Knox's house has a magnificent view right
into the Hollywood Bowl. The music is the symphony
playing something very romantic.

                           DYLAN (CONT'D)
             That's amazing.

They stand there, together, just listening to the music,
Knox watching her reaction closely.

                           KNOX
             Can I ask you a personal question?

                              DYLAN
             Maybe.

                           KNOX
             How much do you know about Charlie?

Dylan seems surprised by this question.

                           KNOX (CONT'D)
             I just find it strange that you
             work for a man you've never met.

                           DYLAN
             Well, I don't know what he looks like,
             but I feel like I know him. We all do.

             Nope.

                           KNOX
             And you're never curious to find out?

She smiles t him, motioning for them to go back up to
Knox's house.

                           DYLAN (CONT'D)
             In fact, let's not talk at all.

                                                 WIPE TO:

INT. KNOX'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Dylan and Knox are asleep in his bed, when the doorbell
CHIMES. Dylan bolts upright. She slips out of bed, peers
out the window. Vivian Wu is waiting by the front door.

                           DYLAN
             Eric, it's Vivian.

                             KNOX
             Hmmm.    I wonder what she's here
             for?

                           DYLAN
             Want me to tell her to come back, or...

                           KNOX
             No, no.  I'd better deal.
                    (he kisses her)
             You go back to bed.

Knox pulls on a robe, goes downstairs.

STAY ON DYLAN --

as she pulls on her clothes, her CELL PHONE rings.     She
grabs it.

                             DYLAN
             Hello?

             Dylan, we were set up. Vivian Wu is not
             who she says she is. She's a former
             assassin and an all around bitch.

                            DYLAN
             Oh no.   OH SHIT. Natalie, she's HERE!

                            NATALIE
             What?!

                           DYLAN
             I'm at Knox's, she just showed up!

EXT. FREEWAY - NIGHT

Driving her own highly excellent car, Natalie has it floored.

INTERCUT

                           NATALIE
             I'm ten minutes away. Wait until I
             get there.

                           DYLAN
             I can't do that. Call Alex and meet
             me here.

                            NATALIE
             Dylan...

But Dylan's already hung up.     Cursing her partner, Natalie
races the car even harder.

INT. KNOX'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Knox is sitting at the coffee table, signing papers. Vivian,
sitting across from him, has her cell phone open. They are
both surprised to see Dylan walk into the room.

                           VIVIAN WU
             I see you take your bodyguarding
             services seriously. Still, I worry
             that no one is watching the door.

                    (covering)
             Oh, I'm watching it.     In fact, I just
             called for back up.

From her bag, Vivian pulls a silver 9MM.

                           VIVIAN WU
             All the same, I'm concerned about
             Mr. Knox's safety.

Although Knox is clueless, it's clear the message Vivian
is sending to Dylan. She's in control here.

Vivian sets the gun on the table, in easy reach.

                           KNOX
                    (explaining)
             Vivian just came over to run through
             some numbers for the IPO.

                           VIVIAN WU
             Please, take a seat. I'm almost
             finished.

With a knowing glance at Dylan, she goes back to her
phone call.

No alternative, Dylan takes a seat beside Knox.     Both face
Vivian, whose hand is very near the gun.

Dylan looks at Knox as he reads through his papers.    He has no
idea there's anything wrong.

                           VIVIAN WU (CONT'D)
                    (on phone)
             Really. How disappointing.

Vivian gestures to the abandoned Scrabble game on the table.
Why not play?

                           DYLAN
             I'm not much for games.

                            VIVIAN WU
             Pity.

As Knox flips pages in the report, Dylan casually begins
pushing Scrabble letters around, nothing serious. But she's
managed to spell...

ENEMY

She gets Knox's attention, looks to the word, up to Vivian.
Knox follows her intention, but doesn't seem to believe it.

While Vivian continues to talk on the phone, Knox sets his
report down. Pushes around some letters of his own. The
words finally come out as...

I   KNOW

CLOSE ON Dylan.      What does that mean?

Vivian snaps her phone shut.

             proceeding apace.

Dylan stands up.    What the hell is going on?

Vivian draws the gun on her.    Knox moves over toward
Vivian's side.

                           KNOX
             Sorry Dylan. I knew this moment
             would come sooner or later. I was
             just hoping for later.

A long beat, Dylan trying to wrap her head around this.

                           DYLAN
             All this time, we thought Red Star
             was behind this, but it was you.
                    (realizing)
             You faked your kidnapping.

Knox taps his nose.    She's got it.

                           DYLAN (CONT'D)
             Why?

                           KNOX
             To gain your trust. And get your
             help.
                    (beat)
             I want you to know, my personal
             attraction to you was a sincere
             and unrelated complication.

                           DYLAN
             Oh, well, in that case I feel a lot
             better about you being a lying pole
             smoker.

Dylan looks like she's about to leap forward and tear Knox's
throat out. Vivian gestures for Dylan to keep stepping back.

                           DYLAN (CONT'D)
             I can't believe I trusted you.

                           KNOX
             Why not? You trust Charlie and you've
             never even met him.

Dylan crosses the sill, out onto the balcony.

             Goodbye, Dylan, I'll miss you...

How right he is, because as soon as Vivian squeezes the
trigger...

Dylan drops to the floor, then rolls.

BLAM!

the bullet misses Dylan and slams into the bulletproof window
causing a spider-web crack to spread. Dylan sees her
opportunity and heads right for the window while Vivian
pumps off shots.

As she comes to the window, Dylan jumps up in the air and
does a flying kick, hitting right at the spot where the
bullet impacted.

SMASH!

The bulletproof glass shatters outward, and Dylan flies out
the window, onto the ledge.

                            KNOX (CONT'D)
             Wow.
                    (to Vivian)
             I've never seen YOU do something
             like that.

                            VIVIAN WU
             Oh, shut up.

                                                   CUT TO:

EXT. BALCONY - NIGHT

Dylan looks over the edge of the balcony. The drop-off is
incredibly steep -- the house is built on stilts -- and the
fall looks like it would kill her. But she doesn't have
much choice.

KNOX AND VIVIAN

come running out onto the balcony, just in time to see Dylan
jump. They rush to the edge, look down into a forbidding
thicket of trees.

                           VIVIAN WU
             She can't have survived.   It's too far.

             Still, I should probably check...

Knox shakes his head.

                           KNOX
             We've got more important things to do.

The two of them head back inside.    As they do...

We hold on the railing, then slowly start to drift down, to
the underside of the balcony. Dylan has attached her belt to
the bottom of the railing, and is hanging in the rafters. As
she pulls herself back up...
                                              WIPE TO:

EXT. AIRPORT -- NIGHT

A black sedan pulls onto the tarmac. Knox and Vivian Wu emerge,
then hustle into a waiting private plane.

INT. ANGELS DETECTIVE AGENCY

Natalie, Dylan and Alex nurse their wounds and compare notes.

                           DYLAN
             I can't believe Knox tried to kill me.
             I mean, I've been lied to, I've been
             cheated on, but no guy has ever
             tried to SHOOT me before.
                    (coldly)
             I'm gonna get him for that.

                           ALEX
             He played us from the very start.
             It was all just so he could get us
             to tap into Red Star. He couldn't
             figure out a way to do it himself.

                           NATALIE
             Who knew that we are actually
             tapping into the main servers for
             The National Security Agency?

                           DYLAN
             And now, thanks to us, he's had hours
             to download whatever top secret
             information he wants, for God knows
             what reason.

The angels take a beat to let their indignation grow.

             What?

             That laptop was the only way to access

They look at each other...

             Bosley!

And on that note...

EXT. BEACHFRONT COMPOUND - FLORIDA COASTLINE - DAY

We PUSH IN over the water to reveal the massive complex -- half-
villa, half-castle. Built into the green hills, it's
flanked by oversized windmills.

EXT. STAIRCASE -       DAY

Armed guards, as if they were necessary, make sure no one
goes up or down a staircase that leans up into the tower,
where their dangerous prisoner is being held.

INT. COMPOUND TOWER - DAY
Bosley's cell, as such, is a round room.

Bosley flits about in a panic. He's hardly touched the gourmet
food on his tray. Except for the pudding. He loves pudding.

JUMP CUT TO:

Still a-twitter, Bosley flips through the 500 channels on
his big-screen TV. He watches a few moments of E!

JUMP CUT TO:

As the Thin Man takes the tray away, Bosley suddenly attacks
him with the silverware. With a single hand to Bosley's
forehead, the Thin Man holds him at arm's length, harmless.
He takes the weapons away.

JUMP CUT TO:

Bosley WHISTLES to a bright red songbird who has landed
on the windowsill. The bird WHISTLES back. Bosley thinks
they're having a conversation.

Bosley is going a little insane.

JUMP CUT TO:

In his spacious bathroom, Bosley is sitting on the toilet,
rocking as he makes spaceman noises.

We hear a PLOP in the water, and then a BLEEP BLEEP.

Curious, he stands up and looks in the bowl.      He's surprised
by what he sees.

                                                  CUT TO:

Alex is on the phone, frantically dialing numbers.

                           ALEX
             Come on, Bosley, answer.
                    (she hangs up, then,
                     to the Angels)
             I've tried all his numbers and paged
             him five times. No answer.

                           NATALIE
             I don't even want to think about
             what I'm thinking right now.

                           DYLAN
             Don't!  He's alive, he's gotta be.   If...
                    (she pauses)
             What IS that?

There's a very faint voice coming from Bosley's desk drawer.
Dylan walks around the desk, yanks it open...

                            BOSLEY (O.S.)
             Angels!   Angels, can you hear me!

Dylan grabs the radio receiver from the drawer, holds him up.
Bosley's voice gets louder.

                           BOSLEY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
             I don't know if you can hear me. I don't
             know if this thing is even working.

The Angels crowd around Dylan and the receiver.     It seems
impossible.

EXT. COMPOUND TOWER - DAY

CLOSE ON a satellite mini-dish mounted to the roof. We CRANE
DOWN to look in a tower window, where Bosley is hunched over
the TV.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                77.

INT. COMPOUND TOWER - DAY

On the top of the TV, a wire runs from the satellite feed to --

THE TINY RADIO

that Bosley swallowed at the spa.   It's worked its way
through his system.

                         BOSLEY
           I know you can't answer, but... I
           really hope you can hear this.

EXT. RUINS OF TOWNSEND AGENCY - DAY

The angels still can't believe they're hearing his voice.

                         DYLAN
           Can we trace him?

                         NATALIE
           Not off a boosted signal. We'd
           have to be within 20 miles.

                         ALEX
           Come on, Bosley. Tell us where you are.

INT. COMPOUND TOWER - DAY

                         BOSLEY
           I don't know where I am, really. I'm
           in a round room. The walls are white.
           Well. Not white-white. More of a
           cream, or an eggshell. Vanilla. Yes,
           I'm going to say vanilla.

INTERCUT

This isn't helping.

                         BOSLEY (CONT'D)
           I can see the ocean.

                         ALEX
           Bingo.

Dylan finds a globe amid the wreckage.     Wipes off the soot.

                         BOSLEY
           I don't know which ocean. I was
           blindfolded the whole time. We were
           flying. It must've been three or
           four hours. Maybe more.

flown. Estimates the circumference.

                    (frustrated)
             He could be anywhere in North America.

The bird Bosley was whistling to lands on the TV, looks
at the transmitter, curious. SINGS its song.

                           BOSLEY
             Wherever it is, they have really
             good pudding.

Natalie holds up a finger -- stop.

The bird SINGS its song again.      Natalie smiles.

             Hear that? That's a blue spotted

Knox and Vivian walk into a fully macked computer room,

at Bosley's laptop.

             on the man known as Charles Townsend.

Knox smiles.    Takes the print-out.

             Finally.
                    (beat)
             How about Bosley? Did we get the

             Once we we drugged him, he sang like a bird.

The Thin Man hands Knox another print-out.

             Hmmm. Miami Arena.    Preparations

             Well?    No time like the present.

The Thin Man nods.

The Thin Man cocks his gun as he heads to the tower to do
away with Bosley. Then...

WE SEE DYLAN, dressed in a black cat suit, as she rewires
a security camera. She glances around, making sure no
one sees her.

             Um, excuse me?     I think you're
             trespassing.

She whips around to see the Thin Man, standing right
behind her. She instantly swings at him, he blocks it.
She's about to swing again when five guns get cocked
against her temple. She's surrounded by guards.

NOW --

The thin man and his boys lead Dylan into the house.

             No offense, but as "storming the

Dylan glares at him, and as she does...

We move in CLOSE ON Dylan's funky belt buckle.       There's a
tiny camera concealed there.

             Dylan, how nice. Welcome to my
             Florida home. Not as tasteful as
             the one in LA, but much more private.

She shrugs off the goons -- enough already.

                           DYLAN
             So tell me, Knox, what's the brilliant
             plan? You gonna sell a list of our
             foreign spies to the highest bidder?
             Blackmail the President?

                           KNOX
             The first plan is too complicated,

             You know what? I'm not in a gabby mood
             right now. I've got a score to settle.

He flips shut a suitcase filled with C-5 explosive, the
same stuff we saw Pascal selling in the opening scene.

                           DYLAN
             Seems like you're going a bit overboard.

                           KNOX
             No, just leaving myself plenty of
             margin for error. Goodbye, Dylan.

With that, he walks out of the room.

The Thin Man signals to the Henchmen. Two of them force
Dylan to sit in one of the wooden deck chairs.

Then, with the thick packing tape, they begin binding her
arms to the arms of the chair. As they do:

                           DYLAN
             I don't know why you bother.   I've
             already won.

                            THIN MAN
             Is that so?

                           DYLAN
             Every moment I sit here is a
             moment I'm using to figure out how
             to take you down. In fact, this
             statement -- this one I'm making
             right here-- is just me stalling
             for time while I decide which of
             your goons I'm going to flatten
             first.
                    (whispering)
             It's gonna be the guy behind me.

The Thin Man can't help but be amused. After all, there
are six guards and one blonde -- who is now taped to a
chair.

                           THE THIN MAN
             Really?

                            DYLAN
             By the time your guys are firing,
             I'll be at about 180 on my reverse
             inverted 360, which will land me
             on Fat Boy there, as promised.
                     (nods to the second guard)
             He'll take the chair seat in the
             chin.
                     (re: two others; very slowly)
             Now... I'm warning both of you:
             I'm going to get you to shoot each
             other. I know. Cliche as that
             sounds.
                     (then to the last two)
             Last, you guys -- hell, I'll make
             something up. We'll have fun.

The Thin Man smirks oh-so-confidently.

                           THE THIN MAN
             And what will you do to me?

                            DYLAN
             You won't even be here. I mean, I
             don't want to tell you how to do
             your job, but you should've killed
             me by now. Because I already know
             that your people are onto my
             people, which means any moment now
             you're going to be called out to
             go and deal --

Suddenly the door flies open and --

                           DYLAN (CONT'D)
             Ah!   See?

                           HENCHMAN AT THE DOOR
             We have intruders.

With a glare to Dylan, the Thin Man follows him out.

INT. UNDERWATER GROTTO

Alex, dressed in a sexy bikini, emerges from the water
and instantly takes out two guards.

EXT. SMALL GARDEN - DAY

NATALIE hang-glides into a courtyard, knocking out two
henchmen as she does. Alex catches up with her, as
Natalie pulls out a small scanner.

                             ALEX
             You find him.    I'll get Dylan.

Natalie heads left.     Alex goes right.

INT. TOWER OFFICE - DAY

Racing up the stairs, Natalie enters a round room with
open windows on all sides. A gentle breeze stirs the
curtains. There's an amazing 360 degree view, from hills
to ocean.

According to her scanner, Bosley should be here, but
there's no one.

                           NATALIE
                    (yelling)
             BOSLEY! Bosley, can you hear me?

INT. BOSLEY'S ROUND ROOM      DAY

Hearing her voice, the feral Bosley looks up.

                            BOSLEY
             Natalie!   Is that you?

INT. TOWER OFFICE - DAY

She hears him. She keeps yelling -- so does he -- until
they both realize that his room is above hers.

                           NATALIE
             How do I get up to you?

                           BOSLEY
             There's a staircase. Look for a
             switch.

She begins frantically checking the desk, the shelves,
everything.

Her cell phone RINGS.     She answers it.

                           NATALIE
             Hello?... Pete, hi! How are you?

INT. BILTMORE HOTEL - DAY

On break, Pete is talking on a pay phone.

                           PETE
             I'm good. I just -- you said you
             wanted me to call.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                85.

INT. TOWER OFFICE - DAY

Natalie keeps checking the shelves, looking for a secret
switch.

                          NATALIE
           I did. I do.    I mean, thank you
           for calling.

INTERCUT

                         PETE
           I'm not an insecure person or anything,
           and I've really enjoyed the very brief
           time we have spent together.

Two GOONS race up the stairs into the office.   Natalie
turns to face them.

                         PETE (CONT'D)
           I'm just wondering if it's
           something I said or did that's
           making this whole thing so weird
           between us.

The Goons approach.

                         NATALIE
                  (into phone)
           Can you hold on a sec?

Hitting MUTE, Natalie kicks the chair behind her and dives
under the desk. She comes up on the other side with a

SURGE SUPPRESSOR,

electric cords attached. She backhands it into the
goons, who jerk and twitch as electricity shoots through
their bodies.

                         NATALIE (CONT'D)
                  (un-muting)
           One more sec.

She re-mutes.

With a roundhouse kick, she flattens one of the goons,
WHACKS the other with the cell phone.

The first goon charges at her, but she sidesteps at the
last moment, leaving Goon One to hit Goon Two. Both men
topple through the open window, falling. Yikes.

                         NATALIE (CONT'D)
                  (un-muting)
           Sorry about that.

             Listen, is this a bad time?

                            NATALIE
             No.   Not at all.

She starts searching again for the switch.

                           PETE
             You just sound distracted.

                           NATALIE
             You know, work this week has been
             really busy. It's been hard to focus.

BEHIND NATALIE, Vivian Wu reaches the top of the stairs.
She moves stealthily. Natalie has no idea she's there.

                           NATALIE (CONT'D)
             See, the thing is, I'm not a full-
             time waitress. I should have been
             more up-front about that, it's just...

At the last moment, Natalie catches a moving reflection
in a shiny trophy. Turns to find Vivian Wu swinging an
antique chair at her head.

She ducks.    The chair SHATTERS the display case.

Scrambling to get away, Natalie drops the phone.

                           PETE
             Natalie, what was that?

                           NATALIE
                    (yelling to phone)
             Everything's fine!

                           VIVIAN WU
             Hate to disagree.

Vivian upends the desk, nearly crushing Natalie. Vivian
jumps on top, ready to kick the shit out of our angel.

As we probably suspected, Vivian Wu is one hell of a
martial artist. Fortunately, so is Natalie.

In their first series of blows, Vivian seems to have the
upper hand, but Natalie rallies hard. Vivian surprises
her with a floor-sweeping kick, knocking her down.

Vivian grabs the phone off the floor.

                           VIVIAN WU (CONT'D)
             Is this the famous Charlie?

             No, it's Pete.

Vivian looks at the phone. Who the fuck cares?      She
throws the phone out the open window.

Getting up, Natalie stares her down, incredulity building
to rage.

                            NATALIE
             You bitch!   I like that guy.

Mocking, Vivian wipes away a tear.

Natalie lets forth a typhoon of fury, a full-out Mortal
Kombat. Vivian is thrown back against the bookcase,
where she knocks over a candlestick.

That's the trigger for the bookcases to begin sinking
into the floor. Circling around the room, each set of
shelves drops to a different level, forming steps that
lead to the upstairs room.

As Natalie and Vivian continue to fight, Bosley sticks
his head down from above, watching the brawl. Natalie is
kicking ass.

                           NATALIE (CONT'D)
                    (to Vivian)
             Do you have any idea how difficult it
             is to find a quality man in Los Angeles?

She slams Vivian into the wall.      Grabs her again, hands
around her head.

                             VIVIAN WU
             To be honest?

Vivian suddenly leans forward and KISSES her, right on
the lips.

                             VIVIAN WU (CONT'D)
             I don't care.

Natalie is surprised for a moment, which gives Vivian the
chance to swing at her. She misses.

                           NATALIE
             I can handle villainy. I can even
             handle super-villainy.
                    (Vivian swings and
                     misses again)
             But what you did is just wrong.

She head-butts Vivian, knocking her out cold.   She throws
the limp body on the floor.

A beat, then Natalie looks up to see Bosley.

                           NATALIE (CONT'D)
                    (suddenly chipper)
             Hi, Bos!

He waves.

EXT. VERANDAH - DAY

From below, we hear SECURITY WHISTLES. The compound has been
breached. Dylan looks at the six armed guards surrounding her.

                           DYLAN
             Here we go.

And now she does exactly what she told the Thin Man she'd do:

She pitches forward, ducking her head so the chair's back
crashes into the railing, tearing it off. She stands.

                           DYLAN (CONT'D)
             Okay, that part worked.

The Guards FIRE -- but Dylan has already launched herself
from the railing into that backflip, which lands her on
the head of --

Fat Boy, flattening him bad, and smashing the rest of the
chair into kindling. She grabs the wooden seat and whips
it up, catching bullets from Guard #3 before flinging it
like a Frisbee at Guard #2, nailing him right on the chin.

Quickly she stands again, between Guards #3 and 4.

                           DYLAN (CONT'D)
             Now, guys, I warned you. This is
             where you shoot each other.

The two men scoff, disbelieving. Then Dylan does a head
fake, both Guards panic, and fire, but Dylan drops, leaving
each man a clear shot at the other. Both gape. Both fall.

Just Guards #5 and 6 left.    Dylan's chair arms are still
taped to her forearms.

                           DYLAN (CONT'D)
             Okay, here's where we improvise.

In a whirl, she overhead-chops Guard #5. Drives her
right arm into his shoulder while swinging her left arm
into the back of the Guard #6's head.

A few more blows, then both men fall.

Now Dylan drops into a second chair, half-exhausted,
half-amused with herself. Has one brief beat to take it
all in, then --

Bosley steps onto the veranda, sees Dylan sitting in the
chair.

FROM HIS POINT OF VIEW: It looks like Dylan -- whose
arms are still strapped to the arms of the first chair --
is taped to the chair she now sits in.

                           BOSLEY
             Oh my God, let me help you.

Bosley hurries over, "freeing her." Amused, Dylan lets
him. Natalie steps out from inside, pausing to KICK one
guard who was starting to revive.

                                                   CUT TO:

Knox, carrying the briefcase bomb, gets into his waiting
helicopter, followed closely by the Thin Man.

The helicopter quick ascends, just as...

                           DYLAN
             You don't understand. He's got a
             pound of C-5 in that briefcase.

                           BOSLEY (O.S.)
             Miami.

The three angels turn to see Bosley, huffing and puffing
his way into the courtyard.

             Because Angels, I was the one who
             purchased those tickets.

Bosley lowers his head.    Suddenly all the angels understand.

                           ANGELS
             CHARLIE!

They race out the courtyard, in hot pursuit.

Racing across the water, we find thong-clad BEACH BABES
moving to a Latin beat. Art Deco buildings flank sun-kissed
streets. The people are sexy, the daiquiris strong, and every
night's a fiesta -- Welcome to MIAMI.

Running down the street, towards Miami Arena, the three
angels pass THREE OTHER WOMEN rollerblading by: JILL
MONROE, SABRINA DUNCAN and KELLY GARRETT.

Nothing is said, but a cool moment just happened.

The three Angels are running down a very long hallway.
Their voices are the only sound that echoes off these
walls, although there is a faint humming that grows louder
as they approach two, metal fire doors.

INT. MIAMI ARENA - NIGHT

We reverse angle to reveal the inside of Miami Arena. The first
thing that hits us is the WALL OF SOUND, the noise made
by twenty thousand people in a basketball induced frenzy.

The next thing that hits us is the sheer magnitude of the
job facing the Angels. Hard to spot? The crowd is one,
enormous, teeming mass of brightly colored humanity.

                              DYLAN
             Aw, shit.

The game is in progress, Duke vs. North Carolina, and it's a
barn burner. A one point game with six minutes to go. BALL
PLAYER pulls up and swishes a three pointer, Duke by two.
The crowd goes apeshit.

BY THE MEZZANINE

The Angels huddle, yelling over the deafening noise of the
crowd...

                           DYLAN (CONT'D)
             We have to split up!
                                                   (CONTINUED)

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                               92.

             I'll take the luxury boxes.

                           DYLAN
             I'll take the mezzanine.

                           NATALIE
             I got the floor.

They split up. Dylan leads the charge down the loge section,
blowing past the SECURITY WOMAN, who yells after her.

INT. ARENA FLOOR - NIGHT

BEHIND THE RIM, COLLEGE PLAYER #2 pulls down a brick, slams
home the rebound. The crowd ROARS.

INT. LUXURY BOXES --

JASON GIBBONS, famous movie star and North Carolina alumnus,
pumps his fists in the air. His luxury box is loaded with
fellow Tar Heels and nameless studio executives. He
repeatedly high fives a Hollywood type in sunglasses and Armani.

                               JASON
             Yes, yes!

When suddenly, the door to the luxury box is flung open.

                           ALEX
                    (yelling)
             Charlie!? Charles Townsend!

Jason whips around and locks eyes with Alex.

                               JASON
             Alex?

                               ALEX
             Jason?
                      (beat)
             Shit.

Realizing she has no time to explain, and that Charlie isn't
in here, she turns and leaves.

                               JASON
             ALEX!    Hey...

While everyone watches, confused, Jason pushes his way
through the box and follows Alex into the hall.

                                               CUT TO:

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                               93.

INT. ARENA -- MEZZANINE

Dylan races past rows of seats, pissing off plenty of fans
in the process.

                        DYLAN
                 (looking everywhere)
          Charlie! Charlie!

FLASHES FIRE

in the stands.

STATISTICIANS

scribble at their monitors. Natalie runs behind them,
scanning the crowd. WHIP PANS, from ONE MAN to ANOTHER to
ANOTHER. Stopping on a likely candidate...

                              NATALIE
          Charlie?

                              LIKELY CANDIDATE
          Who?

THE SCOREBOARD CLOCK

counts down.    :60.   :59.    :58.

INT. LUXURY BOXES - NIGHT

Alex bursts in.   It's a crowd of fifteen cocktail-drinking
BUSINESS MEN.

                        ALEX
          Charles Townsend? Anybody, Charles
          Townsend?

She ducks back into the hallway.

INT. HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS

Alex walks out into the hallway, frustrated.     Then,
miraculously, she spots him...

KNOX.

He walks out of one of the luxury boxes, holding a large,
metal briefcase. He heads for the elevator.

ALEX

immediately goes to intercept him, but...

                              THIN MAN (O.S.)
          Don't move.

It's the Thin Man, standing behind her, with a gun in
her back.

                           THIN MAN (CONT'D)
             You move, you say anything, I
             perforate you. Got it?

Knox glances back at the Thin Man, nods to him.      Then he
gets in the elevator.

The Thin Man starts edging Alex towards some emergency exit
doors, gun still in her back. Alex is trying to think of an
escape, quickly. She knows that the second he gets her out
of this public space, he's gonna shoot her. The door gets
closer and closer...

                            JASON (O.S.)
             Alex?!   Jesus, what is going on?

The Thin Man and Alex turn around to face Jason, who is
sweaty and exasperated from chasing her.

                           ALEX
             Jason, hi, I...

The Thin Man digs the gun deeper into her back.

                           ALEX (CONT'D)
             Can I talk to you later?

                           JASON
             No you can talk to me NOW. I want
             to know what the hell is going on.
             First, you disappear with no
             explanation, not even a goodbye.

                           ALEX
             I'm sorry, I...

                           JASON
             Now, I see you here, but you're
             with some other guy.

                           THIN MAN
             Hey, movie star, do yourself a
             favor and get lost.

Jason double takes.     He's not used to someone talking to
him like that.

                            JASON
             Lemme guess.   You must be Charlie?

                           ALEX
             Jason, please...

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                               95.

CONTINUED:
                           JASON
             No, no I'm sick of this shit. I'm
             sick of this asshole telling you
             what you can and can't do.

And then, with no warning, he hauls off and punches the
Thin Man.

Now, Jason's just an actor, not an ass-kicking super
detective, so his punch isn't all that great. In fact, it
leaves Jason shaking his hand in pain.

The Thin Man, a trickle of blood running from his lip, smiles.

                           THIN MAN
             That was stupid.

First, he pops Jason right in the jaw. Jason stumbles
backward, dazed. Then he reaches for his gun, in the
process, loosening his grip on Alex...

                           ALEX
             Jason, get down!

Alex spins out of the Thin Man's grasp and does a full
roundhouse kick, knocking the gun out of the Thin Man's
hands. The Thin Man immediately responds, throwing two
quick punches, which Alex expertly blocks and then follows
with a hitch-kick to the chin.

Jason, dazed and confused, thinks he must be hallucinating.

                           JASON
             What the hell is going on?

What's going on is a world class ass-kicking, courtesy of his
girlfriend. While the action star watches in amazement, Alex
unloads an arsenal of bad ass kung fu moves that would make
Jet Li green with envy.

The Thin Man doesn't stand a chance. A flying side kick
sends him stumbling backwards into the stairwell. We
follow the fight...

INT. STAIRWELL -- CONTINUOUS

... to the first landing. The Thin Man, battered and bruised,
reaches down to his ankle holster to get his spare gun, but
Alex is too fast for him. She stamps on his hand, then
drops a knee to his throat.

                           ALEX
             Right now, just by leaning forward, I
             could crush your windpipe. You'd die
             a slow and painful death. You don't
             want that, do you?

                           ALEX (CONT'D)
             Where is the bomb, when's it going off?

She presses harder.

INT. HALLWAY

Jason slams out into the stairwell, looking for Alex. He
finds her on her walkie talkie, the Thin Man handcuffed
to the staircase.

                            ALEX
             Hi, Jason.   Gimme one second?

Jason nods, sure.

We go to another triptych, all three Angels on their cell
phones in different parts of arena.

                           ALEX (CONT'D)
             Angels! Knox planted the bomb in the
             basement, and it's timed to go off
             when the game clock hits zero!

                           NATALIE (O.S.)
             Roger that, Alex, I'll stop the clock!

                           DYLAN (O.S.)
             I'll look for the bomb!

Alex turns back to Jason. He's clearly having a difficult
time processing everything he's just seen.

                           ALEX
             I lied to you Jason.    I'm not a
             secretary.

                           JASON
             Yeah, I can see that.

                           ALEX
                    (referring to the
                     Thin Man)
             And that wasn't Charlie.

                            JASON
             Right.

                           ALEX
             I'm actually here to stop a madman
             from killing everyone in this
             building. Would it be okay if we
             talked later?

             I'll be waiting for you.

Alex smiles.    Runs off.

INT. ARENA

Natalie stares up at the clock... :30.       :29.

The WHISTLE BLOWS.

                            REFEREE
             Time out!

Whew, that was close. But it'll start up any second.       She
has to keep it stopped. But how? She glances to the
sidelines and gets an idea.

ON THE COURT --

MUSIC starts from overhead, the respective teams' cheerleaders
coming out for one last routine.

As they kick into gear, Natalie comes out with them, dressed
as a Duke cheerleader. She follows along with the dancers, a
bit timid at first, then more confident as she gets into it.

INT. ARENA BASEMENT -- BENEATH THE COURT

Dylan races through the basement, looking for the briefcase.
Then she spots it, hooked into some wires that snake up
into ceiling above.

Dylan approaches it cautiously.       She slowly opens the top...

                           DYLAN
                    (to herself)
             Alright, Dylan, all we have to do is
             figure out which wire to cut.

REVEAL THE BOMB --

there are about fifty different wires, in every color in
the Crayola box.

                            DYLAN (CONT'D)
             Oh, shit.

INT. COURTSIDE

Alex, still searching for Charlie, notices something strange.

                           ALEX
             You're kidding me.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                98.

NATALIE

is fully transformed on the court, from wallflower to full-
out cheerleader. It's not that she's as good as the other
cheerleaders. She's better.

ON THE COURT

The SONG ends. The Cheerleaders vacate the court, but Natalie
keeps dancing her heart out. She has 18,000 fans watching
her, and she's totally in the moment. But there's another
agenda as well...

                        COURTSIDE RADIO ANNOUNCER
          The time out is over, but one
          cheerleader doesn't seem to notice.
          Officials can't start the clock again
          while she's on the court.

                                                CUT TO:

INT. MIAMI ARENA -- CONTINUOUS

Dylan has picked two wires.

                        DYLAN
          Chartreuse and magenta.   This has
          gotta be it.

She prepares to snip them with her wire cutters, when...

                        KNOX (O.S.)
          I wouldn't do that, if I were you.

She spins to see Knox, standing behind her.

                        KNOX (CONT'D)
          See, if you snip ANY of those wires,
          the bomb WILL blow up.

                        DYLAN
          It's gonna blow anyway, once the
          clock gets to zero.

                        KNOX
          Who told you that, my idiotic
          henchman? Do you think I tell him
          ANYTHING that's confidential?

He holds up a small TRIGGERING DEVICE. It's the same one
we saw Pascal try to sell in the opening scene.

                        KNOX (CONT'D)
          THIS is what triggers that bomb.     So
          if you'll kindly step away, I'll
          refrain from killing both of us.

Realizing she has no choice, Dylan stands up and backs away.

                        KNOX (CONT'D)
          In different circumstances, Dylan, I
          think you and I could have worked out.
          We have a lot in common.

                        DYLAN
          Yeah, I fall for assholes, and you
          ARE one.

Knox laughs.

                        KNOX
          Good one.
                 (beat, as he backs up)
          Well, I must be going. If you like
          your body parts attached to your
          torso, I suggest you do the same.

Knox turns to go, but the other Angels are blocking his way.

                        ALEX
          Give it up, Knox. You're surrounded.

                        NATALIE
          Give us the detonator.

                        KNOX
          NO!

Stumbling backwards, Knox holds it up high.

                        KNOX (CONT'D)
          I'll blow this building sky high, I swear!

                        CHARLIE (O.S.)
          Don't do it, Eric. It's me you want,
          not all these innocent people.

Everyone turns, as one, to a figure emerging from the shadows.

                        KNOX
          Charlie?

That's right, it's Charlie. Finally, after all these years,
we get a look at him, and boy is it... disappointing.

He's not what we expected. Short, portly, dressed in a
"We're #1" t-shirt; the Angels are absolutely floored by
Charlie's appearance.

                        ANGELS
          Charlie?

Charlie ignores their stares and addresses Knox directly.

             Your father was a double agent, Eric.
             Yes, I revealed him, but he was killed
             by his own people before we could
             throw him in jail.
                    (beat)
             He was my friend.

                           KNOX
             It's still your fault, you arrogant
             prick! You still killed my father!

                           CHARLIE
             Maybe. Maybe I did. But why should
             YOU kill all these people? If you
             hate me so much, just shoot ME.
             Just shoot me, Eric.

Charlie spreads his arms, leaving Knox a plenty wide target.

It's a horribly tense moment.       The Angels are frozen, watching
Knox decide Charlie's fate.

Knox is sweating, debating his choices. Can he really do
this? Charlie's not the glamorous, smug asshole he imagined.
He starts lowering his gun.

                           KNOX
             Okay.  You're right.
                    (quickly)
             I'll just kill you.

BLAM!

It all happens in the blink of an eye. Knox fires, hitting
Charlie in the chest. Natalie leaps out and tackles Knox.
Alex dives and grabs the detonator, before it has a chance
to go off.

Dylan runs to Charlie's side.

                            DYLAN
             Charlie, no.   NO!

She hold shim in her arms as the other Angels gather round
their fallen leader. He gasps for air.

                           DYLAN (CONT'D)
             He's trying to say something.

Then Dylan notices something weird. He's not gasping for
air, there's something stuck in his mouth.

With a great, hacking cough, he spits it out. It's a voice
chip, like the one Dylan used in the opening scene.

off Charlie's mask, revealing...

                            NATALIE
             Bosley!   Are you okay?

                            BOSLEY
             Think so.

He pulls back the padding from the suit, revealing a small
wound where the bullet grazed his side.

                           BOSLEY (CONT'D)
             Hurts, but it looks like it'll heel.

Dylan laughs, Alex ruffles his hair.

                           DYLAN
             Hey, wait a second. If Bosley's
             here... then where's Charlie?

The Angels all look at each other.      No one knows.

EXT. CENTER PASSAGE - DAY

In gorgeous SLOW MOTION, the three angels walk side-by-side
with a calm assurance, fireballs exploding behind them.

They won.

As MUSIC rises, the ANGELS TRIPTYCH descends, then peels
away to reveal...

EXT. GORGEOUS BEACH - DAY

The angels kick back on the white sands, tropical drinks in-
hand. Bosley is there as well, with a grass hat and zinc
on his sniffer.

Charlie is on the cellular speakerphone.

                           CHARLIE'S VOICE
             Great work, angels. You'll be happy
             to know you received another
             presidential commendation.

The Angels, and Bosley, clink glasses.

                           CHARLIE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
             Enjoy your vacation, angels.

                           THE ANGELS
             Thank you Charlie.
                                                  (CONTINUED)

They toast the speakerphone.

                           CHARLIE'S VOICE
             Alex, Natalie -- I know you've been
             putting in some long hours on this case,
             so I thought you might enjoy a chance to
             catch up with some old friends.

NATALIE AND ALEX TURN TO SEE

PETER AND JASON

walking across the beach towards them. Each is carrying a
drink of his own. They wave. Damn those men look good.

Alex and Natalie share a smile.

                           DYLAN
             Any chance you'll be joining us,
             Charlie?

                                                CUT TO:

A SUNNY DECK

We're in Charlie's point-of-view. We can see part of his
reflection in the window -- not enough to see his face,
but we get some sense of the man.

He turns away, begins walking.    Steps down onto the sand.

                           CHARLIE
                    (to cell phone)
             I'd love to, Angels. But I have some
             precious treasures to watch over.

With that, he hangs up. We stay in his P.O.V., walking
across the beach. And it's not just any beach.

TO THE LEFT, WE NOTICE

PETE AND JASON

approaching.    We're on the same beach.

Looking right, we see the backs of the Angels and Bosley.
They have no idea that Charlie is walking right behind them.

A beat, then Dylan looks back.

She looks directly as us -- at Charlie -- tracking as we
move past. Does she somehow recognize it's Charlie?
From her reaction, it's not clear.

A beat, then we...

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                            103.

REVERSE ANGLE/NOT P.O.V.

Dylan looks back forward again. Did she just see Charlie?
Her smile tells us she thinks she did.

She raises a toast.

                           DYLAN
          To Charlie.

                           THE ANGELS AND BOSLEY
          To Charlie.

They knock glasses.

Right at the moment we should probably fade out, Bosley
spills his icy drink in his lap. His eyes go wide.

The Angels just have to laugh.

We FREEZE FRAME, then...

CUT TO BLACK.

               Pevensies are running to the shelter, we hear them shouting,

               Edmund turns around, as if forgetting something.

                                     EDMUND

                         you brought anything else?

                         children in his house, and as such, 
                         there are a few rules we need to follow. 
                         There will be no shouting' or running', 
                         no improper use of the dumbwaiter, NO 
                         touching of the historical artifacts 
                         and above all, there shall be no disturbing' 
                         of the Professor.

                                     LUCY
                         I'm not a dwarf, I'm a girl! And actually 
                         I'm tallest in my class.
 
                                     TUMNUS
                         But you're saying, you're a daughter 
                         of Eve?

                         Of course.

                         Narnia? What's that?

                                     TUMNUS
                         My dear girl, you're in it!  Everything 
                         from the lamp post, all the way to castle

                         stick and stone, every icicle, is Narnia,

                         This is an awfully big wardrobe

                                     TUMNUS
                         I'm sorry, please allow me to introduce 
                         myself, my name is Tumnus
 
                                     LUCY
                         Glad to meet you, Mr. Tumnus! *extends 
                         hand* I'm Lucy Pevensie. Oh, you shake 
                         it!
 
                                     TUMNUS
                         Why?

                                     LUCY
                         I-I don't know! People do it when they 
                         meet each other.
 
                                     TUMNUS
                         Lucy Pevensie, from the shining city 
                         of War Drobe in the far land of Spare 
                         Oom, how would it be if you came and 
                         had tea with me?
 
                                     LUCY
                         Oh! Well, thank you very much! But I 
                         probably should be getting back...
 
                         
                                     TUMNUS
                         Oh, come on! It's not every day I get 
                         to make a new friend! And there's a... 
                         roaring fire! And toast and cakes! And 
                         maybe... we'll even break into the sardines.
 
                         
                                     LUCY
                         Well, maybe for just a little while... 
                         if you have... sardines.
 
                                     TUMNUS
                         By the bucket load,

                                     TUMNUS
                         Come Along.

                                     IN TUMNUS' HOUSE
                         
                                     LUCY
                         Can I help you with that?

                                     TUMNUS
                         Why thank you!

               Lucy looks at the picture.

                                     TUMNUS
                         Oh... That is my father.

                                     LUCY
                         He had a nice face. You look just like 
                         him.
 
                                     TUMNUS
                         No, were not alike at all really.

                                     LUCY
                         My father is fighting in the war.

                                     TUMNUS
                         My father went away to war too... but 
                         that was a very long time ago... before 
                         this dreadful winter.
 
                                     LUCY
                         Winter isn't all bad. There's ice skating 
                         and snow ball fights. Oh! And Christmas!
 
                         
                                     TUMNUS
                         We haven't had Christmas in a hundred 
                         years here.
 
                                     LUCY
                         (shocked) No presents for a hundred 
                         years?
 
                                     TUMNUS
                         But, oh, you would have loved Narnia 
                         in spring! The Dryads and the Fauns 
                         would dance all night... but we never 
                         got tired. And oh, the music! Such music. 
                         Would you... like to hear some now?
 
                         
                                     LUCY
                         yes please

                                     TUMNUS
                         (gets flute out) Now, are you familiar 
                         with the Narnia lullabies?
 
                                     LUCY
                         (shakes her head): No, I'm afraid I'm 
                         not
 
                                     TUMNUS
                         Good, because this probably won't sound 
                         anything like one.
 
                                     LUCY
                         Oh I must go

                                     TUMNUS
                         It's too late for that now I'm such 
                         a bad faun
 
                                     LUCY
                         No. You're the nicest faun I've ever 
                         met.
 
                                     TUMNUS
                         Then I'm afraid you've had a very poor 
                         sampling.
 
                                     LUCY
                         I'm sure you're very sorry, and you'll 
                         never do it again.
 
                                     TUMNUS
                         It's not something I have done, Lucy 
                         Pevensie. It's something I'm doing.
 
                         
                                     LUCY
                         What are you doing?

                                     TUMNUS
                         I'm kidnapping you. It's the White Witch, 
                         the one that makes it always winter, 
                         and never Christmas. She told me that 
                         I If I ever was to come across a son 
                         of Adam or a daughter of Eve, I am supposed 
                         to turn it over to her!
 
                                     LUCY
                         But I thought you were my friend



               TUMNUS AND LUCY OUTSIDE/RETURN TO ENGLAND



                                     TUMNUS
                         We must move quietly the woods are full 
                         of her spies, even some of the trees 
                         are on her side
 
                                     LUCY
                         I think so. (Tumnus starts to return 
                         her handkerchief, but she gives it back) 
                         Keep it, you need it more than I do.
 
                         
               Tumnus laughs, and touches Lucy's nose...

                                     MR. TUMNUS
                         Go...   Come on, go!

               Lucy runs off, and Mr. Tumnus returns to his home

               Lucy heads for the wardrobe



               BACK IN ENGLAND



                                     PETER
                         98, 99, 100... Ready or not here I come.
 
                         
                                     LUCY
                         I'm back, I'm back, it's alright,

                                     EDMUND
                         Shhh, he's coming.

                                     PETER
                         You know, I'm not sure if you two have 
                         quite gotten the idea of this game!
 
                         
                                     LUCY
                         but weren't you wondering where I was?
 
                         
                                     EDMUND
                         That's the point! That's why he was 
                         seeking you!
 
                                     SUSAN
                         Does this mean I win?

                                     PETER
                         I don't think Lucy wants to play anymore.
 
                         
               Susan looks in the wardrobe..

                                     SUSAN
                         The only wood in here is the back of 
                         the wardrobe.
 
                                     PETER
                         One game at a time Lu, we don't all 
                         have your imagination.
 
                                     LUCY
                         But I wasn't imagining!

                                     SUSAN
                         that's enough

                                     EDMUND
                         Well I believe you.

                                     LUCY
                         You do?

                                     EDMUND
                         Yah, didn't I tell you about the football 
                         field I found in the bathroom closet?
 
                         
                                     PETER
                         Why don't you just stop it, you always 
                         have to make everything worse. Grow 
                         up!
 
                                     EDMUND
                         Shut up! You think you're dad, but you're 
                         not! (storms out)
 
                                     SUSAN
                         well, that was nicely handled! (walks 
                         away too..)
 
                                     LUCY
                         It was really there... 

                                     PETER
                         Susan's right. That's enough..



               THAT EVENING... EDMUND ENTERS NARNIA AND MEETS THE WHITE WITCH



               Lucy closes the wardrobe and she dissolves to night

               Pan down on candle burning out, Lucy gets out boots and not slippers 
               and takes candle.
 
               Flushing toilet as Edmund comes out and sees Lucy

               Follows her to wardrobe Candle blows out when she opens it and 
               walks in as Edmund does
 
                                     EDMUND
                         Lucy, Lucy. I hope you're not afraid 
                         of the dark (shuts door)
 
               Lucy, Lucy?

               Edmund is soon in Narnia, he walks around... and is amazed by 
               it all
 
                                     EDMUND
                         Lucy? Lucy! I think I believe you now!
 
                         
               Hears bells.

                                     EDMUND
                         Lucy?

                                     DWARF
                         Yah! (whipping sound)

               Edmund dives out of the way into the snow and then the dwarf 
               jumps out and throws a whip around Edmunds legs
 
               Dwarf puts knife to Edmund's throat

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         What is it Ginarrbrik?

                                     EDMUND
                         He won't let go!

                                     DWARF
                         Is that how you address the Queen of 
                         Narnia?
 
                                     EDMUND
                         I didn't know?

                                     DWARF
                         Well, you shall know her better afterwards.
 
                         
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Wait! What is your name Son-of-Adam?
 
                         
                                     EDMUND
                         Edmund, your majesty.

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         And how was it, Edmund, that you came 
                         to enter my dominion?
 
                                     EDMUND
                         I walked through a wardrobe following 
                         my sister.
 
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Your sister? How many are you?

                                     EDMUND
                         four

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Edmund you look so cold! Come and sit 
                         with me here on my sledge. (Edmund joins 
                         her) Now, would like something warm 
                         to drink.
 
                                     EDMUND
                         Yes...your majesty.(Take vial and drops 
                         a green drop on snow that become a hot 
                         drink that the dwarf gives Edmund) How 
                         did you do that?
 
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         I can make anything you like.

                                     EDMUND
                         Could you make me taller?

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         I can make anything you like to eat
 
                         
                                     EDMUND
                         Turkish Delight

               Drop once again comes down and makes the box of Turkish Delight 
               and the Dwarf gives it to Edmund
 
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         I'd love to see your family

                                     EDMUND
                         They're nothing special

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         I have no children of my own and you 
                         are such a good little boy (I never 
                         could hear those words right) where 
                         I could see, one day, you becoming prince 
                         of Narnia - maybe even king.
 
                                     EDMUND
                         (mouth full) Really?

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         (nods) Of course you'd have to bring 
                         your family.
 
                                     EDMUND
                         They're nothing special

                                     EDMUND
                         Oh, Peter will be king too?

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         No! But a king needs servants.

                                     EDMUND
                         I-I guess I could bring 'em.

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Beyond these woods, do you see those 
                         two little hills? My house is right 
                         between them. You'd love it there Edmund, 
                         it has whole rooms simply stuffed with 
                         Turkish Delight!
 
                                     EDMUND
                         Couldn't I have some more now?

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         NO! (smiles) Don't want to ruin you 
                         appetite.
 
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         I'm going to miss you Edmund. But we 
                         are going to see each other soon.
 
                         
                                     EDMUND
                         I hope so.

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Until then...dear one. (WW drives of 
                         and Ed is left alone)
 
                                     LUCY
                         Edmund? Oh Edmund!!!! (hugs her brother) 
                         I saw Mr. Tumnus again and he's fine!!! 
                         The White Witch hasn't found out about 
                         him helping me!
 
                                     EDMUND
                         The White Witch?

                                     LUCY
                         She calls herself the Queen of Narnia, 
                         but she really isn't. Edmund? Are you 
                         okay? You look awful.
 
                                     EDMUND
                         Well what do you expect! It's freezing! 
                         How do we get out of here?
 
                                     LUCY
                         Come on...this way.



               BACK IN ENGLAND



                                     LUCY
                         (turns on the light and jumps on Peter) 
                         Peter, Peter wake up! It's there, it's 
                         really there!
 
                                     PETER
                         (rolls over still half asleep) Lucy, 
                         what are talking about?
 
                                     LUCY
                         Narnia! It's all in the wardrobe, like 
                         I told you!
 
               Susan comes in.

                                     SUSAN
                         Oh Lucy, you've been dreaming.

                                     LUCY
                         No I wasn't, I saw Mr. Tumnus again! 
                         Oh, and this time - Edmund went too.
 
                         
                                     PETER
                         You saw the faun?

                                     LUCY
                         Well, he didn't actually go there with 
                         me. What were you doing Edmund?
 
                                     EDMUND
                         I-I was just playing along. You know 
                         what little children are like these 
                         days, they just don't know when to stop 
                         pretending (sits on his bed looking 
                         smugly at Lucy)
 
               Lucy starts to cry and runs out of the room. Susan runs after 
               her and so does Peter - who shoves Edmund over
 
                                     EDMUND
                         Ow!

               Lucy runs down the hall and smack into the Professor, she looks 
               up a little frightened and then starts her crying all over again, 
               hugging him
 
                                     MRS. MACREADY
                         You children are one shenanigan shy 
                         of sleeping' in the stable- oh, Professor! 
                         I told them you were not to be disturbed.
 
                         
                                     PROFESSOR
                         Oh, it's alright Mrs. Macready - I'm 
                         sure there's a logical explanation. 
                         But I think this one needs some hot 
                         chocolate.
 
                                     MRS. MACREADY
                         Yes Professor. Come on, dear.

               Mrs. Macready takes Lucy down the hall. Peter and Susan turn 
               to go
 
                                     PROFESSOR
                         *Ahem* (the two turn and follow him 
                         into his office and the Professor sits 
                         at his desk and takes some tobacco out 
                         of it's silver apple case and puts it 
                         in his pipe)
 
                                     PROFESSOR
                         You seem to have upset the internal 
                         balance of my housekeeper.
 
                                     PETER
                         We are very sorry sir, it won't happen 
                         again.
 
                                     SUSAN
                         It's our sister sir, Lucy.

                                     PROF
                         The weeping girl?

                                     SUSAN
                         Yes sir, she's upset.

                                     PROFESSOR
                         Hence the weeping

                                     PETER
                         We can handle it! (takes Susan's sleeve)
 
                         
                                     PROFESSOR
                         Oh, I can see that.

                                     SUSAN
                         She thinks she's found a magical land 
                         in the upstairs wardrobe.
 
                                     PROFESSOR
                         What did you say!?

                                     PETER
                         The wardrobe upstairs, Lucy thinks she's 
                         found a forest inside.
 
               Susan and Peter sit on a couch and the Professor sits in a chair 
               across from them
 
                                     PROFESSOR
                         What was it like?

                                     SUSAN
                         Like talking to a lunatic!

                                     PROFESSOR
                         No, not her - the forest!

                                     PETER
                         You're-you're not saying you believe 
                         her?
 
                                     PROFESSOR
                         No, not her - the forest!

                                     PETER
                         You....you actually believe her?

                                     PROFESSOR
                         Well don't you?

                                     SUSAN
                         Well, logically it couldn't possibly 
                         be there!
 
                                     PROFESSOR
                         What do they teach at these schools?
 
                         
                                     PETER
                         Edmund said they were only pretending
 
                         
                                     PROFESSOR
                         And he's the more truthful one is he?
 
                         
                                     PETER
                         No, this would be the first time.

                                     PROFESSOR
                         Well then, id your sister isn't lying 
                         and isn't mad then logically we must 
                         assume that she is telling the truth. 
                         She's your sister, isn't she? You're 
                         a family! It's high time you start acting 
                         like one!
 
               


               CRICKET



                                     PETER
                         Peter winds up, goes for the bowl!
 
                         
               Ball hits Edmund in the leg

                                     EDMUND
                         Ow!

                                     PETER
                         Whoops! Wake up, Dolly Daydream!

                                     EDMUND
                         Can't we play hide and go seek again?
 
                         
                                     PETER
                         I thought you said that it was a kid's 
                         game.
 
                                     SUSAN
                         Besides, we can all use the fresh air.
 
                         
                                     EDMUND
                         Not like there's air inside

                                     PETER
                         Are you ready then?

                                     EDMUND
                         Are you? (smacks his bat on the ground 
                         and gets ready to hit the ball)
 
               Peter pitches the ball, hard, and Edmund whacks it good and it 
               smashes through an upstairs window and crashes into a suit of 
               armor.


 
               UPSTAIRS



               The children are looking at the broken window and the suit of 
               armor on the floor
 
                                     PETER
                         Well done, Ed!

                                     EDMUND
                         You bowled it!

                                     SUSAN
                         Listen, Mrs. Macready is coming

                                     PETER
                         Run!

                                     EDMUND
                         (runs to the wardrobe and opens the 
                         door) Come on!
 
                                     SUSAN
                         You have got to be joking.

                                     PETER
                         Go!

                                     SUSAN
                         Get back!

               SOUNDS OF KIDS GRIPING

               Susan and Peter fall backwards.



               IN NARNIA



                                     SUSAN
                         Impossible!

                                     LUCY
                         Don't worry, it's probably just your 
                         imagination
 
                                     PETER
                         I don't suppose saying we're sorry would 
                         quite cover it?
 
                                     LUCY
                         No, it wouldn't. But this might!

               Lucy nails Peter in the face with a snowball, he throws one back 
               at her and a snowball fight
 
               begins. Susan hits Ed in the arm with one

                                     EDMUND
                         Ow! (rubs his arm) Stop it! (They all 
                         realize that Ed lied)
 
                                     PETER
                         You little liar!

                                     EDMUND
                         You didn't believe her either!

                                     PETER
                         Apologize to Lucy. (He just looks at 
                         her)
 
                                     PETER
                         Say you're sorry! (Peter steps up to 
                         him)
 
                                     EDMUND
                         Alright! I'm sorry.

                                     LUCY
                         That's alright, some little children 
                         just don't know when to stop pretending. 
                         (looks at him smugly)
 
                                     EDMUND
                         (mutters): Very funny.

                                     SUSAN
                         Maybe we should go back

                                     EDMUND
                         Can't we at lease take a look around?
 
                         
                                     PETER
                         I think Lucy must decide!

                                     LUCY
                         I all want you to meet Mr. Tumnus!
 
                         
                                     PETER
                         Well Mr. Tumnus it is (walks into the 
                         wardrobe again)
 
                                     SUSAN
                         We can't just walk around in these clothes!
 
                         
                                     PETER
                         (comes out) We can use these coats.
 
                         
                                     SUSAN
                         Peter, they don't belong to us.

                                     PETER
                         Well I don't think the professor will 
                         mind. And if you think about it logically 
                         we are not even taking them out of the 
                         wardrobe. (Hands coat to Edmund)
 
                                     EDMUND
                         But that's a girl's coat!

                                     PETER
                         I know.



               DISCOVERING NARNIA



               Start walking toward Mr. Tumnus' cave through snow

                                     END OF LINE OF LUCY
                         ...and tea and... (Sees open door and 
                         runs off)
 
                                     PETER
                         LUCY!

               They all run to Tumnus' house

                                     LUCY
                         Who would do something like this?

               Edmund steps on broken picture of Tumnus's dad

                                     SUSAN

                         Now we should really go.

                                     LUCY
                         But we have to help him!

                                     SUSAN

               OUTSIDE AGAIN



               They step outside, they hear rustles from the bushes. Mr. Beaver 
               approaches
 
                                     LUCY
                         It's a beaver.

               Peter approaches the beaver, clicking his tongue

                                     PETER
                         Here, boy *clicks* come here...*clicks*
 
                         
               Peter let's out his hand, Mr. Beaver stares at it then sits upright
 
               
                                     MR.BEAVER
                         Well, I ain't gonna smell it if that's 
                         what you want!
 
                                     EDMUND
                         It's a talking beaver!

                                     MR.BEAVER
                         Lucy Pevensie?

                                     LUCY
                         Yes?

               Mr. Beaver hands her the handkerchief

                                     LUCY
                         This is the handkerchief I gave to Mr-
 
                         
                                     MR. BEAVER
                         Tumnus. He gave it to me just before 
                         they took him.
 
                                     LUCY
                         Is he alright?

                                     MR. BEAVER
                         Further in.(Mr. Beaver scurries off, 
                         Susan grabs Peter by the arm)
 
                                     SUSAN
                         Peter, we don't know what you are doing.
 
                         
                                     EDMUND
                         She's right. How do we know we can trust 
                         this beaver?
 
                                     PETER
                         He say's he knows the faun.

                                     SUSAN
                         He's a beaver...he shouldn't be saying 
                         anything!
 
                                     MR. BEAVER
                         Is everything alright?

                                     PETER
                         Yes. We were just talking

                                     MR. BEAVER
                         That's better left for safer corners.

                         He means the trees.

               Walk to Beaver's dam through the cliffs under a bridge and then 
               they see the Dam

                                     MRS. BEAVER

               Edmund shakes off that comment, & enters the dam. Mr. Beaver 
               follows him

                         Who's Aslan?

               Mr. Beaver laughs.. Mrs. Beaver sees they are serious and lays 
               her hand on Mr. Beaver
 
                                     MR. BEAVER
                         Aslan....you silly little blighter.....you 
                         don't know do you?
 
                                     PETER
                         Well we haven't actually been here very 
                         long
 
                                     MR. BEAVER
                         He's only the king the whole wood, the 
                         true king of Narnia.... and he's waiting 
                         for you!
 
                                     LUCY
                         waiting for us?

                                     BEAVER
                         You got to be joking! Look, Aslan's 
                         return, Tumnus' arrest.....the secret 
                         police! They're all happening because 
                         of you!
 
                                     SUSAN
                         You're blaming us?

                                     MRS. BEAVER
                         Not blaming you dear, thanking you.
 
                         
                                     BEAVER
                         There's....a prophecy, When Adam's flesh 
                         and Adam's bone sits in if Cair Paravel 
                         in throne the evil is over and done.
 
                         
                                     SUSAN
                         You know that doesn't really rhyme.
 
                         
                                     MR. BEAVER
                         I know, but you're missing the point!
 
                         
                                     MRS. BEAVER
                         It's long been told that two sons of 
                         Adam and two daughters of Eve will appear 
                         to defeat the White Witch, and restore 
                         peace to Narnia.
 
                                     PETER
                         And you think we're the ones???

                                     MR. BEAVER
                         Well you'd better be, Aslan's already 
                         fitted out your army!!!
 
                                     PETER
                         I think you've made a mistake; we're 
                         not heroes!
 
                                     SUSAN
                         We're from Finchley!

                                     PETER
                         I think it's time we were going.

                                     LUCY
                         But what about Mr. Tumnus?

                                     PETER
                         Sorry Lucy. It's out of our hands.
 
                         
                                     SUSAN
                         Thank you for your hospitality.

                                     PETER
                         Ed, time to go- Ed? (looks around the 
                         room) I'm going to kill him.
 
                                     MR. BEAVER
                         You may not have to...Has Edmund been 
                         to Narnia before?
 
               Shot of Ed walking to the Witch's castle without his coat - shot 
               of the others trying to catch up to him
 
                                     PETER
                         Hurry up!

               They reach the top of the hill and see Ed going through the Witch's 
               castle gates
 
                                     LUCY
                         (shouting) Edmund!

                                     MR. BEAVER
                         Shh! They'll hear ya!

               Peter starts to run after Edmund but Mr. Beaver grabs him by 
               the sleeve of his coat
 
                                     PETER
                         Get off me!

                                     PETER
                         We just can't let him go!

                                     BEAVER
                         Don't you get it?! He's the bait! She 
                         wants all of ya in there!!! To kill 
                         ya!
 
                                     SUSAN
                         This is all your fault! None of this 
                         would have happened if you had just 
                         listened to me in the first place!
 
                         
                                     PETER
                         So you knew this would happen?

                                     SUSAN
                         I didn't know what would happen...
 
                         
                                     LUCY
                         Stop, this fighting isn't going to help 
                         Edmund
 
                                     BEAVER
                         She's right. Only Aslan can save him 
                         now.
 
                                     PETER
                         Then take us to him.



               EDMUND AT THE WITCH'S HOUSE



               Edmund is walking through the courtyard and see's Giant Rumblebuffin. 
               He walks further in and see's a stone lion - he draws glasses 
               and a moustache on it
 
               Edmund continues through the courtyard, he steps over what he 
               thinks is a log of some sort...only to be lurched on by Maugrim!
 
               
                                     MAUGRIM
                         Stand still stranger!

                                     EDMUND
                         I'm a Son of Adam, I met the Queen in 
                         the woods!
 
               Maugrim gets off him.

                                     MAUGRIM
                         My apologies, fortunate favourite of 
                         the queen - or perhaps not so fortunate.
 
                         
               walks into the throne-room

                                     MAUGRIM
                         Wait here (Edmund sees the glorious 
                         throne, and sits on it longingly. Then, 
                         the witch comes up behind him and says, 
                         scaring him half to death.)
 
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         You like it!

                                     EDMUND
                         (he jumps up startled) Ye... yes, your 
                         majesty!
 
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         I thought you might

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Tell me, you sisters, are they deaf?
 
                         
                                     EDMUND
                         No

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         and your brother, unintelligent?

                                     EDMUND
                         Well I think so, but mom says...

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Then how dare you come alone! Edmund, 
                         I ask so little of you
 
                                     EDMUND
                         They just don't listen to me!

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Couldn't even do that!

                                     EDMUND
                         I...I did bring them half way. There 
                         at the dam at the house of the beaver's!
 
                         
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Well...I guess your not a total lost 
                         then.
 
               Edmund approaches again.

                                     EDMUND
                         Is there any chance I may have some 
                         more Turkish delight now?
 
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Ginnabrick, our guest is hungry

                                     GINNABRICK
                         This way...for your num nums...

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Maugrim!!!! You know what to do....
 
                         
               Maugrim let's out a howl, Edmund realizes the horrible truth 
               as wolves surround the castle...they charge from the castle
 
               

               BACK AT THE BEAVERS HOUSE



                                     MAUGRIM
                         Take them

                                     MR.BEAVER
                         Hurry Mum, they are after us!

                                     MRS. BEAVER
                         right then...

                                     SUSAN
                         What is she doing?

                                     MRS. BEAVER
                         Don't worry, you'll thank you me later. 
                         it's a long journey and a beaver gets 
                         cranky when he's hungry.
 
                                     BEAVER
                         I'M CRANKY NOW!

                                     SUSAN
                         Do you think we should bring jam?

                                     PETER
                         Only if the Witch has toast.



               GOES INSIDE THE TUNNEL



                                     MR. BEAVER
                         This should lead to Aslan's

                                     MRS. BEAVER
                         I thought it lead to your mums!

               Lucy falls howling.

                                     LUCY
                         They're in the tunnel!

               (run further, comes to dead end)

                                     MRS. BEAVER
                         You should have brought a map!

                                     BEAVER
                         There was no room next to the jam!
 
                         
               He jumps out of the hole. Everyone else follow. Once Peter gets 
               out, Lucy falls on a bunch of stone things.
 
               Lucy gets up! They all see stone animals!

                                     MR. BEAVER
                         He was my best mate! (cries)

               BACK TO THE WITCHES HOUSE.. IN THE DUNGEON



               Edmund, in chains at the witches palace. He attempts to eat the 
               food he is given, but coughs and spits it out, because of its 
               taste. He then attempts to drink a cup, which is frozen. He then 
               throws it on the tray.
 
                                     MR. TUMNUS
                         Are you gonna eat that? (from the other 
                         prison)
 
               Edmund gives him the food.

                                     EDMUND
                         Mr... Tumnus.

                         You have the same nose.

               Edmund rubs his nose.

                                     MR. TUMNUS
                         Is your sister alright? (no answer) 
                         Is she safe?

                         little family was nowhere to be found.

                         wanted to see you again.

               Witch stares at him coldly

                         You're here because he (points at Edmund) 
                         turned you in...for sweeties. (turns 
                         to dwarf and guard) Take him (Tumnus) 
                         upstairs and ready my sleigh, Edmund 
                         misses his family.
 


               THE ROCK BRIDGE



                                     MR. BEAVER
                         Now Aslan's camp is just over there 
                         by the stone table just across the frozen 
                         river.

                         Smaller...

               They continue their journey.



               BACK TO EDMUND



               Dwarf brings Edmund up and he sees Tumnus turned to stone

                         Maybe she's gone.

                         Thanks dear.

               Long pause and some noise then...

                                     MR. BEAVER
                         AHHH!....

                         Merry Christmas, Sir!

                                     FATHER CHRISTMAS
                         It certainly is, Lucy. Thanks to you.

                         I thought there was no Christmas in 
                         Narnia.
 
                                     FATHER CHRISTMAS
                         It hasn't been for a hundred years. 
                         But now the Witch's power is crumbling. 
                         (he goes to his bag and throws it to 
                         the ground)

                                     FATHER CHRISTMAS
                         Lucy, Eve's Daughter. These are for 
                         you. The juice of the fire flower. If 
                         you, or one of your friends are wounded, 
                         one drop of this cordial will restore 
                         them. And though I do not expect you 
                         to use it, this.
 
                                     LUCY
                         Well, I think I could be brave enough.
 
                         
                                     FATHER CHRISTMAS
                         I'm sure you could. But battles are 
                         ugly affairs. Eve's Daughter, Susan. 
                         Trust in this bow, for it does not easily 
                         miss.
 
                                     SUSAN
                         What happened to, 'battles are ugly 
                         affairs?'
 
                                     FATHER CHRISTMAS
                         And, though you don't seem to have trouble 
                         making yourself heard, this. When you 
                         put this horn to your lips and blow 
                         it, wherever you are, help will come.
 
                         
                                     SUSAN
                         Thanks.

                                     FATHER CHRISTMAS
                         And, Peter. These are tools, not toys. 
                         The time to use them may be soon at 
                         hand.
 
                                     FATHER CHRISTMAS
                         Bare them well! I best be off, winter 
                         is almost over and things do pile up 
                         when you've been gone a thousand years. 
                         Long live Aslan! (he gets in his sleigh 
                         and rides off)

                         Wait, maybe we should think about this.

               Stabs sword into the ice, and they float away...

               They get to shore. Peter has Lucy's coat in hand, but no Lucy.
 
               
                                     SUSAN

                                     MR. BEAVER
                         Your brother has you well looked after.
 
                         
               Everyone laughs and embraces.

                                     MRS. BEAVER
                         I don't think you'll be needing those 
                         coats any more!
 
               Walk through and see spring coming about and flowers budding 
               as they leave there coats and head toward Aslan's Camp
 
               BACK TO THE WATERFALL, THE WITCH, EDMUND AND DWARF

                                     DWARF
                         It's so warm here! (Cold look from Witch) 
                         I think I'll go check the sleigh.
 
                         
                                     WOLF
                         We found the traitor (Carrying the Fox) 
                         He was gathering troops near the sharwood 
                         forest.
 
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Nice of you to drop by. I understand 
                         you were so helpful to my wolves last 
                         night.
 
                                     FOX
                         Forgive me your majesty

                         Not to seem rude, but I wasn't actually 
                         talking to you (Looks at Edmund)
 
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         (Looks first to Edmund and than at Fox) 
                         Where is ASLAN! Answer me! (About to 
                         hit him with wand)
 
                                     EDMUND
                         Wait! The Beavers said something about 
                         the Stone Table and an army.
 
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Thank you Edmund. It is good for this 
                         creature to see some honesty before 
                         he dies..
 
                                     EDMUND
                         NO!(Fox to stone and White Slaps Edmund 
                         across face)
 
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Think who's side you are on. MINE...(turns 
                         his head) Or theirs? If it is a war 
                         Aslan wants (turns butterfly to stone) 
                         It's a war he shall get.
 


               AT ASLAN'S CAMP



                                     SUSAN
                         Why are they all staring at us?

                                     LUCY
                         Maybe they think you look funny.

               Peter smiles.

                                     MR. BEAVER
                         Oh stop your fussing Mrs. Beaver. You 
                         look lovely.
 
               Peter pulls out sword.

                                     PETER
                         (To Oreius) We have come to see Aslan.
 
                         
               Tent starts to blow in breeze and everyone kneels. Aslan comes 
               from the tent and the children kneel
 
                                     ASLAN
                         Welcome Peter Adam's son, Welcome Susan 
                         and Lucy daughters-of-Eve. Welcome Beavers. 
                          You have my thanks, but where is the 
                         fourth.
 
                                     PETER
                         That's why we are here.

                                     SUSAN
                         We had a little trouble along the way.
 
                         
                                     PETER
                         He's been captured by the White Witch
 
                         
                                     CROWD
                         Captured!

                                     MR. BEAVER
                         He betrayed them your Excellence!

                                     OREIUS
                         Then he has betrayed us all

                                     ASLAN
                         Peace Oreius.

                                     PETER
                         It is my fault really. I was too hard 
                         on him.
 
                                     SUSAN
                         We all were.

                                     LUCY
                         Sir, he's our brother.

                                     ASLAN
                         I know dear and that makes the betrayal 
                         all the worse. It may be harder than 
                         you think
 


               PETER AND ASLAN ON HILL



                                     ASLAN

                         You doubt the prophecy

                                     PETER
                         No, that's just it...you're not who 
                         I think I am

                         Peter Pevensie formerly of Finnchley. 
                         Beaver also said you wanted to turn 
                         him into a hat.
 
               light laughes Peter there is a Deep Magic that rules over Narnia.

                         I don't think I will be able.

                                     ASLAN
                         You were able to get your family here.
 
                         
                                     PETER

                                     ASLAN
                         I will do what I can for Edmund. I too 
                         want my family safe.

               Aslan pins the second wolf to the ground and says to his group
 
               
               Stay back. This is Peter's battle.

               The wolf attacks him. And everyone thinks he is dead

                                     SUSAN AND LUCY
                         Peter... no!

               They run up to him, and see he is alive and looks disgusted by 
               killing the wolf. Aslan lets go the other wolf
 
                                     ASLAN
                         Follow him! He'll lead you to Edmund. 
                         Peter, clean your sword.
 
                                     ASLAN
                         Rise, Sir Peter Wolfsbane--Knight of 
                         Narnia.
 
               Peter looks at Aslan in awe

               All embrace him and are excited about this



               WITCHES CAMP



               Edmund is tied to tree as the Dwarf taunts him

                                     GENERAL OTMIN
                         The Minotaurs on the left, send in the 
                         dwarfs first.
 
               White Witch looks at the plans and then...

               Aslan's army comes in and there is confusion. White Witch goes 
               through camp and see Dwarf to tree, knife in hat and him tied 
               and gagged. She takes the knife and looks like she's going to 
               kill him then cuts him down
 
                                     DWARF
                         You're not going to kill him?

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Not yet! We have work to do (turning 
                         to Otmin)
 


               MORNING ASLAN'S CAMP



               Aslan and Edmund are on the rock above camp Peter comes out and 
               see him and then the girls
 
                                     LUCY
                         EDMUND!

               Peter stops her. Aslan motions Edmund down and they go to the 
               group of his siblings
 
                                     ASLAN
                         What's done is done. There is no reason 
                         to bring up the past with your brother.
 
                         
                                     EDMUND
                         Hello...

                                     LUCY
                         Oh, Edmund (Hugs him and Susan does 
                         too)
 
                                     SUSAN
                         How are you feeling?

                                     EDMUND
                         I'm feeling kinda tired

                                     PETER
                         Get some rest...and Edmund try not to 
                         wander off again.
 
               Some time later, breakfast

                                     LUCY
                         Narnia isn't going to run out of toast 
                         Edmund
 
                                     PETER
                         then you better pack some for the journey
 
                         
                                     SUSAN
                         So were going home?

                                     PETER
                         You are, I promised I'd keep you three 
                         safe but there's no reason I can't stay 
                         and help.
 
                                     LUCY
                         but they need us...All four of us

                                     PETER
                         Lucy it's too dangerous. You almost 
                         drowned, Edmund was almost killed!
 
                         
                                     EDMUND
                         Which is why we have to stay.

               They all look at him.

                                     EDMUND
                         I've seen what the White Witch can do 
                         and I've helped her do it, and we can't 
                         leave these people behind to suffer for it.

               Lucy holds Ed's hand.

                                     SUSAN
                         Well I guess that's it then. *gets up*
 
                         
                                     PETER
                         Where are you going?

                                     SUSAN
                         (picks up bow and quiver) To get in 
                         some practice.
 
               Susan and Lucy practice shooting at the target. Then it cuts 
               to Peter and Edmund practicing sword fighting
 
                                     PETER
                         Come on Ed, sword hand up like Oreius 
                         showed us.
 
               The beavers come running up. Edmund's horse rears

                                     EDMUND
                         Whoa horsey!

                                     HORSE
                         My name is Philip.

                                     EDMUND
                         Oh, sorry

                                     MR. BEAVER
                         you better come quick the White Witch 
                         has requested a meeting with Aslan...
 

                         
               WITCH IN ASLANS CAMP



                                     DWARF
                         Jadis.. Jadis!!!

               Jadis arrives at the camp, Cyclops carry her bed-thingy...She 
               hops down, and walks towards Aslan
 
                                     JADIS
                         You have a traitor in your midst, Aslan.
 
                         
               Everyone gasps.

                                     ASLAN
                         His offence was not against you.

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Have you forgotten the Deep Magic?
 
                         
                                     ASLAN
                         Do not cite the Deep Magic to me, Witch. 
                         I was there when it was made.
 
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Then you will know that the boy belongs 
                         to me. (turns to crowd) That boy (points 
                         to Edmund) will die on the Stone Table.
 
                         
                                     PETER
                         Come and take it then.

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         You think that a simple threat will 
                         deny me my right, little king? Aslan 
                         knows that if I do not have blood as 
                         the law demands, all of Narnia will 
                         be overturned, and perish, in fire and 
                         water.
 
                                     ASLAN
                         Enough, I shall talk with you alone.
 
                         
               (time passes and the Witch exits tent)

                                     ASLAN
                         The Witch has denounced her claim on 
                         Edmund
 
               Narnians cheer.

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         How will I know your promise will be 
                         kept?
 
               Aslan roars. the White Witch falls into her seat and the Narnians 
               laugh. The White Witch leaves. Aslan sighs and walks into his 
               tent.
 


               THAT NIGHT...



               Lucy is quietly resting, when she see's a shadow...she wakes 
               Susan
 
                                     LUCY
                         Susan!

               Susan see's the shadow, the two leave their tent. Aslan is leaving 
               the camp...they follow him. and follow him...and follow him. 
               Until-
 
                                     ASLAN
                         Aren't you suppose to be in bed?

                                     LUCY
                         We couldn't sleep

                                     SUSAN
                         Please, Aslan. Couldn't we come with 
                         you?
 
                                     ASLAN
                         I would be glad of the company tonight.
 
                         
               (Walk further)

                                     ASLAN
                         It is time. From now on, I must go on 
                         alone. Thank you Susan. Thank you Lucy. 
                         And farewell.
 
                                     LUCY
                         (later after lots of jeers towards Aslan 
                         as he walks to the Stone Table) Why 
                         doesn't he fight back?
 
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Bind him. Wait. First let him be shaved.
 
                         
               More jeers and catcalls...

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Tonight, the Deep magic will be appeased, 
                         but tomorrow, we will take Narnia, Forever!
 
                         
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         You know, Aslan, I'm a little disappointed 
                         in you. Did you really think that by 
                         giving your life you would save the 
                         Human boy? Ha. You are giving up your 
                         life, and saving no one. So much for 
                         love.
 
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         In that knowledge... Despair... and 
                         DIE!!!!!!
 
               She plunges in the knife and Aslan's growls in pain and his eyes 
               slowly close
 
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         The great cat is DEAD!!

               Her army cheers loudly.

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         General, gather your army and prepare 
                         for battle. However short it may be.
 
                         
               Otmin lets out a huge roar



               AFTER THE WHITE WITCH AND CREATURES ARE GONE


               The girls come up and cry and lean on Aslan. Lucy gets an idea, 
               unscrews her potion
 
                                     SUSAN
                         It's too late. He's gone. I'm sure he 
                         knew what he was doing.
 
                                     
                         We have to go.

                                     LUCY
                         We can't just leave him here.

                                     SUSAN
                         Lucy there's not time. We have to tell 
                         the others.
 
                                     LUCY
                         The Trees

               Back at Aslan's camp in the boys' tent

                                     DRYAD
                         Fear not my princes. I come with tidings 
                         of grave news..
 
               Peter walks out of the tent.

                                     PETER
                         It is true, he's gone

                                     EDMUND
                         Then you'll have to lead us. There's 
                         a whole army out there waiting to follow 
                         you.
 
                                     PETER
                         I can't

                                     EDMUND
                         Aslan believed you could. And so do 
                         I.
 
                                     OREIUS
                         what are your orders?

               Peter looks at map... you see the battle field



               BATTLE

                                     PETER
                         No, but I bet they help

               Arrival of the Witch's army

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         I take no interest in prisoners. Kill

               Army charges, gryphons attack

               BATTLE TRULY BEGINS



                                     PETER
                         Are you with me?

                                     ORIEUS
                         To the death!

                                     PETER
                         FOR NARNIA, AND FOR ASLAN!!!!

               PETER'S CHARGE BEGINS

               Back to the girls at the Stone Table

               Lucy and Susan wake up.

                                     SUSAN
                         We should go.

                                     LUCY
                         I'm so cold.

               They start walking away...Stone Table cracks

                                     LUCY
                         Susan!

                                     SUSAN
                         What have they done?

               Aslan appears, sending shivers down EVERYONE'S spine!

                                     SUSAN AND LUCY
                         ASLAN!

               Aslan laughs.

                                     SUSAN
                         We saw the Witch, the knife.

                                     ASLAN
                         If the Witch knew the true meaning of 
                         sacrifice, she might have interpreted 
                         the Deep Magic a little differently. 
                         For she would know that if a willing 
                         victim who had committed no treachery 
                         died in a traitors stead, the Stone 
                         Table would crack and death itself would 
                         begin to unwind.
 
                                     SUSAN
                         We sent the word that you were dead. 
                         Peter and Edmund would have gone to 
                         war.
 
                                     LUCY
                         (draws knife) We have to help them.
 
                         
                                     ASLAN
                         We will, but not alone. Now, climb on 
                         my back. We have a long ways to go and 
                         little time to get there. And you might 
                         want to cover your ears. ROAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 
                         
               BACK TO THE BATTLE

                                     PETER
                         Fall back! Draw them to the rocks!
 
                         
                                     BEAVER
                         That's the signal! Get ready!

                                     EDMUND
                         FIRE!

               Swish! Bang! Grunt! Crash! Clash! Roar! Aaaahhh!!! Ouch!

               Peter falls off his unicorn. Oreius and the rhino charge

                                     PETER
                         Stop!

               They don't.

               Witch ducks attack, parries blades, spins her wand and turns 
               Oreius to stone
 
               Back to Aslan and the girls.. at the Witches house

               Cuts to stone centaur in the Witch's castle. Lucy and Susan are 
               looking for Mr. Tumnus. Lucy finds him and starts to cry, while 
               Susan hugs her. Aslan walks up and breathes on Mr. Tumnus, and 
               Mr. Tumnus is restored. He falls forward into Lucy and Susan's 
               arm
 
                                     LUCY
                         Susan this is...

                                     SUSAN
                         MR TUMNUS!!!!

               They hug....then they see Aslan

                                     ASLAN
                         Come, lets search the castle - others 
                         may still be trapped inside and Peter 
                         will need all the help he can get.
 
                         
               BACK TO THE BATTLE

                                     PETER
                         Ed! There are too many of them! Go! 
                         Get out of here! Get the girls, and 
                         get them home!
 
                                     BEAVER
                         Come on, you heard him!

               Ed starts to leave, then sees the Witch. And starts to go back
 
               
                                     BEAVER
                         Peter said to go!

                                     EDMUND
                         Peter's not King yet!

               Edmund rushes down the hill and breaks the witch's sword, then 
               she stabs him with the remainders of her wand. so the next thing 
               that is actually said is a grunt issued from Edmund and... 
 
               
                                     PETER
                         Edmund!!(silenced)

               Peter and the Witch fight, then they see Aslan

                                     WITCH
                         Impossible!

               Aslan rushes to kill the Witch, everything disappears

                                     ASLAN
                         It is finished.

               The three Pevensies reunite

                                     SUSAN
                         Where's Edmund?

               The dwarf hobbles up and is about to finish Edmund

                                     SUSAN
                         Edmund! (shoots arrow, kills the dwarf)
 
                         
               Edmund coughs and gasps. Lucy pulls out her cordial and places 
               one drop on Edmund's lips. He stops moving momentarily before 
               gasping and sitting up
 
                                     PETER
                         When are you ever going to do are you're 
                         told?
 
               Laughing and hugging  Group Hug Lucy gets the idea to heal everyone 
               and she walks over too someone else who is hurt. Then you see 
               Cair Paravel, and horns blowing. The coronation of the Pevensies 
               began. They walk up the aisle happily, and stand next to their 
               cool chairs.
 
                                     ASLAN
                         Bring forth the crowns!

               Tumnus and Mr. Beaver bring out the crowns.

                                     ASLAN
                         (As they put on her crown) To the glistening 
                         eastern sea, I give you Queen Lucy the 
                         Valiant. To the great western woods, 
                         (puts his crown on) King Edmund the 
                         Just. To the radiant southern sun, (puts 
                         crown on) Queen Susan the Gentle. (crown 
                         put on) And to the clear northern skies, 
                         King Peter the Magnificent. Once a king 
                         or Queen of Narnia, always a king or 
                         queen.
 
                                     EVERYONE
                         Long live King Peter! Long live Queen 
                         Susan! Long live King Edmund! And long 
                         live Queen Lucy!
 
               Aslan walking on the beach in the sunset

               Lucy runs out to the balcony and see him walking away

                                     TUMNUS
                         We'll see him again.

                                     LUCY
                         When?

                                     TUMNUS
                         In time...you mustn't press him, He 
                         isn't a tame lion...
 
                                     LUCY
                         No, but he's good...

                                     TUMNUS
                         Here (pulling a hankie from his person) 
                         I think you need this more than I do.
 
                         
               she takes it and sees that Aslan has disappeared and begins to 
               cry softly, her and Tumnus hold hands as she looks into the sunset.

               WARDROBE AT NIGHT

               Lucy tries to get into the wardrobe and then...

                                     PROFESSOR
                         I don't think you'll get back in that 
                         way...you see I've already tried.

                         Will we ever go back?

                                     PROFESSOR
                         I expect so, probably when you least 
                         expect it. What's to say Keep your eyes 
                         open (They walk out the room and the 
                         wardrobe door opens a crack and a light 
                         and smoke come out and we hear a roar)

          CLOSE ON a spectacular example of PEUCETIA VIRIDANS.
          Descending through mid-air on a silken thread. Neon green
          with black leopard spots on its legs. A Green Lynx Spider.
          As we follow it down, the threaded opening of a GLASS JAR
          appears from the bottom of frame.
          Just before the spider continues inside the jar, it stops,
          suspended. Something's not right. It waves a leg
          tentatively through the air...

                         DARREN'S VOICE
          Come on... Just a little lower...
          WIDEN TO REVEAL a Middle School TOILET STALL. Standing on
          the lid of the closed toilet, holding the glass jar up over
          his head, is DARREN SHAN.
          Darren is 14 and a well-liked kid. Tenacious. Diligent.
           The spider just hangs there.

                         DARREN
          Come on... I'll take good care of
          you. All the bugs you can eat.

          MIDDLE SCHOOL BOYS ROOM
          The door bangs open and STEVE LEONARD enters. Unlike Darren,
          Steve's not so well-liked. In fact, he can be trouble.
          Maybe that's why they're friends.

                         STEVE
          Hey, Darren!
          No answer. Steve walks along the stall, scoots low so he can
          see any feet in front of the bowls.

                         STEVE
          Did you fall in? Darren!

                         DARREN'S VOICE
          Shhh...
          Steve looks to the last stall, sees the jar being held up.
          INTERCUT from in and outside of the stall.

                         DARREN
          You're gonna scare him away.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2.

                         STEVE
          Man, we're getting killed out
          there. It's three to nothing.
          Darren is all concentration as the spider drops a little.

                         DARREN
          Your problem, Steve, not mine...
          Steve gets a waggish idea. Stepping to the sink, pressing
          his forefinger over the spigot, he turns the faucet.
          WATER SHOOTS out in a stream, which Steve directs into and
          then over the stall door. Reacting, the spider zips up its
          thread, is lost in the darkened ceiling.
          The stall door opens. Dripping water, Darren stares at Steve
          who flashes a wicked grin...

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. SCHOOL YARD - DAY

          Kids eat lunch, off in their groups. On the field: Darren
          has a SOCCER BALL practically glued to his foot. He dribbles
          through defenders, shoots, SCORES! Steve pumps a fist:

                         STEVE
          GOAL! Three to one!
          The other team regroups, starts back upfield with the ball.
          Darren steals it. A few strides and WHUMP!
          Darren catches the goalie too far out. The ball lofts just
          over the backpedaling goalie's head, bounces into the goal.

                         STEVE

                         (EXULTANT)
          Three to two!
          Angry at himself, the goalie KICKS the ball away. It veers
          off toward the street. Steve takes it as a personal insult.

                         STEVE
          What does that prove? Huh?
          The goalie blanches as Steve moves at him. Kids are nervous
          about Steve. He likes to fight. Darren gets between them.

                         DARREN
          Go get the ball. It's 3 to 2.
          Lunch's almost over.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.

                         STEVE
          That's why he kicked it. To kill
          time. Well, I still got time to
          kick your face.

                         DARREN

                         (BLOCKING HIM)
          Forget it. The ball.
          Steve decides, heads after it. The goalie gulps in relief.

                         GOALIE
          Thanks, Darren. He's crazy.
          Darren watches after Steve. He does have a vicious streak.

                         THE STREET
          Steve tracks down the ball which has rolled into the street.
          From seemingly out of nowhere...
          A gleaming black 1966 LINCOLN Continental. Its tires sucking
          at the asphalt as it rolls. The windows blacked out.
          It speeds up reaching the ball. Ba-Dump! The ball BURSTS.

                         STEVE
          You idiot!
          The car SCREECHES to a stop, idles ominously. Suddenly Steve
          doesn't seem so tough. He looks nervously back to Darren.
          But as a WIND picks up, the Lincoln suddenly tears off.
          A sheet of PAPER is kicked up by one of the car tires. The
          wind sends it sailing. It drifts down, until... Steve
          notices, snatches it out of the air.
          Darren steps up beside him, watches the Lincoln disappear
          down the street. Creepy...

                         STEVE
          Look at this.
          The paper is a FLYER. A startling, violent layout. Beneath
          a snarling WOLF'S HEAD: CIROUE DU FREAK - Human oddities and
          other living curiosities. Midnight. Zeiterion Theater. $20
          - Admission is at the discretion of the proprietor.

                         STEVE
          .Human oddities and other living
          curiosities...

                         (TO DARREN)
          Other. Does that mean not human?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          4.
          Darren shrugs, takes the flyer.

                         DARREN
          A freak show. Ever been to one?

                         STEVE

                         (GRINS)
          Just this school.
          Darren turns the flyer over. There are tire tracks on the
          back. They hear the sound of distant tire squeals, but the
          Lincoln is long out of view. Just an empty street now...

                         CUT TO:

          A BOA OCCIDENTALIS
          Probing the confines of its glass prison. A BOA CONSTRICTOR
          by any other name. It's a prison within a prison because
          we're inside...

          THE SCHOOL SCIENCE LAB - DAY
          The teacher, MR. DALTON, moves ponderously around the room.
          His voice like a metronome.

          MR. DALTON
          As you can see reptiles and
          amphibians are not one in the same.
          As Mr. Dalton continues, we see various PAIRS OF STUDENTS,
          their computer screens showing text or pictures of various
          FROGS, ALLIGATORS and LIZARDS...
          DARREN and STEVE sit together staring at a Komodo Dragon.
          After Mr. Dalton passes by, Steve switches screen views.
          He's done a WebSearch of Cirque du Freak. There are a dozen
          or so entries. He picks one: History of the Side Show.
          Under 1920's there's an older, much more 'Victorian' pamphlet
          for the Cirque du Freak. A more ornate version of the same
          Wolf Head. The same notice from the proprietor.
          Steve spreads the flyer out to compare. They whisper:

                         STEVE

          1923...

                         DARREN
          Must be a different one.
          Steve scrolls down through pictures:

          Human skeleton: J.D. COMBS. .and then...
          Egyptian Soothsayer: LARTEN CREPSLEY. Crepsley's gaze is
          startling. Like he can see through the screen, even from
          1923. Steve looks like he's just seen a ghost.
          Suddenly, he hits print. As a PRINTER against the wall
          clicks to life, Steve looks back at Darren.

                         STEVE
          I gotta show you something...

          Picture perfect: two stories, dormers, trellises. 9-year-old
          ANNIE rides up on her bike, bookbag over her shoulder.
          Without stopping, she hops off, dumps it on the lawn by two
          other bikes. A few steps and she's through the door.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. DARREN'S ROOM - DAY

          Moody for the daytime. Only the light from the half-closed
          blinds streaking the floor where:
          Darren and Steve are huddled over several clippings and
          pictures that Steve has spread out. They all deal with
          VAMPIRES in some form or another. Steve pulls another stack
          from his backpack, spreads them out as well.

                         DARREN
          I don't get it.

                         STEVE
          Vampires. I've been studying them.
          Vampires? Darren looks at him a beat.

                         DARREN
          Right. You're failing half your
          classes at school, but you're
          studying vampires.

                         STEVE
          They been around 1000's of years.
          Two tribes. They even fight wars.

                         DARREN
          What? When?

                         STEVE
          Okay, sometimes, when humans fight?
          They fight at the same time. And
          no one knows it. Like at the
          Battle of Stalingrad they fought at
          the same time the Russians and
          Germans were fighting.
          Darren just looks at him, wonders if he's serious.

                         STEVE
          Some people know about it. There
          have even been books written.
          He pulls a frayed old yellow hardcover from his bag.

                         DARREN
          That's your proof? It smells.
          Steve's really trying to convince him now.

                         STEVE
          It's everywhere if you look. On
          the internet, in blogs, newspapers,
          weird places. But you can find it.
          The room starts to tighten a notch around them.

                         STEVE
          I chatted online with one of them.

                         DARREN
          Come on.

                         STEVE
          Serious.
          We become aware of...

          A SINISTER POV
          Someone watching Darren and Steve through the half open
          doorway. It moves in, starts coming up from behind.

                         DARREN
          What was his name? Mr. Dracula?
          Mad now, Steve opens the book, flips pages, finds an old 19th
          Century painting. He slaps down the science lab internet
          print-out of Larten Crepsley. It's the same guy! Maybe...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          7.

                         STEVE
          Here he is in 1923. And here 1855.
          Huh? Maybe he'll be there tonight.
          Would that make you believe?
          As Darren looks them over, the POV looms up behind them.
          Suddenly Darren spins...
          And ROARS at what's behind them: his sister Annie. She
          SCREAMS in response. Steve jumps a mile. Darren LAUGHS.

                         ANNIE
          How'd you know?

                         DARREN
          Saw your shadow on the floor.
          Gotta try harder, knucklehead.
          Steve snaps his book shut, shoves it in his backpack.

                         STEVE
          I'm gonna get a soda.

                         DARREN
          Get me one, too.
          Steve gets up, stomps out of the room.

          INT. KITCHEN - SHAN HOUSE - DAY

          Steve opens the refrigerator, looks to see what's in there.
          At the same time Darren's MOTHER arrives home. Coming in
          through the kitchen door, she sees the refrigerator door
          open, two sneakered feet behind it.

                         MOM
          I know you want to fight global
          warming, Darren, but that's not the
          way to do it.
          Steve leans back to show his face.

                         STEVE
          Sorry, Mrs. Shan.

                         MOM
          Oh hi, Steve. I thought you were,
          Darren.

          You guys got everything in here.

                         MOM
          Help yourself.
          She sets her PURSE down on the counter.

                         MOM
          How's your mother?

                         STEVE
          She's okay... She's been working a
          lot lately.
          A little frown of concern crosses Darren's mom. Something
          about Steve... His mom... He brings out a bottle of soda.

                         MOM

                         (POINTS)
          Glasses are up there.

                         STEVE
          I know.
          Darren's mom exits as Steve pulls down two glasses, starts to
          pour soda. As he waits for the foam to settle, he sees...
          The purse. Just there. A quick look around, it doesn't take
          him long to decide. Steve steps over, opens the purse.
          A quick rifling finds a wallet: $200 in $20's. He peels off
          three bills, shoves them in his pocket. BLLEEEP!
          A cell phone starts going off in the purse. Fumbling,
          frantic, Steve stuffs the rest of the money back in the
          wallet, the wallet back in the purse, closes the purse --
          Darren's Mom is back in. She's hurrying to get to her
          celiphone, so...

                         MOM

                         (INTO PHONE)
          Hello?
          .it takes her a second to realize something's up. Not
          listening to her call, she watches Steve grab the two glasses
          and hurry out, leaving the soda bottle on the counter and
          guilt in the air. As she looks over at her purse...

          table, continues into...

                         DARREN'S ROOM
          Darren's looking through Steve's vampire memorabilia. Steve
          reaches past, starts packing it up.

                         STEVE
          I gotta go. See ya tonight.

                         DARREN
          Huh? Tonight where?
          He zips the bag, slings it over his shoulder.

                         STEVE
          Cirque du Freak.

                         DARREN

          Don't sweat it. I got money. Meet
          me ten to Midnight. The Zeiterion
          Theater.

                         DARREN
          That place is supposed to be

          What am I going to tell my parents?

                         STEVE

                         STEVE
          D, it's Cirque du Freak. You wanna
          hear about it Monday? Or see it
          tonight?
          Steve lets his point sink in, then goes.

                         CUT TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          10.

          INT. KITCHEN - SHAN HOUSE - NIGHT

          Darren and Annie and his mom and DAD eat dinner. Annie
          chatters away.

                         ANNIE
          And that's why we need a dog.
          She waits for an answer. Mom and Dad exchange a look.

                         DAD
          We'll have to think about it.

                         ANNIE
          How do you guys decide who's going
          to say no when you look at each
          other.

                         DAD
          Whoever's eyes are the widest. And
          I didn't say no. Yet.
          As she tries to think through a new approach...

                         DARREN
          Mom? I'm gonna sleep over Steve's
          tonight? Okay?

                         MOM
          (emphatic; no hesitation)
          No.

                         DARREN
          What? Why not?

                         MOM
          Because I said so, Darren.

                         DARREN
          I'm fourteen. I shouldn't even
          have to ask stuff like this.

                         MOM
          The answer is no. And I'm not sure
          I want you hanging around with
          Steve anymore.

                         DARREN
          I've known him since I was five
          years old!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          11.

                         MOM
          People change and I don't like the
          way Steve's changing.

                         DARREN
          But -- That's not fair!

                         DAD
          Stop arguing with her, Darren.
          Furious at his treatment, Darren gets up, stomps out. As
          Annie wonders if she should ask what's up...

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. DARREN'S ROOM - NIGHT

          The moonlight glinting off Darren's spider terrarium.
          Darren, under the covers, gets out of bed. Fully dressed.
          Going to his door, he listens. Then he crosses to the
          window. Pulling out the screen, he starts to climb out.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. TRELLIS - SHAN HOUSE - NIGHT

          Darren out his second floor bedroom window, starts to climb
          down via the trellis. CRACK! A section of the trellis
          BREAKS under his feet. Darren almost falls, catches hold.
          He pulls himself over, starts down again.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. UNION STREET - NIGHT

          Part of a dilapidated, mostly abandoned downtown. Noirish.
          Darren and Steve hurry around a corner.

                         STEVE
          I came here after your house.
          There was a van there, guy selling
          tickets.
          (holds up tickets)
          Rest is history.
          They cross toward the ornate, albeit crumbling facade of the
          ZEITERION THEATER. Deserted, except for a few CANDLES
          burning on the sidewalk by a door. The wind moans.

                         DARREN
          You know why they closed it, right?
          Years ago a kid fell out of the
          balcony and died. It's haunted.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          12.
          Steve catches himself getting spooked. He shoves Darren.

                         STEVE
          Get inside.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. ZEITERION LOBBY - NIGHT

          Paint peeling. The walls scribbled on. Most of all - it's
          dark. Darren and Steve head toward a glow coming from...

                         A HALLWAY
          They move toward a light at the end. Darren pauses at a
          darkened staircase. Headed up. He points it out to Steve...

                         DARREN
          The balcony. Where he fell...

                         VOICE
          May I help you?
          They wheel around, react to the sight behind them. MR. TALL.
          Gaunt, but oozing an elegant toughness.

                         STEVE
          We're here to see the show.
          He takes an ominous step forward, then holds out a hand.

          MR. TALL
          Ticket.
          Steve hands it over. Mr. Tall pockets it, looks to Darren.

          MR. TALL
          Do you have your ticket? Darren.
          Darren starts to hand it over, hesitates. The guy knew his
          name. Mr. Tall reaches, takes it.

          MR. TALL
          This way. We're about to begin.
          Mr. Tall turns on his heel and strides off. As they follow:

                         DARREN

                         (LOW)
          He knew my name.

                         STEVE
          Maybe he heard me say it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          13.
          Mr. Tall turns a corner, only steps ahead of them. But...

                         AROUND CORNER
          When they turn it, Mr. Tall is gone. Vanished. Ahead, a
          threadbare velvet CURTAIN. A low murmur on the other side.
          The boys exchange a last look, then push through into...

          THE ZEITERION THEATER
          Mouldings removed, cherubs gouged from the walls of a once
          proud theater. Rows of seats are missing as well. Those
          that remain are filled. The crowd seems nervous, watching
          the empty stage expectantly. Yearning for something special.
          No sign of Mr. Tall. Darren and Steve stand at the top of
          the aisle. The only kids here. Somewhere off stage a
          TRUMPET sounds and with it a stage light goes out.
          Steve nudges Darren, points out two empty seats halfway down.
          As they move for them, a second trumpet sounds and a second
          stage light goes out.
          And so on. By the time Darren and Steve take their seats,
          the theater has gone black. A final flourish from the
          trumpets and all is silent.
          Then, a dull green light glows across the stage. Before it
          was empty; now there is a CAGE, set on wheels, in the center.
          There's the scraping of chain. A low guttural sound.
          A white spot shines down, leaves the front half of the cage
          in light, the back half in shadow. A FIGURE moves in there..
          The AUDIENCE lean forward, hoping to see when there's a ROAR!
          Several people SCREAM as the figure CRASHES to the front of
          the cage. A WOLFMAN for lack of a better term, its body
          covered in thick, matted hair. It roars again, shakes the
          bars. Its half-canine teeth yellow, its eyes red. A chain
          hangs attached to an iron collar around its neck.
          Half the audience believe it's real. The other half are
          amazed at how real this 'performer' seems. As they buzz, Mr.
          Tall steps out on stage. Wearing red leather gloves and hat.

          MR. TALL
          Ladies and Gentlemen. Welcome to
          the Cirque du Freak. We are an
          ancient circus. We have toured for
          five hundred years...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          14.
          Darren and Steve exchange a look at this information.

          MR. TALL
          .Bringing the remarkable and
          grotesque to generations. Our
          freaks are not people in masks.
          They are not harmless misfits.
          What you see tonight is real. Each
          performer unique. None harmless.
          To prove this, the Wolfman lunges, reaches a claw through the
          bars to swipe just centimeters short of Mr. Tall who's non-
          reaction shows he knows exactly where he's standing.
          A ripple goes through the crowd as they become aware of
          TRUSKA. Startlingly beautiful. Dressed for the Moulin
          Rouge. Crossing the stage in a languid catwalk. Several MEN
          in the audience begin to cough and shift in their seats.
          Even the Wolfman takes notice.

          MR. TALL
          Beauty and the beast.
          Truska approaches the cage, makes soothing motions, her upper
          body swaying. The Wolfman lulls to a trance.
          Two stage hands - MIDGETS apparently, hidden by blue robes,
          step out and start to push the cage off stage.
          Truska steps toward the audience, moving in the same
          languorous rhythm. And then: she begins to grow a BEARD.
          Hairs creeping from above her lip, curling from her chin.
          Some in the audience recoil.
          Darren and Steve trade grins. This is great. Then...
          From either wing of the stage come twin contortionists: SIVE
          & SERSA. They walk on their hands, their legs pulled back
          with their ankles cinched behind there necks.
          As Truska exits, Sive and Sersa meet in the middle. Like
          Hindu wrestlers they take turns, climbing up and down each
          other, look like one person with two fronts. They twist like
          pretzels, getting huge LAUGHS when they pretend to be stuck.
          As it goes on, RHAMUS TWOBELLIES pads out to watch. The
          floorboards creak under his feet. He must weigh 600 pounds.
          After a moment, he turns, walks toward the audience. The
          light leaves the contortionists and focuses on Rhamus.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          15.

                         RHAMUS
          My name is Rhamus Twobellies. And
          I do have two.
          He TRIPS, stumbles toward the edge of the stage. PEOPLE in
          the front row jump back to keep from being crushed. Rhamus
          stops short, LAUGHS at them. He was pretending. He's
          practically doubled-over, resting his hands on his haunches.
          More blue-robed MIDGETS roll out a CART covered with food and
          lots of other stuff. Rhamus grabs a GLASS BOTTLE of soda.
          Instead of opening it, he bites off the glass top, chews it
          and swallows. Soon he's eating food almost as fast as he can
          grab it. Disgusting, but great fun at the same time.
          Next, he holds up a couple of nuts and bolts. Then swallows
          them whole. He swings his belly around. You can hear the
          sound of metal shifting inside.
          The crowd recoils as he starts to regurgitate, spitting out
          BOLTS, NAILS, BOTTLE CAPS, a JACKKNIFE. They clatter on
          stage. Finally, a METAL LINK appears between his teeth.
          He pinches hold of it and pulls. A CHAIN starts out of his
          mouth, up from his belly. One foot...two...six feet in all.
          With a shrug he starts off stage, dragging it behind him.
          Darren & Steve break into applause. So does the audience.
          As Rhamus' chain slides out of sight, a SNAKE slides in. An
          enormous BOA CONSTRICTOR. Impossibly huge. It slithers out
          to the center of the stage, its tongue flicking in and out.
          A SPOTLIGHT flicks down from above. The snake stops, raises
          itself several feet off the ground as it looks up, seemingly
          transfixed by the light. But in reality...
          The end of a thick ROPE drops down. And moving (headfirst!)
          down the rope is a BOY. Very thin, his blonde hair tinged
          with green. This is EVRA VON. He moves smoothly, twists
          over backwards to set his feet down on the stage.
          Evra wears a sort of cloak which he suddenly spins out of.
          The audience GASPS... Wearing only shorts, Evra's body
          SPARKLES. He's covered in gold, blue and green scales!
          He moves a vaguely webbed hand through the air, charming the
          snake which raises itself higher still. He slowly slides
          forward till he and the boa are nearly eye-to-eye.
          Then Evra leans forward and KISSES the snake on the nose.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          16.

                         DARREN & STEVE

                         DARREN
          He's as old as us.

                         STAGE
          Evra starts to make a HISSING sound. In response, the snake
          begins corkscrewing around him like the stripes on a barber
          shop pole. Finally, it slithers around his neck, pulls back
          to look him in the eye. And then...
          Evra bends at the knees, lays down and starts to roll. Like
          he was wrapped in a snake carpet, he disappears stage left.
          More applause from the audience.
          Then the stage goes dark except for a small focused spot at
          the center. Everyone waits, but nothing happens until...
          Appearing literally out of nowhere - one instant there's
          nothing under the spot and the next instant there is --

          LARTEN CREPSLEY!
          Motionless, looking past the crowd. The only difference from
          his pictures is he's a bit older and a SCAR runs down his
          left cheek. It stretches his mouth up on that side.

                         DARREN & STEVE
          Recognize him. Can't believe their eyes. Steve pulls the
          print-out from his pocket, compares.

                         DARREN
          It's him...

                         STAGE
          Crepsley disappears! The crowd mumble nervously. And just
          as suddenly he's back! On the edge of the stage, lit by the
          footlights. This time he holds a draped BIRDCAGE.

                         CREPSLEY
          It's not true. That all tarantulas
          are poisonous. Though some can
          kill a man. With one bite.
          Crepsley whisks off the covering. In the cage: a TARANTULA
          the size of a large man's hand. So big you can make out
          individual eyes. As deadly looking as it is beautiful.

                         DARREN
          Reacts. A spider!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          17.

                         STAGE
          Crepsley makes the introduction.

                         CREPSLEY
          Her name? Madam Octa. Pray that
          she never learns yours.
          Two of the blue-robed 'little people' lead a GOAT onto the
          stage. A ripple of worry runs through the crowd. Crepsley
          starts over. The goat BLEATS. The little people hold it.
          Mr. Crepsley flicks open the cage door with his finger. The
          spider sets its front legs on the bars, pulls itself through.
          A few gasps from the audience. The goat bucks.
          Madam Octa bares her fangs, poised to leap on her prey.
          Several audience members CRY OUT that this should stop.
          Crepsley looks out with mock-theatrical surprise.

                         CREPSLEY
          No...? Shall it be life?
          Chuckling to himself, he looks to the goat tenders. They
          release the goat which bee-lines its way off the stage.
          Crepsley faces the audience.

                         CREPSLEY
          I wonder if you would be as shocked
          to see the same fate for me?
          Madam Octa moves -- climbing the outside of the cage --
          taking a cautious step onto the hand holding the cage, then
          starting up Crepsley's arm. He stands dead still.

                         DARREN & STEVE
          Have a million questions, but right now the performance has
          their full edge-of-their-seat attention.

                         STAGE
          Madam Octa has nearly reached Crepsley's left shoulder.

                         CREPSLEY
          Though we have been together such a
          long time, she is no pet. I think
          she would quite enjoy killing me.
          Crepsley calmly raises his free hand. It holds a shiny TIN
          WHISTLE. Madam Octa has reaches his shoulder.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          18.

                         CREPSLEY
          For her bite there is no cure.
          Madam Octa bares her fangs, even longer now. Her malevolence
          about to be directed at her master.
          Crepsley carefully puts the whistle to his mouth and starts
          to play, as simple as it is evocative.
          Madam Octa hesitates. Then, she moves around his throat,
          starts to climb his face using his scar as her guide. She
          gets to the top of his head, stands in his shock of hair.
          She sways; she's dancing!
          Then she leaps, lands on the end of the whistle. Crepsley
          keeps playing as Madam Octa attaches a web, drops down about
          18 inches off the end. She starts to swing.
          Crepsley takes the whistle from his mouth and twirls it
          around. Octa does a few 360s and the thread breaks. She
          sails up high over Crepsley's head.
          He cranes back to watch as down she comes, legs splayed. She
          lands flat on his face. The whistle is in his hand.
          Crepsley looks out at the audience. Looking out between her
          hairy legs, his eyes are wide with horror.
          Without warning, the spotlight on him goes out. As the stage
          is plunged into darkness, we hear Crepsley SCREAM.
          A horrible, horrible sound. The audience wait, but nothing
          happens. Some of them rise from their seats, peer into the
          gloom. It's too dark.
          The sound of something being DRAGGED. Then nothing. A light
          comes up stage left as Mr. Tall steps out.

          MR. TALL
          Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
          That is the end of our show.

                         AUDIENCE MAN
          But... What happened to him?!

          MR. TALL
          Don't you know? What happens to us
          all, can happen to any of us.
          That said, there's a crack of thunder and an explosion
          seemingly at Mr. Tall's feet. He's nowhere to be seen.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          19.
          The houselights come up. The stage is empty. Some in the
          audience start to clap. Others are a bit dismayed.
          Darren and Steve sit there as people start for the exits.

                         DARREN
          Let's get outta here.

                         STEVE
          No, you go. I'm staying.
          Steve starts down toward the stage. Darren follows.

                         DARREN
          Wait. What're you doing?
          Steve reaches the stage, looks around. The audience is
          mostly exited; no one from the Cirque is in sight.
          As Steve starts up onto the stage, Darren grabs his shoulder.
          Steve wheels, shoves Darren who stumbles back into a seat.

                         STEVE
          This is my destiny. Don't ruin it.
          Steve looks dangerous as he looms. Darren raises his hands
          in surrender. Steve eases off, but he's still intense.

                         STEVE
          That car today. It was a sign.
          Sending me here. I was told
          there'd be a sign.
          Too friggin' weird.

                         DARREN
          Told by who? The guy in the chat
          room? The internet guy?

                         STEVE
          I'll tell you later. If I can.
          Steve scrambles onto the stage and disappears into the back.
          Darren stands, whispers into the dark.

                         DARREN
          Steve...
          Decision time. Darren climbs up, starts after his friend.

                         CUT TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          20.

          INT. ZEITERION THEATER - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

          Darren moves back into the gloom. Deserted, the junk casts
          sinister shadows. Then, a sound at his feet. Darren stops
          short. Sees that he's almost walked into an open stage DOOR
          IN THE FLOOR. The sound is someone moving below.

                         DARREN
          Steve...?
          No answer. Darren decides, starts down steep, rickety steps.

                         CUT TO:

          STEVE - UNDERSTAGE STORAGE AREA
          He moves past a dilapidated stage elevator. Stumbles. As he
          heads further into the dark.

                         DARREN
          Coming down the creaky stairs. Spooky.

                         DARREN
          Steve...

                         CUT TO:

                         STEVE
          Turning a corner, is startled by what turns out to be a
          costume mannequin. But beyond: a LONG BOX set on two
          sawhorses. Coffin-sized. Empty, its lid propped up by it.
          The dust is tracked with footsteps. A mini-FRIDGE hums in a
          corner. Steve steps over, sees an EXTENSION CORD which runs
          up the wall, disappears into a hole punched in the ceiling.

                         DARREN
          Stops short as a LIGHT suddenly cuts through the gloom to his
          left. Darren steps over low behind a CREDENZA. He sees...

                         STEVE
          He's opened the door to the fridge. The little bulb inside
          pushes through the gloom, lighting the area up.

                         DARREN
          Reacts as MADAM OCTA tries to jump on his face! The bars of
          her CAGE stop her. It rests on the credenza he crouches
          behind. The whistle is there too. Darren looks over as...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          21.

                         STEVE
          Reaches in the fridge, takes out a glass jar that looks to be
          filled with BLOOD. Steve raises it, swirls it around inside.

                         CREPSLEY'S VOICE
          Are you looking for me?
          Steve whirls -- drops the bottle -- SMASH!
          Standing behind him - dead still - CREPSLEY.

                         DARREN
          Rooted to the spot. Watching...

                         STEVE & CREPSLEY
          Crespley sniffs the air - the spilled blood to be exact.

                         STEVE
          I -- I know who you are.

                         CREPSLEY
          Tell me, boy. Who am I?

                         STEVE
          You're a vampire.

                         CREPSLEY
          Too broad a definition. Do you
          introduce yourself as a human? Who
          I am is Larten Crepsley.

                         DARREN
          Moving slightly to get a clearer view.

                         STEVE & CREPSLEY
          Crepsley suddenly DISAPPEARS, REAPPEARS much closer. Steve
          jumps, twists around. Unnerved.

                         CREPSLEY
          Who sent you and what do they want?

                         STEVE
          Nothing. No one.
          Crepsley takes a moment to decide if he believes him.

                         CREPSLEY
          Then what do you want?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          22.

                         STEVE
          I want to join you.

                         CREPSLEY
          Join me? I don't understand.

                         STEVE
          I want you to make me a vampire.
          Not what Crepsley (or Darren) expected. Steve stands there
          trying to look resolved. Crepsley is surprised, intrigued.

                         CREPSLEY
          Is it because you want to live
          forever? Because we don't.

                         STEVE
          I don't care about living forever.
          But you do seem to live a long
          time.

                         CREPSLEY
          A long time alone. Do you want to
          live alone?

                         STEVE
          I already do.

                         CREPSLEY
          Are you an orphan?

                         STEVE
          My father's gone; my mother doesn't
          care about me.

                         CREPSLEY
          Nor mine. You're friendless also?

                         STEVE
          I have a friend, but he doesn't
          understand. He's got too much to
          know what it's like to be alone.
          As Darren reacts to this...

                         STEVE
          When you're alone you feel weak.
          Useless. But I know there must be
          something strong about it, too. I
          want to feel the power of being
          alone. I want to be a vampire.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          23.

                         CREPSLEY
          The power of being alone will never
          be greater than the weakness of it.

                         STEVE
          I don't care.
          Crepsley's actually impressed, but after a moment he waves a
          dismissive hand.

                         CREPSLEY
          It makes no matter. We do not
          blood children. I'm sorry.
          Steve pulls a JACKKNIFE from his pocket, flips open the 2-
          inch blade. Crepsley laughs out loud.

                         CREPSLEY
          Do you intend to use that on me?
          And we feel it more than see it, but Steve cuts into his own
          palm. He holds it up, moist and red in Crepsley's face.

                         STEVE
          Do it. Make me a vampire.

                         CREPSLEY
          Do not tempt me.

                         DARREN
          Can't believe what he's watching. He sees Crepsley suddenly
          get 'scent' of something. Something to do with Steve's
          blood. Not quite a clear view as Crepsley grabs Steve's
          wrist, dabs a finger into his palm and then tastes it.

                         CREPSLEY
          Crepsley shoves Steve down to the ground and immediately
          begins spitting onto the floor. Like it was poison.

                         STEVE
          What's wrong?

                         CREPSLEY
          You have bad blood.

                         STEVE
          What do you mean?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          24.

                         CREPSLEY
          I can taste the menace in your
          blood. You can never be a vampire.
          You're evil.
          Steve scrambles to his feet.

                         STEVE
          That's a lie. You take that back!
          Crepsley draws himself full, his voice deadly.

                         CREPSLEY
          Go home.
          Suddenly cowed, Steve just stands there blinking.

                         CREPSLEY

          GO!
          Steve runs, disappears into the gloom. After a moment, we
          can hear him scurrying up the stairs. Then he's gone.

                         DARREN
          Frozen to his spot, watches as Crepsley, seemingly ill, holds
          his head and spits again onto the floor. Then he steps over
          and kicks the fridge door closed.
          And in the blink of an eye, he's gone. Disappeared.
          Darren is alone. He starts out, then stops. Looks back.
          That beautiful spider. And Darren takes Madam Octa's cage
          and the whistle and makes a run for it. Just like that.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. STREETS - DARREN'S NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT

          3 AM. Dead quiet. Darren hurries home, cage in hand.
          Looking over his shoulder. So far so good. He nearly trips
          over an untied shoelace. He sets down the cage, to tie it.
          Madam Octa lunges across her cage at a WORM on the sidewalk.

                         DARREN
          Oh. You want that?
          Darren picks up the worm, lowers it between the bars. A beat
          and then Madam Octa snatches it away from him. Dinner.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          25.

                         DARREN
          See? I'm your friend... You're so
          beautiful I stopped thinking.
          The wind rustles. Darren grabs the cage, continues.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. THE SHAN HOUSE - NIGHT

          The house dark. Holding the cage with one hand, Darren
          starts climbing the side of the house using the other. He
          avoids the broken section, but as he reaches the window:
          His Dad is standing there looking out. Busted.

                         DAD
          Get inside.
          From his angle, Darren's Dad can't see the cage in his son's
          hand. Darren hooks it over the end piece of part of the
          trellis and climbs in. Leaving the cage hanging behind.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. DARREN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Darren stands across from his Dad.

                         DAD
          A freak show? Are you kidding me?

                         DARREN
          It was down at the old Zeiterion
          Theater. Look, dad, I'm sorry.
          It's just, I couldn't resist. I --

                         DAD
          You told me the other day you were
          broke. You were looking for a job
          to do around the house this
          weekend.

                         DARREN
          Yeah? So?

                         DAD
          Where'd you get money for the show?

                         DARREN
          Steve had money.
          Darren's Dad's suspicion is confirmed.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          26.

                         DAD
          Steve... We weren't going to tell
          you, but we think Steve stole money
          from your Mom's purse yesterday.

                         DARREN
          He wouldn't do that.

                         DAD
          Mom's pretty sure about it.

                         DARREN
          Man, what is this? You don't want
          me hanging around with him. Now
          you say you think he stole money?
          Do you know for sure?

                         DAD
          No.

                         DARREN
          Steve's had some bad times lately.
          I'm trying to be a good friend.

                         DAD
          Being a good friend and sneaking
          out are two different things.

                         DARREN
          I have to sneak out! You treat me
          like a kid!
          A moment as Darren's raised voice rings out of the room.

                         DAD
          Then act like an adult if that's
          how you want to be treated. This
          world is crossed by fences --
          Darren interrupts. He's heard it a million times.

                         DARKEN
          I know, I know. And you gotta
          decide which side you stand on.
          And you can't sit on it either.
          His Dad doesn't enjoy hearing his words thrown back at him.
          He starts for the door, looks back before exiting.

                         DAD
          A freak show. What do they do, put
          people in cages for everyone to
          laugh at?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          27.
          Darren feels bad, like a kid. He looks down at the floor.

                         DARREN
          It wasn't like that.
          A beat. Darren's Dad goes, closing the door. Darren sighs.
          He goes to the window, pulls up the cage. He scans a look
          outside. Except for his Dad, the coast is clear.

          Darren's Mom making omelettes. Darren's DAD helping, dicing
          up some ham. Annie sits at the table awaiting the results.

                         ANNIE
          Is he in a lot of trouble?

                         DAD
          Nothing a few years in prison won't
          take care of.

                         ANNIE
          I don't see what the big deal is...

                         (TO MOM)
          Did you talk to Steve's mom yet?

                         MOM
          Get this. She said she couldn't
          comment because she didn't make it
          home last night herself.

                         ANNIE
          Where was she?

                         MOM
          Go tell Darren it's breakfast.

          Darren's just snapped her photo with his DIGITAL CAMERA.
          As the door bursts open and Annie enters... Darren scrambles
          to block the cage from view.

                         DARREN
          Annie, you gotta learn to knock.

                         ANNIE
          Mom said to come eat. What's that?
          As Annie tries to look, Darren stays in front of her.

                         DARREN
          Out.
          Annie sighs, heads out. Darren puts the cage in the closet.

          INT. KITCHEN - SHAN HOUSE - DAY

          Darren arrives, sits as everyone pretends not to notice. His
          mom slides his omelette off the pan into his plate. Annie
          watches everyone's every move. Darren eats a bite.

                         DARREN
          Mom, this is the best omelette I
          ever had.
          His Dad can't help but smile. Good move. Mom is pleased,
          but knows she's being manipulated. As Annie stifles a laugh,
          Darren shoots her a look.
          A KNOCK at the kitchen door. Annie gets up, opens the door
          to reveal: Steve. From his angle he can only sees Annie.

                         STEVE
          Hey, midget, where's the idiot?
          Annie motions Steve in. He stops short when he see everyone
          else. He recovers, does his best Eddie Haskell...

                         STEVE
          Hi, Mr. Shan, Mrs. Shan. It's nice
          to see ya.

          INT. DARREN'S ROOM - DAY

          Darren and Steve enter his bedroom.

                         STEVE
          What was that? Everyone acting
          like they don't know me. Did I
          walk in on something?
          Darren closes the door. Gets to the point.

                         DARREN
          What happened last night?

                         STEVE
          Nothing. I hung out in the theater
          for awhile, but no one was around.
          The lie hangs in the air a moment.

                         STEVE
          Sorry about the way I acted. I'm
          sorry I pushed you.

                         DARREN
          Don't worry. There's, you know, no
          bad blood or anything like that.

                         STEVE
          What?

                         DARREN
          I said don't worry.

                         STEVE
          You said bad blood. I never heard
          you say something like that before.

                         DARREN
          What are you, the word police?
          Steve gives him a look. A weird tension in the air. Darren
          glances at the bandage on Steve's palm, changes the topic.

                         DARREN
          Wanna see that new game I got?

                         STEVE
          Sure...
          Darren steps over, starts his computer up. While waiting,
          Steve sees the digital camera on the dresser, picks it up.

                         STEVE
          I gotta get one of these.
          Steve switches it on. Something occurs to Darren too late...

                         DARREN
          Let me see that --
          On the screen: the PHOTO OF MADAM OCTA. Steve twists around
          to keep the camera out of Darren's reach.

                         STEVE
          It's Madam Octa.

                         DARREN
          I took it at the show.

                         STEVE
          Liar. Look at the background.
          This got taken right on your desk.
          Darren's caught. As they just stare at each other.

          How'd you do it?

                         DARREN
          They were loading a van outside.
          I, I just took her.

                         STEVE
          Just like that...
          (after a look)
          You stole from a vampire you know?

                         DARREN
          Just because he had a coffin
          doesn't mean he's really a...
          Darren trails off. Steve realizes Darren saw the coffin.

                         STEVE
          You were there, weren't you?

                         (NO ANSWER)
          You heard what he said to me? That
          I was evil?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          31.

                         DARREN
          I didn't believe it.
          Steve studies Darren, hopes that's true.

                         DARREN
          I heard what you said to him, too.
          That you wanted to be a vampire.
          Steve doesn't want to talk about it. He looks at Madam Octa.

                         STEVE
          How do you think he made her do
          what he wanted?
          Darren opens his desk drawer, pulls out the flute.

                         DARREN
          I wish I knew how to play it.

                         STEVE
          I think that was just for show. I
          think he used something else. Some
          kind of mind control.

                         DARREN
          You mean telepathy?

                         STEVE
          I bet anyone with a brain could do
          it. Which leaves you out.
          Steve smiles, gives Darren a little punch in the arm. The
          tension is loosening. They react to a KNOCK on the door.

                         ANNIE'S VOICE
          Can I come in?
          Darren goes to the door. Opens it a few inches.

                         DARREN
          I swear to God, Annie...

                         ANNIE
          What? I knocked.
          As they talk, Steve opens the cage door. Madam Octa sets her
          arms on the edge, pulls herself out.

                         LEAPS --
          Lands on Steve's shoulder. Her fangs, wet with poison, glint
          just before she sinks them into Steve's throat. She BITES!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          32.
          Steve surges upward, his shout dying in his throat. He
          stiffens, eyes snapped wide, and then crumples to the floor.
          Darren and Annie react as --
          Madam Octa scurries off, disappears behind the curtain.

                         DARREN

                         (TO ANNIE)
          Don't move.
          Annie freezes. Darren grabs a BASEBALL BAT which leans in
          the corner. He reaches out, pokes at the curtain with it.
          Madam Octa drops down onto the window sill -- WHAM! Wood
          cracks as Darren brings down the bat, but Madam Octa is too
          quick. She disappears, leaping out the open window!
          Darren pulls it shut. He rushes back to Steve, turns him
          over. Steve's skin is already a deathly pale.

                         DARREN
          Steve...
          Annie reaches out, takes Steve's hand.

                         ANNIE
          Darren, he's freezing.

                         DARREN
          Get dad. Go.

          INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY

          Hospital doors BANG OPEN as a gurney bearing Steve is rushed

                         DOCTOR
          What kind of spider was it?

                         DARREN
          I think some kind of a tarantula.

                         DOCTOR
          Where is it?

                         DARREN
          It got away.
          Darren's Dad holds up the camera.

                         DAD
          We have a picture of it.
          The doctor takes it as a NURSE meets the gurney.

                         DOCTOR
          Anaphylactic shock. Get Doctor
          Lund. And we need to download a
          photo to poison control.
          This is as far as Darren goes. Steve is wheeled in,
          surrounded. Syringes are drawn, handed in. All we can see
          of Steve is one skinny arm hanging out.
          PUSH IN ON DARREN. Sick for Steve. Scared. Unaware that
          his world has only just started to crash down around him.

          Tough, no nonsense. Marching along, carrying a print-out,
          coming to a stop where Darren sits on a plastic chair. He
          sticks the print-out into his face. The PHOTO of Madam Octa.

          DR. LUND
          How did you make this and why would
          you make this?
          Darren's Mom and Dad start over from down the corridor.

          DR. LUND
          Poison control couldn't ID it. In
          fact, the department of Entomology
          at Harvard couldn't find it in
          their data base. So either it's a
          new species or it's a fake photo.

                         DAD
          If my son said he took that photo,
          then that's the truth.
          Dr. Lund just stares at Darren. Then:

          What have you done to him?!
          STEVE'S MOM approaches, her eyes on Darren. Disheveled,
          cheap looking, she hasn't quite started her hangover yet.
          She lunges past Darren's dad, grabs Darren by the shoulder.

                         STEVE'S MOM
          Did you hurt Stevie?! Did you?!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          34.
          She shakes Darren hard. Darren's Dad gets between them. She
          breaks down, sobbing. Darren's mom tries to soothe her as
          she moans about what a bad mother she is.

          DR. LUND
          Your friend's going to die unless
          we find out what's in him.
          On Darren. He looks down to where light spills out from

          Crepsley's COFFIN. A beat and Darren steps up. He grips the

          Madam Octa perched on the side, staring back at him!
          Darren stumbles back. The coffin lid SLAMS to the stage as
          Darren loses his footing, lands on his butt. And then --
          APPLAUSE. One pair of hands create a hollow echo.
          Crepsley sits alone in the middle of the theater. Clapping.
          And then he's gone! Only to reappear over Darren, offering a
          hand up. Darren scrambles to his feet. A beat.

                         CREPSLEY
          What have you come for this time?
          Darren pulls out a CRUCIFIX, holds it in Crepsley's face.
          The vampire takes it, looks it over. It has no effect.

                         DARREN
          Crosses don't hurt you?

          Why should they?

          Because... you're evil.

                         CREPSLEY
          Am I? Are vampire bats evil when
          they drink the blood of cows?

                         DARREN
          That's different. Bats are animals.

                         CREPSLEY
          So am I. So are you. Our
          appetites don't make us evil.

          Why are you here?

                         DARREN
          Your spider bit my friend Steve.
          Crepsley shrugs, tosses Darren back his crucifix.

                         DARREN
          He's dying.

                         CREPSLEY
          Yes, well, boys who play with
          things they do not understand can
          hardly complain if --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          36.

                         DARREN
          You have to help him!

                         CREPSLEY
          The antidote to her poison is rare.
          Expensive. Why should someone as
          evil as I am waste it on Steve?

                         DARREN
          I'll pay you back. If it takes 50
          years. Whatever it costs.

                         CREPSLEY
          Money doesn't interest me.

                         DARREN
          There's something you want. That's
          why you're here waiting for me.
          Right?
          Crepsley's surprised and pleased by Darren's intuitiveness.

                         CREPSLEY
          The night Steve came below to speak
          to me, you were there. Did you
          hear what we talked about?

                         DARREN
          He wanted to... become like you.

                         CREPSLEY
          You don't just 'become' a vampire.
          The change is too extreme. And if
          the shock didn't kill you, your
          inexperience would. So you become
          one in stages. A half-vampire at
          first. With greater strength than
          a human, but still able to go out
          in sunlight. You learn from a full
          vampire. Do you understand?

                         DARREN
          I think so...

                         CREPSLEY
          But your friend has bad blood.
          He's no good. There's no telling
          what he'll become as he matures.

                         DARREN
          I don't believe that someone can
          have bad blood.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          37.

                         CREPSLEY
          And yesterday you didn't believe in
          vampires. Regardless, I've left
          the Cirque. Left my protection. I
          need someone to protect me while I
          sleep. I need an apprentice.

                         DARREN

                         (SUDDENLY REALIZES)
          Me?
          Crepsley nods.

                         DARREN
          You're crazy. There's no way.

                         CREPSLEY
          Then your friend will die.
          The words hang in the air. Crepsley smiles.

                         CREPSLEY
          You hardly have a choice. It's
          your destiny.

                         DARREN
          Destiny? That doesn't make sense.

                         CREPSLEY
          Try this then. You're reckless
          enough to steal, responsible enough
          to come back for a friend. That's
          enough for me.

                         DARREN
          Not for me.

                         CREPSLEY
          Yes, well, destiny can't be
          explained. It must be lived. Now,
          you're wasting my time.

                         DARREN
          There's gotta be another way.

                         CREPSLEY
          There isn't.

                         DARREN
          Please... He's my friend.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          38.

                         CREPSLEY
          And he slips away while we argue.
          Life or death? Yes or no?

                         DARREN
          You'd never be able to trust me.
          If I got a chance for payback I'd
          take it.

                         CREPSLEY
          Yes or no?
          Thoughts rush, then stop. Darren finally just nods.
          Crepsley raises his right hand. The nails are not especially
          long, but they look thick and sharp.
          Crepsley takes Darren's hand, jabs at his forefinger, draws
          blood. He dabs off a drop, smells it, then tastes it.

                         CREPSLEY
          You have good blood.
          Crepsley lifts his own left hand. He presses the nails of
          his right into the fleshy tips of his left hand fingers.
          Then he uses the left nails to mark the right fingers in the
          same way. Blood drips down all ten fingers.

                         CREPSLEY
          Lift your hands.
          Darren does as he's told. Crepsley digs all ten nails into
          all ten of Darren's fingertips. Darren jerks back in pain.

                         CREPSLEY
          Get used to pain. More lies ahead.
          He motions to his hands. Darren raises them, fingers spread.
          Crepsley presses his fingertips to Darren's. Blood brothers.
          As their eyes lock, Darren frowns at an alien sensation.

                         CREPSLEY
          The blood flows into your left arm
          and out of your right. Do you feel
          it? Getting near your heart?
          Darren nods, shivers.

                         CREPSLEY
          Almost there.
          A force arcs through Darren's body. He screams, falls down.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          39.
          Crepsley turns away, starts to lick the blood from his
          fingertips. Tries to block out Darren's soft whimpering.
          Tries to block out any sympathy he feels.

                         CREPSLEY
          The world will start to slow down.
          You'll become a witness of time.
          (snaps out of it)
          Your friend's time is running out.
          He pulls Darren to his feet.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. ZEITERION THEATER - NIGHT

          They step out into the moonlight. Darren a little wobbly.

                         CREPSLEY
          Take my arm. Don't let go.
          Darren takes hold. Crepsley starts to move. Only it seems
          more like he's still and the ground is moving under his feet.
          Darren looks about as the building begin to streak past, the
          road a blurred ribbon. The night has a weird chromatic look.
          The world moving faster, Crepsley and Darren slipping past.
          A moment later and they're in the...

          HOSPITAL PARKING LOT
          Crepsley pulls loose Darren's hand. They're still bleeding.

                         CREPSLEY
          Lick your fingers. Vampire spit
          will stop wounds from bleeding.
          Darren looks at his fingers, then around the lot.

                         DARREN
          How'd we get here?

                         CREPSLEY
          It's called flitting. Which room
          is your friend in?

                         CUT TO:

          INT. HOSPITAL - STEVE'S ROOM - NIGHT

          Tubes run in and out of Steve. His breathing is labored.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          40.
          Crepsley leans over him, rolls up one of Steve's eyelids.
          Darren watches as Crespley looks into Steve's eye.

                         CREPSLEY
          We're in time. He still has a few
          minutes left.
          Crepsley takes a small AMBER VIAL from his pocket. He breaks
          a wax seal then pinches out a small blackened cork.
          He pulls the drip line out of the IV CATHETER and empties a
          drop of the vial's dark, viscous contents inside. It swirls
          murkily, coloring the liquid on its way into Steve's arm.
          A beat and then Steve seems to convulse, his arms and legs
          twitching. Is he dying?

                         DARREN
          What's happening?

                         CREPSLEY
          He was near death. The journey
          back is not pleasant. What do you
          know about him, this boy with bad
          blood?

                         DARREN
          He's my friend.

                         CREPSLEY
          Hmm... Who's his father?

                         DARREN
          Never met him. I don't think Steve
          ever did either. Why do you want
          to know?
          And then Steve comes around. He opens his eyes, focuses on
          Darren for a moment. He looks puzzled.

                         STEVE
          Darren?
          And then he drifts off, asleep. His breathing growing
          deeper, steadier. Darren realizing he's going to be okay.

                         CREPSLEY
          Will you come with me now or do you
          have things to set in order first?
          That's when it really hits home. He's agreed to leave every-
          thing and go off with a vampire. Without really thinking,
          Darren starts backing toward the door, his eyes on Crepsley.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          41.

                         CREPSLEY
          I see...
          Darren's almost to the door. Crepsley stays where he is.

                         CREPSLEY
          Run if you want. It won't help.
          You're a creature of the night now,
          Darren Shan.
          Darren turns and bolts leaving Crepsley alone. Chuckling,
          the vampire tucks Steve's covers up under his chin.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. HOSPITAL DOORS - NIGHT

          BURSTING OPEN as Darren charges out. Running for his life.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. DARREN'S ROOM - MORNING

          Darren asleep in his bed. The door opens and his mom enters.

                         MOM
          Darren... Wake up, honey.
          Darren wakes with a start as she gives him a little shake.
          As he looks about, wonders what reality he's in.

                         MOM
          I just got off the phone. Great
          news. Steve's going to be okay.

                         DARREN
          What?

                         MOM
          The hospital says it's a miracle.
          Was it a dream? Darren looks down at his hands. On the tip
          of each finger and two thumbs are small round WHITE SCARS.
          Darren instinctively hugs his mom. She thinks he's
          overjoyed, can't see his look of terror. She hugs him back.

                         MOM
          Yeah, it's great news. I know how
          you feel.

                         CUT TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          42.

          EXT. THE SHAN HOUSE - DAY

          The door opens and Darren steps out. He takes a long look up
          and down the street. Nervous. Then he see the sun up in the
          sky. Relaxes a little. Right... Vampires... Sun.
          He takes a step down the stairs when... From out of the
          bushes... SOMEONE LEAPS!

                         ANNIE
          Boo!
          Darren nearly jumps out of his skin. Annie laughs.

                         ANNIE
          Got you! I finally got you! -
          Darren turns on her, looks like he could kill her.

                         DARREN
          Don't ever do that again.
          Annie's smile drops away. As Darren continues on...

                         CUT TO:

          INT. HALLWAY - SCHOOL - DAY

          Darren walking along, feeling isolated as he moves past the
          other students. Everything seems weird, off.
          A couple of KIDS RUSH past him going into a classroom. Then
          a COUPLE more coming the other way.

                         KID
          Hey, Shan, you gotta see this.
          They duck into the classroom. Darren follows.

                         SCIENCE LAB
          TWENTY or so KIDS all pressed around the Boa Constrictor
          tank. Steve holds court.

                         STEVE
          .Doctor said it was a miracle.
          They say I'm unique --
          Steve spots Darren as he steps up in the back.

                         STEVE
          Hey, Darren. I've been looking for
          you. We got a lot to talk about.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          43.

                         DARREN
          Yeah?

                         STEVE
          But first...
          Steve holds out a fist. A MOUSE pokes its head out through
          an opening in the hand. Its whiskers twitch. As Darren
          looks from the mouse to the snake...
          Steve addresses the kids does his best 'Mr. Tall'. He tries
          to be entertaining, but he comes off creepy.

                         STEVE
          Welcome to Cirque du Steve. What
          happens to us all can happen to any
          of us. If you watch, it's by your
          own free will. Say farewell...

                         HEFTS MOUSE
          .to Crepsley the mouse.
          Darren reacts to the name. Steve lowers his hand into the
          terrarium. Some kids already look away, others are intent.

                         DARREN

                         STOP --
          Steve hesitates. Darren pushes to the front.

                         DARREN
          It's cruel.

                         STEVE
          It's nature. Anyhow don't watch.

                         (TO KIDS)
          And don't blink; you might miss it.
          Steve sets the mouse in the terrarium.
          The MOUSE takes a few tentative steps. Moves toward a corner
          away from the... SNAKE who's suddenly alert. It raises its
          head, flicks its tongue. Coils back on itself.
          ZAP! The snake STRIKES...
          And Darren darts down his hand! CATCHES the snake just below
          its head, out of mid-air, out of mid-strike. Impossible!
          The snake twists in Darren's hand. The students are blown
          away. Steve's eyes narrow, his wheels are turning.
          The BELL RINGS. Moment over. Kids hurry out to class.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          44.
          Darren scoops up the mouse, drops the snake back in. As he
          starts out, Steve cuts him off.

                         STEVE
          What happened to the spider?

                         DARREN
          I killed it.
          Steve hesitates, processes, looks Darren over.

                         STEVE
          I had a dream. You and Crepsley
          were in my hospital room...

                         DARREN
          Tell me about it later.
          Darren starts away. Steve grabs him hard, spins him around.

                         STEVE
          I'll tell you now.
          Darren reacts instinctively, grabs Steve with his free hand
          and SLAMS him against the wall. Steve's nearly off the
          ground, only his left toe touching.

                         DARREN
          I said later.
          Darren lets go, heads off. Steve watches, wonders.

          EXT. STREETS - DARREN'S NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

          Darren walks home, hands in pockets. Annie comes up behind.

                         ANNIE
          Darren! Wait up!
          He looks over his shoulder, keep going.

                         ANNIE
          Can I walk home with you?
          He softens, slows down. After a few silent steps.

                         DARREN
          Got you something.
          Darren pulls the MOUSE from his pocket. Annie loves it, cups
          it in her hand.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          45.

                         ANNIE
          He's adorable.

          ANNIE & DARREN - A CREATURE'S POV
          Coming in low and fast.

                         STREET
          Annie SCREAMS as a GERMAN SHEPHERD charges, stops just short
          of them. GROWLING like it was rabid. Like it hates Darren.
          Darren steps between it and Annie. Darren's pupils dilate
          oddly; he curls his lip to show his own teeth. The dog
          starts to back off..

                         ANNIE
          Hey. That's King.

                         DARREN
          No it's not. King's my buddy.

                         ANNIE
          That's King, Darren. It is.
          Darren realizes it is King. As Darren realizes something's
          wrong with Darren.. Another growl. From down the street.
          Darren looks back as a black 1966 LINCOLN prowls through the
          intersection. The one seen at school. It slows, windows
          blacked out. As it continues, disappears from view...

                         DARREN
          Come on.
          As Darren hurries Annie along down the street...

                         CUT TO:

          INT. KITCHEN - SHAN HOUSE - NIGHT

          Darren at the kitchen table doing his math homework. His Mom
          makes dinner, chopping vegetables at the sink.

                         MOM
          How was school today?

                         DARREN
          The usual. Sometimes it was
          boring, sometimes really boring.
          Darren's mom laughs. Then...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          46.

                         MOM
          Ouch!
          She drops the knife on the cutting board. A thick drop of
          BLOOD runs down her finger.
          Darren flinches at the sight and in that moment we PUNCH INTO
          his eyes. The PUPILS swirl red; the IRISES flatten and
          narrow. A dark, ravenous look.

          MOM - DARREN'S POV
          Holding up her finger. Her skin tone receding back into
          gray, the blood pulsing with red vibrancy. Alive. A target.

                         DARREN
          Standing at the blood's seeming siren call. But as he
          suddenly moves forward, she turns away.
          Darren stops as she wraps her finger in a paper towel. She
          looks back at him: misunderstands his hunger for concern.

                         MOM
          It's okay, honey. I just need a
          band-aid.
          Darren looks at his mom's neck. His eyes zero in on a little
          blue VEIN PULSING away. She leaves the room to get a band-
          aid. As Darren's horror sinks in...

                         CUT TO:

          INT. BATHROOM - SHAN HOUSE - NIGHT

          Darren looks at his reflection in the MIRROR. Looking for
          reassurance. He curls his lip, checks his teeth. They look
          normal. He reaches out. Trying to reach himself.
          His hand comes to a stop against the glass. His nails CLICK
          hard against the surface. He scrapes the nail of his
          forefinger along the glass. It leaves a deep scratch.
          Darren starts to freak a little. His breath getting ragged.
          He tries to get a hold of himself, looks back in the mirror.

                         DARREN
          You're different...

          47.

          INT. ZEITERION THEATER - STAGE - NIGHT

          Darren walks down an aisle, climbs up onto the empty stage.
          Dark, but Darren moves calmly, like it was noon.

                         DARREN
          Hello? Hey!
          Crepsley appears. Darren turns, sees him. A beat. Crepsley
          raises his hands to the gloom around them.

                         CREPSLEY
          The darkness isn't so scary
          anymore, is it?

                         DARREN
          I'm starting to think it's me
          that's scary.
          Crepsley waits to hear more.

                         DARREN
          It's only gonna get worse, isn't
          it? There's no way back, is there?
          No magic potion to make me human
          again?
          Crepsley shakes his head. Darren nods that he understands.

                         DARREN
          We made a deal. I won't run away
          again.

                         CREPSLEY
          It's neither here nor there, but, I
          do feel sorry for you.
          Darren waves it off, doesn't want to hear it.

                         CREPSLEY
          Are you ready then? The night is
          young. We can make many miles.

                         DARREN
          I can't just -- My family, I can't
          let them think I just left them.
          Or that something happened to me.
          My mother would... She couldn't...
          As Darren trails off, Crepsley really does look sympathetic.

                         CREPSLEY
          There's only one thing for it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          48.

                         DARREN
          What?

                         CREPSLEY
          We'll have to kill you.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. LIVING ROOM - SHAN HOUSE - NIGHT

          Darren's parents watching CNN. Darren comes in.

                         DARREN
          I'm going to bed.
          They say 'good night' to him. Impulsively, Darren kisses his
          dad on the cheek, then does the same to his mom.

                         DARREN
          I love you both. I don't say it
          that much, but I do.
          Darren's Mom is caught off guard, but happy to hear it.

                         MOM
          We love you, too. Don't we, Tommy?

                         DAD
          Of course we do.
          Darren looks at them a beat, then smiles, satisfied.

                         DARREN
          Good night.
          They watch him go, then exchange looks.

                         (SHRUGS)

          INT. ANNIE'S ROOM - NIGHT

          Annie asleep already. Darren enters, pulls his sister's
          blanket up, tucks it under her chin. He whispers:

                         DARREN
          Goodbye, knucklehead. If I can
          ever help you, I will.

          49.

          INT. DARREN'S ROOM - NIGHT

          Darren enters to find Crepsley sitting at his desk. He holds
          a small dark bottle between his fingers (different than the
          one he gave to Steve). As Crepsley's about to speak...

                         DARREN
          Shut up.
          Off Crepsley's reaction...

                         DARREN
          This is my home and I'm never gonna
          see it again, so don't rush me.
          Crepsley makes a motion to zip his lips. All the same, he
          stands, unscrews the bottle as Darren takes a last look
          around. He takes a PHOTO of his family off the dresser.

                         DARREN
          Hold onto this for me, okay?
          Crepsley takes the photo, offers Darren the bottle in return.
          Darren sniffs, recoils at the foul smell.

                         DARREN
          You're sure it will work?
          Crepsley opens the window.

                         CREPSLEY
          Your heart will slow down so
          drastically they won't find a
          pulse. With the fall from the
          window, they'll think you're dead.

                         DARREN
          What if I break bones?

                         CREPSLEY
          Even better. They'll mend in a few
          days. Vampires don't stay broken
          for long and it takes a very long
          fall to kill one.

                         DARREN
          And the funeral home? Won't they
          embalm me or something?

                         CREPSLEY
          Don't worry. I have ways of making
          my thoughts become the thoughts of
          others. They'll leave you alone.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          50.
          Crepsley gestures to the window. Knowing the plan, Darren
          climbs out, his foot resting on the trellis. He looks to the
          ground, back to Crepsley as an odd thought hits him.

                         DARREN
          My dad's allergic to grass. It's
          my job to cut the lawn.

                         CREPSLEY
          You have a new job now. Drink.
          Darren steels himself, gulps it down, hands the bottle back.

                         DARREN
          So this is destiny, huh? Tastes
          like crap.
          Darren body seizes up. He lets go, but Crepsley grabs him.

                         CREPSLEY
          Your breathing is slowing, your
          heart as well. Do you feel it?
          Darren can't answer. He blinks his eyes 'yes' instead.

                         CREPSLEY
          You may be aware of what's going on
          around you. Remember, the grief
          that you hear will be a release for
          those who express it.
          Darren's eyes drift shut. Crepsley lets him go.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. SHAN HOUSE - NIGHT

          Darren FALLS, crashes through the trellis and thumps into the
          lawn. Crepsley looks down from the window, then disappears.
          CLOSE ON Darren lying face down in the grass. CRICKETS
          chirp. Beyond, a NEIGHBOR walks his DOG. The dog suddenly
          turns in the direction of Darren, pulls on its leash.

                         NEIGHBOR
          No, no, come on --
          The Neighbor stops short as he sees the body.

                         NEIGHBOR
          Hey -- Hey, kid --
          He rolls Darren over, realizes something is very wrong.

          We stay on Darren, the dog sniffing at him as the neighbor
          disappears toward the front door. We hear his fist pound. A
          moment later, Darren's father is there. He looks at Darren,
          up to the open window, realizes he fell. An instant later,
          he's on his knees, cradling his son.

                         DAD
          Darren? Darren!
          A moment later his Mom...

                         MOM
          Darren! Oh my God!
          We're still on Darren's face, his eye open a slit.

          Friends and family passing by. The sounds of people crying.
          TWO CUTE GIRLS from school lean in.

                         GIRL ONE
          He's still cute.

                         GIRL TWO
          I always had a crush on him.
          The Goalie from school soccer is next. He holds a little
          SOCCER BALL in his hand. Tucks it into the coffin.

                         GOALIE
          For the next life, Shan. Top right

          Annie steps up, gently strokes her brother's cheek. Then
          suddenly overwhelmed, she buries her face in their Dad's
          chest. He leans in tenderly over his son. Choked up:

                         DAD
          I love you, Darren. You said it

          Steve nods sadly, looks to Darren. He pats one of Darren's
          hands which are folded across his chest.
          In reality Steve checks Darren's fingertips. A WHITE SCAR at
          the end of each one. Steve's crazy idea may be confirmed.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

          Darren's coffin is lowered into the ground.

                         MINISTER
          Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, in
          sure and certain hope of the
          resurrection to come...
          Darren's Dad tosses a handful of earth down onto the coffin.

                         CUT TO:

          DARREN INSIDE THE CLOSED COFFIN
          The lid an inch from his face. His eyelid twitching as we
          hear shovelfuls of dirt hit the lid. The sound growing
          duller at each turn. Then, as Darren's eye flickers open...

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

          Moonless. The sound of digging continues. Only now, dirt is
          coming out of the hole rather than going in.
          Crepsley is digging the coffin back up. Effortlessly.
          Finally, he spreads his feet apart, pulls open the lid.
          Darren sputters as some of the dirt spills onto his face.
          Crepsley reaches down, pulls him up and out of the grave.
          Darren sits on the ground, coughing then moaning.

                         CREPSLEY
          On your feet.

                         DARREN
          My legs are asleep.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          54.
          Crepsley pulls him up anyhow. Darren stumbles a few steps,
          nearly falls before finding his balance.

                         CREPSLEY
          Walk it off. I'll fill this back
          in. Go. Breathe some air.
          Crepsley closes the coffin, begins to fill the hole as Darren
          ambles off. Not exactly the start of his best day.

          MOVE WITH DARREN
          Passing among the graves, stretching his arms, twisting.
          Really beat up. He looks about, the names and dates on the
          headstones popping into focus even from far away. Night
          vision. Suddenly he becomes aware of something:
          Steve. On the other side of a mausoleum. Ten feet away.

                         DARREN
          What are you doing here?

                         STEVE
          (smiles; closing in)
          Vampire hunting.
          Steve rushes the last step, a jagged WOODEN STAKE held high
          over his head. He knocks Darren back on the ground.
          Pouncing on top, he brings down the stake.
          Darren catches hold of Steve's wrist. Stops the point of the
          stake just over his heart. Steve puts his weight into it. A
          desperate moment of struggle, but Darren's strength is
          resurgent. He throws Steve off.
          Steve rolls to his feet, comes at him again. Darren catches
          his wrist with one hand, his throat with the other. He slams
          him up against the mausoleum, holds him there.

                         DARREN
          What do you have against vampires?
          You wanted to become one yourself.

                         STEVE
          Yeah, I wanted to, but you did.
          You stole my dream. You stole my
          destiny.

                         DARREN
          Are you crazy? I did it to save
          your life. That was the deal. Me
          for you.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          55.

                         STEVE

                         (UNHINGING)
          Liar. You told him I was evil.
          You planned this all along. And
          you'll pay! You'll pay --
          Darren jams the stake under Steve's throat. That stops him
          struggling. The points jabs him as he swallows.

                         DARREN
          I want you to leave...
          Steve is just beginning to realize how strong Darren is now.

                         DARREN
          I want you to leave and forget you
          ever saw me. Understand?
          Scared, he nods. Darren shoves him away, brakes the stake in
          two. Steve heads away, looks back over his shoulder.

                         STEVE
          I'm going to hunt you, Darren. You
          and the other one. Crepsley. I'll
          put a stake in you and burn you to
          ashes. I'll make sure you never
          come back from the grave again.
          WHAM. Steve walks right into Crepsley. He picks Steve up by
          the shoulders, pulls him close. With a voice like Death...

                         CREPSLEY
          If we ever meet again, I will show
          you loneliness you cannot imagine.
          Steve trembles in fear. Crepsley lets go. Steve takes off
          running. Crepsley looks to Darren.

                         CREPSLEY
          Do you still question his blood?
          Darrenthoughtful, doesn't know what to think.

                         DARREN
          Would a stake through the heart
          kill a vampire?

                         CREPSLEY
          Yes. But so would getting hit by a
          truck if it was going fast enough.
          Steve finally disappears from sight. Crepsley sighs.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          56.

                         CREPSLEY
          He'll be trouble before it's over.

                         DARREN
          Before what's over?

                         CREPSLEY
          This adventure we're on. Shall we
          start?
          Darren hesitates, looks to the twinkling lights of his city.

                         CREPSLEY
          You'll get used to it after awhile.
          Vampires are always saying goodbye.
          A beat, then Darren looks back at him.

                         DARREN
          Let's go.

                         CUT TO:

                         THE SUN
          As it blisters up into, then rises above the horizon.
          Sunrise. Ominous if you're a full vampire.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. RURAL OHIO MOTEL - SUNRISE

          On the edge of the highway. Silhouetted against the sun.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. MOTEL ROOM - SUNRISE

          Darren jams a rolled towel along the bottom of a closed door.

                         DARREN
          How's that? Dark enough?

                         CREPLEY'S VOICE
          (on the other side)
          Better.

                         DARREN
          It's sunrise.

                         CREPLEY'S VOICE
          I know the time. I know more about
          the sunrise than anyone alive.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          57.
          Crespley sounds irritated. Darren gets mischievous.

                         DARREN
          Maybe I'll wait until noon and then
          open every door and curtain in the
          place.
          A long tense silence as Darren awaits Crepsley's reply.

                         MOTEL BEDROOM
          Crepsley is a shadow among the shadows. He climbs into bed.

                         CREPSLEY
          Yes, sunlight would kill me. My
          electrons are different than a
          human's. But it would take several
          hours of exposure. I'd have plenty
          of time to kill you before I closed
          the curtains and went back to bed.
          Crepsley pulls the blanket up over his head.

          MOTEL LIVING ROOM
          As Darren considers this...

                         CUT TO:

          DOORWAY - LATER
          Darren doing pull-ups, a hand on either side of the top jamb.

                         DARREN

          242... 243... 244...
          It's almost effortless. Bored rather than tired, Darren
          drops to his feet. (He still wears his burial suit.)

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. MOTEL COURTYARD - AFTERNOON

          Darren watching the cars go by on the highway, spots...

                         DARREN
          Minnesota...
          Darren jots this state down on a LIST he's keeping. About
          twenty state license plates so far.

                         CUT TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          58.

          INT. COUCH - MOTEL ROOM - SUNSET

          A TV droning. Darren asleep. Bathed in a golden glow that
          flickers out as the sun sets. The bedroom door opens.
          Crepsley steps over, looks down at his snoozing assistant.
          Crepsley CLAPS his hands together, nearly against Darren's
          ear. Crepsley smiles as Darren jolts awake.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. SHOPPING MALL PARKING LOT - NIGHT

          Getting late, stores closing. The parking lot nearly empty.
          Darren and Crepsley are on a walk and talk.

                         CREPSLEY
          We can die violently. Accidentally
          or otherwise. But we also grow
          old. A full vampire will age one
          year for every ten human years he's
          alive. A half-vampire like you:
          one for every five.

                         DARREN
          I don't understand.

                         CREPSLEY
          I was born in 1774. I became --
          Crepsley looks back to where Darren has stopped short.

                         DARREN

          1774?

                         CREPSLEY
          Should we do the math or not?
          Darren nods. Crepsley motions him to keep up.

                         CREPSLEY
          I became a vampire when I was 20
          years old. In 1794.

                         DARREN

          1794?

                         CREPSLEY
          In Paris. The days of the Terror.
          Heads in baskets. Guillotines up
          and down all day. Really when
          humans put their minds to it, we
          vampires can hardly compete.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          59.
          Darren's stare jogs him back from the good old days.

                         CREPSLEY
          Math. 1794. So I've been a
          vampire now for 211 years. Hmm?
          Darren nods again, still with him.

                         CREPSLEY
          I age 1 year for every 10, so, 211
          divided by 10, I've aged about 21
          years in that time. That 21 plus
          my first human 20 makes me look
          about 40.

                         DARREN
          But altogether you're 211 plus 20.
          You're really 231 years old.

                         CREPSLEY
          Exactly. You're going to be a
          teenager for a very long time.
          They walk on a few steps as Darren thinks this over.

                         DARREN
          Where do you keep your car anyhow?

                         CREPSLEY
          What car?

                         DARREN
          The one you were driving around my
          town in. The old black one.

                         CREPSLEY
          I've never owned a car, Darren. I
          don't need one.

                         DARREN
          It was near school one day. It
          followed me home a few days later.

                         CREPSLEY
          And you saw me behind the wheel?

                         DARREN
          I couldn't see who was driving.

                         CREPSLEY
          It wasn't me.
          As Darren considers this, Crepsley stops suddenly.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          60.

                         CREPSLEY
          There...
          Ahead: just more parking lot. A WOMAN exiting a BOOKSTORE.

                         DARREN
          What?

                         CREPSLEY
          Dinner.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

          The woman nears her car. A chirp as she unlocks it with her
          remote. She opens the back door, sets the book bag on the
          seat. Suddenly she turns, like someone called her name.

                         WOMAN
          Yes?
          Only nobody's there. She shrugs it off, closes the back
          door. But hesitates at the driver's side door. Then she
          starts walking away, toward a back area of loading docks.

                         CUT TO:

                         DARREN & CREPSLEY
          Watch from a dumpster by the loading dock. She walks right
          toward them. One look at Crepsley's face and we know he must
          be willing her over. Darren looks terrified.
          But the air shimmers and Crepsley has disappeared.
          The woman steps up, stops across from Darren. As she frowns,
          tries to figure out who he is and how she got here...

                         DARREN
          Go. Run.
          But Crepsley appears beside her. He 'breathes' into his
          hand, 'guides' the air into her face. He catches her as she
          passes out. Darren is horrified.

                         DARREN
          Did you kill her?

                         CREPSLEY
          I put her to sleep. She'll be like
          this 15 minutes. When she wakes
          up, she won't remember a thing.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          61.
          Crepsley eases her to the ground, finds a vein on her wrist.

                         DARREN
          Will she become a vampire?

                         CREPSLEY
          No. She'd have to share y blood
          for that to happen.

                         DARREN
          Don't take too much.

                         CREPSLEY
          A vampire who feeds often can
          control himself. One who drinks
          only when he must can end up
          feeding wildly.
          He uses one of his fingernails to open the vein.

                         CREPSLEY
          The hunger inside us must be fed to
          be controlled. To be civilized.
          It's what separates us from... the
          others.

                         DARREN
          What others?
          But as blood oozes, he takes the woman's wrist td his mouth.
          Darren is repulsed, but can't look away. Crepsley takes a
          few deep swallows, then holds the wrist out to Darren.

                         CREPSLEY
          Your turn.

                         DARREN
          No. I won't.

                         CREPSLEY
          Darren...

                         DARREN
          I'll never do it.
          Crepsley runs his tongue over the cut, rubs the saliva in.

                         CREPSLEY
          You can lead a vampire to blood,
          but you can't make him drink.

                         DARREN
          I'm only half-vampire.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          62.

                         CREPSLEY
          No matter, you need blood to live
          now. You'll drink eventually.
          When you're hungry enough.
          The wrist is clean, the cut gone. A barely perceptible scar.

                         DARREN
          I'll die first.

                         CREPSLEY

                         (ANGER FLASHING)
          Don't be stupid. You may abstain
          tonight, but you must feed soon.
          Crepsley stands to go, then stops short. Tense, he looks
          about, more hunted animal than man. As he shrugs it off.

                         DARREN
          What is it?
          As the woman starts to stir...

                         CREPSLEY
          Nothing. Let's go.

                         DARREN
          Something out there scares you.
          What is it?

                         CREPSLEY
          The thought of spending another
          minute with you.
          Crepsley turns and walks, but Darren's right.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. HAMBURGER JOINT - NIGHT

          The WAITRESS sets a juicy BURGER down across from Darren.
          Crepsley sits across from him.

                         CREPSLEY
          We still need to eat food, too. I
          just don't need it tonight.
          Darren just sits there. Silently as tears begin to run down
          his cheeks. Crepsley is exasperated.

                         CREPSLEY
          Now what?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          63.

                         DARREN
          The blood... I wanted it. I
          wanted to drink it.

                         CREPSLEY
          Of course you did! You're a
          Crepsley catches himself. He is not without some compassion.

                         CREPSLEY
          I'm sorry. It was wrong of me to
          blood you. You're too young. But
          it's done. Like the entire history
          of the world up to this moment.
          Darren quietly cries. Crepsley pulls two paper napkins from
          the dispenser, hands them to him.

                         DARREN
          Thank you.
          Darren turns to face the window as he wipes his eyes, nose.
          Then he sees it: parked across and down the street...
          A black 1966 Lincoln Continental.
          Darren looks back at Crepsley.

                         CREPSLEY

                         (RE: HAMBURGER)
          Eat. Let's not waste anymore food
          tonight.

                         DARREN
          The car...
          Crepsley follows the finger as Darren points.
          DING DING! The bell over the diner door rings...

          CLOSE ON DARREN
          As he looks back over his shoulder at the door.

                         DARREN'S POV
          MR. TINY comes through the front door pimpin'. Peter Lorre
          on steroids. Scary, done up like a Las Vegas high roller.

                         TABLE
          Darren knows trouble when he sees it. He looks back at
          Crepsley, but the vampire is gone! Vanished.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          64.

          MR. TINY

                         (STEPPING UP)
          Darren Shan, we meet at last.
          Darren just looks up at him. The guy is practically leaking
          nastiness no matter how avuncular he tries to be.

          MR. TINY
          You're quite a boy. Sacrificed
          everything to save a friend.

                         DARREN
          Where'd you hear that?

          MR. TINY
          A little bat told me.
          Mr. Tiny takes a french fry off Darren's plate, eats it.
          Darren looks around. Where the hell did Crepsley go at a
          time like this? Mr. Tiny knows what he's thinking.

          MR. TINY
          Oh, he's still here.

                         DARREN
          Who is?

          MR. TINY
          Crepsley. Trying to stay alive.
          It's so quiet around them Darren can hear a clock TICKING.
          It's a heart shaped POCKET WATCH Mr. Tiny holds on a chain.

          MR. TINY
          Would you like to see?

                         DARREN
          See what?
          The air seems to buzz as something 'passes'.

          MR. TINY
          Why the fight of course. Boys like
          to watch fights, don't they?
          Mr. Tiny hefts his watch. It almost seems to melt into his
          palm. As he pulls the winding knob out with a CLICK...
          As Darren and Mr. Tiny blink out, disappear from the booth...

                         CUT TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          65.

          INT. HAMBURGER JOINT - NIGHT (IN THE FLITTING WORLD)

          Darren and Mr. Tiny reappear in the booth, but the
          restaurant's patrons are slowed to near motionlessness.A
          battle royal going on. Crepsley fighting three VAMPANEZE.
          All three are sinewy, whipcords with blotchy purple skin.
          Crepsley stands surrounded in the middle of the restaurant.
          Whirling, hand fighting. Blocking their thrusts and blows.
          Darren moves to stand. Mr. Tiny pushes him back to his seat.
          Crepsley takes one down with a violent leg whip. He drives
          the second one back into the third knocking both back.
          A look to Darren and then he's back on LEG WHIP who's getting
          to his feet. Crepsley drives his flat hand forward, his
          nails tearing into the vampaneze's throat.
          As leg whip's hand instinctively goes to his throat to stem
          the blood, Crepsley grabs his free hand, sends him airborne.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. HAMBURGER JOINT - NIGHT (REAL WORLD)

          As leg whip 'unflits'. The patrons react to him soaring over
          the counter, slamming into the wall --

                         CUT TO:

          INT. HAMBURGER JOINT - NIGHT (IN THE FLITTING WORLD)

          The patrons near frozen again. Leg whip sliding ever so
          slowly down the wall. Crepsley and Sinewy One & Two FIGHTING
          at full speed.
          Sinewy One pulls Crepsley's arm up behind his back. Crepsley
          HOWLING as we hear the bone BREAK.
          Mr. Tiny grabs Darren by the wrist, pulls him toward the
          door. Behind them...
          Crepsley drives the back of his head into Sinewy One's face
          at the same time as Sinewy Two swings in his open palm...
          Sinewy One releases Crepsley who disappears as Sinewy Two
          slices open Sinewy One's throat.
          As Mr. Tiny pulls Darren out the door...

          66.

          INT. HAMBURGER JOINT - NIGHT (REAL WORLD)

          Crepsley appears. Leg Whip hits the floor. Blood splashes
          the wall as Sinewy One appears, dropping to his knees.
          As Leg Whip stands, Crepsley charges, 'shoulders' him halfway
          through the wall. Patrons SCREAM, react, scatter.
          As Crepsley grabs a knife...

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. HAMBURGER JOINT - PARKING LOT - NIGHT (FLITTING WORLD)

          Darren struggles as Mr. Tiny pulls him along. Behind,
          through the diner windows, WE SEE Patrons frozen in flight.
          Sinewy Two near frozen in fight with Crepsley who is in mid
          swing with the knife in his head.
          Mr. Tiny and Darren stop across from YOUNG MURLOUGH.
          Humanoid in shape, monstrous in visage. Bloated, his skin
          albino white with purplish mottling and red crisscrossing
          veins. He must weigh 300 pounds, but NFL nose tackle style.

                         MURLOUGH
          Smell the blood. The lovely blood.
          His eyes narrow at the sight of Crepsley, his mouth widening
          to show two rows of sharp filthy teeth.
          Darren needs to do something. He eyes the watch in Mr.
          Tiny's hand. He grabs it with his free hand, thumbs back in
          the winding knob. As Murlough disappears from view...
          The WINDOW EXPLODES as Sinewy Two hurtles out.
          Darren tosses the watch high in the air. Mr. Tiny releases
          him to move to catch it.
          Darren rushes back toward the restaurant.
          Mr. Tiny catches his watch.
          Crepsley meets Darren. Crepsley's broken arm hangs uselessly
          from his side.
          Murlough appears alongside. He grabs Crepsley by the throat,
          lifts him off the ground.
          Crepsley arcs the knife into Murlough's shoulder.
          Murlough staggers, lets go.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          67.
          Crepsley takes Darren's hand and they flit, disappearing.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. STREET - NIGHT (IN THE FLITTING WORLD)

          Beyond the hamburger joint. The world beginning to streak
          past them. The asphalt begins to blur beneath their feet,
          passing cars like they were standing still. But Crepsley
          heaves for breath. In pain.
          Darren looks back over his shoulder...

                         DARREN'S POV
          Murlough follows. Closing ground.

                         DARREN & CREPSLEY

                         DARREN
          It's behind us!
          Crepsley bears down, the buildings streaking by. But...

                         MURLOUGH
          Closes regardless, relentless, death in his eyes.

                         CREPSLEY
          Almost out of gas. But looking ahead. Clocks in an instant:
          a RED LIGHT AHEAD. Cars STOPPED. A CAR FROZEN having just
          crossed the INTERSECTION. HEADLIGHTS from a blind corner.
          Crepsley slows. Just as Murlough's about to catch him from
          behind... Crepsley comes out of flit mode, disappears.
          As Murlough FADES after him.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. INTERSECTION - NIGHT (REAL WORLD)

          Darren and Crepsley appear on the far side of the crossing.
          Murlough comes out of flit in the center.
          WHAM! The headlights Crepsley saw frozen, but coming from
          the blind corner, become a PICK-UP - broadsiding Murlough!
          He goes up over the hood, SMASHES against the windshield.
          As Darren and Murlough disappear again...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          68.
          The pick-up brakes. Murlough doesn't. He tumbles off the
          hood, sprawls hard into and skids along the street.
          A beat and he rolls to a sitting position, looks around. No
          Crepsley in sight. Blood runs out of one of his ears. As he
          wipes it, smearing it across his cheek...

                         PICK-UP DRIVER

                         (RUSHING OVER)
          Hey, man, are you okay?!
          He stops short when he sees Murlough's face. Murlough
          stands, SWATS the driver aside.
          The Lincoln screeches to a halt alongside him. Murlough
          climbs in. The Lincoln tearing away.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. STATE HIGHWAY - DAWN

          The sky getting lighter. A SIGN: Now Entering Pennsylvania.

          EXT. HUNTING CABIN - WOODS - DAWN

          Boarded up. Abandoned. Clutching his arm, Mr. Crepsley
          kicks at the door, splinters it. Opens"a gap. Darren
          reaches through, unlocks it. As they step inside, the first
          rays of the sun appear through the trees.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. ROOT CELLAR - DAWN

          Crepsley climbs down a few steps, closes the door behind him.
          Barely any light, but some.

                         CREPSLEY
          Find a blanket. A rug. Cover it.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. HUNTING CABIN - DAWN

          Darren drags a CARPET over the root cellar door in the floor.

                         ROOT CELLAR
          It goes black except for a glint in Crepsley's eyes. He
          sighs, settles down on the ground. Worn out.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          69.

                         DARREN'S VOICE
          Are you okay?

                         CREPSLEY
          My arm's broken. But it should be
          fine in a day or two.

          INTERCUT THE FOLLOWING:
          Sunlight fills the kitchen. Darren sits, exhausted.

                         DARREN
          Who were they? Vampires?

                         CREPSLEY
          No. The one with the watch was Mr.
          Tiny. Very dangerous.

                         DARREN
          How dangerous can a man named Mr.
          Tiny be?

                         CREPSLEY
          Who said he was a man?

                         DARREN
          Then what is he?

                         CREPSLEY
          Mr. Tiny can't be explained. He
          needs to be experienced.

                         DARREN

                         (FRUSTRATED)
          And the purple guy. What was he?

                         CREPSLEY
          A vampaneze.

                         DARREN
          Yeah? Keep talking.

                         CREPSLEY
          Long ago humans were looked upon as
          animals by some vampires. Cattle
          to be slaughtered. Laws were
          passed to forbid needless killing.
          It made it easier to pass unnoticed
          among humans if we didn't murder
          them. Most vampires obeyed...

                         DARREN
          But some didn't?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          70.

                         CREPSLEY
          Seventy vampires broke away,
          declared themselves a separate
          race. The Vampaneze. Over time
          their appearance changed, their
          numbers grew. They believe it's
          wrong to feed from a human without
          killing it.

                         DARREN
          What? That's crazy.

                         CREPSLEY
          They believe those of us who feed
          in small amounts live like leeches.
          In shame. It led to war.
          Crepsley touches the scar on his face, remembers.

                         CREPSLEY
          The last one nearly destroyed us
          all. There's been a truce for many
          years now.

                         (A BEAT)
          Will you be alright while I sleep?
          Darren looks around at the dilapidated crap heap he's in. As
          he tries to hold his heart together...

                         DARREN
          Oh yeah... This is so much better
          than where I used to be...
          Crepsley hears the strain in his voice. Knows what's best
          for both of them..

                         CREPSLEY
          What do you think of rejoining the
          Cirque du Freak? Until you get on
          your vampire feet so to speak.

                         DARREN
          Half vampire.

                         CREPSLEY
          Yes, yes. Three-eighths if you
          want. What do you think?
          As Darren thinks...

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. MR. TALL'S AIRSTREAM TRAILER - NIGHT

          The Cirque is camped by an ABANDONED FACTORY. Neo-Gothic in
          scale and mood. Lit up for a performance. Mr. Tall, pulls
          on his jacket, shouts orders.

          MR. TALL
          Show time in twenty minutes.
          Someone tell Rhamus to get his
          stomachs in gear!
          He's surprised to see Crepsley and Darren walk up the road.
          Crepsley's arm seems much better now.

          MR. TALL
          Larten'Crepsley! As I live and
          breathe. I thought it would be
          years before I saw you again.
          Mr. Tall looks to Darren, throws a surprised look to
          Crepsley. Crepsley nods. 'Yes'.

          MR. TALL
          Darren Shan. You've come a long
          way since the last time I saw you.

                         DARREN
          I liked it better where I was.

          MR. TALL
          I'm sure.

                         CREPSLEY
          Do you still have my coffin?

          MR. TALL
          Of course. You're really back?

                         (CREPSLEY NODS)
          Perhaps you could do the show
          tonight? A few of us are absent or
          ill this evening.

                         CREPSLEY
          I'd be delighted.

          MR. TALL
          Mr. Shan will have to pull his
          weight as well. I'll give him to
          Evra. Evra! EVRA!

                         (LOOKING ABOUT)
          I hope I haven't gone from one
          unreliable boy to two.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          72.
          Evra arrives. The snake boy from the first Cirque show.

          MR. TALL
          Evra, my industrious wonder. Here
          is Darren. Put him to work with
          you. Show him the snakey ropes.
          As the two boys consider each other...

          MR. TALL
          Off with you. Go!
          As the boys head off, Mr. Tall looks over at Crepsley.

          MR. TALL
          You blooded a child, Larten? What
          were you thinking?

                         CREPSLEY
          You don't approve?

          MR. TALL
          I don't matter. What will the
          vampire generals say when they hear
          about it?

                         CREPSLEY
          I'm no longer part of their domain.

          MR. TALL
          So you say. They may disagree.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. CIRQUE CAMP - NIGHT

          As Darren and Evra make their way through.

                         EVRA
          What do you do? Me? I'm a snake
          boy. I do a whole snake thing.
          Evra goes into a slithery snake walk for a few steps to
          illustrate. It's strange. Funny. Evra looks back over.

                         DARREN
          Do you eat mice?

                         EVRA
          Big Macs actually.
          They share a LAUGH. Evra 'high fives' Darren. Fast friends.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          73.
          As they continue, Darren looks at the palm of his hand. A
          few of Evra's SCALES have come off and are stuck there.

                         DARREN
          I caught your act in the last town.
          Pretty cool.

                         EVRA
          Thanks. I'm not doing it tonight.
          My snake caught a cold.

                         DARREN
          Snakes can catch cold?
          Evra nods, then SNEEZES himself.

                         EVRA
          Still gotta work the floor though.
          Ushers. We get the seats filled.
          They pass PEOPLE all hurriedly crossing the camp.

                         DARREN
          Who are they all?

                         EVRA
          The backbone of Cirque du Freak.
          They do the driving, the tent
          pitching, the potato peeling even.

                         DARREN
          How did they end up here?

                         EVRA
          Most wandered in. If Mr. Tall
          likes them, they stay.
          Darren's eye is caught by the WOLFMAN. He's being pushed
          toward the factory building by several of the blue-robed
          LITTLE PEOPLE. The wolfman's yellow eyes are on Darren as he
          rumbles a low, guttural growl.
          Darren is so taken that he almost walks into...
          Madam Truska. He stops short. In costume, beardless, even
          more beautiful than when we first saw her. She considers
          Darren, uses a finger to raise his chin. She shakes her
          head, smiles. As she continues...

          74.

          INT. FACTORY SPACE - NIGHT

          An odd setting, but it works well. Stripped, ragged, weird.
          Feels like a rave. The lighting dramatic, the concrete walls
          ominous. PATRONS take their seat around a stage. A buzz in
          the air.

                         DEBBIE & SAM
          About the same age as Darren and Evra, they're here for the
          show. Debbie is self-assured. Sam is sarcastic to cover his
          insecurities. Right now it's hard to find a seat.
          And here are Darren and Evra. Evra looking cool in his green
          sharkskin, Darren still wearing his burial suit.

                         EVRA
          Can we help you find a seat?

                         DEBBIE
          Are there any left?

                         EVRA
          Only the best seats in the house.
          He leads them a few steps over toward a column.

                         DEBBIE
          You guys are with the Cirque?
          Darren nods. Sam's a little sarcastic and skeptical.

                         SAM
          Cirque is French, right? Are you
          guys French?

                         EVRA
          Oui. Vous etes observateur. Nous
          sommes les serpents frangais.
          That slows Sam a beat. Evra points out a small platform
          eight feet up the column. You have to climb a natural re-bar
          ladder to get there. Sam looks dubious, but Debbie smiles.

                         DEBBIE
          Cool... I'm Debbie, this is Sam.

                         EVRA
          Evra Von.
          She looks at Darren, waiting.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          75.

                         DARREN
          Oh, I'm Darren.

                         DEBBIE
          Is the show great? Say yes. We
          had to sneak out to see it.

                         DARREN
          I snuck out to see it once, too.
          And I'm still here.
          An odd, almost spooky moment. Is he serious?

                         SAM
          Good one, Darren. Hey. Debbie and
          Darren. Like Bonnie and Clyde.
          And their friend Evra Von what?
          That breaks the moment. Debbie starts climbing the re-bar.
          Sam looks Darren over a beat, picks a thread off his lapel.

                         SAM
          Dude, it looks like the kind of
          suit you'd wear to a funeral.

                         DARREN
          You have no idea...
          Evra smiles, sticks out his tongue. Pointy, narrow, Evra
          sends it up his own nostril. Sam tries to smile, then starts
          up after Debbie. Freaked out. As Darren and Evra laugh...

                         CUT TO:

          INT. THE STAGE - NIGHT

          Mr. Tall under a spotlight. Back in his red hat and gloves.

          MR. TALL
          Welcome to the Cirque du Freak. We
          are an ancient circus. Bringing
          the remarkable to generations...

                         BACK ROW
          Darren and Evra watch from the back, whisper to each other.

                         DARREN
          How long have you known Mr. Tall?

                         EVRA
          Five years.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          76.

                         DARREN
          How do you meet someone like him?

                         EVRA
          I was raised in a circus, but not a
          nice one like this. The owner used
          to beat me and keep me in a glass
          cage. I felt like a useless freak.
          One night I looked out of my cage
          and saw Mr. Tall just standing
          there. He watched me until the
          owner came over and asked if he
          could help him. Mr. Tall grabbed
          him by the throat and strangled him
          to death. Then he opened the cage
          and said, "Let's go, Evra." He
          named me that. I added the Von.
          I've been with him ever since.
          Darren looks back at Mr. Tall with a new set of eyes.

                         CREPSLEY'S VOICE
          Darren...
          Darren turns. Crepsley's back there in the shadows.

                         CREPSLEY
          How do you feel about show
          business?

                         CUT TO:

          INT. THE STAGE - NIGHT

          The audience reacts as Crepsley 'appears' on the empty stage.

                         CREPSLEY
          To be poisoned by a spider may be
          my fate.
          It's Darren's cue. Looking appropriate in his burial suit,
          he walks out carrying Madam Octa's cage at arm's length.

                         DEBBIE & SAM
          As she realizes it's Darren. Cool.

                         STAGE
          Darren sees Debbie who gives a little wave. As he smiles...

                         CREPSLEY
          Look glum... Miserable...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          77.
          Darren loses the grin. Crepsley opens the cage. Madam Octa
          steps to the opening. Crespley raises the flute, plays.
          Madam Octa walks out and up to Darren's shoulder where she
          attaches a web thread. The audience react as she leaps to
          Crepsley's shoulder and attaches the other end. She dances
          across to the music, spinning a web as she goes.
          Darren looks out, sees how much Debbie enjoys it.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. THE MOON - NIGHT

          Set against the black sky. Sparks rise up, their source
          unknown. All very mysterious until... LAUGHTER. Lots of
          it. Borderline raucous. We follow the sparks DOWN to...

                         A BONFIRE
          Blazing in the Cirque campgrounds. The freaks are eating,
          drinking wine, relaxing after the show. Like a gypsy camp.
          Mr. Tall sits with his long legs up on a box, really enjoying
          watching everyone else enjoy themselves.
          Evra munches on a sausage he grills on the end of a stick.
          Darren is all ears and eyes. He likes these people. And
          he's certainly never experienced anything like this.
          Someone starts to play a guitar, someone else beats a drum.
          Madam Truska starts to dance, the fire flickering against her
          as are all eyes. Then she reaches out, takes Crepsley by the
          hand. A few moments later, the two of them are engaged in a
          mad TANGO. It takes the camp's collective breath away.
          Even Darren can't help but enjoy it. Crepsley's arm gives
          him a twinge or two, but only Truska notices.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. AN OLD VAN - NIGHT

          A mattress on the floor inside. Using tape and cardboard,
          Darren 'blacks out' the windows. Crepsley steps over.

                         DARREN
          Almost done.
          Crepsley looks to the sky. Still dark. The moon setting.

                         CREPSLEY
          Darren...
          (Darren looks over)

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          78.

                         CREPSLEY (CONT'D)
          I'm not going to sleep here. We'll
          find a nook in the factory.
          Crepsley starts off. Darren starts to follow.

                         CRESPLEY
          Mattress.
          Darren sighs, goes back to the van to retrieve the mattress.
          He starts to pull it out, then stops, nearly doubled over.
          Concerned, Crepsley steps over. Darren waves him off,
          straightens as whatever it was passes.

                         DARREN
          I just felt sick for a second.

                         CREPSLEY
          You need blood.
          Darren gives him a dirty look, grabs the mattress. They
          start walking toward the factory.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. FACTORY - NIGHT

          The SHADOWS of a loading dock. Crepsley and Darren approach.

                         DARREN
          You think Mr. Tiny might come?
          Crepsley shrugs, doesn't answer.

                         DARREN
          Who is he? What does he want?

                         CREPSLEY
          What we want is who we are, don't
          you think?

                         DARREN
          Can't you give me a straight answer
          just once?!

                         CREPSLEY
          You won't learn by me telling you.
          You must live some things to know
          what they are.
          Darren sighs in deep frustration. Crepsley has a thought.

                         CREPSLEY
          Okay. Why do you like spiders?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          79.
          Darren tires to figure what he's getting at? Implying?

                         CREPSLEY
          Did you ever think there was a
          particular reason?
          It seems Crepsley knows the answer even if Darren doesn't.

                         DARREN
          No. I never thought about it.

                         CREPSLEY
          That's the trouble with children.
          They don't think about things.

                         DARREN
          I'm not a child.
          Theystop by the shadows.

                         CREPSLEY
          Are you a man? If you're not a
          man, you're a child.

                         DARREN
          I'm in between.

                         CREPSLEY
          In between does not exist!
          The words echo a moment. Darren no closer to understanding.

                         CREPSLEY
          I'll sleep in here tonight. But
          sit outside the van tomorrow and
          make it look like I'm there. It's
          just caution. Old habits die hard.

                         VOICE
          And old vampires?
          Without a sound, someone has reached around the two of them
          from behind, a RAZOR-KNIFE held to each of their throats.
          They stand dead still. We can make out the shape of a head
          as whoever it is leans in ever so slightly from the dark.

                         CREPSLEY
          Gavner Purl, as always I heard you
          coming from a mile away.
          CLICK! In his hand by his side, Mr. Crepsley holds a thin
          SWITCHBLADE. He presses the steel back ever so slightly.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          80.

                         VOICE
          We'll call it a draw then.
          The 'voice' pulls back his knives, steps out. It's GAVNER
          PURL. He was once handsome, but those days are long gone.
          His face is crossed with scars. They vary in size, thickness
          and color. Gavner is a warrior, carries himself so.

                         GAVNER PURL
          It's been too long, Larten.

                         CREPSLEY
          Decades now.
          They embrace. Darren's trying to catch up.

                         DARREN
          You guys are friends?

                         GAVNER PURL
          I suppose. We once shared a coffin
          together. For six months.

                         DARREN

                         (SARCASTIC)
          Like roommates? To save money?

                         GAVNER PURL
          We were being hunted.

                         DARREN
          Who was hunting you?

                         CREPSLEY
          Never mind. Darren, Gavner Purl.
          Gavner extends his hand to shake. Darren sees'the scars on
          Gavner Purl's fingertips. Darren raises his own hand so
          Gavner can see his scars. Gavner looks at Crepsley.

                         GAVNER PURL
          A half-vampire?

                         CREPSLEY
          Of course. We don't make full
          vampires of our assistants.
          Gavner Purl looks at Crepsley, stunned.

                         GAVNER PURL
          Nor do we make assistants of
          children.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          81.
          GAVNER PURL (cont'd)

                         (LOSING IT)
          A child, Larten? Why?!

                         CREPSLEY
          I have my reasons.

                         GAVNER PURL
          And they are?

                         CREPSLEY
          I don't owe answers to vampires
          anymore. I'm exiled from our kind

                         GAVNER PURL
          Self-exiled. And I at least am
          owed an answer.
          There's a personal history being called upon here. Crepsley
          is well aware. Darren again is left out.

                         CREPSLEY
          All I care to say is a boy sought
          me out, knew who I was. He asked
          me to make him my assistant.
          Gavner looks to Darren, suspicious.

                         GAVNER PURL
          And how did you know --

                         CREPSLEY

                         (INTERRUPTS)
          It wasn't Darren. Another boy.
          His blood was bad. I should have
          killed him, but I didn't.
          Darren reacts. Gavner considers it all.

                         CREPSLEY
          I met Darren shortly after. His
          blood was good or I certainly would
          have killed him.
          Darren reacts again.

                         GAVNER PURL
          How could a boy find you?
          Crepsley shrugs. Of course he had help.

                         GAVNER PURL
          Tiny?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          82.

                         DARREN
          He tried to kill us.

                         CREPSLEY
          He tried to kill me. What he
          wanted with you wasn't determined.

                         GAVNER PURL
          Perhaps you chose the wrong boy.
          In Mr. Tiny's eyes.
          A moment as they consider the unspoken implications.

                         DARREN
          What are you guys talking about!?
          No answer as Crepsley and Gavner lock each other in a look.

                         CREPSLEY
          What's important enough to track
          down an exile? What is your news?

                         GAVNER PURL
          War.

                         CREPSLEY
          I'm not interested in your wars.

                         GAVNER PURL
          Well the other side is interested
          or they wouldn't be trying to get
          rid of you.
          Crepsley gets suddenly very angry.

                         CREPSLEY
          I've had enough killing! No more!
          You've come to the wrong place. I
          am the wrong place...
          Gavner raises his hands in surrender.

                         GAVNER PURL
          Even so, I'm glad you're alive.

                         CREPSLEY

                         (RELENTING)
          The sun is coming. Will you stay?

                         GAVNER PURL
          I can still make miles. The war
          won't wait. And neither will bad
          news. I have to go.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          83.

                         CREPSLEY
          Then travel safely.

                         GAVNER PURL
          Would you mind if I walk a bit with
          your assistant?

                         CREPSLEY
          Take him with you if you want.
          He's of little use to me.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. FIELD - NOT FAR OFF - NIGHT

          Darren and Gavner Purl walk. Gavner looks him over.

                         GAVNER PURL
          You look sick. Doesn't Larten feed
          you?

                         DARREN
          I won't drink blood if that's what
          you mean. I promised myself.

                         GAVNER PURL
          Why?

                         DARREN
          You'll get insulted.
          As Gavner waits for Darren to tell him...

                         DARREN
          I'm afraid if I drink blood, I'll
          become evil.
          Gavner LAUGHS out loud, catches himself.

                         GAVNER PURL
          The only thing drinking blood will
          do to you is keep you alive.

                         DARREN
          That's how it would start. I would
          swear it was just to stay alive.
          But what'll I turn into? You're on
          one side of the fence or the other.
          My father used to say that and now
          I know what he meant.
          The 'father part' chokes Darren up a bit.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          84.

                         GAVNER PURL
          You've already turned, Darren. You
          need to accept what you've already
          become. There's no going back.
          They walk in silence a moment. Then:

                         DARREN
          Why did Crepsley make himself an
          exile anyhow?

                         GAVNER PURL
          He was tired of all the killing.
          We were at war.

                         DARREN
          With the vampaneze?

                         GAVNER PURL
          Crepsley was once a Vampire
          General. One of our great leaders.
          He may seem reluctant, but I assure
          you, no one is as skilled at
          killing vampaneze than Crepsley is.
          I think that's why they'd like to
          get him out of the way. Kill him
          off before the new war starts.

                         DARREN
          You've known him a long time?

                         GAVNER PURL
          I was his assistant. He blooded
          me, as he blooded you.
          There's almost something comforting in this news. Gavner
          Purl so proud and strong looking. Darren wants to know...

                         DARREN
          Why'd he choose you?

                         GAVNER PURL
          To teach me to kill vampaneze. Up
          until now, it's the only reason he
          ever chooses anyone.

                         DARREN
          Is it why he chose me?
          Gavner hesitates, not sure.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          85.

                         GAVNER PURL
          That's for Crepsley to say. Not
          me.
          Another brick wall, but Darren accepts it.

                         GAVNER PURL
          Do you know what the biggest danger
          is to a vampire, Darren?

                         DARREN
          The vampaneze? Mr. Tiny?

                         GAVNER PURL
          No. It's that they live so long
          they no longer care. Everything
          they love is left behind until they
          finally have nothing left to live
          for. Except death. The fact that
          he's taken an apprentice seems, to
          me, a good sign. A sign that he's
          thinking of living not dying.

                         DARREN
          Lucky for me. Glad I could help.
          All the same Darren considers what he's heard. Gavner,
          meanwhile, considers the open countryside ahead.

                         GAVNER PURL
          A clear run. Good.
          Gavner gives Darren one last appraising look.

                         GAVNER PURL
          Stay by him, Darren. Stay by him.
          Gavner takes a deep breath. The air around him shimmers, his
          image bouncing in and out of phase like an electron heating
          up. And then he's gone.

                         DARREN
          That part is definitely cool.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. THE SUN - DAY

          High in the noon sky. PAN DOWN to where Darren stands under
          a tree by the old van. He concentrates, looks himself over.
          Nothing. He concentrates again. He's trying to flit.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          86.
          Very briefly -- the air shimmers around him -- then stops.
          He looks at his arms. Little WISPS of smoke come off them.

                         EVRA

                         (ARRIVING)
          What's up?

                         DARREN
          Nothing.

                         EVRA

                         (SNIFFS AIR)
          It's smells like burnt hair.

                         DARREN
          Don't know. I'm congested.

                         (SEES SOMETHING)
          Hey...
          Evra follows his gaze, turns just in time to see:

                         THEIR POV
          Debbie and Sam ducking inside the factory.

                         DARREN & EVRA
          Exchange a look. Start after them.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. FACTORY FLOOR - DAY

          Where the show was the night before. Light streams down from
          gaps in the decrepit roof. No sight of Debbie and Sam as
          Darren and Evra make their way in.- They pause at a CREAKING
          coming from somewhere overhead. As they move...

                         CUT TO:

          INT. UPPER FLOOR - FACTORY - DAY

          Darren and Evra come off a rickety staircase, pass through a
          half-rotted door. There are holes in the roof overhead and
          huge gaps on the floor where the boards have fallen through.
          They see Sam, his back to them, staring out a smashed window.

                         EVRA
          Let's scare the crap out of him...
          They begin to creep in, flanking the unsuspecting Sam. But
          as they get close, a SHAPE drops down behind them!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          87.

                         SHAPE

          ARRRGGGH!
          Darren and Evra are the ones who jump. The shape is Debbie!
          She almost falls over laughing. So does Sam.

                         DEBBIE
          You should see the look on your
          faces.
          But Evra and Darren are not laughing.

                         EVRA
          What're you doing here?

                         DEBBIE
          We could ask you the same thing.
          We come here all the time. My
          grandfather used to work here.

                         DARREN
          Must've been a long time ago.

                         DEBBIE
          He says now it's like one of those
          bombed out World War II cathedrals.
          Empty of what is used to be.
          An odd little moment till Sam breaks it.

                         SAM
          Hey, we loved the show, man. It
          was off the hook.

                         EVRA
          (messing with him)
          Off the hook, huh? I'll tell all
          the freaks you said so.

                         SAM
          Are you guys on your own? Just
          traveling. No parents or nothing?

                         DARREN
          No. No parents.
          He says it with a little twinge that Debbie picks up on.

                         SAM
          School?

                         EVRA
          No school either.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          88.

                         SAM
          You're the luckiest guys on earth.
          Wanna switch places?

                         DARREN
          You have to be different to be
          here.

                         DEBBIE
          Different how?
          Evra steps into a slash of sunlight and his skin flashes to
          life, the green of his scales catching the rays. Debbie's
          mouth drops. They couldn't see it in the dark last night.

                         EVRA
          Everyone has a place they belong.
          The Cirque du Freak is ours.

                         DEBBIE
          I think your skin is beautiful.
          That wins Evra over.

                         DEBBIE
          Can I touch it?
          Evra holds out his arm. Debbie traces a finger across it.

                         DEBBIE
          Wow. Has it always been this way?

                         DARREN
          He's a snake-boy.

                         DEBBIE
          You shouldn't call him names
          because he looks different.

                         EVRA
          It's okay. I am a snake boy.

                         SAM
          You could say you're
          dermatologically challenged.
          They all LAUGH. Debbie considers Evra a beat, then Darren.

                         DEBBIE
          What about you, Darren? How are
          you different?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          89.

                         DARREN
          I get scared easy.
          Darren looks up toward the rafters. From where she dropped.

                         DARREN
          How'd you get up there anyhow?

                         DEBBIE
          You mean, how did a girl get up
          there?

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. FACTORY ROOF - DAY

          A spot where the roofing is gone, several long RAFTERS
          stretch out. Darren, Evra and Sam watch Debbie walk out on
          one. Like a balance beam. The factory floor 70 feet below.

                         EVRA
          Hey, be careful.

                         SAM
          Don't worry. She's like a gymnast.
          Debbie moves slowly at first, her arms stretched out for
          balance. Then she does a hop, a skip. Darren and Evra gasp.
          She gets to the other side, turns and bows.

                         DARREN
          You're crazy!

                         DEBBIE
          How about you?

                         DARREN
          I got nothing to prove.

                         DEBBIE
          But it'd be easier for you than me.

                         DARREN
          Why's that?

                         DEBBIE
          Because chickens have wings.
          She starts chicken CLUCKING. Mad, Darren steps onto a
          rafter, starts across. He stops in the middle, spins around.
          Aided immeasurably by his half-vampire skills.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          90.
          Debbie is impressed.

                         ANGLE OVERHEAD
          The vertigo angle as Debbie walks back out on her rafter.
          Stops about 4-feet across from Darren.

                         DARREN & DEBBIE
          Darren crosses his arms across his chest. No big deal.

                         DEBBIE
          Let's play mirrors.

                         DARREN
          What's that?

                         DEBBIE
          I do something and you have to copy
          me. Like this.
          Debbie crosses her arms the same way Darren has. He
          uncrosses them as he realizes.
          Debbie reaches down, touches her toes. Darren sighs, then
          does the same, gets a good look at the floor below.
          Debbie takes one foot off the rafter, takes hold of the top
          of it with one hand, raising the other arm out for balance.
          Looks like a ballerina.
          Evra doesn't like this daredevil stuff.

                         EVRA
          Come on, guys...
          Darren hesitates. Not because he won't do it, but because
          maybe for the first time in his life, he's really fascinated
          by a girl. Debbie misreads, starts CLUCKING again.
          Darren smiles, repeats her move effortlessly.
          Without warning, Debbie leaps the gap, lands on the rafter
          alongside Darren. As she struggles a bit for balance, Darren
          reaches out and steadies her. As they come face to face.

                         DEBBIE
          There definitely something
          different about you. I just can't
          figure it out.

                         DARREN
          Is Sam your boyfriend?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          91.

                         DEBBIE
          He's my cousin.

                         DARREN
          Oh...
          A funny, awkward beat out on the rafter. Finally...

                         DARREN
          We should get off this.
          She nods, a bit smitten. Darren turns. As they start off...

                         DARREN
          Chalk it up to lack of blood, but everything starts spinning.

                         DARREN'S POV
          The area is like a big drain and he's whirling down it.

                         RAFTER
          Darren legs go out and he falls off. As Debbie screams...
          Darren CATCHES HOLD of the rafter just as he drops past it.

                         DEBBIE
          Hold on.
          Debbie grabs his arm. Evra starts out to help, but the
          rafter CREAKS OMINOUSLY. He stops. Sam states the obvious.

                         SAM
          I don't think it'll hold you, dude.

                         EVRA
          Thanks for the heads up... Bro.

                         DARREN
          (shakes it off)
          It's okay. I'm okay.
          Darren swings up a leg, hooks it over the rafter. A beat and
          he's back on top. Debbie relieved. Evra backs up the way he
          came and in a few seconds they're all safely off the rafter.

                         DEBBIE
          I don't know how you hung on. I
          couldn't have.

                         DARREN
          You wouldn't have fallen in the
          first place... I just got dizzy.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          92.

                         DEBBIE
          Maybe you need to eat something.
          Darren looks at her. She has no idea.

                         EVRA
          Well, the food's down on ground
          level. Let's get out of here.
          Sam and Debbie start off, Darren and Evra following. As Sam
          and Debbie start down a ladder, Darren hangs back a beat.

                         DARREN
          She's kind'of cool, huh? I mean,
          for a girl.

                         EVRA
          I like her. She asks a lot of
          questions though.

                         DARREN
          She's just curious.

                         EVRA
          There's no such thing as 'just'
          with a girl.

                         DARREN
          What makes you such an expert?

                         EVRA
          My snake's a girl.

          EXT. FACTORY - SUNSET

          The sun peeps below the horizon.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. FACTORY PASSAGE - NIGHT

          Darren walks along, flashlight in hand. Going somewhere. He
          suddenly stops, listens, not sure if he heard something. A
          following FOOTSTEP?
          MOVE WITH Darren as he continues. As he passes through a
          doorway, he ducks around the corner. Waits a few beats.
          Then he leaps out to see who's following. No one's there.
          Shaking his head, he continues on.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. BOILER ROOM - FACTORY - NIGHT

          Darren knocks on a door, waits a beat before it opens and
          Crepsley emerges from his sleeping place.

                         CREPSLEY
          Good morning, Darren.

                         DARREN
          What's good about it?
          Crepsley looks him over, doesn't like what he sees.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. CIRQUE CAMP - NIGHT

          Bustling with activity. Nearly show time. Crepsley stands
          by an open tent flap watching Darren cross camp. Not well.

                         DARREN
          He stops as Sam and Debbie catch up with him.

                         SAM DEBBIE
          Hey, Darren. Hi...
          Darren's happy to see them.

                         DARREN
          You guys are coming to the show
          again tonight?

                         DEBBIE
          Of course. Evra's doing his snake
          act tonight.

                         DARREN
          Oh, you came to see Evra.

                         DEBBIE
          And you...
          Darren smiles shyly at that.

                         SAM
          I was hoping for Amanda Bynes.
          Darren sees Crepsley watching him from the tent.

                         DARREN
          Hey, I'll catch up with you later.
          I got some stuff I gotta finish up.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          94.
          They watch as Darren heads off.

                         SAM
          He's gonna be gone in another day
          or two. Tonight's the last show.

                         DEBBIE
          I know that. So?

                         SAM
          So stop looking at him like you
          love him.

                         DEBBIE
          You're such an idiot, Sam.

                         TENT OPENING
          Darren joins Crepsley, a little unsteady.

                         CREPSLEY
          Look at you. You can barely stand.

                         DARREN
          I'm fine.

                         CREPSLEY
          You need to feed. You need blood..

                         DARREN
          No! I won't let you hunt some poor
          person down for me. I --
          Crepsley grabs hold of Darren, hauls him into...

                         THE TENT
          Dark, the inside walls richly embroidered. Medieval.

                         CREPSLEY
          No need to hunt. There's someone
          here willing to save you.
          From the shadows: Madam Truska. Startlingly beautiful. She
          steps up. Eyes on Darren, she offers Crepsley her wrist.

                         MADAM TRUSKA
          By my own free will, Darren Shan.
          As Crepsley's fingernail hovers, ready to open a vein.
          Darren shakes his head. 'No'.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          95.

                         CREPSLEY
          Drink or you'll die.

                         DARREN
          No. I can't. I'm human.
          Crepsley releases Truska's arm.

                         CREPSLEY
          You're not! And you'll be nothing!
          Darren stands there as noble and sad as a boy could be.

                         DARREN
          I am human. In my heart I am.
          A great big TEAR rolls down Truska's cheek. That's the last
          thing Crepsley needed to see. He's defeated.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. FACTORY SPACE - NIGHT

          People in their seats or taking them. Darren is back in his
          role as usher. He seats two people, wipes at the sweat
          beading on his forehead. He's getting sicker.
          He sees Debbie. She and Sam are already seated across the
          way. She smiles, waves. Darren forces a smile,, waves back.
          Looking for more patrons, Darren nearly walks into... A
          FIGURE. A hat pulled down obscures his face.

                         VOICE
          An usher in the house of usher.
          And I can't seem to find a seat.
          Darren frowns at the odd voice, but leads down the aisle.

                         DARREN
          This way.
          Darren brings him down to a handful of seats. The figure
          looks up from under the brim of his hat. It's Mr. Tiny.

          MR. TINY
          Join me.

                         DARREN
          I don't think so.
          As Darren moves to go, Mr. Tiny clamps a hand around his
          wrist. Like iron. He sits, pulling Darren down beside him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          96.

          MR. TINY
          It's time we had a few moments.
          Folks involved in epic struggles
          should get to know each other.
          Darren doesn't answer.

          MR. TINY
          Has Crepsley told you about me?
          Explained me?

                         DARREN
          He said you can't be explained.
          You need to be experienced.

          MR. TINY
          He gives me too much credit.

                         DEBBIE
          Hey, Darren.
          Darren looks up to see Debbie and Sam. Oh no...

                         DEBBIE
          We're gonna sit on this side.

                         SAM
          Cuz we miss you so much.
          She digs Sam with her elbow. They sit just a row in front.

          MR. TINY

                         (WHISPERS)
          Choosing sides can only lead to
          trouble. Never, ever choose sides
          unless it's your own.

                         DARREN
          You've chosen the vampaneze.
          Mr. Tiny laughs, slaps his knee even.

          MR. TINY
          Is that really what you think? A
          smart boy like you?
          And the lights drop. A trumpet blasts and all is silent.

          ON THE STAGE
          The little people wheel out a CAGE. There's a gurgled GROWL.
          The little people retreat. Several audience members lean in,
          then SCREAM as the wolfman CRASHES to the front of the cage.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          97.
          A white spot shines down on Mr. Tall.

          MR. TALL
          Ladies and Gentlemen...

          DARREN & MR. TINY

          MR. TINY
          .subjugators and saps...

          MR. TALL
          Welcome to the Cirque du Freak. We
          are an ancient circus...
          As Mr. Tall drones on...

          MR. TINY
          Oh, his speeches are impossible.
          Mr. Tiny opens his free hand. His pocket watch melts up into
          view from his palm. Time begins to speed up around them.
          Mr. Tall's voice speeds to a BUZZ as he 'keystone cops' off
          the stage and Rhamus 'keystones' on. The audience's small
          movements become rattles and shakes.
          Only Darren and Mr. Tiny are at normal speed.

          MR. TINY
          I'm not so complicated, Darren.
          During war there are those who
          profit. A war between vampires and
          vampaneze would have terrible
          consequences. Therefore...

                         DARREN
          Terrible profits.

          MR. TINY
          Excellent. I am a profiteer. I
          exact fees and gains. I'm simple.
          On stage, Madam Truska exits and Evra 'keystones' through his
          performance with his snake.

          MR. TINY
          Did Crepsley tell you of the
          prophesy?

                         DARREN
          What prophesy?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          98.

          MR. TINY
          They say the final battle between
          vampires and vampaneze will be
          decided by a child. That's why the
          vampires won't blood children. To
          avoid the end of the world.
          As these words are pondered by Darren...

          MR. TINY
          I think I underestimated you. I
          think you could be wonderful.

                         DARREN
          I think you're a creep. I think
          you suck.

          MR. TINY
          Too bad.
          Mr. Tiny closes his hand around the watch. Time returns to
          normal. The applause for Evra slowing down to normal speed.
          As he walks off the stage, Debbie looks back at Darren.

                         DEBBIE
          He was great!
          As she looks back to the stage someone sits on Darren's other
          side. Collar pulled up, head wrapped in a scarf. Murlough!

                         MURLOUGH
          (low; re: Debbie)
          Is it Dar-wren's girlfriend?

                         DARREN
          Forget about her --
          Murlough takes hold of Darren's other wrist. Still low:

                         MURLOUGH
          She has plenty of lovely blood
          inside. Inside, outside, hmmm?
          Darren struggles. Murlough pulls him close, HISSES in his
          ear, flashing those filthy teeth.

                         MURLOUGH
          I don't care about humans. I don't
          care about you. But the vampire -
          Larten Crepsley - him I care about.

                         (ALMOST SHY)
          Murlough is a vampire killer.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          99.
          On stage: the spotlight hits Crepsley.

                         DARREN
          You guys are in trouble. There's
          more than one vampire now. Gavner
          Purl is here.
          Murlough reacts to the name. Does not like it.

                         MURLOUGH
          Have you seen Purl Gavner's face?
          Young Murlough sliced it for him.

          MR. TINY
          Darren, you're a liar. He's a
          thousand miles gone by now. And
          master Crepsley is right there.
          As he points at Crepsley...

                         CREPSLEY
          Holding Madam Octa's cage. Aware something's 'in the air'.

                         MURLOUGH
          Shimmers, phases into flit mode. Disappears.

                         DARREN
          Crepsley! Look out!
          The audience LAUGHS. Like Darren's worried about Madam Octa.
          Debbie looks back, knows something is wrong. Sees Mr. Tiny's
          hand around Darren's wrist.

                         STAGE
          As Murlough 'appears' alongside Crepsley.
          Madam Octa's cage drops to the stage as Murlough knocks
          Crepsley fifteen feet through the air. He lands flat on his
          back. The audience CHEER! Think it's part of the show.
          Murlough reaches into his jacket, produces a razor-sharp LONG
          KNIFE in either hand.
          Crepsley pops to his feet. As his own single BLADE
          'switches' to life in his hand...

          DARREN & MR. TINY
          As Darren struggles, Mr. Tiny switches his grip to the back
          of the boy's neck. That holds him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          100.

                         STAGE
          CHEERS as Murlough charges forward, the long knives
          pinwheeling in his hands. His attack is brutal and blunt.
          Crepsley is driven back, parrying each thrust and attack as
          it comes. Sparks fly as the blades connect.
          From out of nowhere, Crepsley adds a BACKHAND to the mix. It
          catches Murlough hard across the chops.

                         OFF STAGE
          Mr. Tall and Evra watch. Not knowing what to do.

                         STAGE
          Murlough swings back wildly. Crepsley catches the blade in
          Murlough's left hand with the one in his right.
          Crepsley catches Murlough's left wrist, the second blade
          dangerously close to retracing the scar on Crepsley's face.
          Crepsley throws himself back, sending Murlough head over
          heels across the stage and SLAMMING into a concrete wall.

                         DARREN
          Concentrating. Trying to flit.

                         STAGE
          Murlough rolls to his feet, charges. It's brute force versus
          style. But as Crepsley moves to sidestep, Murlough's not so
          brutish after all. He matches the move --
          Buries one of his knives into Crepsley's stomach. Crepsley
          reacts, frozen in shock.

          DARREN & MR. TINY
          The audience around them unsure. Many shocked. It's part of
          the show, right? Darren sees Murlough raise the other knife
          to finish Crepsley off. Darren trembling, phasing.
          And Mr. Tiny's holding nothing but air. Darren is gone.

          DARREN (FLIT WORLD)
          Speeding down to the stage. The dagger descends in slo-
          motion, but it's only a centimeter or two from it's target.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          101.

                         STAGE
          Darren reappears, leaps onto Murlough's back, knocks him off
          target. As Murlough staggers right, Crepsley staggers left.
          Murlough regroups, charges after him. Badly hurt, stumbling,
          Crepsley falls off the edge of the stage. Disappears.
          ROARING, Murlough grabs Darren. They disappear as well.

          MR. TINY
          Sighs. This is not how it's supposed to go. Sam and Debbie
          leave their seats, head for the stage.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. FACTORY - NIGHT (FLIT WORLD)

          Murlough with Darren in tow, looking high and low for
          Crepsley. Moving past the barely moving Mr. Tall and Evra.

          CREPSLEY (FLIT WORLD)
          His back to a wall. Trying to hold it together. Frozen
          PATRONS facing the exit beyond. As he'loses his flit power,
          the patrons suddenly resume real speed for the exits.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. BOILER ROOM - NIGHT

          The old power plant. Pipes and catwalks. Murlough and
          Darren here. A chain hangs from the ceiling. Murlough lifts
          Darren, wraps it around his ankle. Hangs Darren upside down!

                         MURLOUGH

          CREPSLEY!

                         CUT TO:

                         CREPSLEY
          Reacting to Murlough's voice.

                         CUT TO:

          BOILER ROOM - FACTORY
          Murlough twists Darren's arm. Darren SCREAMS out in pain.

                         CUT TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          102.

                         EVRA
          Reacting as Debbie and Sam arrive. They move toward it.

                         CUT TO:

                         CREPSLEY
          Listening as the scream fades off. Clutching his stomach,
          Crepsley moves.

                         CUT TO:

          BOILER ROOM - FACTORY
          Murlough pulls Darren a little higher. They're face-to-face,
          though Darren is upsidedown.

                         MURLOUGH
          Crepsley will come for his
          assistant.

                         DARREN
          He doesn't care about me.

                         MURLOUGH
          Murlough has an assistant, too. A
          smart one, smarter than you.
          As Murlough says this, Darren looks past as stepping up,
          grinning, is Murlough's assistant.

                         DARREN
          Steve?
          Steve! Steve holds up his hands so Darren can see the WHITE
          SCAR on the tip of each finger. He gets closer.

                         STEVE
          Mr. Tiny made my dream come true.
          Only better. I'm half vampaneze
          instead of a stupid half vampire.
          Mr. Tiny says I have a destiny. He
          says he's gonna make sure of it.

                         DARREN
          Is that who you talked to? Was
          that the internet guy? Mr. Tiny?

                         STEVE

                         (LAUGHS)
          Pretty funny, huh? He introduced
          himself after you left town.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          103.

                         STEVE (CONT'D)
          But, I think I've known him a long
          time in my head. In my bad, bad
          blood.
          Chilling. Maybe Steve is evil. He leans in even closer.

                         STEVE
          He gave me back the dream you
          stole.
          Murlough motions Steve quiet, slaps a hand over Darren's
          mouth. Listens. Smiles. Whispers.

                         MURLOUGH
          Crepsley comes.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. APPROACH PASSAGE - FACTORY - NIGHT

          Crepsley moving forward. Hurting. He slows, stops. As he
          looks back over his shoulder. Something's behind him.

          EVRA, DEBBIE & SAM
          Freeze as Crepsley looks back in the direction from which
          they follow. From their POV, Crepsley suddenly disappears.

                         SAM
          Where'd he go?
          They jump as Crepsley appears right in front of them.

                         CREPSLEY
          Evra... Get them out of here.

                         EVRA

                         BUT --
          Evra knows it's useless. As he nods, Crepsley turns and
          strides back toward where he had been.
          Sam and Debbie exchange a look. What the Hell?

                         EVRA
          You guys better go back.

                         SAM
          What are you gonna do?

                         EVRA
          Darren's my friend.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          104.

                         DEBBIE
          Ours too.
          Sam's not so sure, but he nods in agreement.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. BOILER ROOM - FACTORY - NIGHT

          Darren swings back and forth in long strokes like a pendulum,
          a rag stuffed in his mouth to silence him.

                         DARREN'S POV
          Sweeping the room. Wait! It fixes on a doorway. There's
          Crepsley. Looking about, everywhere but at Darren.

                         BOILER ROOM
          Crepsley speaks to 'the room'.

                         CREPSLEY
          I can smell it. Why does it hide?

                         (STEPPING UP)
          The vampire is here.
          WHUMP! Murlough drops from above. Lands ten feet in front
          of Crepsley. As they begin to arc around each other.

                         MURLOUGH
          The vampire will die.

                         STEVE'S VOICE

                         (FROM ABOVE)
          Let's get readyyyyy to rumble!
          Crepsley looks up, reacts.

                         CREPSLEY
          Even the creatures of the night
          watch too much TV.
          Darren swings past through the middle of it all.
          Murlough charges.
          Crepsley sidesteps Darren, decides to take the fight higher.
          He leaps up, swings himself up onto one of the catwalks.
          Murlough follows. They use the room steel as monkey bars as
          they climb, clash. Violent, quick attacks. Crepsley gaining
          a position, abandoning it as Murlough SLAMS in.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          105.

                         DARREN
          Has lost sight of them, he can only hear the battle now. He
          reacts as Evra, Debbie and Sam rush out. Evra takes hold,
          lifts, tries to lessen the load on the chain.

                         EVRA
          Sam, unhook his legs.
          As Sam struggles, Debbie pulls the rag from Darren's mouth.

                         DARREN
          Are you guys nuts? Get outta here!

                         EVRA
          It's against our code.
          Suddenly unhooked, Darren hits the ground. He looks up at
          Evra who grins down at him.

                         EVRA
          Never leave a freak behind.

                         CUT TO:

                         CEILING SUPERSTRUCTURE
          On the catwalks Murlough draws his knives. Crepsley jumps
          to the space he wants to defend, draws his own. Murlough
          counters. Two very serious predators'-at work. The animal
          kingdom at its killing best.
          A charge. Murlough a bull, Crepsley a matador. He redirects
          one of Murlough's arcing arms, smashing it against a metal
          housing. One of the vampaneze's knives clatters away.
          It's not graphic or bloody, but several times Crepsley's
          knife finds its way into Murlough's body. It enrages him,
          but Crepsley continues dealing out punishment.
          He's now like a brilliant counter-puncher, even as he
          inadvertently backs his way into a corner.
          But as quarters close in, Murlough's rage works to his
          advantage. He charges into Crepsley, his lowered shoulder
          sending Crepsley through the air and into...
          And through a BRICK WALL. Into the thin air outside! Still
          raging, Murlough nearly falls through himself. Instead, he
          slips, drops about twenty feet down inside the building!

                         CUT TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          106.

          EXT. ASPHALT - NIGHT

          Crepsley falls sixty feet, lands flat on his back, as brick
          and concrete rain on top of him...

                         CUT TO:

          INT. FACTORY - NIGHT

          As Evra pulls Darren along. Debbie and Sam riding shotgun.

                         EVRA
          Come on!

                         DARREN
          Evra. I think I'm dying.
          He looks horrible.

                         DEBBIE
          Let's carry him if we have to.
          Evra and Sam support him on either side. They continue,
          start across part of a darkened backstage area.
          A dark rectangular shape looms ahead. We hear a GUTTURAL
          GROWL, sees eyes glow in the gloom. They freeze.

                         EVRA
          It's okay. It's the wolfman. He's
          in his cage.
          They move forward again, the cage becomes visible. But
          another SHAPE beside it. Steve. He sets his hand on the
          cage's heavy latch. He's going to open it.

                         EVRA
          No don't!

                         STEVE
          Ooops...
          Steve lifts the latch. Even he doesn't expect the force the
          wolfman hits the door with. Whaanngg! It's out.
          Evra steps bravely forward. The wolfman sends him flying.
          Sam can't hold Darren up by himself. He doesn't even see the
          Wolfman leap over. As Darren sinks to the floor...
          The wolfman tears into Sam...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          107.

                         DEBBIE
          Reacts in horror.

                         STEVE
          He's more surprised than shocked. Until the wolfman looks
          his way. Then he heads for the hills, disappears into the
          dark. The wolfman turns back toward Debbie.
          She backs away, takes off up a rickety stairway. The wolfman
          HOWLS, then follows.
          Darren's too weak to follow, near tears in frustration and
          regret. He watches after them, then he looks over at Sam.
          Sam who is dying. Just a few feet away. His eyes flicker to
          Darren's. He tries to say something, but can't.

                         DARREN
          Oh Sam. Oh no...
          Darren crawls over, takes Sam's bloody hand.

                         SAM
          Go save Debbie, Darren...
          Sam manages the smallest smile. As his eyes drift shut...

                         SAM
          I think she loves you...
          From above, we hear Debbie SCREAM. Darren considers Sam's
          blood, knows what he has to do. Leave his humanity behind
          and cross the line. He needs to drink Sam's blood.

                         DARREN
          Forgive me, Sam, but I need
          strength. I need blood.
          As Darren extends his nails over Sam's wrist...

                         DARREN
          We're going to save her together.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. UPPER FLOOR - FACTORY - NIGHT

          Debbie backing into a corner. The wolfman almost on her...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          108.
          Murlough arrives! Pure animal action as he tears into
          wolfie, sends him retreating, licking his wounds into the
          darkness. Murlough heaves for breath, pretty beat up
          himself. And here comes Steve. Cautiously.

                         STEVE
          Is Crepsley dead?

                         MURLOUGH
          Who knows? Young Murlough lives,
          but he's hurt.

                         STEVE
          What can I do?

                         MURLOUGH
          What can Dar-wren's girlfriend do?
          We need to get the blood inside
          outside. Don't we?
          Then we hear it: a blood-curdling scream filters up. It's:

          DARREN! - BACKSTAGE AREA
          He's drunk Sam's blood. He rises. His sickness wicking off
          him. Strength descending. Empowered. Furious. He screams
          again, the sound taking shape into words.

                         DARREN

          FORGIVE ME!!!

          FACTORY STAGE SPACE
          The audience who haven't left react as the chilling sound
          reaches them.

          BACKSTAGE AREA - FACTORY
          Fully 1/2 vampire powered, he takes the stairs two at a time.

                         UPPER FLOOR
          Murlough, looming over Debbie, smiles as Darren arrives.

                         DARREN
          Let her go.

                         STEVE
          Stop being a big shot. This isn't
          like stopping some fight at school.

                         DARREN
          Shut up, Steve.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          109.
          Murlough's eyes go very, very dark. He attacks.
          Darren tries to meet the onslaught, but he's bowled over.
          Knocked in a heap.
          Debbie moves to go after Murlough from behind. She's going
          to go down fighting as well. But Steve intercepts her. He's
          pretty powerful himself.
          Murlough pulls Darren to his feet, stands him up. He swings
          his fist in a vicious arc.
          Darren just ducks it and Murlough's fist SMASHES right
          through the wall (an inside wall) alongside Darren's head.
          Murlough's getting tired of Darren.

                         MURLOUGH
          You need to stand still so you can
          die.
          But as he attempts to pull his arm back through, he can't.
          He frowns. Then his eyes widen in pain.
          Murlough jerks his arm back as hard as he can. The wall
          smashes open as Murlough brings his arm back through with
          Crepsley hanging onto the end of it.

                         FACTORY SPACE
          The audience who remain chanting: "Refund! Refund!" They
          react as debris falls from above, smashes to the stage.

          UPPER FLOOR - FACTORY
          Crepsley brings up his knife.
          Murlough catches him by the wrist with one hand.
          With the other he grips Crepsley by the throat, SLAMS him
          hard into an I-beam pillar. Again. Then he squeezes. We
          can hear the cartilage crunching in Crepsley's throat.
          But Crepsley covers his own right hand with his left. He
          drives the knife blade INTO MURLOUGH'S HEART!
          Murlough looks down at the handle of the knife, then back at
          Crepsley whose throat he still holds.
          Murlough gives him a lopsided grin and then pitches back,
          falling through one of the holes in the floor. Taking
          Crepsley with him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          110.

                         FACTORY SPACE
          SCREAMS from the audience as Murlough descends. Somewhere in
          mid-fall, Crepsley FLITS, disappears. When Murlough hits the
          center of the stage, he hits it alone. Dead.
          As people start for the exits, we see Mr. Tiny'is among them.

                         UPPER FLOOR
          But as Darren stands, it's not over. Steve grabs Debbie,
          pushes her to the edge where the rafters are.

                         STEVE
          Stay back! Or I'll throw her off!
          I mean it!
          It sounds like he does. Darren looks intently at Debbie.
          She looks back. Then, Darren makes CHICKEN CLUCK SOUNDS.
          Understanding, Debbie tears herself away. To the precipice.
          But instead of falling, she continues out on a rafter.
          Steve slides out after her. But as he reaches for her, she
          deftly skips across the rafters, jumps back to the floor.
          Before Steve can follow, Darren cuts him off. Below them:
          rows of jagged, rusty pipes. The remains of a pumping
          station. Shredded now, broken. Waiting to impale.

                         DARREN
          It's over, Steve.

                         STEVE
          Is it?
          Steve lunges. They come together, trading shots, stumbling
          but still having to make the rafters. A missed footfall will
          be their last. They separate, try to gain position.

                         STEVE
          You wanna hear something funny?
          After your funeral, I went to see
          your parents.
          They continue circling.

                         STEVE
          And they were fine. They acted
          like they barely remembered you.

                         DARREN
          Liar.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Darren lunges, but Steve's ready. He CUFFS Darren in the
          head. Darren falls, ends up hanging. Steve looms, smiling.

                         STEVE

                         (SMILES)
          And your sister. She was moving
          into your room. They had a yard
          sale. I bought some of your stuff.
          Steve's foot on his hand. Darren about to die. Oddly:

                         DARREN
          Did you steal money from my mom's
          purse?

                         STEVE
          What?

                         DARREN
          Did you?
          Darren hanging there, dead grim. Steve's curious.

                         STEVE
          Why do you ask? Is knowing that
          gonna help you rest in peace?

                         DARREN
          No. It's just practically the last
          thing that ever happened between me
          and my dad was I was arguing with
          him.

                         STEVE

                         (FLIP)
          Least you had a dad to argue with.
          A fury building in Darren.

                         DARREN
          I was telling him he was wrong
          about you. That's the last time we
          had together. Fighting about you.

                         STEVE
          Hate to tell ya. Your dad was
          right. How do you think we got the
          money for the dumb tickets? I took
          it. Just like I'm gonna take you.
          Steve jams his foot down into Darren's face, but Darren hangs
          on. In fact, with a superhuman surge, he hauls himself up,
          no matter how many times Steve hits him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          112.
          WHAM! Darren lets Steve have it.

                         DARREN
          I miss him.

          WHAM!

                         DARREN
          Do you understand?

          WHAM!

                         DARREN
          I miss him so much.
          WHAM! Steve's arm pinwheel for balance. He's going over.
          But just as he pitches off the end rafter...
          Darren catches him by his belt. Nearly bent backward, he
          hangs back over the abyss. If Darren lets go, Steve will
          fall into the spikes below.
          Crespley steps up beside Debbie, knows what Darren should do.

                         CREPSLEY
          Kill him, Darren. Do it now so you
          won't have to do it later.
          Darren looks at Steve. A moment they'll remember forever.

                         DARREN

                         (SOFTLY; SADLY)
          No. He used to be my friend.
          Darren flings Steve back the other way. To safety.

                         DARREN
          Start running. Don't ever stop.
          Steve hesitates. It wasn't supposed to be like this. Darren
          starts off the rafter toward him. One last look of hate.

                         STEVE
          Next time...
          And he's gone. Disappearing into the dark.
          Darren joins Debbie. Nothing left to hide.

                         DEBBIE
          Sam?
          Darren shakes his head. Sam didn't make it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          113.
          She understands. Darren looks at Crepsley. He's a mess.

                         DARREN
          Are you gonna be okay?

                         CREPSLEY
          I just need to catch my breath.
          For a few days. Maybe a week.

                         DARREN
          You think I made a mistake, don't
          you?

                         CREPSLEY
          No. I think that you proved
          yourself human after all.
          Human. As Darren absorbs this kindness, smiles.

                         DARREN
          Half human. What now?

                         CREPSLEY
          What do you mean?

                         DARREN
          There's a war on, isn't there?
          Crepsley shrugs.

                         DARREN
          This world is crossed by fences.
          You have to decide which side you
          stand on.

                         CREPSLEY
          Yes, yes. Black and white fences
          crossing very gray fields.

                         DARREN
          It's not gray. I've met the bad
          guys. They need to be stopped.

                         CREPSLEY
          I'm not sure it's my fight.

                         DARREN
          But you said it. There's no in
          between. And the power of being
          alone is never going to be greater
          than the weakness. It's our fight.

                         CUT TO:

          As PATRONS try to get as far as they can as quick as they
          can. We see Steve duck out, blending in.
          Mr. Tiny's Lincoln Continental pulls up. As Steve gets in...

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. FIELD - NEAR THE CAMPSITE - NIGHT

          Mr. Tall, Evra, Debbie, Darren and Crepsley. Crepsley sets
          Sam's body down in the grass. It's covered with one of Madam
          Truska's tent silks. As Crepsley's eyes meet Darren's...

                         DARREN

                         (A WHISPER)
          He was a good kid. It's weird, but
          I remember things about him even
          though I wasn't there when they
          happened. Even though it's
          impossible.
          A moment as Crepsley nods sadly at this most singular boy.

                         CREPSLEY
          His blood is in you.

          MR. TALL
          I'll deal with the police when they
          come. What I'll say, I don't know.

                         DEBBIE
          Say what happened. Some crazy guy
          showed up. Sam was in the wrong
          place at the wrong time.
          They're all quiet a moment.

                         EVRA
          He was brave.

                         DEBBIE

                         (SADLY)
          For the only time in his life.

                         DARREN
          He didn't die in vain.
          A beat.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          115.

          MR. TALL
          Time to fly or flit or whatever you
          call it. The sun won't wait all
          night.

                         CREPSLEY
          Actually, that's exactly what it
          does.
          Mr. Tall manages a smile, considers the sky a moment.

          MR. TALL
          Time will tell what this night has
          brought us.

                         CREPSLEY
          Yes. Keep my coffin ready, would
          you?

          MR. TALL
          Always.
          As they exchange farewells, Debbie turns to Darren.

                         DEBBIE
          Do you think we'll meet again?

                         DARREN
          You never know.
          As she hugs him tight, she whispers in his ear:

                         DEBBIE
          I hope so...

                         DARREN

                         (WHISPERS BACK)
          Hope is a good word. I hope so,
          too.
          And so goodbye. Darren and Crepsley start down the road.

                         DARREN
          Where are we going?

                         CREPSLEY
          To meet the Vampire Generals. War
          clouds are forming. A storm is
          coming. And I have a feeling
          you're needed much more than I am.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          116.

                         DARREN
          So what are we waiting for? Let's
          go.
          Crepsley offers his hand.

                         CREPSLEY
          Take my arm.
          Darren shakes his head, doesn't need it.
          He shimmers, flits into the night.
          Crepsley laughs to himself. As he follows...

          FADE TO BLACK.

                         FADE IN:

          EXT. ALLEYWAY (VILLAGE) - DUSK

          Gloomy, last light. From out of the shadows comes            --
          A DOG. A dog of war. Big, mangy, muscular, scary. As
          he moves down the alley, the way becomes increasingly
          choked with fallen structures. and signs of tumult.

          EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DUSK

          TRACKING WITH THE DOG as he comes onto a battlefield.
          The hellish scene is REVEALED TO US SLOWLY --                

          SERIES OF SHOTS
          as the Dog traverses a landscape of --
          BODIES, frozen in contorted death poses. This was
          furious, hand-to-hand fighting between human SOLDIERS and
          nightmare CREATURES, their corpses now in piles to the
          horizon.
          The Dog climbs a mound of casualties. At the top, the
          Dog looks back across the battlefield. The Dog's eyes
          are sad, his expression weary and disgusted.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          EXT. THE PALACE OF ACRISIUS - NIGHT

          The entrance is patrolled by a dozen PALACE GUARDS. They     
          don't see the Dog pad silently to a fissure in the palace    
          wall and disappear inside.                                   

          INT. THE PALACE OF ACRISIUS - GREAT HALL - NIGHT             

          Bloodied and battered, the King's GENERALS are               
          disagreeing loudly about strategy. A loud BANGING sound
          pierces the hubbub, and the officers quiet, turning to --    
          KING ACRISIUS, a striking man in his prime, his handsome     
          face marked by one crooked scar on his jaw. He commands      
          the room --                                                  

                         KING ACRISIUS
          Now we end the debate about
          tactics... and begin to plan for
          victory.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2.

          AT THE BACK OF THE HALL
          The Dog stares at the King. Then slips away.

          INT. THE PALACE OF ACRISIUS - GREAT STAIRS - NIGHT

          Unseen by exhausted Guards, the Dog bounds up the stairs.     

          INT. THE PALACE OF ACRISIUS - ROYAL APARTMENT - CORRIDOR -


                         NIGHT
          The Dog approaches a doorway; stops to watch from the         
          shadows.

          INT. THE PALACE OF ACRISIUS - BEDCHAMBER - DOG'S POV -


                         NIGHT
          In the dim bedchamber, the SILHOUETTE of QUEEN DANAE as a     
          LADY-IN-WAITING removes her gown, revealing the Queen's       
          perfect body as she slips into bed. The Lady-in-Waiting
          leaves.
          The Dog's eyes. He moves forward.

                         FLOOR-LEVEL
          TRACKING WITH the Dog's legs as they MORPH INTO HUMAN
          LEGS. The CAMERA RISES BEHIND a towering male figure,
          who roughly pulls a curtain aside.                            
          In the bed, the Queen is startled, then pleased.

                         QUEEN DANAE
          My King! Has the strategy been
          set so quickly?

                         REVERSE ANGLE
          The looming figure looks exactly like King Acrisius,          
          including the distinctive scar. He regards her hungrily.      

                         QUEEN DANAE
          Come to your Queen, my King.

          INT. THE PALACE OF ACRISIUS - GREAT STAIRS - SUNRISE          

          The real King Acrisius wearily climbs the stairs with         
          AIDES and Guards. Suddenly, the King stops.                   

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.

                         CONTINUED:
          On the wall above is the huge shadow of a four-legged
          creature -- and now it appears:
          The Dog stops at the top of the stairs and regards the
          men without fear -- its eyes blaze with a God's power.
          Even Acrisius, who fears nothing, steps back. The others
          raise their weapons.
          The Dog comes down the steps, eyes upon them, and passes     
          close by. No one dare move. The Dog disappears into the      
          shadows below.                                               

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          EXT. THE SEA - ROCKY PROMONTORY - CLOSE ON KING ACRISIUS'    


          HARDENED COUNTENANCE - DAY
          staring at --

                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          Queen Danae, PREGNANT NOW, and weeping. Her arms are
          bound.
          A ROYAL ENTOURAGE is gathered. The women weep, the men       
          agonize.                                                     
          Palace Guards lift the Queen into a chest and chain it       
          closed. On the King's signal, the Guards carry the chest     
          to the edge and drop it into the rough sea. We HEAR a
          SCREAM from within.
          Some members of the Royal Entourage look with scorn at
          their King, outraged by this double murder. Acrisius
          registers their disapproving looks and angrily turns to
          leave the promontory.
          WE SEE in his face what the others do not -- shame and
          doubt.                                                       
          IN THE WATER BELOW, the chest rights itself and rides out    
          on the tide.                                                 

          EXT. SAND DUNES OF A LONELY BEACH - NIGHT                    

          Two HORSEMEN gallop in the moonlight. The first Rider
          sways in the saddle and falls from his mount. He
          staggers to his feet, a skin of ale in his hands. It is
          King Acrisius, very drunk.
          The second Rider, the King's STEWARD, dismounts to give      
          aid, though he's also drunk.                                 

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          4.

                         CONTINUED:

                         KING ACRISIUS

                         (RAGING)
          My own subjects condemn me! They
          dare judge me? And what emboldens
          this treachery?...

                      STEWARD          
          You are mistaken, my King. None                                           
          would risk your anger --                                                  

                      KING ACRISIUS    
          (oblivious to him)                                                        
          It is Zeus who warps my                                                   
          kinadom!... Zeus the ungodly, Zeus                                        
          the defiler...                                                            
          This talk sobers the Steward instantly; he looks about                    
          fearlessly.                                                               

                      STEWARD          
          Please, speak not these things                           --               
          Acrisius spins on him, out of control --                  

                         KING ACRISIUS
          He cuckolds me in my castle, rapes
          my precious Queen! This is a low,
          conniving God... But I have bested
          him on this day and humbled the
          great Prime.

                         (SWIGS ALE)
          Tell me, Panos, who rivals Zeus on
          Olympos? Who does the Fearless
          One fear?

                         STEWARD                                                   
          I beg you, Your Highness --                               
          Acrisius pulls a dagger and holds it to the Steward's
          throat.

                         KING ACRISIUS
          Tell me what the Priests say!

                         STEWARD
          (terrified, halting)
          Tiamat... Tiamat, Queen of the
          Deep.

                         (WHISPERING)
          Those who dare, whisper she covets
          Zeus' throne and schemes to
          achieve it, the ambitious Goddess
          of the Dark Oceans...

                         KING ACRISIUS
          Yes, Tiamat! And today I have
          honored her.
          The King whirls and staggers up the crest of the dune.        

                         KING ACRISIUS
          I've taken Zeus' whore and the
          bastard she grows in her belly and
          thrown them to Tiamat in her rough
          sea!
          (toward the moonlit

                         OCEAN)
          I honor Zeus' rival with all that
          was dear to me --
          (falters, ashamed)
          -- and commit double murder in her
          honor...
          About to go to pieces, rage seizes him again --               

                         KING ACRISIUS
          so that Zeus will know I
          despise and disdain him and spit
          on his foul name!
          The Steward shrinks from this blasphemy, eyes darting in      
          fear.                                                         
          ON THE CREST the King is silhouetted in the moonlight,        
          arms raised defiantly toward the heavens, when suddenly --    
          -- his figure is seized by some violent force, shaking
          his being. A HORRIBLE SOUND                                  (MUSCLE TEARS, BONES CRACK)
          and THE KING'S BODY GROWS LARGER AS IT DISTORTS IN

          MISSHAPEN DISFIGUREMENT.
          And thus, KING ACRISIUS BECOMES... KALIBOS!
          The Steward SEES what we now cannot. An INHUMAN ROAR and
          the shadow of this new being falls upon the Steward. He
          SCREAMS, but it's too late -- the huge CREATURE grabs him
          by the neck and LIFTS HIM OUT OF FRAME. From the empty,
          moonlit dunes, we...

          SUPERIMPOSE: TWENTY-FIVE YEARS LATER

                         FADE IN:

          EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

          A LITTLE BOY leads a blind OLD MAN along a road.             
          Abruptly, the Old Man halts. Puzzled, the Boy scans
          ahead, SEES --
          -- a SPRAY OF DUST, moving fast, behind a blurred BLACK

                         FORM --                                                      
          -- in an instant, the apparition blows past them -- wind
          and dust whip at them. In awe and fear --

                         OLD MAN
          Thoth the Quick...
          (sensing the boy's

                         CONFUSION)
          Messenger of the Gods. Bound for
          Olympos.
          The rushing Black Form crosses a field, leaving a            
          violent wave in the long grass and suddenly --

          EXT. FIELDS/WOODS/MOUNTAIN/OLYMPOS - DAY

          WE ARE IN THAT RUSHING POV: the landscape is just a          
          blur. But up ahead is a mountain: OLYMPOS. WE ZOOM UP        
          TO the summit --                                             
          -- INTO the clouds above the peak. THROUGH the mist --
          villas, classical facades: THE ABODE OF THE GODS. The
          polished stone of the grandest villa reflects THOTH'S
          dark form touching down.

          INT. ATRIUM                                                 (OLYMPOS)   - DAY

          THOTH THE QUICK enters the wide courtyard, his cape
          billowing. He strides past the reflecting pool in the
          center of the courtyard, gravely acknowledging --
          -- each of the TEN FIGURES seated around the perimeter...
          THE OLYMPIANS. APOLLO is here, and bronze-helmeted
          ATHENA; APHRODITE and muscular VULCAN -- we are dazzled
          and lose count.
          Thoth bows deeply before the throne of ZEUS, majestic,       
          bearded, awe-inspiring. An EAGLE is perched on his arm.      

                         THOTH
          My lord.

                         ZEUS
          (rumbles, like

                         THUNDER)
          We have debated, we have voted,
          and it is decided. We offer the
          Humans peace. Thoth, you will
          take them the terms of a treaty --

          TIAMAT                                                     (O.S.)

                         (SCORNFULLY)
          A treaty!
          Zeus and his eagle turn their heads. The God's eyes are
          familiar -- the blazing orbs we saw in The Dog.
          In the shadowed corner of the atrium stand TWO MORE
          Olympians: SET THE VOID, whose countenance is death made    
          visible, and --                                             
          -- TIAMAT, QUEEN OF THE DEEP, the only God fearless         
          enough to challenge Zeus' rule --                           

                         TIAMAT
          We don't negotiate with them! We
          dictate to them. Their place is
          to beg. They have forgotten their
          role and have denied us the
          sustenance of their prayers.

                         APHRODITE
          Our mercy will give them reason to
          be grateful. They will bow down
          and whisper our names with more
          passion than before.

                         TIAMAT
          They will bow down when we snap
          their backs! Mercy? We are Gods!
          Some of us remember that and are
          not afraid --
          Zeus has had enough: furious ARCS OF LIGHTNING jump to
          the walls, the eagle beats its wings in rage.               

                         ZEUS
          Silence! Or learn what it is to
          be afraid! The debate is over,
          the votes cast...
          Zeus points to a golden tray; it bears TEN chips of
          alabaster versus TWO shards of obsidian.

                         CONTINUED:

                         ZEUS
          We guarantee an armistice, we
          shield the bridegroom and the
          Joppan royal family.
          (turning again on

                         TIAMAT)
          And we do not interfere in their
          actions. We leave them
          undisturbed unless-invoked by name
          to enter their affairs.

                         SET
          And if they refuse our terms?

                         ZEUS
          They have suffered terrible
          losses. They will not pass up a
          chance for peace.

          INT. ATRIUM - MAGIC HOUR (LATER)

          Only Tiamat and Set now. Tiamat regards Zeus' throne.      

                         SET                                                        
          This is your rightful place to                             
          take.                                                      

                         TIAMAT
          Soon enough, Set. Zeus has grown                           
          weaker than I knew.
          Set gestures at the white chips on the tray as he picks
          up the two black shards representing their votes. He
          hands one to Tiamat.                                       

                         SET
          So have they all. They no longer
          see clearly.                                               

                         TIAMAT

                         (DISDAINFUL)                                               
          They're beginning to think like                            
          Men. But you and I shall not.                              
          Set agrees, his eyes searching her face.                   

                         TIAMAT
          We will manage these thick-witted
          Humans to our own ends.
          (off his look)
          Yes, we will be bound by great
          Zeus' rules... until their fragile
          membranes tear. We dare not
          interfere with these insects...

          but we may be invited to                                 
          intervene.
          Tiamat flicks the obsidian into the reflecting pool --

          In my palace, I decide how the                             
          discourse proceeds, not some
          messenger sent on errands by Zeus.

          THOTH (O.S.)
          You are correct, Your Highness, I
          do the bidding of Zeus...
          To their astonishment, the emissary is already in the
          Throne Room, behind them. Startled, they turn to see      --    
          Thoth the Quick, Messenger of the Gods, float forward.          

                         THOTH

          King Kepheus, as humble messenger

          visit from the realm of the Gods.                          
          The King shoots Amoun a look, but he is still shaken by
          Thoth's sudden appearance. Cassiopeia tries to recover
          her composure.

                         KEPHEUS

          the crowd watches the Basilica, worried by the God's        
          presence.

          INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY

          Kepheus and Cassiopeia sit stunned. Amoun watches
          without surprise.

                         KEPHEUS
          A treaty marriage?

                         THOTH
          You have a daughter of age.

                         CASSIOPEIA

                         (GASPS)
          Andromeda!

                         KEPHEUS
          Surely Zeus does not ask a mortal
          father to give his daughter to a
          God.

                         THOTH
          No. Such a union would be
          unclean. Years ago Zeus created a                           
          scion of mixed blood. Half-man,
          half-God. Bred for just this
          union. That is how important Zeus
          considers this truce.

                         CASSIOPEIA                                                  
          Is my only daughter to marry a
          demigod, not of this earth?

                         THOTH
          A prince, of both Olympian and
          Human royalty. A chosen one.

          Zeus has given his son to the
          cause of peace.

                         KEPHEUS
          I have heard of no such demigod.

                         AMOUN
          Majesty, if I may -- the young man
          does exist. He lives in a small
          fishing village on the isle of                         
          Seriphos.
          Kepheus turns, surprised at Amoun's foreknowledge.

                         KEPHEUS
          You knew about this and said
          nothing?

                         CASSIOPEIA

                         (ACCUSATORY)
          Just which king do you serve?

                         AMOUN
          My Queen, I serve only the great
          order of things. I was the boy's
          tutor years ago.

                         KEPHEUS
          How haughty this boy must be, who                      
          knows he is half-God.

                         AMOUN
          He knows nothing and believes
          himself an ordinary man. He has
          never left his village. He can be                      
          overconfident, but it is from                          
          inexperience, not arrogance.                           
          Repheus and Cassiopeia exchange wary looks. Sharply    

                         CASSIOPEIA
          What assurance do we have that our                     
          daughter will be safe?

                         THOTH                                                  

                         (LOSING PATIENCE)                                      
          You have my word, as Ambassador of
          the Gods.

                         KEPHEUS
          With our daughter's future at
          stake, we do not bestow trust
          easily.

                         (THREATENING)

          Amoun reacts, but it is too late -- Thoth has been

                         IRRITATED:
          Suddenly, the WALLS GROAN, compressing with an AWFUL
          SHUDDER. The room TILTS. Kepheus and the Queen grab for
          a solid handhold, frightened.
          The golden marbles on a tabletop roll from their pits and
          pile up in defiance of gravity. Wine goblets tilt toward
          Thoth.

                         THOTH

                         (SHAKEN)
          Of course... of course your word
          is unquestioned here.
          Thoth's demeanor changes. The marbles spill off the          
          table, rolling across the floor to Kepheus' feet. TILT       
          UP TO his intimidated face:

                         KEPHEUS
          Where is the lucky young suitor?

          EXT. UNDERWATER (THE AEGEAN SEA)                            - DAY                                              

          Perfectly blue, sunlight shafting from the surface.                                                            
          A GREAT WHITE SHARK appears, ensnared in a fisherman's       
          net. Panicked, the shark is diving as fast as it can.        
          As the net passes we see --
          ANTEROS, a hapless young fisherman, his legs entangled in    
          the net, desperately trying to hold his breath. When
          they have disappeared, we see a FIGURE appear through the
          blue in pursuit. As he passes, we get our first look

                         AT --
          PERSEUS,                                                    25, wiry, bronzed from the sun, a stubbled jaw,
          a knife in his teeth. He swims with the power and grace
          of a porpoise -- beyond the ability of any normal man.

          EXT. SEA FLOOR - DAY

          The shark thrashes about, jaws snapping close to Anteros.

                         CONTINUED:
          Perseus swims INTO VIEW and uses his knife to cut the net
          near the shark's snout. The shark tries to swim through
          the hole, but instead drags the net upwards. Perseus
          hangs on.
          One more slice and the shark zooms out of the net,
          bumping the young hero as it swims away. Perseus pulls
          Anteros toward the surface.

          EXT. FISHING TRAWLER - DAY

          A CREW of FISHERMEN wait desperately at the rail.
          SPYROS, the oldest and toughest, watches in agony.
          Perseus breaks the surface, gasping, his lifeless friend
          in his arms. Five crewmen dive in to help, but Perseus
          is mad with despair. They have to pull him away.
          Spyros watches sadly. But also, relieved to see the one
          survivor.

          EXT. FISHING TRAWLER - DAY

          Spyros makes his way to the bow, where Perseus sits
          alone, downcast, in pain. Spyros watches in silence.
          Then, gruffly --

                         SPYROS
          Your grieving does Anteros no
          good. It comforts only you.

                         PERSEUS
          It's my fault he's gone.

                         SPYROS
          He was careless with the net.
          Perseus gives him a hard look.

                         PERSEUS
          So it's his fault. Not mine, not
          fate, not the Gods?

                         SPYROS

                         (DISDAINFULLY)
          The Gods delude themselves about
          their power and watch in envy
          while we act. We make our own
          history.

                         PERSEUS
          (breaks down, crying)
          Now my history is I let my friend
          die in my arms. I made it back,
          why couldn't he?

                         SPYROS
          What you do, no other man can do.
          Have you not noticed?

                         PERSEUS
          To what purpose? I failed him.

                         SPYROS

                         (SCOFFS)
          Purpose! Looking for purpose is
          what ensnares men in the
          superstition of the Gods, as
          surely as your friend was caught
          in that net. And all the
          searching leads down to the same
          place.
          The trawler is approaching its home island, Seriphos.
          Perseus looks off at the rocky coast. Collects himself,

                         QUIETLY --

                         PERSEUS
          You always say that my abilities
          are greater than other men's. But
          they were not enough to save him.

                         SPYROS
          You are still a man, confined by
          man's limits. You are just as
          likely to fail as succeed.

                         PERSEUS
          How is that greater than other
          men?

                         SPYROS
          Ordinary men fail most of the
          time.
          The trawler rounds a point on the island.
          Perseus spies a beautiful girl on the cliff. A closer

                         LOOK --
          A huntress; a pagan leather bandeau hugs her lithe         
          figure. Flowers in her golden hair -- wilted dahlias.      
          Young yet ancient. THE WILTING GIRL.

                         CONTINUED:
          She watches Perseus intently as the boat passes. He
          turns to see if Spyros or his friends have seen her, but
          no one has. When he looks back, she's gone.

           EXT. PROMONTORY NEAR THE HOME OF SPYROS - MAGIC HOUR     

           Perseus sits looking sadly at the sea that killed his
          friend. TEKLA,                                             14, Perseus' adoptive sister, runs up                    
           from the modest stone dwelling. She sees his mood and    
          touches his arm gently.                                 

                         TEKLA
          Mother wants you to come in for
          supper.
          (as he is

                         UNRESPONSIVE)
          Perseus, why are you so sad?
          This breaks his spell. He looks at Tekla warmly, gets up    
          and puts a reassuring arm around her shoulders as they      
          head inside.                                                

          INT. HOME OF SPYROS - KITCHEN - NIGHT

          Perseus eats with his adoptive family: Spyros, his wife
          MARMARA, and Tekla. Spyros is patient and twinkly with      
          his wife though he disagrees with her beliefs.

                         TEKLA
          I still don't understand.

                         SPYROS
          Your mother can explain. She
          believes everything has an
          explanation, even if we have to
          make it up.

                         TEKLA
          Tell me! Why is there war between
          Man and the Gods?
          Marmara and Tekla continue to bring out the food.

                         MARMARA
          At the beginning of time, when Man
          was young, he prayed to the Gods.
          His belief in the Gods gave his
          life meaning. It was a good
          thing.

          But Man grew, as children do, and
          he turned away from the Gods. Be
          began to put his faith in other
          things.
          Perseus watches the debate with fiery eyes.

                         TEKLA
          What things?

                         SPYROS
          Learning, science... love.

                         (PASSIONATE)
          self-determination! Those
          things that give Man dignity and

                         MARMARA
          But what of the Gods, who had
          protected and guided us so long?
          They must breathe our prayers to
          survive. They hunger for

          Spyros!

                         (TO TEKLA)
          Your father's mind is closed on
          these matters.

                         SPYROS
          The Gods were desperate to claim
          our awe again.

                         TEKLA
          Desperate... the Gods?

                         SPYROS
          Yes, even the Gods. If they could
          not earn our faith with love, they
          would demand it with fear.

          INT. HOME OF SPYROS - PERSEUS' ROOM - NIGHT

          Middle of the night. Perseus lies wide awake in his tiny    
          space. He stares, thinking about his friend. Suddenly,      
          a KNOCK at the door.                                        

          INT. HOME OF SPYROS - DOORWAY - NIGHT

          Perseus opens the door to the Wilting Girl. Her beauty      
          electrifies him. She glows from within, but her color is    
          oddly faded, washed-out.                                    

                         PERSEUS
          You... I saw you watching our boat
          at the cliff.

                         WILTING GIRL
          It was not the boat I was
          watching.

                         PERSEUS
          Can I be of service?

                         WILTING GIRL
          Yes, of service. I need you to
          come with me on a journey.
          Perseus gives her a look.

                         PERSEUS
          Right now?
          (as she nods)
          It wouldn't take much persuading
          to get me to leave this village,
          but tonight is impossible. My
          family can't wake and find me
          gone. Where do you want me to go?

                         WILTING GIRL
          It's not what I want. I am in the
          service of others.

                         PERSEUS
          For what?
          Perseus doesn't notice the black widow spider scurry
          between her feet. Then a centipede, a scorpion. Then a
          swarm, racing toward him.
          He feels the first spider and looks down. The creatures
          climb his legs, biting. Weakening from the venom, he
          stumbles back into the table, loses his balance and
          falls.

          A white sail, swollen with wind, draws the small boat
          swiftly across the sea. The Wilting Girl, alone, sits
          quietly at the stern, effortlessly steering.

                         CLOSER
          We SEE that she is also watching Perseus, who is sleeping
          in a makeshift bed in the bottom of the boat. Her eyes
          slowly travel over his bronzed, muscled frame. There are
          bite marks on his legs and arms, but they seem to be
          healing as we look at them.
          Perseus stirs and wakes, squinting up at the Wilting         
          Girl.

          I had a dream. I fell into a dark

          formed a soft net, caught me and

          When I came back up to the world,
          a beautiful woman appeared and

          cloth. Then she reappears, the sail on her other side.

          Perseus can't take his eyes off the Wilting Girl, who            
          steers. She tries not to be self-conscious; she would            
          blush were she not so pale.

                         WILTING GIRL
          You're looking in the wrong
          direction.

                         PERSEUS
          I don't think so.

                         WILTING GIRL
          Perhaps you should give some
          thought to your immediate future.

                         PERSEUS
          (laughs, flirtatious)
          That's what I'm doing.

                         WILTING GIRL
          Maybe you should take another
          look...
          She indicates the view behind him. Perseus turns, jaw        
          dropping.

                         HIS POV
          A breathtaking view of Joppa -- a city in two parts.
          At sea level, tangled hovels, boats, and docks crowd the
          working-class area -- the LOWER WHARF.
          Above, twisting stone stairs climb the cliffs to the
          ACROPOLIS with its gleaming villas, temples, statues, and

          The Wilting Girl leads Perseus through the city. He's
          never seen anything like it. He rubbernecks, awestruck
          as he passes a BLACKSMITH who takes a dragon skin from
          the coals and fashions armor by pounding the white-hot
          scales over a mold.

           homeless refugees on the street and the ruins   of once-

           Don't joke about such things. I'd

          They pass an evangelist                        (FANTASOS) haranguing a crowd.

          or know despair, for Tiamat will
          rule the heavens and the earth.
          Perseus is mystified by this talk. He turns to Vidalia
          for explanation, but she seems disturbed by the preacher   L
          and does not return Perseus' gaze.

          Cassiopeia hurries down a corridor to the parlor. WE
          FOLLOW to find:
          Kepheus speaking sternly to Perseus, before him.

                         KEPHEUS
          . before I am a king or a
          peacemaker, I am a father. Do you
          know what that means?

                         PERSEUS
          I'm not sure, Your Highness. I
          did not know my father.

                         KEPHEUS

                         (THROWN)
          Yes, well... it means I had no
          desire for my little girl's
          carefree springtime to be cut

                         SHORT --
          (to Cassiopeia,

                         (EMBARRASSED)
          I'm sure she's preparing herself
          to make the best possible
          impression.
          Perseus suppresses a smile, amused by the royal couple.
          Kepheus paces with mounting impatience.

          She's not the only one, sir. I
          don't know much about the events
          for which I've been drafted.

          (disarmed, but tough

                         GUY)
          I take no comfort in that, young
          man. In fact, I find little to
          take comfort in here. You are a
          stranger from a distant place, and
          I am asked to entrust the welfare
          of my daughter to you.

          should come her way, I will have
          your head on a stake.
          Kepheus thinks he sees a smirk on Perseus' face. He puts    
          his hand on the hilt of his sword.

                         KEPHEUS
          Is this amusing to you?

                         PERSEUS
          Not even a little, my lord. It's
          just that I myself was waylaid --
          snatched also, as you say, from my
          happy springtime...
          Kepheus studies him to see if he's making jest of him.

                         PERSEUS
          I've been told I'm to play a                                
          part in events which serve a                                
          higher purpose... of which I'm not                          
          at all convinced.

                         KEPHEUS
          Does a truce in the war between
          Men and Gods not strike you as a
          higher purpose?

                         PERSEUS
          With all respect, I have never

          no more than a story.

          Perhaps the thought of her new
          life has made her frantic to enjoy
          the vestiges of her old one.

          Perseus, if you're to take the
          wild girl for a wife, this is a
          good time to start your training.
          Go into the city and retrieve her.

                         PERSEUS
          How will I know her?

                         CASSIOPEIA
          She is unmistakable.

                         PERSEUS
          I'm a stranger here. Any hints?

                         AMOUN
          Follow the lights and the sound of
          profane music.

          EXT. BASILICA - SIDE ENTRANCE - MAGIC HOUR

          The Wilting Girl slips into the dusk like a thief.          

          EXT. ALLEYWAY - MAGIC HOUR

          The Wilting Girl steals down the dark, narrow alley,        
          headed toward the outskirts of town.
          Suddenly, a heavy wall shoots up from the cobblestones,     
          blocking her way. She startles, but does not stop. She
          goes up to the wall, turns at an angle and slides right
          through the stone, like a ghost.
          On the other side, she emerges from the stone, breathing    
          hard. She looks around and hurries down an intersecting
          passageway.
          She's gone only a few steps, when just ahead of her,        
          thick vines shoot out and form a dense barrier. She
          takes a breath and dives into the surging growth.
          She almost makes it through, but at the last moment,        
          vines wrap her arms and legs, holding her prisoner. She
          gives up, with a sigh. We HEAR the LAUGHTER of a God.

                         WILTING GIRL
          Zeus?
          Zeus' rumbling voice is held low, talking to her in an
          intimate way -- a beautiful sound.

                         CONTINUED:

          ZEUS                                                        (V.O.)
          Why do we have to play these
          games, my lovely girl? You know
          you cannot leave.
          The vines retract, freeing her. She rubs where they
          gripped her.

                         WILTING GIRL
          My part is finished.

          ZEUS                                                        (V.0.)
          It has just begun. Have you
          forgotten your place in this?

                         WILTING GIRL
          As I've lost my believers, the
          future has become dimmer to me.

          ZEUS                                                        (V.O.)
          I still believe in you. Close
          your eyes and see your tomorrow.
          She closes her eyes and takes a deep breath. A single
          tear runs along her cheek. She opens her eyes.

                         WILTING GIRL
          It's too painful. I can't involve
          myself.

          ZEUS                                                        (V.O.)
          You you already involved. Such is                                     
          fate. We cannot hide from the
          .trials of our future... no matter
          how dark the alleyway.
          She looks back at the Basilica with profound sadness.

          EXT. STREETS OF JOPPA - MAGIC HOUR

          Perseus roams, taking in the city with interest. Rich        
          and poor mix in the crowded streets. As always, the poor     
          have suffered the most from the conflict.                    

          EXT. OCEAN TERRACE - MAGIC HOUR

          Perseus follows the MUSIC and the sound of LAUGHTER to a
          crowded terrace overlooking the sea. Upper class YOUNG
          PEOPLE are partying en masse.
          Perseus moves through the revelry, looking at every girl,    
          testing his instincts. Suddenly, he stops in his tracks,     
          looking off --

                         CONTINUED:
          Andromeda is dancing at the center of attention, her
          sheer gown enhancing her sensuality. The MUSIC ends.
          Andromeda laughs and tosses her curly mane.
          A HANDSOME YOUNG NOBLEMAN embraces her. She gives him a
          deep kiss, causing a sensation, then breaks away into the
          crush.

          EXT. BALUSTRADE - MAGIC HOUR

          Andromeda glides to the balustrade to watch the sunset.
          The Young Nobleman approaches, but her imperious gesture
          stops him cold.

          PERSEUS                                                     (O.S.)
          Very beautiful.
          Andromeda spins, petulant.

                         ANDROMEDA
          Will you please give me some

                         PEACE --
          The sight of the handsome stranger gives her pause.

                         ANDROMEDA
          What did you say?

                         PERSEUS
          I said, 'Very beautiful.'

                         ANDROMEDA                                                    
          Do you think just anyone can make                            
          intimate judgements on the royal
          family?

                         PERSEUS                                                      
          I meant the sunset.
          She regards Perseus over her glistening bare shoulder.       

                         ANDROMEDA
          Do you always start a seduction
          with an insult?
          Perseus moves to the rail, very close to her, and looks
          at the sea.

                         PERSEUS
          I know nothing of seduction. I'm
          a simple fisherman. My home is
          across that water.

          What brings you here?

                         PERSEUS
          To Joppa? I was kidnapped.

                          

                         ANDROMEDA
          I mean here, tonight.
          He looks over at her a long moment.

                         PERSEUS
          I've come to see my future wife.
          Startled, Andromeda suddenly realizes who he is. A mad
          mix of emotions crosses her face.

          EXT. GARDENS OF THE BASILICA - NIGHT

          Perseus and Andromeda walk in moonlit gardens. She stays
          close, attracted to him.

                         ANDROMEDA
          It's not personal. You're not a
          bad-looking boy.
          (as Perseus laughs)
          I'm too young. I don't want to be
          married.

                         PERSEUS
          Me either.

                         ANDROMEDA
          Then why are you doing it?

                         PERSEUS
          No one asked me. And now that
          I've met you, I don't know if I
          can go through with it.
          (off her look)                                              
          It's not personal. Seeing you
          makes it real. I think a man
          should make his own decisions. I
          won't be the pawn of a King or a                            
          God.
          She looks at him with new interest.

                         ANDROMEDA
          Since we agree, it's settled. No                            
          marriage.

                         PERSEUS
          I don't think it's going to be
          that simple.
          Ignoring that, she takes his arm, moving even closer.

                         ANDROMEDA
          That doesn't mean we can't be
          friends. Get to know each other.
          I want to show you something.
          She leads him into a tall, hedged garden maze.

          EXT. THE BASILICA - GARDEN MAZE - NIGHT

          Beautiful in the moonlight. She hurries him quickly         
          around one turn, then another, and another. He laughs at
          her excitement.

                         PERSEUS
          I'm already lost.                                           

                         ANDROMEDA
          I'll take care of you.
          They take two more jogs and find themselves in an odd
          sylvan chamber. Soft plants have been stacked in what
          could be mistaken for a bed.

                         ANDROMEDA
          This is my special place. No one
          can see or hear or even find us
          now.

                         PERSEUS
          (looks around the

                         CHAMBER)
          I don't suppose I could escape
          without your aid.

                         ANDROMEDA
          Do you want to?
          When he turns back to her, she melts into his arms and
          gives him a long deep kiss. He's surprised, but handles
          it well. When she tries to continue, he slows things
          down, holding her at bay.

                         ANDROMEDA
          Do you not find me attractive?

                         PERSEUS
          One of the most beautiful women
          I've ever seen.

                         ANDROMEDA
          Of course, you haven't been much
          in the world.

                         PERSEUS
          True. Maybe a lot of girls look
          like you.

                         ANDROMEDA
          Don't you want to make love to
          your almost-wife? Maybe we'll
          find we're not compatible.

                         PERSEUS
          What if we find we're very compat--
          She stops him with another kiss. He starts to surrender
          to his desire, but again, he stops. Her voice is a low

                         PURR --

                         ANDROMEDA
          Is it true you're a demigod?

                         PERSEUS
          (makes a face)
          It seems what everyone wants to
          believe.
          Her face is inches from his. She looks into his eyes.

                         SEXY --

                         ANDROMEDA
          I don't see it.
          (as Perseus laughs)
          But let's find out for sure...
          She kisses him yet again, pulling him toward the bed of    
          foliage. He can no longer resist. Together they fall
          into the softness. He kisses her passionately as their
          bodies begin to move together. She breaks the kiss for
          only a moment, her voice husky --

                         ANDROMEDA
          I think I'm becoming a believer...
          They start to make love.

          The chamber, deserted for 25 years, is in decay, dead

          The King who stood against Zeus

          In the half-light appears the huge, deformed changeling:    

          KALIBOS.                                                    

          TIAMAT (V.O.)
          (to the monster)
          My Servant, your lonely solitude
          now ends... It's time to leave.

          EXT. THE BASILICA - GARDEN MAZE - SUNRISE

          Perseus wakes on the bed of foliage, looks around.
          Andromeda is gone. He thinks, smiles. Then he remembers
          his situation. The smile fades.

          INT. THE BASILICA - GREAT HALL - EVENING

          Perseus, in a white tunic and polished ceremonial armor,
          moves through the crowd of REVELERS. The grandiose room
          is hemmed by columns and statues. The royal family sits
          on the dais. Andromeda motions Perseus up beside her.

                         ANDROMEDA
          You're late.

                         PERSEUS
          I didn't know how to get this
          outfit on.

                         ANDROMEDA
          I want to thank you for seeing me
          home. I was so flushed with wine
          I can't recall much of the
          evening.
          Perseus half smiles and turns to the crowd.

                         PERSEUS
          Me either.

          PERSEUS' POV - THE WILTING GIRL
          watches from the back of the hall. When they make eye       
          contact, she quickly looks away.                            

          BACK TO SCENE
          Perseus is surprised by his feelings. Andromeda has seen
          her, too. He has a guilty moment and averts his eyes.

          At what point do you plan to tell
          them we're not getting married?

                         PERSEUS
          Tell who?

          (a sweeping gesture)
          Them...

          FROM BEHIND THEM
          We see the ecstatic crowd of thousands, all celebrating
          the union. MUSIC STOPS and the crowd begins to settle.

                          

          ROYAL HERALD (0.5.)
          The Queen will speak!
          The room QUIETS as Cassiopeia moves front-and-center of     
          the dais with a cup of wine, not her first.

                         CASSIOPEIA
          I won't be long-winded. You all
          know I am a modest person, no
          matter my rank.
          Some of the crowd react silently. Andromeda watches her
          mother with trepidation, but not as much as Kepheus,
          watching from his throne.

                         CASSIOPEIA

                         (WITH EDGE)
          This is not a celebration of a
          betrothal...
          (as Kepheus is on

                         ALERT)
          not the celebration of the
          happiness of two parents, or of
          our good people.
          Mild confusion in the hall, concern from the Royal          
          Entourage.                                                  

                         CASSIOPEIA
          This union represents new hope for
          a lasting peace! That is the only
          cause for celebration.
          The crowd reacts with exclamations and applause. Amoun      
          wills her to stop. Cassiopeia takes another drink, looks    
          over at the Princess.

          My sweet Andromeda... grown into a                        
          fine young woman, confident and
          sure. Look at her! Isn't she                              
          beautiful?
          Her subjects agree loudly. Andromeda wishes this would    
          end. Cassiopeia raises her glass.

                         CASSIOPEIA
          To my beautiful daughter... more
          beautiful than all the women of
          Joppa. More beautiful than the
          Gardens of Nineveh...
          Kepheus is about to pull her away. She throws him a
          spiteful glance.

                         CASSIOPEIA
          More beautiful than the turquoise
          ocean and its sublime Goddess of
          the Deep... Tiamat herself! My                            
          daughter is a beauty even a                               
          Goddess must envy.
          Amoun reacts in dismay. A distressed MURMUR roils the
          crowd. Andromeda goes to her mother.                      

                         CASSIOPEIA
          I've gone on too long --
          She stops with a look of sudden dread. The Great Hall     
          DARKENS. The torch flames TURN BLACK. The temperature     
          drops. The statues lining the hall shut their eyes and    
          the doors burst open.                                     
          TIAMAT, QUEEN OF THE DEEP, floats forward, parting the
          terrified celebrants. Perseus sees his first Olympian.
          Tiamat arrives at the dais. Cassiopeia drops to her
          knees.

                         TIAMAT
          You have blasphemed powers beyond
          understanding... You, a stupid
          braying goat before the
          unfathomable galaxies. You dare
          put this frivolous, scrawny
          slut...

          Tiamat tears off her cloak and STANDS NAKED. Her body,
          made from the elements of the sea, is magnificent -- sexy
          and terrifying.
          Fantasos, the priest who proselytizes for Tiamat in the      
          streets, is in the throng. His reaction is a mix of          
          religious ecstasy and outright lust.                         
          The celebrants shield their eyes, but Cassiopeia can't.
          She crumples, aging before our eyes. Every word shakes
          her frame --

          Tell me now, mortal, how bright
          your preening urchin shines?
          No one dare look long at the Goddess. No one but             
          Perseus. Tiamat notices Perseus... and his boldness.

          The people react in terror. Cassiopeia starts to faint,           
          but Tiamat snaps her back to consciousness                  --

          Clouds of black sea ink swirl and swallow Tiamat, then
          implode. Tiamat is gone. Cassiopeia, palsied and
          withered, collapses. Kepheus and Royal Aides rush to
          her.

          EXT. OCEAN FLOOR - NIGHT

          An immense school of fish is SUDDENLY SPOOKED. An EERIE
          GLOW swells in the gloom -- Tiamat glides TOWARD us,        
          stops and raises her palm. The silt SWIRLS and RIPPLES.
          A VAST PRIMORDIAL SHAPE SLOWLY RISES in clouds of ocean     
          mud. It's impossible to see what this creature looks        
          like, but it is big. We hear a deafening ROAR, which        
          drives a SHOCKWAVE across the silt.

          The sea bulges and a TSUNAMI rolls toward the shores of

          asleep.
          A lone FISHERMAN unloads nets from his boat. Suddenly,      
          the water under his boat is sucked out to sea. A deep       
          RUMBLE shakes the ground.                                   
          The fisherman is mesmerized as the horizon CLIMBS higher    
          and higher, a WALL OF WATER. In seconds, the colossal       
          wave breaks and falls, obliterating the boat, the docks     
          and the low-lying shanties.                                 

          INT. ROYAL CHAMBERS - NIGHT

          Cassiopeia lies blank and wan. A LOW DRONE grows.           
          Kepheus rushes to the window. And then, a deep, EARTH-

          A figure passes by a window in silhouette -- Andromeda

          INT. BALCONY ABOVE THRONE ROOM - NIGHT

          Andromeda edges into position to see the room below.

          AMOUN (O.S.)

          A council of VICEROYS and MINISTERS gathered before
          Kepheus, who seems lost in thought, head down. Perseus    
          stands off to the side.

          INT. THRONE ROOM - NIGHT

          Amoun reads from a scroll.

          nigh indestructible.
          The men turn to Kepheus; when he raises his face, he      
          looks exhausted.

          Amoun watches Perseus, at the fringe of the group,
          expectantly. But Perseus looks only perplexed, an
          observer.

          How can that be?                                            
          Amoun alone takes notice: he spins toward Perseus, with     
          relief.

          Perseus! You had something you                              
          wanted to say to the King?                                  
          All eyes turn to Perseus, who shrinks before them, self-    
          conscious.                                                  

                         PERSEUS                                                     
          What? No, Master Amoun. I'm                                 
          listening.                                                  

                         AMOUN
          You're 'listening'? We're talking
          about the precious life of your
          betrothed.
          Perseus meets his gaze, confused.

                         PERSEUS                                                     
          I'm a newcomer here. I would not                            
          presume to tell these men --

          Exactly! A newcomer with a fresh
          perspective. Share your thoughts
          with the King, your future father-
          in-law.
          The ministers are puzzled by Amoun's persistence.         
          Perseus, uncertainly --                                   

                         PERSEUS
          I know that I am young and have
          not seen much of the world, but it
          seems to me that nothing is
          indestructible.
          The Ministers react to the young man's arrogance.

          SPYROS                                                   (O.S.)
          I am far from young and have seen
          much of the world... and I agree
          with my son.
          Everyone turns to the new arrival: Perseus' adoptive               
          father, Spyros. Perseus goes to embrace him.                       

                         PERSEUS
          Father, how did you find me?

                         KEPHEUS
          I thought this boy's father was a
          God. How does a stranger walk
          unmolested into the Throne Room of
          the King?

                         AMOUN
          I sent for him, Lord. This good                           
          man raised Perseus from infancy.                          
          He will help him now.                                     

                         KEPHEUS
          Help him with what?

                         SPYROS
          With whatever is needed...
          Perseus approaches the King. Surprising himself --        

                         PERSEUS
          He will help me destroy Leviathan.
          Spyros does a double-take, then swallows: "Yeah, okay,
          sure."

          UP ON THE BALCONY
          Andromeda reacts, falling in love with Perseus.       

          IN THE THRONE ROOM

                         KEPHEUS
          But how?
          Perseus has no idea.                                  

                         AMOUN
          Majesty, we can seek the counsel
          of the Norn Sisters of Skolothia.
          They know the hidden ways of the                      
          Gods. If Leviathan can be slain,
          they'll know how to do it.

                         PERSEUS
          We have thirty days to find its
          weakness.

          Twenty-nine.

                         PERSEUS
          (flashes him a look)
          We'll leave tonight.

                         KEPHEUS
          With what army? I dare not weaken                     
          our forces when the city is about                     
          to be besieged.

                         PERSEUS

          We'll go alone.

          Yes. Give us a map.                                   
          Amoun laughs. When some of the others join in, the   King
          gives them a look that stops them dead.

                         AMOUN
          My King, with your permission...
          The King assents, seemingly lost. Amoun speaks to
          Perseus.

          band of comrades to help you on                              
          your mission. We can leave at
          first light.
          (to his Aide)
          Diokles, the map.
          The men move to the work area, where the Aide selects a      
          map from dozens. Something catches Perseus' eye.             

                         PERSEUS' POV
          Andromeda, up in the balcony, has made herself visible
          only to him. She silently mouths these words --              
          "Thank... you."

          AT THE MAP
          which has been hung for all to see, Amoun uses a pointer.

                         AMOUN
          We head north on the Via Dahlia.                             
          If we can make it to the Disputed

          MOVE IN ON the tip of Amoun's pointer on the                 

          AMOUN (O.S.)
          . we'll join the Cleon desert                                
          legion, the most formidable unit
          in all the army... With their
          escort, we can safely reach our
          destination in Skolothia, which
          lies to the east...
          We DISSOLVE THROUGH the map and pointer, which remain
          LIGHTLY SUPERIMPOSED over the following:

          EXT. VIA DAHLIA - DAY

          MUSIC SWELLS as we see THE FULL EXPEDITION on horseback,     
          on the main road north. As they come over a rise, Amoun      

                         IDENTIFIES THEM:                                             
          First, two fearsome Mongols, MONGKE and TAMBURLANE.

          Our guides will be Mongke and
          Tamburlane, father and son monster
          hunters from the Kingdom of the
          Iron Horde.
          Next, THE PRAETORIAN GUARD, commanded by a square-jawed    
          old soldier, DRACO. His men, in heavy armor: KOSMO,        
          Draco's lieutenant, and the soldiers ABAS, ICOS, THAD,     
          BOREAS, KRIKOR, and POLLUC.

          Wilting Girl.

          PERSEUS                                                   (V.0.)
          Why do we bring the Earth Goddess                          
          into this danger?                                          

          AMOUN (V.0.)
          I thank the stars we have her.                             
          Besides, she takes her orders from
          an authority much greater than I.
          Next, Spyros; horseback riding is not one of his many      
          skills. Behind him, Perseus and Amoun ride talking --      

                         PERSEUS
          Amoun, it seems an odd coincidence
          you came into my life as tutor, so
          long ago, and now, once again you
          instruct me.

                         AMOUN

          I've been looking forward to this
          journey for a long, long time.
          He spurs his horse, riding ahead. Spyros drops back
          beside Perseus.

                         SPYROS
          Who would have thought we'd be on
          a journey like this? Two simple
          fishermen.

          little idea of what I'm doing.

                         SPYROS
          Living at the mercy of the sea so
          long has convinced me some
          adventures are unexpected and some
          dangers unavoidable. It's all in
          your attitude.

          Tiamat's Palace-Galleon is bigger than anything man can
          construct. Tiamat is at the prow of the vessel, using
          all her godly power to STIR THE ELEMENTS. With great

          I'm sure that is not so.

          That's a pretty name. Wait,
          better yet -- 'Vidalia'? How's
          that... 'Vidalia'? That's more
          than pretty, beautiful really,

          Perseus fixates on the sadness in her eyes. His
          expression changes, and the tenor of this stolen vigil is
          altered.
          RAINDROPS fall as the SKY OPENS and a CLOUDBURST pelts
          the pool. Vidalia opens her lips to taste the rain and

           grotesquely misshapen. Abas raises his sword, but a

          With a "watch this" grin, Perseus rises. Draco pulls him

          soothingly. It WHINNIES and threshes its wings,              
          buffeting Perseus with gusts.
          The Pegasus rears up, and leaps over Perseus' head. It       
          lands behind him, bucks its hind legs, and kicks Perseus     
          face-first into the dirt.
          Icos and Boreas are laughing, but when Draco gives them a
          dark look, Boreas jumps up, sobered, and heads into the

          The Pegassi take flight, but the Humbaba grabs one and       
          swallows it whole. Humbaba turns and SNIFFS the air,

          does the same.                                               

                         DRACO
          I told you to run, boy. You'll
          make things worse.

          EXT. CEDAR FOREST ROAD - DAY

          Hearing the ROARS, the Expedition is already up. Icos       
          arrives.                                                    

                         ICOS
          A Humbaba!                                                  
          Mongke and Tamburlane fly into the woods; the others        
          follow.

          EXT. CEDAR FOREST CLEARING - DAY

          The reinforcements arrive to see Humbaba pin Boreas with    
          its talons.                                                 

                         DRACO
          Boreas!
          Draco hacks at the monster's leg, to no avail. it rips      
          off Boreas' head and swallows his body.                     
          Perseus CRIES OUT and leaps at the creature, sword          
          swinging.                                                   

                         AMOUN                                                       
          No, Perseus!                                                

                         VIDALIA                                                     
          Get back!                                                   
          Vidalia spins her shepherd's sling to pitch lead sling-
          bullets. Spyros leaps between Perseus and the monster
          and thrusts his weapon -- a VICIOUS-LOOKING HARPOON/BOAT

          HOOK.
          Tamburlane hoists an ancient BAZOOKA. Mongke lights the     
          fuse and backs away. KA-BOOM! The weapon belches fire       
          and metal.                                                  
          The Humbaba staggers from the shot, but lunges and          
          swallows Mongke whole. Spyros sinks his harpoon in one      
          leg, but has it ripped from his hands.                      

                         VIDALIA
          A delusion is planted in its mind.
          It thinks it's starving and it
          wants to feed on --

                         (SUDDENLY

                         UNDERSTANDING)

          -- YOU!

          58.

                         CONTINUED:
          The Humbaba's eyes bulge with surprise as a saber pierces    
          its nose. From inside, Mongke pries open the beast's
          mouth with his saber.

                         VIDALIA
          I can't reverse the powerful
          curse. But if the monster's
          hungry, I can feed it.
          Vidalia raises her arms and shuts her eyes. A cyclone of
          CAWING RAVENS descends from the sky and dives straight       
          into the monster's mouth. As the Humbaba tries to shake      
          them away, Mongke is thrown clear.                           

                         VIDALIA

                         (TO DRACO)
          Now! The belly! Slash the belly!
          Draco moves to do that when Perseus leaps forward, lunges
          and sweeps his blade up Humbaba's belly at the same
          moment Draco sweeps down. The two blades barely miss
          each other, opening a huge X in the belly. The others
          are shocked and impressed by Perseus. Steaming purple
          entrails spill over Perseus and Draco. HUMBABA CRASHES

          TO THE GROUND.
          The flock of ravens, liberated from Humbaba's gut, shake
          the viscera from their feathers and take flight.

          EXT. THE CEDAR FOREST - STREAM - DAY

          Perseus, somber, washes the creature's guts from his arms
          and legs. He turns to find Vidalia standing above him,
          furious.

                         L-

                         VIDALIA
          I should cast a spell upon you and
          leave you forever a stone upon
          this stream.

                         PERSEUS
          I didn't beckon the Humbaba.

                         VIDALIA
          You did, with your childish
          recklessness, and Boreas has paid
          the price!
          Perseus, already rife with guilt, is stung by the truth.     

                         VIDALIA                                                      
          Your safety is entrusted to me by                            
          the mightiest power on Olympos.

          fellows'.

                         PERSEUS
          The monster killed my friend. I
          could not contain my rage. But
          you, Goddess, are aloof from the
          emotions of Men.
          Vidalia's eyes narrow, enraged.

                         VIDALIA
          Yes, a tyrannical Goddess, who
          dares question your mad rush to
          annihilation.

                         (QUIETLY INTENSE)
          The hopes of multitudes reside
          with you. You're late in learning
          you cannot act upon every impulse.
          She whirls and walks away. Perseus is left with the
          weight of his culpability... and the beginning of
          knowledge.

          INT. SECRET SANCTUARY OF TIAMAT (JOPPA)   - NIGHT

          A CADRE of REVOLUTIONARIES led by Fantasos is gathered.
          Agenor, the handsome scullion who made love to Andromeda,
          leads Peshet in from the rain. She is frightened; Agenor
          has misled her.

                         PESHET
          Where have you brought me?

                         AGENOR                                                       
          It's okay...                                                 
          Peshet tries to leave, but Agenor stops her.                 

                         AGENOR
          Just listen to this good man. He
          needs your help.
          Fantasos comes forward. He fixes her with a hypnotic

          insane. They fight like Hades
          himself is keeping score...
          From the dark SURROUNDING DESERT, WE SEE the Night Patrol

          I'm not ashamed to say I'll be
          relieved to have their protection
          the rest of the way...
          Amoun's Voice FADES. TILT DOWN TO the barren, desert          
          flats. Suddenly, a miracle transforms the moonlit           

                         SCRUB --                                                    
          Strange, beautiful MAGENTA FLOWERS sprout magically where                                                               
          there had been only dirt and cacti. The LOTUS BLOSSOMS

          EXT. MOUNTAIN RIDGE (SIROQUE VALLEY) - NIGHT               

          The Cleon camp is just twinkling lights from here on the
          mountain. Startlingly, a huge DEFORMED PAW/CLAW/HOOF
          scrapes onto a boulder. Pulling himself INTO VIEW in
          repulsive CLOSEUP -- Kalibos. (There, within his
          frightening visage, is the distinctive crooked scar we
          noticed on the jaw of Acrisius in his human form.)
          When his twisted body has gained purchase, he looks up                           
          the mountain. AN EERIE LIGHT illuminates his awestruck                           
          countenance. Above him --

                         CONTINUED:
          -- Tiamat, ensconced in a natural throne of rock.
          Turning a Lotus blossom in her hand, she smiles on
          Kalibos, like a benevolent mother.

                         TIAMAT
          My loyal friend. it is beneath
          you to stalk this band of infidels
          one by one. Events demand more
          decisive action.
          Kalibos' SPEECH is as tortured and deformed as his body --

                         KALIBOS
          Grorashnrd... I to be... ruler...
          rhodirs... made whole...

                         TIAMAT
          Yes, Kalibos, the time is nigh
          when I restore you to your
          rightful form -- proud Acrisius.
          With me, your protector, on the
          throne of Olympos... the violator
          Zeus deposed.
          Kalibos reacts, with what must be satisfaction.

                         TIAMAT                                                        
          Go down into this valley. See                                 
          what I am building for you -- an                              
          army dangerous and fearless as

          EXT. CLEON LEGION BIVOUAC - PREDAWN

          Several Soldiers have been drawn from camp by the
          IRRESISTIBLE FRAGRANCE of the Lotus flowers. They pluck
          petals and chew them.
          The rest of the Legion filters out between the tents to
          take their fill of the drug.
          Kalibos watches the handsome, powerful warriors from
          across the field of Lotus blossoms.

          INT. THE BASILICA - ANDROMEDA'S CHAMBERS - NIGHT

          Peshet comes into the dark room and looks at the lump on
          Andromeda's bed. On instinct, she hurries to the bed and
          throws off the covers -- a pile of cushions, no
          Andromeda. Peshet races out.

          EXT. THE ACROPOLIS - NIGHT                                   

          Peshet sprints through the RAIN, dodging the REFUGEES and    
          CITIZENS like a cat, peering under each hood, searching      
          for her mistress.                                            

          EXT. THE ACROPOLIS - COVERED PLAZA - NIGHT                   

          On the plaza, a rabid throng of Refugees. Fantasos, the      
          Revolutionary leader, exhorts the mob, surrounded by         
          BODYGUARDS, including Agenor. As before, Fantasos seems      
          to have actual hypnotic powers.                              

                         FANTASOS
          How much are we meant to suffer?
          Where is your mighty King? Safely
          cloistered above the flood... on
          the high ground, with the high-
          born -- the privileged gentry!...
          The angry crowd responds, fists shaking. Peshet moves
          through the throng, desperately looking for Andromeda.
          She passes close to the rostrum and Fantasos registers
          her presence.

                         FANTASOS
          . Does Kepheus worry about you?
          No! Only the Princessa... And
          still, the Kraken comes! Does the
          King build his defenses at the
          water's edge?
          "NO!" cries the crowd. Peshet is shocked to find herself
          replying with them -- "NO1" Fantasos motions for Agenor
          to continue the harangue, while Fantasos hurries off the
          stage.

                         AGENOR
          No! He makes his stand at his
          daughter's chamber door!... We
          will show Kepheus we're not
          sacrificial fodder. We will
          tremble the walls of his Basilica!
          RABID SUPPORT from the mob. Peshet stops suddenly,
          peering ahead.

          at the fringe of the crowd, Andromeda herself watches        
          from the anonymity of a hooded cloak, terrified.

          Andromeda is the one Tiamat wants!
          We die so she may live...
          As the crowd EXPLODES, Andromeda hurries away in tears.    
          Peshet fights through the crush to follow her.             

          EXT. THE ACROPOLIS - ALLEY.- NIGHT                         

          Peshet rounds a corner, frustrated. Andromeda is gone.     
          A hand grabs Peshet's shoulder, startling her. It is       
          Fantasos.

          Peshet, you've come at the right                           
          time.                                                      
          Fantasos engages her with hypnotic power. Peshet nods,     
          trance-like.                                               

                         FANTASOS
          One night soon, a gong will sound
          three times. When you hear it,
          unlock the back gate of the
          Basilica. Then go to Andromeda's
          chambers...
          (hands her a dagger)
          . and bring the Princess out.
          My men will take her to Leviathan.
          Peshet just stares at the dagger, hands trembling.         

                         FANTASOS
          Do you understand me?
          (harshly, off her non-

                         RESPONSE)
          Peshet, do you understand how
          important your part is?
          She nods, horrified by her predicament.

          Everyone is standing perfectly still.                       
          DARK FIGURES surround them. The transformed Cleon Legion    
          lurches INTO VIEW. The only resemblance to the soldiers

          Draco bolts for the barrier. A Lotophagi spears Kosmo,      
          killing him. Draco slides inside the swarm. He looks        
          back at Kosmo in horror.
          Polluc slashes zombies and runs toward the swarm. He's      
          almost there when one of the Lotophagi lands on him,        
          sinking fangs into his skull. Polluc sticks his sword
          into the creature; they both fall over dead. Icos and
          Spyros fight their way to the swarm and jump inside.
          Mongke and Tamburlane kill a Lotus-eater and leap over
          the corpse into the protected circle.                       
          The tide of HOWLING and SHRIEKING Lotophagi claw at the     
          barrier of insects to no avail.                             

                         AMOUN
          Only humans can penetrate the
          shield!
          Perseus takes quick stock of the group inside the swarm,    
          thinking.

                         PERSEUS
          Only humans...
          He looks over the Lotophagi and sees Vidalia out there,
          alone, flinging sling-bullets as she fights her way
          toward the barrier.

                         PERSEUS
          Drop the barrier!                                          r

                         AMOUN
          No! It's too late for her!

                         PERSEUS
          Drop it, Amoun!
          At that moment, Kalibos grabs Vidalia and drags her to
          the top of an outcrop. At the top, he turns, LOOKS
          DIRECTLY AT PERSEUS and HOWLS, his message clear: "If
          you want to save her, come and get her." He hungrily
          rips her leather bandeau. Perseus turns to Amoun.

          Have you learned nothing? If you
          break out now, we're all at risk.
          On the boulder, Kalibos grabs Vidalia's white flesh.         
          Perseus is anguished; he knows he's in love.                 

                         PERSEUS                                                      
          I've learned one thing for                                   
          certain!                                                     
          Perseus shouts at Thad, the massive Praetorian.              

                         PERSEUS
          Get down!
          Perseus backs away three steps. To the others               --    

                         PERSEUS
          Get ready to defend yourselves!
          Perseus runs, plants a foot on Thad's back and leaps out
          through the swarm, which immediately dissipates around
          the humans. They have only a moment to react as the
          stunned Lotophagi come to their senses.

                         DRACO
          Let's kill these freks!
          Perseus runs over the backs of the Lotophagi. Hurtling
          off them, he scrambles up and knocks Kalibos off Vidalia.
          Ralibos rolls, flips onto his feet and gives Perseus a
          look: "You're the one that I want."
          They face off, looking for an opening. Perseus lunges,
          thrusting his sword. Kalibos dodges, springing up the
          rocks and then down toward Perseus, acrobatic as an ape.
          Perseus rolls out of the way.
          Perseus sweeps his sword at Kalibos' head. The monster       
          catches the blade in his jaws and SNAPS IT IN TWO!           
          Bloody spittle flies from his tongue.                        
          Kalibos pounces, pins Perseus. He opens his jaw and
          sinks his teeth into Perseus' shoulder. Vidalia cracks a
          rock into Kalibos' head. The creature whirls on Vidalia
          and careens toward her, head bloody.
          Perseus leaps in the air and catches Kalibos in the back     
          with both feet, knocking him over the edge.

                         CONTINUED:
          Kalibos slams down on the jagged boulders and ricochets
          off, pinwheeling through the air. The grotesque figure
          hits the lower rocks head-first and his neck CRUNCHES.
          He slams into the dust, dead.
          Perseus lands on his back, weak from the bite. When he       
          tries to rise, his legs are rubbery. Vidalia catches him
          as he falls forward and lowers him gently, looking at the
          bloody puncture wounds.

                         VIDALIA

                         (SOOTHING)
          Okay... sshh... I've got you.
          A THUNDEROUS SOUND SURGES in the distance. Vidalia scans
          the horizon.

                         DOWN BELOW
          Draco, Spyros, Amoun and the others hack away, fending
          off the Lotophagi. Outnumbered, they won't last long.
          The earth VIBRATES. The Lotophagi are distracted,
          looking around nervously.
          Over a rise stampede SCORPIOCHS, rhino-sized scorpions.      
          Riding them, DJINN RAIDERS, flowing black silk masking       
          all but their blue eyes.                                     
          They lay into the Lotophagi. The Scorpiochs skewer the
          beasts with HUGE PINCERS. The Djinn use flashing             
          SCIMITARS to cut them down.                                  

          ATOP THE ROCKS
          in Vidalia's arms, the fading Perseus watches as the
          Djinn turn and surround the Expedition members, closing
          in.

                         PERSEUS
          Vidalia... we need to help them...
          He blacks out. Vidalia cranes to look over the edge of       
          the cliff where Kalibos fell. She is mystified by what       

                         SHE SEES:                                                    
          The deformed monster Kalibos is gone. In his place, neck     
          broken, lies a handsome, aging noble, finally at peace --    
          King Acrisius.

          A STRING OF LIGHTS, each a lantern hanging from a
          Scorpioch's tail. The Expedition members ride on the
          Scorpioch with the Djinn. Some of the huge scorpions
          carry small box/rooms (palanquins) on their backs.

          INT. PALANQUIN - NIGHT

          Perseus lies sprawled on cushions, unconscious. Vidalia                                    
          replaces the dressing on his bite wound. Knowing he                                        
          cannot hear her --

                         VIDALIA
          To save me, you risked everything
          -- your mission, your friends...
          the fate of multitudes. Men need
          better judgment in the one who is
          meant to lead them...                                       
          No longer able to lecture, she regards him with love.       

                         TENDERLY --                                                 

                         VIDALIA
          You shouldn't have risked your
          life for me. It is a waste to                               
          save me when I'll be gone so soon.
          She strokes his hair and kisses his forehead.               

                         VIDALIA
          Thank you for your reckless
          disregard. Thank you, Perseus...
          Vidalia holds her palm above the floor and mutters a
          quick incantation. A small shoot APPEARS and SPROUTS FAT    
          PODS. Vidalia squeezes the salve from a pod and covers      
          Perseus' wound.                                             
          The wound bulges, then squirms deeper into Perseus.         
          Perseus shoots up, clutching his chest. Vidalia gently      
          lays him down.                                              
          Perseus gags. A VIPER WRIGGLES from his throat and          
          slithers away with the fat lump of infection in its         
          stomach.                                                    

                         VIDALIA

          Surviving Lotophagi chew on the bones of the fallen. One
          reaches hungrily for an Alkali Lotus in the sand, but
          suddenly the petals blacken and curl. The creature,
          spooked, sniffs the air.
          All at once, the Lotophagi age years in seconds and keel
          over, dead. The cause: Set the Void glides over,
          surveying the battlefield.

          stucco and thatch. DOORS and SHUTTERS CREAK shut as they

          The Skolothians have suffered more
          than their share in this war. The

          It's no wonder they shy away from

          Perseus looks ahead, where the Expedition is parting        
          company with the Djinn Raiders. only one of the Djinn is    
          staying -- SHAIKH SULEIMAN, a veiled priest.

          They're witches in the form of
          Strix. Not a pleasant sight, a                              
          Strix. They have powerful magic                             
          and dreadful habits. Baby-eaters,
          among other things.
          (off Perseus' shock)
          But they owe me a favor. When the
          war broke out, they lent their
          power to men against the Gods in                            
          exchange for infant sacrifice.
          Tiamat struck them blind for their
          treachery. When they came for                               
          help, I fashioned them an
          artificial eye, for their Second                            
          Sight.

          WHISPERS. Shaikh Suleiman moves toward Perseus. The
          WHISPERING comes from behind his veil. He pulls a
          GLEAMING BRONZE SICKLE from his cloak. The priest, blade
          poised, stands over the sleeping Perseus.
          OUT OF THE DARKNESS runs Spyros, his harpoon raised for a
          strike.

          Perseus jolts awake. He reaches for his sword, but has       
          none. Spyros struggles to his feet to start another          
          charge.
          Suleiman raises his hand and freezes Spyros in his           
          position. The Shaikh's veil has fallen, revealing his        
          frightening countenance: scaled skin of charred wood;        
          eyes like slots in a furnace. Perseus listens to the         

          WHISPERING.

                         PERSEUS
          Spyros, he means me no harm.                                 
          The Shaikh lowers his hand: Spyros falls into the dirt.
          The Shaikh pulls his veil over his face. He kneels
          before Perseus, head bowed.

                         PERSEUS
          I hear you and I understand you.
          But I don't know how.

                         SHAIKH SULEIMAN

          75.

                         PERSEUS
          You are praying to me? There must
          be a mistake.
          The Shaikh proffers the gleaming bronze sickle which has
          a zig-zag, LIGHTNING BOLT PATTERN engraved on the blade,
          honoring Zeus.

                         PERSEUS
          An offering'? I thank you and
          take it humbly, as agift from a
          friend, not an offering.
          He takes the weapon and bows his head, surprising the
          Shaikh.

                         SHAIKH SULEIMAN
          Tuj patir esti ho theos kosmosr.

                         PERSEUS
          You honor my father? You honor
          Spyros?

                         SHAIKH SULEIMAN
          Ho Zeus Patir... Zeus...
          Perseus reacts, taken aback to hear it from this             
          mysterious stranger.

          EXT. MOIRAI PILLAR - NIGHT

          The Expedition ascends the sheer pinnacle via rain-slick     
          stairs and GROANING ROPE BRIDGES.

          EXT. SUMMIT OF MOIRAI PILLAR - SUNRISE

          In a morning fog, the Expedition enters a circle of FREE-
          STANDING MONOLITHS white with bird crap. All around:
          regurgitated food, shredded garments and tiny human baby
          bones.
          A FLAP of WINGS and suddenly perched atop the stones are                
          the NORN SISTERS: URD, VERDANDI, and SKULD -- human-                    
          sized owls with the gray faces of old crones                (Strix).    
          Each has one central EYE SOCKET; they share one              
          ARTIFICIAL ORB. The Strix toss the Eye between them and      
          pop it in to study the arrivals.                             

                         URD
          (low, hoot-owl)

                         AMOUN
          Likewise, Urd. I seek your
          counsel.

                         VERDANDI

                         (SHRIEKING)
          You want us to tell you about
          Leviathan.

                         AMOUN
          You know already... of course.                               

                         VERDANDI
          We know this -- the Kraken cannot
          be defeated.

                         SKULD

                         (PIERCING)                                                   
          You've wasted a journey. I trust
          it was not a taxing one.
          The Sisters CACKLE HORRIBLY. Skuld SWOOSHES down. Icos
          and Krikor, terrified, hit the deck. Skuld tosses the
          Eye back to Urd. Perseus watches with growing
          irritation.

                         AMOUN
          Surely the beast from the sea has
          some weakness. You owe me this
          answer at least.

                         URD
          The Sisters owe nothing to you or
          any Man!
          She tosses the Eye to Verdandi, who focuses her attention
          on Perseus.

                         VERDANDI
          There's something wrong with that
          one. I don't like having him
          here.

                         SKULD
          Let me take a look.
          Verdandi tosses the Eye to Skuld. Perseus leaps and          
          snags the Eye out of mid-air. The Strix SCREECH.             
          Perseus goes to the precipice.                               

                         PERSEUS
          Tell us what we want to know or
          your Eye has seen its last.

                         CONTINUED:
          The Norns flap their wings and puff up their feathers.

                         TO AMOUN:

                         AMOUN
          No, good Sisters... the son of
          Zeus.
          The Strix react in horror and all land on the same
          monolith.

                         PERSEUS
          Since you cannot see, let me tell
          you what's about to happen. I'm
          about to throw this evil Eye to
          the rocks far below. I fear its
          journey will be a taxing one.
          The members of the Expedition are impressed; Vidalia,
          too: the young demigod shows growing leadership. The
          Strix are panicked --

                         URD
          We can't tell you. We don't dare
          betray Tiamat again.

                         VERDANDI
          She sees all! Her touch is felt
          in every evil thing!                                      

                         SKULD
          A second offense and she will

                         PERSEUS
          You don't have to tell us the
          secret. But you will have to live
          as blind as she made you.

                         SKULD
          No! Give us the Eye and we'll
          tell.

                         PERSEUS
          Tell me first. If I like the
          answer, you get your Eye.

          You know the answer sure as you
          already knew the question.
          The Norn Sisters confer, enclosed in a curtain of wings.

                         THEN --

          Leviathan can be destroyed...

                         VERDANDI
          The beast has one weakness.

                         SPYROS
          Tell us now!
          The Strix are torn, frightened. Finally --

                         URD
          The stare of Medusa. No creature
          can look directly in her eyes and
          still survive.
          The answer hangs in the silence of the stunned
          Expedition.

                         AMOUN
          They're lying, Perseus.
          Perseus studies the Sisters, weighing his response.

                         PERSEUS
          I believe them.
          (tosses the Eye high)
          Here's your second sight.
          Verdandi launches and catches it in her beak, pops it in
          her socket.

                         PERSEUS
          (to the Norns)
          And Medusa! Where does she abide?

                         SKULD
          In Tartaros, beyond the frozen
          Tethys Sea. Only Charon's ferry                             
          dare challenge the ice.

          Perseus stares into the black entrance.

                         DRACO
          Don't go in there, Perseus. It's
          a trap.

                         VERDANDI
          No. We have guaranteed the rage
          of Tiamat with this revelation...

          The Shaikh holds a branch near his eyes until the end        
          bursts into flame and hands it to Perseus, who disappears
          into the blackness.

          INT. VAULT OF THE NORN SISTERS - DAY

          Perseus fights through cobwebs and hanging roots. The        
          torch REVEALS piles of armor, bones, and broken weapons.     
          A round edge catches his eye. He pulls it free -- A
          SHIELD, TARNISHED AND DENTED. Unsure why it attracted
          him, he shoulders it and leaves.

          EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT

          The STORM RAGES around a FLEET OF SHIPS, manned by
          armored CREWMEN, that rises and falls on hundred-foot
          mountains of water.

          EXT. DECK OF LEAD SHIP - NIGHT

          The FIRST MATE shouts to the stalwart CAPTAIN.

                         FIRST MATE
          Captain, the storm is too great!

                         CAPTAIN
          Joppa is under siege! King
          Kepheus needs these supplies!
          Something huge breaches the surface. The captain squints
          through the rain... and sees the GIGANTIC SCUTED TAIL of
          Leviathan. IT GOES RIGHT PAST THEM, miraculously leaving
          the fleet untouched.
          But then -- they HEAR a sound BIGGER than the typhoon.
          The dark sky gets darker as an ENORMOUS BLACK SHAPE
          appears behind the Fleet, bearing down on them at
          impossible speed --
          TIAMAT'S PALACE-GALLEON so dwarfs the Fleet that it PLOWS    
          THROUGH the other ships without noticing, obliterating       
          them in seconds, sending all hands to the depths.

          A bleak shore. A boulder jetty juts into the cold pewter
          sea and fades into the fog. Chunks of ice bob on the
          lapping waves.

          The Expedition, miserably wet, waits for passage around a
          campfire on the frigid beach. Perseus, polishing the
          shield he got from the Norns, looks to Amoun, who sits
          smoking.

          Medusa was a tender young woman
          once -- a mortal creature of such
          rare beauty as to tempt even the
          Gods. One night, on the road
          home, she caught the eye of the
          God of Deserts and Entropy -- Set
          the Void.

          FLASHBACK - EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

          A stunning beauty, YOUNG MEDUSA, carries a water pitcher.    
          Suddenly, frightened, she turns, sees something, drops       
          the pitcher and runs.                                        

          AMOUN (V.0.)
          She hastened to hallowed ground,
          thinking the Goddess Tiamat would
          protect her in her temple. But
          the God Set followed.
          A SHADOW passes swiftly over the shattered pitcher, in    
          pursuit.                                                  

          INT. TEMPLE OF TIAMAT - NIGHT                             

          In the center of the dark hall, SET overtakes Medusa,        L.
          forcing her down.

          His cloak ripples as SHAPES PUSH THROUGH THE SPECTRAL
          FOLDS -- the girl's reaching fingers, her screaming face.

          AMOUN (V.0.)
          He ravished her on the cold floor.
          She felt the heartless passion of
          a God.

          SAME SCENE - LATER                                           
          Alone, Medusa crawls with bloody fingernails toward the      
          altar.                                                       

          AMOUN (V.0.)
          Despoiled and broken in the shadow
          of Tiamat's altar, she prayed for
          comfort and pleaded for courage...
          But the Goddess of the Deep
          regarded Medusa with disdain. The
          prayers of such a frail and filthy
          mortal angered Tiamat.
          A bust of Tiamat chiseled from black crystal opens her       
          BLAZING eyes, THROWING A LONG SHADOW OF MEDUSA onto the      
          wall.                                                        

          AMOUN (V.0.)                                                 
          The Goddess twisted young Medusa                             
          into a loathsome new thing...                                
          The contorting shadow shows the transformation. Legs
          twist and snap and become a slithering tail. Snake heads
          wriggle from her skull.

          Dark, hot and loud: PIPES, STEAM, GEARS and PISTONS.
          CHARON, a grizzled old sea captain, shovels coal and
          slams the furnace closed. He walks past his "crew"          --
          MECHANICAL OARSMEN of tarnished brass, rowing tirelessly.
          Charon dons furs, then climbs up to --

          In a small space among the stores, Vidalia circles
          Perseus, whose eyes are shut. Suddenly, she sweeps his
          legs out. He lands hard.

                         VIDALIA
          She's got a tail and she'll use it
          just like that.
          Perseus opens his eyes.

                         VIDALIA
          Keep your eyes shut! Open them
          with Medusa and it will be your
          last look.

          They tie on blindfolds and feel their way into the
          Temple.

          EXT. TEMPLE OF TARTAROS - LAVA FIELD - DAY

          Nessus and Ixion arrive. Ixion's mace catches Krikor,       
          flinging him to his death in an open lava vent. Icos
          CRIES OUT for his friend and charges in. Ixion smashes
          him to oblivion.
          Thad, enraged, races at Nessus, but the Centaur dodges      
          the massive Praetorian and kicks him in the chest,          
          killing him.

                         CONTINUED:
          Nessus charges Amoun. Amoun throws a handful of sand,
          which becomes a hail of STEEL-BARBED DARTS in midair,      C
          which lash the Centaur's flesh.
          Tamburlane rolls under the beast and fires his weapon.      
          Nessus hurls the monster-hunter against a boulder and       
          goes for him when --                                        
          -- Shaikh Suleiman jumps between them. His scimitar         
          slashes but is ripped from his hands. The Shaikh BOWS       

          HIS HEAD.
          Nessus' mace shatters Shaikh Suleiman's head of charred     
          wood. BLUE FIRE shoots out his neck, ENVELOPING THE         
          CENTAUR. The burning Centaur crumples, dead.                
          Ixion SLAMS his mace down, just missing Amoun. Suddenly,    
          Vidalia's sling-bullets slice his flesh. Ixion turns and    
          leaps at Vidalia.                                           

          INT. TEMPLE OF TARTAROS - DAY                               

          In the subterranean temple, we HEAR Ixion landing above;    
          dust rains into the cavern. SUNLIGHT angles through         
          holes in the roof.                                          
          Draco, Spyros and Perseus move blindly through the          
          debris. CORPSES everywhere, faces frozen in stone           
          screams.                                                    
          The men can't see it, but one wall suddenly frames a
          silhouette of MEDUSA: HAIR OF HISSING SNAKES atop a
          woman's torso, the body of a mammoth reptile.
          WE SEE only GLIMPSES of Medusa as she slides through the
          shadows. Her forked tongue tastes the air.
          CUTTING BETWEEN Spyros, Perseus and Draco, moving
          silently on opposite sides of the sanctuary.
          OUR VIEW of Draco is suddenly BLOCKED by Medusa -- she      
          coils around Draco without touching him. He HEARS the       
          RASP of SCALES ON STONE.                                    

                         DRACO
          I hear her, Perseus. She's near!
          Her torso behind him, she RATTLES her tail in front.
          Draco spins and slices the air. The RATTLE stops. Draco
          waits, confused.

          (from across the

                         ROOM)
          Draco, be wary --                                           !
          Medusa gingerly tugs Draco's blindfold free. Draco sees               
          the tail before him. Unthinking, he instinctively spins               
          and looks.
          Medusa's face is inches from Draco's. His muscles lock                
          and his flesh hardens to scabrous stone, emanating SMOKY              
          GAS. Medusa breathes in the vapors ecstatically.                      
          AT THAT MOMENT a hole blasts through the roof of the                  
          cavern as Ixion crashes down in a cloud of dirt -- dead,              
          a gaping wound in his head.                                           
          Medusa regards her fallen minion in horror, loosing a        

          MOURNFUL SIGH.                                               
          Spyros HEARS HER and blindly hurls his harpoon toward the
          sound.
          WITH THE HARPOON as its sails cleanly through slanted        
          pillars and debris, WHOOSH, WHOOSH, until it comes
          through a tiny opening and --
          THUDS into Medusa's body! The Monster SCREAMS, whipping      
          about. She tries to pull the harpoon out, but can't.         

          SPYROS                                                      (O.S.)
          Perseus, I think she's hit!

          Where?

          SPYROS                                                      (O.S.)
          Near to the left!
          Medusa's enraged attention shifts back and forth between
          the VOICES of the two men, deciding which to attack.
          Perseus tries to control his shakes, jumping at every                 
          sound, head swiveling blindly. From a distance --                     

          SPYROS                                                      (O.S.)
          Perseus... I don't hear her near
          me!
          Perseus steps back and BUMPS into a column.

          Medusa is coiled around the column, harpoon stuck in her     
          bloody side. She CRAWLS DOWN toward Perseus.                 
          Perseus against the column. FROM THE TOP OF FRAME,           
          Medusa's fingers reach for his blindfold. She pulls the      
          knot and the blindfold falls.                                
          Eyes closed, Perseus slashes the air, sweeping the sickle    
          about until it SMASHES into the column -- BRINNNGI The       
          SOUND ECHOES, then FADES.                                    
          Perseus waits and listens. Then, PING!, one drop of
          Medusa's blood lands on his shield.                          
          Perseus opens his eyes and peers into his shield. In the     
          reflection on the bronze, he SEES: Movement. Snakes.         
          Searing eyes... Medusa!
          Eyes shut, he windmills his weapon above him. Medusa's       
          talons DEFLECT the blade and the sickle flies from his
          grip.                                                        
          Perseus scrambles for it on his hands and knees. Behind
          him, Medusa SLITHERS down the column and heads for           
          Perseus.
          Perseus reaches the sickle. He lifts his shield up in
          front of him and sees Medusa's reflection growing closer
          behind him.
          He shuts his eyes and wheels around, blade sweeping. A       
          soft F-THMMP as the blade slices through something...
          SILENCE. Perseus turns away and opens his eyes, looking
          into the shield. Still, Medusa looms behind him!             
          But suddenly, Medusa's head THUDS and rolls on the
          ground. The headless reflection topples over, dead.         r-

          THE AFTERMATH: the survivors -- Vidalia, Amoun, Mongke,
          and Tamburlane -- take mournful stock of their losses.
          Mongke sees something, smiles and SWEARS in his language.
          They all turn to see:
          Perseus and Spyros, spent and saddened, stand at the top
          of the Temple steps. Perseus grasps the canvas sack.
          Now it holds Medusa's head, which bloodies the whole bag
          and sends a crimson drip to the stones. There is still       
          movement in there -- squirming serpents.

          The relief fleet is lost.
          Monsters gather outside our walls.
          Soon I won't be able to keep my
          own people at bay. And still, no
          word from the Expedition.
          Kepheus raises a spyglass to survey the view beyond the    
          city walls.

          Jove the Father is another name by

          Yes, Joppa... once the most sacred
          site in the worship of Jove.

          The Expedition passes through deep woods. Spyros and
          Perseus ride side by side.

                         PERSEUS
          Father, we've seen much on this
          journey we cannot hold in our
          hands. Yet these things are real
          enough. At each turn, we find
          monsters and Gods.

                         SPYROS
          Yes, the evidence is everywhere
          once we leave our island. That's
          why I so rarely leave. These
          Gods, what do you make of them?

                         PERSEUS                                                    
          As you always said, they're petty,                         
          vengeful... and dangerous.                                 

                         SPYROS
          Yes, as bad as men.
          (as Perseus smiles)
          And would you have that sort guide
          your life?

                         PERSEUS
          No. Men must be accountable to
          themselves. Otherwise we serve
          poor masters.

          Riding behind them, Vidalia (paler and more ephemeral
          than ever) is suddenly alert. She peers into the woods,
          agitated. Then she EXCLAIMS SOFTLY, dismounts and runs
          into the woods.

          her.

          I know this place...
          Suddenly, she hurries to the trunk of an ancient tree.

          instinct. When the time comes,
          you'll know how to use it.                                   
          She takes his head in her hands, pressing her forehead to
          his. Gently, her fingers slip into his mind. A TEAR
          runs down her cheek.

                         PERSEUS' POV
          In QUICK FLASHES: A white lid opens to a black eye.
          Reflected in the eye -- clouds roll over a stormy sky.

                         THEN:
          Feathered WHITE WINGS beat the air. Then:
          Racing over the surface of a blue SEA, and then down,
          down, to SMASH THROUGH the surface, into the depths.

          INT. TEMPLE OF TARTAROS - NIGHT

          Tiamat and Set the Void stand over the corpse of Medusa.
          Baby snakes and beetles spill out of her neatly-sliced
          neck. Tiamat is furious.

                         TIAMAT
          How did he do this? They were not                            
          even to reach Medusa.

          Fate has begun to shift. The                                 
          future ripples with uncertainty.                             

                         TIAMAT
          Spare me your pitiful maundering!
          There is no Fate beyond my actions
          and no uncertainty in the face of
          my will.

          He is ignorant of the rules, or
          unconcerned with them.

          Set absorbs her tirade, stung.

          I am your ally. That is all you
          need to know. Bloody your hands
          and rid me of this pestilence.

                         SET
          You have liberated me, my Queen.
          Watch as your desires are quickly
          satisfied.

          INT. UNDERGROUND SHRINE - SUNRISE                          

          Perseus jolts awake. He reaches for Vidalia, but she is
          gone. Amoun stands over him, his manner severe.

                         PERSEUS
          Where is she?

          This is my fault. I've permitted                           
          .this infatuation to progress too
          far.

                         PERSEUS
          It is not yours to permit,                                 
          Master... with respect.                                    
          Vidalia comes down into the shrine, her apron full of      
          berries.                                                   

                         VIDALIA
          Look what I've found for us --                             
          She startles when she sees Amoun, dropping the berries.    

                         AMOUN

                         (TO VIDALIA)
          Have you forgotten Perseus is                              
          engaged to the Princessa?

          Both Amoun and Vidalia are surprised.

                         AMOUN
          If by some miracle you survive
          this encounter with Leviathan, the                          
          hand of the Princessa is your

          Are you so selfish? Would you                               
          risk everything for the foolish
          love of --
          A BLAST of HOT DESERT WIND blows into the Shrine. The       
          berries turn brown and shrivel.                             
          Amoun grabs his chest. Perseus and Vidalia crumple in       
          agony.
          SET THE VOID COMES INTO THE SHRINE. Amoun tries to          
          invoke a spell, but Set touches his chest and Amoun         
          splits open.                                                
          Set points at Vidalia, slamming her into the earthen        
          wall. The God is there in an instant, strangling her.       
          Perseus staggers up and swings his sickle, but Set          
          points, ripping the weapon from Perseus' hand. It flies     
          across the shrine and sinks with a CLANG into the tablet    
          that once held Vidalia's true name.                         
          Still choking Vidalia, Set grabs Perseus' arm. Perseus      
          doubles over, paralyzed by the God's touch. Suffocating,    
          Vidalia FADES MORE.                                         
          Immobilized, Perseus watches her struggle and searches

          Perseus rises. He cocks his arm and clobbers Set with an
          ear-splitting CRACK OF THUNDER and a sparking BURST OF
          WHITE ENERGY. Set drops Vidalia and lurches back,
          aghast. BLACK BLOOD shoots from his mouth.
          Perseus, his face contorted in rage, chokes Set. The        
          God's body SPASMS and deforms in DEATH THROES.

          Perseus slams the God down in a ghastly heap, which
          liquefies into thick black blood. It seeps into the
          sandy floor, leaving an ugly stain.                          
          Perseus rushes to embrace Vidalia, who is more evanescent
          than ever. They look with pain at the remains of Amoun.      

                         VIDALIA
          I'm so sorry, Perseus.
          A look of brutal, determined resolve grows in Perseus'       
          face.

                         (IN AWE)
          You faced a God in lethal
          combat... and vanquished him.
          Never have I heard of such a
          thing.
          He looks at her, mind racing, then lifts her as he           
          stands.

                         PERSEUS
          We must go quickly now.
          He pulls the sickle from the marble with a BRINNG! The
          light flashes off Zeus' LIGHTNING BOLT PATTERN on the
          blade.

                         PERSEUS
          The combat has just begun.

          it may be an illusion, but the Idol seems to have taken      
          on the most subtle of life. It does not move, but it

          A GONG sounds ONCE in the night. Repheus sleeps fitfully
          on a divan by the bed of the desiccated Cassiopeia.

          INT. ANDROMEDA'S CHAMBERS - NIGHT

          The GONG sounds again. CLOSE ON Andromeda's tortured
          face staring down at the city -- too CLOSE to see exactly
          where she is.

          EXT. THE BASILICA - BACK GATE - NIGHT

          The GONG sounds a THIRD TIME. Peshet opens a lock and
          sets the heavy gate ajar. She looks at the dagger in her
          palm and hurries inside.
          After a moment, four CLOAKED REBELS slip through the open

          Peshet enters, dagger held at her back. No sign of
          Andromeda.

                         PESHET
          My lady? Princess Andromeda?
          She goes deeper into the rooms, then GASPS, looking off,

                         ALARMED --
          Andromeda stands on the balustrade of her balcony,
          preparing to jump to her death. She turns at the sound,      
          teetering.                                                   
          Peshet rushes to her but stops when Andromeda raises a       
          knife of her own. Peshet is shocked, not afraid.

          My lady, please --

                         ANDROMEDA
          I was afraid, Peshet. Afraid to                              
          understand that the fate of so                               
          many could rest with me.

          they may live.

          She turns, but Peshet leaps and grabs her, pulling her to    
          safety. They fall to the floor, both daggers CLATTERING      
          on the marble.                                               

                         PESHET
          I won't allow it, my lady. Today,                            
          you are only a Princess. One day
          your people may need a Queen ready

          Peshet leads Andromeda out.

                         ANDROMEDA
          We must get to my mother and
          father.
          A VOICE from the darkness:

          AGENOR (O.S.)
          Your father is dead and your
          mother has been relieved of her                              
          suffering.                                                   
          The four Cloaked Rebels step into the light. Agenor          
          wipes his bloody dagger on his cloak as all four advance.

                         AGENOR
          The Princessa is coming with us.
          She has a rendezvous to keep.
          Peshet WHIPS HER DAGGER through the air; it THUDS into
          the neck of the First Rebel, killing him on his feet.
          Before he can fall, Peshet leaps to him and pulls out her    
          knife. She plants herself in front of Andromeda.             

                         PESHET
          Come and get her.                                            
          Agenor and the other two circle Peshet. She moves with       
          feline agility, but is separated from the Princess. To       
          the Second Rebel --

          Take the Princess -- alive!                                  
          The Second Rebel circles around Peshet toward Andromeda.

          Run, Princess! Save yourself.                                
          Peshet leaps on the Third Rebel.                             
          Andromeda runs away from the Second Rebel, who easily        
          closes the gap.

          He grabs her in a bear hug from behind. She spins, tiny
          within his massive arms, and is suddenly facing him. He
          JOLTS in surprise, Andromeda's knife in his belly. He
          falls on her, dead.
          Peshet wins her struggle with the Third Rebel, sinking
          her dagger in him. She GASPS. Agenor has thrust his
          blade into her ribs. She totters and COUGHS -- deep and
          bloody. Peshet falls against the wall.
          Andromeda WAILS at the sight. She is pinned beneath the      
          dead weight of the Second Rebel, unable to move. Agenor      
          finishes off Peshet and turns to the Princess.

          Vidalia is almost transparent. The Expedition reacts in      
          shock to what they see.

          FROM BEHIND THE GROUP
          They're on a shelf above the wide, flat basin that lies      
          outside Joppa. A limitless INHUMAN ARMY -- Centaurs,         
          Minotaurs, Monsters of every stripe -- fills the plain,      
          right up to the city walls.

          battle are ranks of fifteen-foot AUTOMATA (CLOCKWORK         
          SOLDIERS). OPERATORS feverishly work the mechanisms of       
          the steel soldiers, which flex their artificial limbs and
          weigh their massive weapons.

          Mongke and Tamburlane exchange words. For the first

          The winch platform SLAMS into the cliff face, pulled by
          Leviathan.

          PERSEUS' DIVING POV
          Exactly the image he saw when Vidalia first planted the
          spell in his mind -- down, down toward the dark sea.

          BACK TO SCENE
          Perseus and Pegasus arrive a moment before the crashing
          winch. Perseus dives off with the bloody Medusa bag in
          hand. With his free hand, he catches the chain just
          ahead of the winch and goes under.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          112.

          EXT. UNDERSEA - DAY

          Leviathan hurtles downward. Andromeda flails, bound to
          the chain.

                         FAR ABOVE
          Perseus grips both the chain and the bag in his hand.        
          Leviathan spirals on, but THE WINCH CATCHES ON A REEF and    
          the chain SNAPS! Andromeda, suddenly separated from the      
          monster, sinks, weighted by her shackles.                    
          Perseus, swimming with the raw power of a porpoise, dives    
          after her, but loses his grip on the bag. Desperate, he      
          looks back and forth: Andromeda, the sack -- both
          sinking. Perseus goes after the sack.                        
          Leviathan realizes it has lost the Princess. Huge eyes
          darting, it spots Andromeda and surges down after her.
          Andromeda, drowning, passes out. Tiny bubbles leak from      
          her nose. Leviathan swims down to her, eye as big as her     
          entire body.
          The wreck of a SUNKEN WHALER rests on the ocean floor.
          The Medusa sack FALLS INTO VIEW and catches on a harpoon
          wedged in the deck. Perseus appears, snags the sack and
          is about to kick upward. On impulse, he grabs the
          harpoon.
          Leviathan opens its huge jaws. Andromeda is sucked           
          toward the maw.
          Perseus swims upward toward Leviathan's tail. Perseus        
          concentrates -- a sparking BURST OF WHITE ENERGY shoots      
          through his forearm to the harpoon in his grip.
          LIGHTNING CRACKLES and BOILS the water. He plunges the
          harpoon in the Kraken's tail --
          -- at the same moment Leviathan inhales the unconscious
          Andromeda.
          Contact -- an ELECTRIC FLASH-POINT FLARES and a charge       
          races up Leviathan's spine. Jolted, the monster spits        
          Andromeda out.                                               
          The Kraken twists to lock its enraged gaze on Perseus.       
          Perseus shuts his eyes and yanks Medusa's head from the
          sack. Medusa's hellish eyes ignite channels of boiling
          energy into Leviathan's enormous eyeballs -- hardening
          them to boiled eggs, then rocky spheres.

          113.

                         CONTINUED:
          The monster thrashes, tries to turn -- but unbending
          stone races its length, freezing the gargantuan curves --
          the scuted tail locks mid-flail into a final, permanent
          hook.
          Dead in the water, the grotesque mass sinks like a           
          mountain range, picking up speed as it plunges into the      

                         ABYSS                                                       --                                                           
          Perseus must swim like a God to snatch Andromeda from the    
          downward tug. The stone Kraken barely misses them as it      

                         DROPS --                                                     
          -- and CRASHES in a cloud of silt, SHAKING THE OCEAN
          FLOOR like an earthquake. A CRACK opens in the seabed
          and sucks back the silt. The trench deepens and streaks
          away across the seabed, swallowing all the water above
          it, creating a giant opening to the sky.

          EXT. TIAMAT'S PALACE-GALLEON                                (OCEAN)                                                     - PROW - DAY     

          Tiamat's face contorts, sensing her beloved Leviathan is
          dead. She turns at the sound of GHASTLY CREAKING -- the
          immense length of the galleon buckles into a hole in the
          ocean. As the towering masts drop below wave-level,
          Tiamat raises her arms to the sky --

                         TIAMAT
          I damn you, Zeus! You will hear
          my curses forever in the crash of

                         SURF                                                        --
          Walls of water collapse, burying the Goddess, her ship,                      
          and her malediction deep in her realm. We HEAR a world-                      
          rocking ROAR, which booms off toward --                                      

          EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY

          Tiamat's Monster Army is DEAFENED by the BOOM, losing all    
          spirit with the unmistakable certainty that their Goddess    
          is gone.                                                     
          THE TIDE TURNS IN THE BATTLE as the Joppans and their        
          steel allies, the Automata, wade into the ranks of           
          creatures.                                                   
          Mongke and Tamburlane, in the center of the battle, find
          the opposition turning tail. They roar and lift their
          weapons high, surviving yet another fight. Spyros,
          bloodied but unbowed, smiles wide and sits down in the
          mud, exhausted.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          114.

          EXT. OCEAN SURFACE - DAY

          The water stills. The sea calms. No sign of Perseus or
          Andromeda. WIND and QUIET...
          CHOOM! Perseus surfaces with Andromeda in his arms,          

          GASPING FOR AIR.

          EXT. CLIFFS OF JOPPA - DAY

          The onlookers rejoice.

          EXT. OCEAN SURFACE - DAY

          BACK WITH Perseus and Andromeda. He looks at her             
          lifeless countenance in agony -- has he failed again as      
          he did with Anteros the fisherman??                          
          Distraught, his muscles go taut around Andromeda, and a      
          short powerful burst of electric energy shoots from his
          arms into her still body -- SHE JOLTS TO LIFE!               
          Movement! Breath! Color returns to her face. Perseus,
          too, breathes again, relieved.
          For the first time since the start of the adventure, they
          find themselves alone, holding each other.

                         PERSEUS
          Hello.
          (as she smiles,

                         RELIEVED)
          Are you all right?
          She takes a moment, doing an inventory. Finally, she
          nods.

                         ANDROMEDA
          I think I am.
          He smiles. She'll never know how close they came to          
          oblivion.

                         ANDROMEDA
          Are you ready to become a king?
          His expression is kind, but unmistakable. "No." She          
          accepts that, rueful.

                          

                         PERSEUS
          Are you ready to become a queen?

          115.

                         CONTINUED:
          She thinks about it, her face beginning to light with
          confidence.

                         ANDROMEDA
          Yes. Yes, I am.

                         PERSEUS
          Then you're ready to go home.
          Perseus raises one arm. The-AIR reverberates to a LOUD      
          BEATING OF WINGS. Andromeda looks up in wonder.
          Pegasus appears out of the sun's glare, gracefully          
          alighting on the water. Perseus helps Andromeda up and
          then climbs on behind her.
          Pegasus takes off. TILT UP WITH them until they are lost    
          from sight.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          EXT. BLUE SKY AND WHITE CLOUDS - DAY

          Black smoke RISES to dirty the perfect sky. TILT DOWN

                         TO:

          EXT. SACRED GROUND - DAY

          The Sacred Ground of Joppa in the verdant hills, above      
          the sea, is so beautiful it might be mistaken for           
          Olympos.
          TWO FUNERAL PYRES burn. The citizens of Joppa, by the       
          thousands, commend King Kepheus and Queen Cassiopeia to     
          the afterlife.                                              
          MOVING OVER THE CROWD, WE PUSH THROUGH the flame to find    
          the new ruler of Joppa. Mournful, but cloaked in regal      
          dignity and strength -- QUEEN ANDROMEDA.                    

                         CUT TO:

          A DISTANT POV OF THE QUEEN
          The ceremony and the heavenly setting.

                         PERSEUS
          Perseus views the scene from a nearby hill. Behind him,
          Pegasus waits patiently, grazing the grass. Until --

                         CONTINUED:
          -- the equine suddenly WHINNIES and REARS UP. Just as
          quickly, Pegasus goes silent and BOWS DOWN. Perseus          
          looks in that direction, to find --
          ZEUS the Prime, God of Gods, an eagle perched on his arm.
          He couldn't look more imposing.

                         ZEUS
          Am I to understand you do not
          intend to make this union with the
          Queen Andromeda?

                         PERSEUS
          Yes.

                         ZEUS
          Despite my will and intention that
          you do so?

                         PERSEUS
          Yes.

                         ZEUS
          Would you choose to condemn Men,
          your own people, to suffer more of
          this devastating War?

                         PERSEUS
          I have no people. You have
          stranded me between realms,
          neither man nor God.

                         ZEUS

                         (STERNLY)
          Do you reproach Zeus?

                         PERSEUS
          No. I thank you... Father.
          Zeus, mighty God, reacts to the word. His expression
          softens and he looks on Perseus with growing pride.

                         PERSEUS
          You have freed me. I will not be
          a pawn for Men or Gods.

                         ZEUS
          Does that absolve you suddenly of
          your responsibilities?

                         PERSEUS
          You've made me understand that my
          responsibility is to myself. So
          it is with us all.

                         CONTINUED:

                         PERSEUS

                         (INTIMATELY)
          You've put me to a great test. In
          the midst of it, I found the
          courage in my heart to defy Gods.
          I do not know how much of that
          comes from you, Father... and how
          much from my Mother, who I never
          knew.
          Zeus starts, subtly, at the mention of Queen Danae.

                         PERSEUS
          It matters not. Whatever the
          source, I are only grateful.
          He looks off toward the funeral pyres and the human
          throng.

                         PERSEUS
          This war will end the moment you
          choose for it to end... and Men
          agree. I think, perhaps, that is
          the free will that all realms
          share.
          Zeus looks at him, proud, yet wistful -- what an
          offspring, what a creation!

                         ZEUS
          What will you do, Man of free
          will?
          Perseus motions Pegasus forward, and swings up onto his
          back.

                         PERSEUS
          I'm going to find Vidalia.

                         ZEUS
          So... my Son, you will be a pawn
          for love?

                         PERSEUS

                         (LAUGHS)
          Yes, Father, gladly.
          Perseus spurs Pegasus and launches into the sky. And
          soars away.

          FADE OUT.

        EXT. MOUNTAIN RANGE - HELICOPTER SHOT - DAY

        An unparalleled set of sheer mountains -- part of the Colorado
        Rockies. The peaks rise a challenging half mile and more out
        of the valley -- wind-whipped snow mists over the mountains
        like a low fog. The tranquility is broken as a helicopter
        BLASTS into view, fighting the wind as it heads for the center
        of it all.

        Our CREDITS fly us past and through this magnificent range.
        There are sky-piercing peaks that slope up to a narrow, high
        pinnacle -- and others that are steel, straight-up approaches
        to large plateaus. One of the mountains has a crystal lake on
        top -- with a waterfall that drains from it and exits from the
        middle of a mountain wall. Nearby, an abandoned cable ladder
        is bolted into the same wall, leading to the top.

        BACK IN THE HELICOPTER

        We can see a man sitting in its doorway, looking out --

        INT/EXT HELICOPTER - BINOCULAR POV

        The glasses scan systematically, slowly -- to us, it looks
        like nothing more than a field of gray and white.

                      Nothing yet.

        EXT. THE MOUNTAINS - LONG SHOT

        The helicopter now circles this tallest mountain -- "The
        Tower", separated from a lower but equally formidable peak by
        a chasm of two hundred feet -- that drops 3,500 feet below.

        INSIDE HELICOPTER - FRANK AND MAGGIE

        Spotter FRANK NEWELL (50s) scans the mountain wall.  MAGGIE
        DEIGHAN (30s) expertly pilots the helicopter through the storm
        winds. Both wear orange jackets identifying themselves as
        members of the Rocky Mountain Park Rescue Team.

                                        FRANK
                      Wait a minute -- there's Hal.
                            (beat)
                      And his date.

        BINOCULAR POV - A LEDGE

        that's part of the smaller peak. HAL TUCKER (30s) and his 
        "date", SUSAN COLLINS (20s), are decked out in climbing gear.  
        Hal's aplomb suggests he's a veteran climber -- Susan's
        worried look shows she isn't. Hal and Susan huddle together,
        both cold, but okay. Hal has a makeshift splint wrapped
        around his lower leg, and a slow burning flare in one hand.

        INSIDE HELICOPTER

        Frank lowers his glasses -- Maggie struggles with the wind.

                                        MAGGIE
                      How do they look?

        BINOCULAR POV - HAL AND SUSAN

        Hal, now aware of the copter, looks towards it, smiling -- and
        starts jerking off the flare.

                                        FRANK (O.S.)
                      He's signalling "okay."

                                        MAGGIE (O.S.)
                      Where's Gabe?

        The POV dips down -- there's somebody climbing below, in an
        orange rescue jacket.

                                        FRANK (O.S.)
                      Right where he's supposed to be.

        CLOSER ON THE CLIMBER

        This is GABE WALKER (30s). In spite of the cold and the snow,
        he's fearlessly, swiftly scaling the tower without safety
        lines, as if he's done it a hundred times. That's because he
        has done it a hundred times. This is what Gabe lives for.

        ON THE LEDGE

        Gabe, almost there, finds a fingertip-width handhold at arm's
        length -- grabbing it, he pulls himself up on the ledge with a
        move that's just a little tougher than chinning yourself on a
        doorjamb. Winded, Gabe slumps down next to the couple, and
        tries to light a cigarette. The lighter only sparks.

                                        HAL
                      Excuse me -- I know you're my
                      salvation, and all -- do you think you
                      could rescue us before your smoke
                      break?

        Hal pulls out a box of wooden matches and lights one Bogart
        style, one-handed with a thumbnail, cupping a hand to shield
        it against the wind. Gabe bends down for it -- a familiar
        routine. We know in a glance they've been friends for years.

                                        GABE
                      Maybe you could tell me why I am
                      rescuing you.

                                        HAL
                      Basically -- I've fallen down, and I
                      can't get up...

                                        GABE
                            (into radio)
                      Rescue One -- have located helpless
                      climber, please prepare idiot line
                      for transport, over --

        THE HELICOPTER dips down towards the ledge -- no way can it
        land there. Frank lowers a rescue wire to

        GABE

        who precariously swings out from the ledge to grab it -- the
        wire is just out of reach. Hal grabs the radio.

                                        HAL
                      Rescue One -- please remind me to tell
                      you about the time I hauled your hero
                      here down Mt. Huntington on my back,
                      over --

                                        MAGGIE (O.S.)
                            (through radio)
                      Hal, if I hear that story one more
                      time, I'm making you limp down the
                      entire three thousand feet, over --

        Gabe finally grabs the line, secures it to a heavy piton, and
        hammers it into the wall.

                                        GABE
                            (to Susan)
                      This guy showing you a good time?

        THE HELICOPTER

        swings over across to the facing mountain -- Maggie lands the
        copter, in spite of the winds, on a small plateau. Frank gets
        out to secure the wire -- there's now a lifeline spanning the
        chasm.

        ON THE LEDGE

        Gabe finishes anchoring the line in the rock -- he
        extinguishes his cigarette in the snow, and naturally, pockets
        the butt. Hal, propped up against the wall, expertly rigs a
        seat harness around his legs -- Susan helps him get part of it
        around his splint, and Gabe clips it to the line.

                                        GABE
                      Now, remember -- keep your arms and
                      legs within the vehicle at all
                      times --

                                        HAL
                            (laughing)
                      Fuck you --

        With that, Hal pulls himself hand-over-hand across the sloping
        line -- Hal makes a point of looking down --

        HAL'S POV -- THE DROP

        is vertigo defined. Thirty five hundred feet straight down.
        You could stack the World Trade Center towers on top of each
        other and they'd still be shorter than this mountain is high.
        However --

        HAL

        lets go of the overhead line and claps his hands to his face
        in mock horror -- he quickly whizzes down the last thirty feet
        of the line, where Frank catches him and pulls him out. Hal
        gets out of the harness, checks every stitch of it, signals
        thumbs-up, and sends it back.

        THE LEDGE

        Gabe, retrieves the harness on a small attachment line, and
        gives Susan a reassuring smile, but she's still, sensibly,
        very scared. Gabe recovers the harness, rigs Susan into it,
        and meticulously re-checks it.

                                        GABE
                      Ready?
                            (sees she's afraid)
                      Did he tell you about the time he
                      almost made it up Everest?

                                        SUSAN
                      He said you gave him a bad oxygen mask
                      --

                                        GABE
                      Well, if he's bored you with that
                      bullshit, then this has to be the best
                      part of a bad date. Right?

        Susan nervously laughs.

                                        GABE
                      Ready?

                                        SUSAN
                            (scared but tough)
                      Okay --

        Gabe starts to push her out on the line, but she grabs his arm
        in a panic.

                                        SUSAN
                      I can't --

        Susan starts to tilt her head down -- Gabe gently takes hold
        of her chin, turning her view up to face him.

                                        GABE
                      Yes you can.
                            (reassuring)
                      You can do it. Don't look down.  The
                      whole way across, don't look down.
                      Look at me. Just keep looking at me --
                      and you'll be okay.

        Susan looks at Gabe -- trying to be confident -- nods.

                                        GABE
                      Sure?

                                        SUSAN
                      Yeah.
                            (beat)
                      I have always depended on the kindness
                      of Rangers.

        Gabe grins and gently pushes her out. Susan tentatively pulls
        herself across -- then develops a rhythm, building speed --

        GABE'S POV - SUSAN

        inching away in the harness, looking more confident now --

        SUSAN'S POV - GABE

        signalling "OK" -- "you're doing fine" --

        SUSAN - ANOTHER ANGLE

        thirty feet out, going fine --

        INSERT -- A HARNESS CLIP

        holding the strap under Susan's left leg breaks --

        GABE'S POV - SUSAN

        The harness completely unravels all at once, its strands
        shoot through the clips -- what was a seat has become a trap
        door in half a second -- as the harness shoots out from under
        her, Susan falls but grabs the harness strand --

        HAL

        is helpless, and can only watch as

        SUSAN

        too scared to breathe, dangles on the remaining strand of what
        used to be the harness -- she sways from the wind and the jerk
        of her own weight, her grip loosens --

        INSERT - THE TOP CLIP

        that is supporting all of Susan's weight is being seriously
        tested -- a single knot in the harness has caught there, but
        it clearly won't last long --

        GABE

        moves back from the ledge.

                                        GABE
                            (loud, in control)
                      Hold on. I'm coming out to get you.

        Gabe gently pulls himself up on the line, crosses his ankles
        on it, and clips himself on with a three foot safety line.
        Gabe starts smoothly, quickly pulling himself out, but --

        SUSAN

        is in trouble -- the bobbing of the line from Gabe's weight
        and the winds are making her lose her grip even more --

        GABE

        urgently pulls himself along the line faster, trying not to
        shake the line. As he gets closer and closer to a terrified
        Susan, his eyes lock on hers --

                                        GABE
                      Keep looking at me. Hold on --

        WIDER ANGLE

        Gabe is only ten feet away from --

        SUSAN

        who stares at Gabe, petrified -- this focus is helping, but
        her strength is just about gone --

        INSERT - THE CLIP

        The knot has worked itself halfway through -- it doesn't make
        any difference how tight she holds on to the harness, the
        harness itself is letting go --

        ON GABE

        who knows it and pulls himself the rest of the way, a little
        faster, almost bridging the gap --

        ON SUSAN

        staring desperately at Gabe, holding on --

        INSERT - THE TOP CLIP

        that's keeping Susan alive surrenders the knot -- it passes
        through, and

        SUSAN

        falls --

        GABE

        deliberately lets go of the main line and launches himself
        at Susan --

        THEIR HANDS

        miss --

        ANGLE ON BOTH

        Gabe's three foot safety line pulls taut, testing the limits
        of the line above as it yanks him back --

        GABE'S POV - SUSAN

        is just out of reach -- her hand is still stretched out, her
        eyes still locked on

        GABE

        who can only look down, swaying helplessly on the wire as
        Susan's SCREAM starts --

        ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE

        Frank and Maggie look down in horror, but neither look as
        anguished as Hal --

        LONG SHOT - SUSAN

        falling -- falling -- falling -- looking very small against
        the vast mountain range --

        SUSAN'S POV - FALLING

        from this height takes the longest nineteen seconds you can
        imagine --

        GABE

        twists from his safety line, spinning helplessly -- he wants
        to, but can't, shut his eyes --

        GABE'S POV - THE CHASM

        Susan is gone. Her SCREAM, cut short, echoes -- the "safety"
        harness spirals down after her like a carefree bird --

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

        INT/EXT SMALL AIRLINER - GABE'S POV OUT WINDOW - DAY

        As the plane dips to land, Gabe can see a bird circling far
        below, over the same mountainous terrain.

        INT. SMALL AIRLINER - GABE

        sweating, panting, awake. It hasn't been that long since the
        accident -- a year, to be exact -- but he looks older. He
        looks as if he's watched Susan Collins drop at least one
        hundred times. Gabe reels himself in as a STEWARDESS hands him
        a glass of water.

                                        STEWARDESS
                      Take this.
                            (Gabe does)
                      Afraid of flying?

        Gabe shakes his head.

                                        GABE
                      Falling.

        INT. TERMINAL - DAY

        Gabe, with no luggage, is at the small airport's only car
        rental counter, doing the paperwork for a RENTAL AGENT.

                                        RENTAL AGENT
                      Midsize?

                                        GABE
                      Any size, any color, any model.

                                        RENTAL AGENT
                      How long will you be needing it?

                                        GABE
                            (flat)
                      Just under six hours.

                                        MAGGIE (O.S.)
                      You aren't wasting any time, are you?

        Gabe turns and looks at

        MAGGIE

        who is standing off to the side.

                                        MAGGIE
                      I knew you'd be coming by. Today.

        Gabe's happy to see her -- but at the same time, he isn't.
        She looks too good -- and she brings up quite a mixed bag of
        memories. Maggie carves on a smile.

                                        MAGGIE
                      If you're in that much of a hurry, why
                      don't you ride with me?

        INT. RESCUE HELICOPTER - DAY

        Maggie pilots the copter, heading out toward the mountain
        range. Gabe fiddles with some of the equipment inside. Both
        grope for a way to start the conversation.

                                        GABE
                      This is new...

                                        MAGGIE
                      It's a thermal scope -- picks up body
                      heat of lost hikers --

        Gabe flicks it on, looks at the total absence of heat as they
        fly over the snow.

                                        GABE
                      Still find the dead ones the old
                      fashioned way, I guess.

        So much for small talk. Gabe is clearly uneasy watching these
        mountains go by. Maggie breaks an awkward silence --

                                        MAGGIE
                      You could have said goodbye.

                                        GABE
                            (shakes head)
                      If I did, I'd have to listen to you
                      tell me one more time that it wasn't
                      my fault.

                                        MAGGIE
                            (angry)
                      Today -- especially today -- you get
                      to hear it again. The harness clip
                      broke.  Cold stress -- one in a
                      million equipment failure. You and
                      Hal could have checked it from then
                      till now and it still would have
                      happened.
                            (beat)
                      You did everything right --

                                        GABE
                      -- If I did everything right, Susan
                      Collins would still be alive.

        THE HELICOPTER

        whizzes on to the Ranger station -- a small building by an old
        country road. Not much activity outside of some ROOKIE
        CLIMBERS working out on a CLIMBING PRACTICE WALL. Maggie
        starts to land the copter, and as she does --

        INSIDE THE COPTER

                                        GABE
                      Do you really believe all that?  That
                      it wasn't our fault?

        Maggie slows the rotor, her eyes on the controls. Gabe's eyes
        are locked on her.

                                        MAGGIE
                            (turns to Gabe)
                      Yes. Yes, I do.

        But she answered a half beat too slow. The helicopter touches
        ground.

                                        GABE
                      I'm not sure what I wish more, Maggie.
                      That you meant what you said, just now
                      -- or that it were really true then.

        EXT. RANGER STATION

        Hal, wearing Sheriff's garb, storms towards Maggie's side of
        the copter as the engine shuts off and the rotor dies.

                                        HAL
                      Maggie, where the hell have you been?
                      I've got two climbers out --

        Gabe gets out of the copter, and Hal sees him for the first
        time. Unlike the last time we saw them, neither man is glad to
        see the other. Hal turns on Maggie.

                                        HAL
                      Brett and Evan are up there again to
                      jump off the spur. Their wives called
                      twice. I want you in the air and I
                      want them found before the storm
                      system moves in.
                            (Maggie hesitates)
                      Now.

        Maggie takes off as Gabe and Hal step away from the copter.
        Gabe eyes Hal's uniform and almost -- not quite but almost --
        laughs.

                                        GABE
                      Christ. You're in charge of Rescue
                      now?

                                        HAL
                      There was a vacancy. Maybe you heard
                      about it. The last guy lost his nerve
                      and lit out of town.

                                        GABE
                      Well, you're a better man than I am,
                      Hal. Nothing rattles you.

        The rookie climbers get off the practice wall to watch this
        faceoff. Gabe and Hal are one crack away from beating hell out
        of each other. Frank heads over to defuse the confrontation.

                                        FRANK
                            (steering Gabe away)
                      Gabe! Long time, son -- why don't you
                      come meet some of the new guys --

                                        GABE
                      Good idea. Say, Hal?
                            (beat)
                      Why don't you come with me so we can
                      show these rookies how to death-rig a
                      woman properly?

        That tears it -- Hal rushes Gabe and they pummel each other
        until Frank and the others pull them apart, panting and
        bleeding.  Hal throws off the men holding him back -- but
        instead of going at Gabe again, Hal throws Gabe a set of car
        keys.

                                        HAL
                      Take the Bronco to where you're going.
                      I've already been. Then go back to
                      wherever it is you like to hide. And
                      stay there.

        Hal heads back into the office -- Gabe heads for the Bronco.

                                                           CUT TO:

        EXT. DENVER MINT - HIGH ANGLE - DAY

        The Southwest regional center for printing and distributing
        currency. Hundreds of troops stand guard over the impressive
        U.S. Treasury complex.

        INT. TREASURY COMPOUND - A HUGE PRINTING PRESS

        is at work -- the ROAR of its parts is deafening as it stamps
        out a plate design on huge sheets of paper -- we move in on

        THE PAPER

        which is moved by mechanical arm to a SLICER that razors the
        bills apart -- it's moving too fast for us to see the
        denomination -- the cut bills are separated by --

        FOUR SEPARATION CHUTES

        that fire the bills down to a mechanical COUNTER that
        serializes, counts, bands and stacks them faster than any
        human could -- a HAND reaches to pick up a band --

        THE BILLS

        are something a banker could work a lifetime without seeing,
        but are real nonetheless --  $5,000 bills, banded here in
        hundreds. The band is put back in the growing stack by

        RICHARD TRAVERS

        mid-thirties, a tough, imposing Treasury agent -- he regards
        the fortune piling up in front of him with only cold,
        professional interest. Travers is flanked by a trio of equally
        tough TREASURY AGENTS -- he turns to flunky DAVIS (20s). It's
        clear who's in charge of protecting the money here, and who's
        in charge of counting it.

                                        TRAVERS
                      Tell Wright the San Francisco shipment
                      is ready.

                                        DAVID
                            (phone already out)
                      Right away, Mr. Travers.

        As Davis dials we move to --

        THE OFFICE

        of WALTER WRIGHT (50s), comptroller of currency -- his
        demeanor suggests he's in control, and used to keeping it that
        way.

                                        WRIGHT
                            (into phone)
                      Good -- good. I'll be right down.

        As Wright gets up from his desk, though, we hear in the outer
        office --

                                        SECRETARY (O.S.)
                      You can't go in there --

                                        MATHESON (O.S.)
                      Watch me.

        KURT MATHESON (30s) bursts into the office, trailed by
        Wright's flustered SECRETARY.

                                        MATHESON
                      Walter Wright?
                            (flashes badge)
                      Matheson. FBI. We need to talk.

        PRINTING COMPOUND - THE MONEY

        has now been packed into a trio of metal briefcases -- ten 
        thousand $5,000 bills. Travers shuts the cases in turn, and
        locks each with an electronic key card, triggering a FLASHING
        RED LIGHT on the locks as he does. A uniformed PILOT shows up
        behind Travers as he cuffs the cases to the hands of the three
        other agents.

                                        PILOT
                      We'll be fueled and ready in ten
                      minutes, Mr. Travers.

                                        TRAVERS
                            (an order)
                      Be ready in five.

                                        MATHESON (O.S.)
                      Go ahead and take ten. We'll need the
                      time.

        Travers looks up at Matheson, who has just arrived with
        Wright. Travers is instantly furious at the challenge to his
        authority.

                                        MATHESON
                            (flashes badge)
                      Matheson. FBI.

                                        TRAVERS
                            (looking down at it)
                      Your parents must be proud.
                            (to Wright)
                      What the fuck is this about?

                                        WRIGHT
                      Small problem with the shipment,
                      Travers.
                            (to Matheson)
                      Tell him what you just told me.

        Matheson draws out a file and hands it to Travers.

                                        MATHESON
                      We got word that somebody's been
                      observing your currency shipments --
                      this load, the $5,000s -- over the
                      last three deliveries.

                                        TRAVERS
                            (laughs)
                      There isn't a hell of a lot anyone can
                      do but observe.
                            (beat)
                      This is the most protected shipment
                      we've got -- and the most useless for
                      a thief. Those bills aren't in
                      circulation. You think five thousand
                      dollar bills are easy to pass? Who the
                      fuck would try?

        Matheson hands Travers a folder.

                                        MATHESON
                      This guy might.

        We look over Travers' shoulder at the photos, which are all
        blurry, all blown up from different surveillance pictures --
        and all of them show ERIC QUALEN.

                                        TRAVERS
                      Who is he?

                                        MATHERS
                            (patient)
                      His name's Eric Qualen. One of the
                      East German spies who got shut out by
                      the reunification. The CIA issued an
                      inter-agency warning about him right
                      after the wall came down. He's got
                      nowhere to go and nothing to lose.
                      He's also got the international
                      connections to get rid of bills like
                      these -- and he's probably desperate
                      enough to try for them. Fifty million
                      bucks buys a lot of sanctuary.

                                        TRAVERS
                      Could you get to the part where I'm
                      supposed to care?

                                        MATHESON
                            (shows him more photos)
                      We had two agents monitoring him.
                      These two -- Gleason and Quinones.
                      Their last report said he was going to
                      try to take this shipment.

                                        TRAVERS
                            (turning away)
                      Thanks for the tip. But I've got work
                      to do.

                                        MATHESON
                            (stopping him)
                      Did I say "last" report? I think I
                      did. I mean last fucking report.
                      These guys have vanished.

                                        TRAVERS
                      You have my sympathy, but --
                            (exasperated)
                      There's a reason we do things this
                      way, all right? Armored cars can be
                      hijacked. Trains can be derailed. But
                      nobody can get to us in flight. The
                      only time this is on the ground is at
                      the mint, or on the Presidio runway in
                      San Francisco. Either way, someone
                      would have to shoot his way past a
                      couple of thousand guards.

        Matheson still isn't convinced.

                                        TRAVERS
                      If you're worried about an inside job,
                      forget it. I checked the plane from
                      top to bottom an hour ago. And these
                      three are my best against. Even if one
                      of them did go skydiving, they
                      wouldn't get far. Each case has an
                      electronic tracer with a range of one
                      hundred miles.

        Travers pulls a tracking device about the size of a watchman
        out of his jacket pocket. The small screen shows three red
        blips at rest -- matching the three currency cases.

                                        TRAVERS
                            (facing down Matheson)
                      I haven't lost a bill in eight years.
                      And I'm not scrubbing this shipment
                      because you scare easily.

                                        MATHESON
                            (an easy smile)
                      Who said anything about stopping the
                      shipment?
                            (beat)
                      I've been tracking Qualen for almost a
                      year. If he pulls something, I want to
                      be in on the party.

        Travers, angry, turns to Wright. Wright clearly doesn't like
        this either, but is resigned to it.

                                        WRIGHT
                      This is cleared from the top, Travers.
                      Matheson will accompany you on the
                      flight to San Francisco.
                            (beat)
                      Show him every professional courtesy.

        Travers turns back to a smiling Matheson, looking like he'd
        rather kill him instead, as we --

                                                           CUT TO:

        EXT. MOUNTAIN RANGE - MAGGIE'S HELICOPTER

        is being buffeted by storm winds and a light snow -- Maggie
        struggles hard with the controls, but --

        INSIDE HELICOPTER

        Visibility is near zero. Maggie keys the radio.

                                        MAGGIE
                      Rescue One to base, over.

                                        HAL (O.S.)
                      Rescue One -- have you sighted them?
                      Over --

                                        MAGGIE
                      Negative, Hal -- storm's already
                      moving in -- I can't see them, and
                      winds are too strong to stay up
                      here -- over --

                                        HAL (O.S.)
                      Rescue One -- abort. They'll be all
                      right. Brett and Evan are dumb enough
                      not to log in, but they're smart
                      enough to have storm gear. Head back
                      to base.
                            (not unkindly)
                      Maybe you can catch Gabe before he
                      leaves. Over.

                                        MAGGIE
                      I don't think he's planning a long
                      visit, Hal.
                            (back to business)
                      Rescue One heading back to base, over
                      and out.

        THE HELICOPTER

        banks a 180 to fly back -- we can see over the horizon that
        the storm is moving in fast.

        INT. CAVE - DAY

        We can hear Maggie's helicopter flying off overhead -- camped
        inside the cave are BRETT and EVAN, both 20s, both shivering,
        amid their gear -- backpacks, cooking stuff -- and parachutes.
        These are Colorado rock jocks -- thrillseekers who'll try
        anything if the odds are strong enough they'll die in the
        process.

                                        EVAN
                            (freezing)
                      Way to check the weather, Brett.

                                        BRETT
                            (shivering yet macho)
                      Hey. If it were easy, it wouldn't be
                      worth d-doing.

                                                           CUT TO:

        EXT. TREASURY JET (DC-9) - DAY

        The DC-9 cruises over increasingly mountainous, remote
        terrain.

        INT. JET - CLOSE ON TRAVERS

        who looks tense -- we MOVE AROUND the cabin and find two more
        relaxed Treasury agents are dozing on the opposite side of the
        plane, their arms chained to the currency cases. Matheson is
        edgy. Another AGENT offers some condescending reassurance.

                                        AGENT
                      Just enjoy the view, huh?
                            (Matheson says nothing)
                      Relax. I mean, what could happen in
                      the air?

        Matheson turns back to his window and looks down --

        WINDOW POV - THE GROUND BELOW

        is covered with snow -- the jet's shadow moves sleekly and
        plainly over it. But after a moment we see -- -- another
        jet's shadow on the ground, coming up fast!

        INSIDE THE DC-9 - MATHESON

        reacts this and shifts his look upward to --

        WINDOW POV - ANOTHER PLANE (GULFSTREAM)

        is flying a parallel course to the Treasury jet, and is just
        one hundred yards away. Close enough to see Eric Qualen's face
        in one of the windows.

        INSIDE THE PLANE

        Matheson stands -- Travers has noticed the plane by now too,
        and gets out of his seat as the other agents react.

                                        TRAVERS
                            (to other agents)
                      Stay put! Don't panic, goddammit!

        Travers moves into

        THE COCKPIT

        where the pilot seems nervous, but oddly, not frightened.

                                        PILOT
                      He's coming in too slow.

                                        TRAVERS
                            (cool)
                      No -- we're going too fast, and we're
                      too high up. Push flaps forward twenty
                      degrees and drop to five thousand
                      feet.

        THE CABIN

        Matheson is out of his seat, pistol drawn. Seems a little puny
        under the circumstances.

                                        MATHESON
                            (to agent)
                      You got any rifles?

                                        AGENT
                      Forward compartment -- left side --

        Matheson rushes through a curtain to the area between the
        cabin and the cockpit and pulls open a closet door. To his
        horror, he finds inside not rifles, but

        TWO DEAD BODIES

        who we'll recognize as the missing FBI agents from the photos
        Matheson showed Travers.

        MATHESON

        backs up in horror -- and he sees Travers calmly coming out of
        the cockpit. Rattled, Matheson pulls his gun on Travers.
        Travers looks dumbfounded -- then angry.

                                        TRAVERS
                      What the hell are you doing --

                                        MATHESON
                      Checked the plane from top to bottom,
                      huh? You fucker --
                            (clicks hammer back)
                      Put your hands behind your head! It's
                      over!

        Travers puts his hands out and walks forward -- slowly,
        backing Matheson into the cabin. Not in surrender, but as if
        he's calming a nutcase. The other agents see this and don't
        know which way to jump.

                                        TRAVERS
                      Calm down -- give the gun to me --

                                        MATHESON
                            (to other agents)
                      There's a couple of dead bodies in the
                      front compartment -- they're FBI
                      agents --

                                        TRAVERS
                      He's losing it --

        They now think Matheson is crazy too -- he looks nuts -- the
        other agents move behind him. Matheson gets even more frantic
        and point his gun at them.

                                        MATHESON
                      Goddamn it! Don't you see what he's
                      doing! He's hijacking the fucking
                      shipment!
                            (back to Travers)
                      Don't make me shoot you!

        The other two agents get behind Matheson and rapidly disarm
        him. Travers pulls out his gun with a slow, leisurely move.

                                        TRAVERS
                      Don't make me laugh.

        Travers FIRES his gun three times, one for each agent's
        chest -- the agents are cut down, realizing too late what's
        happened. A fourth SHOT knocks Matheson over a seat as if he'd
        been kicked. Travers puts his gun away and puts on a radio
        headset as he goes to a window.

                                        TRAVERS
                            (to mouthpiece)
                      Move into position.

        EXT. QUALEN'S JET - GULFSTREAM

        maneuvers over the DC-9 -- and holds steady above it.

                                                           CUT TO:

        EXT. CEMETERY MARKER - COLORADO - DAY

        The stone reads "Susan Collins -- 1965 - 1991". It's
        surrounded by wreaths -- one of which has an old snapshot of
        her attached to it. Mementos sent on the first anniversary of
        her death.

        GABE

        brushes some of the falling snow away from the marker. He lays
        down his flowers and pauses for a moment -- then gets into the
        Bronco and drives away.

        INT. FORD BRONCO - DAY

        Gabe looks out the window at the countryside he used to belong
        in. He's wondering if he still does.

                                                           CUT TO:

        EXT. TREASURY JET/QUALEN'S JET - FLYING

        Qualen's jet is now flying parallel to, and slightly above,
        the Treasury jet. The door in Qualen's jet is open, and we get
        our first good look at --

        INT/EXT. QUALEN'S JET

        -- Qualen, who is also wearing a headset radio and is wired
        to a safety line in the jet. He's lowering a thick steel cable
        down to the Treasury jet.

        Qualen is as deadly as advertised -- 150 mph winds are tearing
        at him through the open door, but he is unfazed and
        unfrightened.

        TRAVERS

        is also wired to a safety line by his own jet's open door.

                                        TRAVERS
                            (into radio)
                      More -- more -- keep it coming --

        THE TWO PLANES

        Qualen's jet lowers the cable into the Treasury jet -- it
        looks like an Air Force midair refuelling -- difficult and
        dangerous. After about thirty feet of line is lowered --

        TRAVERS

        -- takes it in and clips it to a ring at the top of the jet's
        doorway.

                                        TRAVERS
                            (into radio)
                      Locked on. Move into lateral position.

        INSIDE QUALEN'S PLANE

        The pilot, KRISTEL, is a woman. Her skill, like her hard
        beauty, can be measured in a glance: she's a lot calmer than
        her counterpart in the Treasury plane.

                                        KRISTEL
                      Moving into lateral position.

        ON THE TWO PLANES

        Qualen's jet lowers itself, banking to the side -- the
        Treasury jet raises itself. Both are now flying side by side,
        with the cable serving as a thirty foot bridge.

        TREASURY JET CABIN

        Travers, unclipped from his safety line, cautiously goes to
        the cockpit. The pilot, nervous, struggles with the controls.

                                        PILOT
                      We're right on the edge of the
                      storm -- let's move it.

        Travers pulls the two dead FBI agents out of the
        compartment -- one is dressed in a flying suit like the pilot,
        one in a suit like Travers.

                                        PILOT
                      This isn't going to work -- Wright
                      will suspect something.

                                        TRAVERS
                      So what. He'll sift though a plane
                      that went down in a storm --
                            (gestures to bodies)
                      -- find enough pulverized bone for six
                      men heroically killed in the line of
                      duty --
                            (finds three suitcases)
                      -- and just enough of the right kind
                      of ash.

        Travers opens one of the cases, which is identical to the
        others -- except that it's full of one dollar bills. He's
        thought of everything.

                                        TRAVERS
                      We get twenty-one gun funerals and
                      they write off fifty million. It's
                      perfect, as long as you hold the plane
                      steady -- so concentrate.

        Travers moves back into the cabin.

        INSIDE QUALEN'S JET

        We can now see four other passengers. All are fit and armed --
        HELDON and RYAN are seated, while KYNETTE and DELMER, ready to
        help with the transfer, are on the opposite side of the door
        from a very impatient Qualen.

                                        QUALEN
                            (into radio)
                      Travers -- hurry it up.

        INSIDE TREASURY JET

        Travers, now in a harness like the one seen earlier -- uncuffs
        the money cases from the agents.

                                        TRAVERS
                            (into radio)
                      On my way.

        Travers steps back into the cockpit and flips a toggle switch
        over and LED --

        THE LED

        starts counting down from 2:00 -- 1:59 -- 1:58 --

        IN THE COCKPIT

        Even in the last minute, the storm's gotten worse -- the plane
        is flying right into the blackest center of it. The pilot
        looks more panicked than ever.

                                        TRAVERS
                      That charge is going to blow both
                      engines -- the plane'll go down like a
                      rock, so clip yourself on to the end
                      of the cable with the money as soon as
                      I get over.
                            (an afterthought)
                      And make sure you bring the right
                      cases.

        Travers heads back into the cabin and hooks his harness to the
        cable between the planes.

                                        TRAVERS
                            (into the headset)
                      Dip the plane. I'm coming over.

        THE JETS - LONG SHOT

        Qualen's jet dips down so there's a sharp incline -- Travers
        starts the slide down, zipping in seconds across into

        QUALEN'S JET

        where he's pulled in and unclipped by Qualen.

                                        QUALEN
                            (shouting over the wind)
                      Why didn't you send the money over?

                                        TRAVERS
                            (shouting too)
                      Somehow, I didn't think you'd have
                      waited for me if I'd sent it first.

        Qualen smiles in reply. No. Maybe he wouldn't.

        IN THE TREASURY PLANE COCKPIT

        The pilot locks the controls and rushes back to the cabin.

        THE LED

        counts down -- 0:38 -- 0:37 -- 0:38 --

        IN THE TREASURY PLANE CABIN

        The pilot gathers the cases and uses their cuffs to attach
        them to the cable -- but as he steps past the bodies of --

        THE AGENTS

        Matheson's eyes open -- he's not dead yet.

        IN THE CABIN

        The pilot clicks the last of the three cases onto the cable
        and is about to put his harness on -- but behind him, Matheson
        shakily crawls to his feet, draws his gun, and SHOOTS the
        pilot in the back twice.

        THE PILOT

        drops out of the plane, flailing -- if he's screaming, we
        can't hear it over the HOWLING of the storm --

        IN QUALEN'S JET

        Qualen and Travers are watching the whole plan unravel --

                                        TRAVERS
                            (shouting to cockpit)
                      Get underneath the jet! The cases will
                      slide over!

        THE JETS - LONG SHOT

        Qualen's jet sharply dips down and the cases start to slide
        over -- but at the same time --

        INSIDE THE TREASURY JET

        Matheson, groggy, holds onto the doorway and FIRES a full clip
        from his automatic at Qualen's jet -- and

        THE LED

        counts down -- 0:02 -- 0:01 -- 0:00 -- and

        THE TREASURY JET'S ENGINES

        are destroyed as the charge DETONATES --

        THE JETS - LONG SHOT

        As promised, the Treasury jet is now plummetting as if it had
        no wings at all, levelling the angle between the planes -- the
        cases dangle precariously on the wire --

        INSIDE QUALEN'S JET

                                        TRAVERS
                            (shouting)
                      Lower! Get underneath it!

        INSIDE TREASURY JET

        Matheson struggles to the cockpit and gets behind the controls
        -- as if that's going to do any good --

        THE JETS - LONG SHOT

        Qualen's jet is deliberately racing the disabled Treasury jet
        down, but it's hopeless -- there's no way to get underneath
        the falling jet long enough for the cases to slide over.

        INSIDE QUALEN'S JET - KRISTEL

        isn't quite panicked. Yet.

                                        KRISTEL
                      It's dragging us down! Disconnect the
                      cable!

        INT. QUALEN'S JET - CABIN

        Heldon and Ryan try to do just that, but the cable is
        taut -- there's no way to loosen the clip on the door --

        BOTH JETS

        dive down faster at an ever steeper angle, over the edge of
        the Colorado mountain range --

        INSIDE THE TREASURY JET

        -- the clip on the door finally breaks --

        BOTH JETS - LONG SHOT

        -- the Treasury jet drops as Qualen's jet, trailing the cable
        and the money, sharply shoots upward --

        THE TREASURY JET

        makes a one point landing nose first into the wilderness,
        cartwheeling into a FIREBALL!

        INT./EXT. RANGER STATION

        The sound of the EXPLOSION, muffled in the wind, far-off, but
        audible, drives Hal outside -- he's alert, but can't see
        anything in the murk of the storm --

        INT. QUALEN'S JET - THE COCKPIT - KRISTEL

        levels off the plane, but it's still in trouble --

        CABIN - QUALEN AND TRAVERS

        struggle to reel in the cable, because --

        CLOSE ON THE CABLE

        The money cases are still, barely, holding on, the cuffs
        caught on the broken clip at the end --

        QUALEN AND TRAVERS

        aren't even bothering with the electric winch, they're
        dragging it in hand over hand -- but --

        CLOSE ON THE CABLE

        -- the cases, torn by the wind, work their way loose one at a
        time and drop -- one -- two -- three -- into the snowy
        mountains below!

        IN THE CABIN

        Heldon and Ryan clamp the door shut as Qualen angrily attacks
        Travers --

        THE COCKPIT - KRISTEL

        tries to bring the plane up, but can't -- the fuel guage
        needle is dropping fast --

        INSERT - THE WING

        is pouring out fuel through a dozen bullet holes -- one of two
        engines sputters to a stop.

        THE COCKPIT - KRISTEL POV

        The plane is now just skirting the mountain tops, and is still
        being battered by storm winds -- Kristel aims it for what
        looks like the flattest, longest mountain top --

        THE CABIN

        Kynette and Ryan grab Qualen and Travers to separate them --
        all strap in, because

        THE PLANE

        is going down -- it just tops the edge of a precipice and hits
        the ground level --

        THE MOUNTAIN TOP - LONG SHOT

        -- the problem is, the ground itself isn't level, it tilts
        down towards another edge five hundred yards distant -- if the
        plane keeps skidding, it'll go over the edge --

        THE PLANE

        sleds down at an angle, skipping over rocks -- -- through
        trees --

        -- tearing off a wing --

        THE COCKPIT

        Kristel rides the stick only out of habit -- nothing she does
        is going to matter now --

        INSIDE THE CABIN

        The men are jolted around -- windows IMPLODE as Kynette tries
        to protect a bag of what is obviously explosives --

        THE PLANE

        rips downhill through a wooded area like a runaway train --

        -- the second wing is sheared off by trees --

        COCKPIT POV - THE OPPOSITE EDGE

        is coming up fast -- but

        THE PLANE

        wrenches to a sudden halt, the fuselage intact.

        WIDER VIEW - THE PLANE

        or what's left of it has stopped several feet short of the
        edge -- we can see why: the steel cable, trailing from the
        cargo door, has lashed itself around a half dozen trees,
        acting as a tripwire to stop the plane.

        INSIDE THE PLANE

        Quiet. All are dazed but, outside of superficial cuts,
        unhurt. Kristel moves out of the cockpit, looking around.

                                        KRISTEL
                      So much for phase one.
                            (to Travers)
                      Now what?

        She speaks for all of them -- especially a still-seething
        Qualen. Travers pulls out the tracer monitor for the cases.
        The tracer screen shows three distinct blips -- the tracers
        have survived the fall.

                                        TRAVERS
                      Now -- we call the police.

        INT. RANGER STATION - DAY

        Hal, agitated, paces in the main office -- Frank, unconcerned,
        puts a coat hanger and some aluminum foil on a little TV to
        drag in the fading signal of a Broncos game.

                                        HAL
                      Look -- I know there's a storm, but

        Kristel is on the radio, as Travers and Qualen hang back.
        Kristel's voice is panicked but she can't suppress a grin.

       Kristel hangs up the radio and smiles, Travers and Qualen
       standing behind her. Qualen lightly applauds.

                                        QUALEN
                      Not bad. The insulin was a nice touch.

       EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

       The Bronco wends through a winding country road, coming
       finally to a cabin settled in a clearing.

       GABE

       pulls into the driveway and puts the Bronco in park. He
       doesn't cut the engine, because he's not sure whether he's
       going in or not. Finally -- he cuts the ignition.

       INT. CABIN - DAY

       A knock on the door brings no response -- no one inside. Gabe
       opens the unlocked door -- and steps inside.

                                        GABE
                      Maggie?

       No answer. Gabe takes a look around the living room. His face
       tells us, without a doubt, this used to be his home. Gabe
       moves inside, pausing at a mantle. Two framed photos -- Gabe
       and Maggie sleeping together in a hammock, bolted to a sheer
       wall over a 2,000 foot drop. Gabe, Hal and Maggie, all
       younger, all sporting drunken grins, in a mountain cave.  Gabe
       smiles for the first time today at this memory -- a BANGING at
       the back of the cabin shakes him out of it.

       EXT. CABIN - DAY - THE BACK DOOR

       has come open and swings in the wind. Gabe steps outside and
       pulls it shut. Gabe looks down and sees tracks that lead to a
       small but sturdy shed a few yards away. Gabe heads over to it.

       INT. SHED - DAY

       Not a storage shed at all -- it's a small workspace that
       offers solid protection from the elements, is well-lit, and
       whistle-clean. Maggie, in front of a table, pulls a cover off.

       A LARGE PLASTIC CAGE

       -- inside is a bald eagle. One of maybe 2,000 left in the
       country. Its uneven feathering and small, gawky size tells us
       it isn't nearly full grown. A bandage on its side tells us
       it's been injured. Maggie's smile tells us it's healing.

                                        MAGGIE
                      Hey there --

       The door to the shed opens -- Gabe steps in, and shuts the
       door behind him. Maggie looks surprised to see him. Gabe just
       looks awkward.

                                        GABE
                      Hi.
                           (beat)
                      Could you introduce us?

                                        MAGGIE
                      Sure. Gabe Walker -- this is A27.
                      A27 -- Gabe.

                                        GABE
                      Not the tag -- what do you call
                      him?

                                        MAGGIE
                      Her. I call her Lucky.

                                        GABE
                           (bends down, eyes wound)
                      Poachers?
                           (Maggie nods)
                      Bastards...

                                        MAGGIE
                      They got the mother -- and left this
                      one behind. Too small to make a decent
                      trophy, I guess.

                                        GABE
                      About four months, right?
                           (Maggie nods)
                      Christ -- it must have been just about
                      his -- I mean her -- first flight --

                                        MAGGIE
                      Time to change the dressing.

       Maggie pulls on a pair of pair of cowhide gloves.

                                        GABE
                      You can't do that alone --

                                        MAGGIE
                      I've had to learn. She trust me --

       Maggie reaches into the cage, but the eagle starts thrashing.

                                        GABE
                      I'm making her nervous --
                           (beat)
                      You hold her, I'll do the dressing.

       Gabe finds another pair of gloves, sterile cotton pads and
       alcohol in a drawer -- Maggie reaches in and grabs the eagle's
       beak and talons quickly but gently, and takes it out of the
       cage, holding it firm. This is clearly something they've done
       many times before. They move together, tight -- Gabe and
       Maggie both react to this bit of close contact as they bandage
       the eagle. It's getting warmer in here. Gabe reaches down and
       yanks off the patch. The eagle thrashes as Gabe cleans the
       wound.

                                        GABE
                      Got some fight in her -- that's good.
                           (beat)
                      What happened to Dave?

                                        MAGGIE
                      The usual. Flew off -- never calls,
                      never writes --

       Gabe winces at this one as he carefully tapes the small patch
       and sticks it on the eagle's side. Maggie puts the eagle back
       in the cage and closes the top door. Gabe and Maggie don't
       move any further apart as they pull their gloves off. Gabe
       tentatively reaches for Maggie's face -- but she pushes him
       hand away.

                                        MAGGIE
                      I'm glad to see you, Gabe. But I kind
                      of wish you hadn't come. I was almost
                      used to you being gone.
                           (beat, quiet)
                      Why are you here?

                                        GABE
                           (pauses)
                      I thought I came back to see if I'd
                      learned to live with it. Well, big
                      surprise. Coming back just tore me
                      open all over again, like it all
                      happened yesterday instead of a year
                      ago. Nothing's changed. Including the
                      way I feel about you.
                           (beat)
                      I didn't realize it till I saw you at
                      the airport. But I came back for you,
                      Maggie.

                                        MAGGIE
                      Does that mean you're going to stay?

                                        GABE
                      No. Not here.
                           (beat)
                      I want you come with me. Start over,
                      somewhere else.

                                        MAGGIE
                           (incredulous)
                      You come back after being gone a year,
                      and you expect me to --
                           (beat)
                      You don't live here any more, Gabe.
                      Your choice, remember? But this is
                      my home. I'm not leaving. You can
                      stay with me, or you can go alone.
                      It's still your choice.

                                        HAL (O.S.)
                      Now there's an easy call.

       Standing in the shed's doorway is Hal. Stone faced. Grim.

       OUTSIDE SHED

       Furious, Gabe heads out after Hal.

                                        GABE
                      What the hell do you want?

                      This is a little more important than a
                      bet. Just a few injured people with
                      no first aid or shelter, camping in a
                      zero degree blizzard. They'll be ice
                      sculptures by tomorrow morning.

                                        GABE
                            (shakes his head)
                      Maybe you missed the headlines -- but
                      I don't do rescues any more. They're
                      bad for my conscience.
                            (beat)
                      Fuck this one up on your own.

        Gabe walks past Hal. Furious, Hal spins Gabe around.

                                        HAL
                      Play it again, Gabe, about how we
                      killed her. I was there too, remember?

                                        GABE
                            (hot)
                      Not like I was, pal -- her fingers
                      brushed mine on the way down --

                                        HAL
                            (right back)
                      -- and I was the one who had to deal
                      with her family when you fucking tore
                      out of town.
                            (takes a breath)
                      We lost her. Whatever anybody says
                      about cold stress and the clip, you
                      and I have to live with that. But
                      right now, there are some more people
                      who need our help, and they shouldn't
                      die too just because you've got a
                      problem keeping the past in the past.

        Gabe knows he's right. But he's hesitant. And scared.

                                        GABE
                      I don't want the responsibility.

                                        HAL
                      Walk away and you are responsible.
                      They'll die. I can't do this alone.
                            (Gabe slows but doesn't
                             stop)
                      You know what else, Gabe? You can go
                      anywhere you want, but if you don't do
                      this, now, you're going to be stuck on
                      that goddamn ledge for the rest of
                      your life.

        Gabe turns. Sees Maggie in the doorway. She's heard every
        word. Gabe turns to Hal -- hesitates -- and nods.

        EXT. COMB BLUFF TRAILHEAD - WIDE SHOT - DAY

        Relative to the other mountains, Comb Bluff is smaller --
        about 2,500 feet high. But that's like saying the Empire State
        Building is smaller than the Sears Tower. It's still a long
        way up if you're climbing the stairs.

        ON THE GROUND - GABE AND HAL

        with full packs of mountaineering gear on. They've got to
        climb up this beast. Gabe -- now back in his orange Sheriff's
        jacket -- scrambles with Hal up the base of the mountain, the
        last few yards before it turns into a sloping wall. Gabe
        takes a bolt gun -- which fires rope-fastened bolts into
        rock -- and hangs it from a strap on his chest.

                                        HAL
                            (indicating gun)
                      That thing's dead weight. Completely
                      useless for an ice climb.

                                        GABE
                      Just backup.

        Gabe readies a coil of rope and starts up the wall.

                                        GABE
                            (not a challenge)
                      I'll lead. I left a few bolts last
                      time I climbed this -- I think I can
                      find some of them.

        Hal starts up after Gabe, easily keeping pace with him.

                                        HAL
                      Save the rope for when it gets tough.
                            (beat, realizing)
                      That bet was for you to free climb
                      the wall.

                                        GABE
                            (further up)
                      Tell you what, Hal -- if we're still
                      alive tomorrow morning, I'll give you
                      the twenty bucks back, okay?

        COMB BLUFF - LONG SHOT

        Two orange specks move their way up the mountain -- it's
        definitely going to be a long trip.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

        EXT. COMB BLUFF - LONG SHOT - DAY - GABE AND HAL

        are now visibly two-thirds of the way up.

        CLOSER ON GABE AND HAL - THE MOUNTAIN FACE

        is not only higher, it's a lot tougher to climb. Instead of
        being angular, the wall is now completely vertical -- and
        coated with ice. Rough, irregular ice ledges are all Gabe and
        Hal can grip -- it's a matter of grabbing what you can for a
        handhold, and kicking the spikes of the steel crampons on
        their boots into the ice for footholds. Gabe leads, planting
        pitons into the ice, threading the rope through them as he
        goes. Three steel pins between Gabe and Hal. Their only safety
        net. Gabe, trailing rope behind him, goes up a difficult slab
        of ice and climbs under a ledge, where he anchors the rope in
        the ice with another piton.

                                        GABE
                            (shouting down)
                      Anchored!

        HAL

        is beside and slightly below Gabe -- at the other end of the
        fifty foot rope. Hal cautiously pulls himself along the line
        to the first piton -- as is standard for a climb, he pulls out
        the piton, then moves on to the second -- but up above

        HIGHER ON THE MOUNTAIN

        Ice, building in a small crevase, builds and CRACKS the
        adjoining rock -- several ten-pound boulders fall, causing a
        chain reaction

        ROCKSLIDE

        that bounces down the wall --

        GABE

        hugs the ice wall, making himself as flat as possible --

                                        GABE
                            (shouting down)
                      Rockslide!

        HAL

        flattens too as rocks bounce past -- the second anchoring
        piton LOOSENS as it is struck by a falling rock -- Hal
        nervously eyes the last piton between him and Gabe --

        THE PITON - CLOSE

        also has been clipped by the still falling boulders and droops
        at half mast -- no way are these going to hold in the
        unreliable ice --

        HAL

        tries to stay flat, but one boulder painfully CLIPS him on the
        shoulder, knocking him from his perch -- Hal falls --

        WIDER - HAL FALLING

        In falling, Hal's weight on the rope yanks out the nearest
        anchor piton -- Hal tumbles in space, keeping pace with the
        boulders, as --

        GABE

        who's seen everything we have, quickly reaches to the piton
        he's just anchored, and removes the carabiner clip --

        HAL - FALLING

        The rope draws taut, yanking out the last piton between he and
        Gabe -- nothing but a few yards of slack rope now --

        GABE

        has the bolt gun out. He rapidly hooks the rope's carabiner
        clip to the chambered bolt, and FIRES it at a solid rock ledge
        above him --

        INSERT - THE BOLT

        imbeds solidly in the rock --

        GABE

        lashes the rope to his shoulder, bracing for the coming impact
        by lodging his feet in the ice --

        THE JOLT - WIDER SHOT

        The line pulls taut, leaving Hal suspended, the wind knocked
        out of him from the impact --

        GABE

        is almost dragged down by the jolt -- he painfully takes most
        of the impact in his shoulders -- the shock forces his feet
        through an ice ledge -- but the rope, bolted to the rock
        above, has held. Barely.

                                        GABE
                            (shaken, voice gone)
                      Anchored --
                            (shouts this time)
                      Anchored!

        HAL

        now somewhat recovered, steadies himself.

                                        HAL
                            (breathless too)
                      You're sure this time --

        Hal climbs up the rope, finally reaching another ledge
        slightly below Gabe's. Hal leans against the wall, gasping, as
        Gabe clips the gun to his pack.

                                        HAL
                            (looking up at gun)
                      Don't say it --

                                        GABE
                            (wheezing too)
                      It's kind of hard to resist --

                          GABE                         HAL
                  It's not dead                It's not dead
                  weight -- you                weight -- I am.
                  are.

        Hal and Gabe start howling -- that hysterical, giddy laugh
        that only comes from just missing a violent end.

        WIDE SHOT ON MOUNTAIN - THE TWO LEDGES

        Hal and Gabe's friendship is starting to resurface -- their
        LAUGHTER is nearly louder than the wind, as we --

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

        EXT. PRECIPICE EDGE - DAY - BINOCULAR POV

        From the top of the bluff, someone is looking down through
        binoculars -- Gabe and Hal's orange jackets are plainly
        visible a few hundred yards below.

        RYAN

        lowers the binoculars, and keys an ear button on the headset
        radio he's wearing, sending a beep.

        INSIDE THE PLANE

        Travers is wearing another headset -- the others are just
        resting in the seats

                                        TRAVERS
                            (into mouthpiece)
                      Have they arrived?
                            (two beeps in response)
                      Good. Return to the plane and cover
                      your tracks.

                                        QUALEN
                            (to others)
                      Get ready.

        ON THE MOUNTAIN BELOW

        Hal and Gabe are tired, but get a second wind from the
        excitement of being almost on top. Gabe stops, breathless for
        a second, then goes on. Hal lags a little behind.

                                        GABE
                      Come on -- the hard part's over.

        Gabe heads up and over

        THE MOUNTAIN'S EDGE/CRASH SITE

        and helps Hal up. From here, the rest of the range looms
        large. Even in the continuing snowstorm, it's a spectacular
        sight -- but Gabe and Hal don't pause to enjoy it. This isn't
        a trip for sport. Hal looks off into the trees, and sees the
        torn tree stumps from the plane crash.

                                        HAL
                            (grim)
                      That's it.

        Hal and Gabe run into the wooded area and follow the
        wreckage -- felled trees, a smashed wing -- and reach

        THE FUSELAGE

        which sits intact by the other edge of the precipice.

                                        GABE
                      I thought the fuselage was broken.
                      That looks pretty cozy.

                                        HAL
                            (puzzled too)
                      The pilot was hysterical.

                                        GABE
                      Something's wrong here --

                                        HAL
                      Does this look like a prank to you?
                      Come on --

        Hal pulls open the passenger door and goes in -- Gabe, wary,
        takes a look around the plane.

        INSIDE THE FUSELAGE

        It's comparatively dark in here -- Hal starts in, shining a
        light -- the beam finds

        HAL'S POV - TRAVERS

        slumped down on the cabin floor, a blanket wrapped around
        him -- he's shaking and is generally giving a good impression
        of a shock victim. Hal rushes to him.

                                        HAL
                      Relax -- we're here to help --

        "Weak", Travers whispers as Hal gives him some water.

                                        HAL
                      Don't try to talk --

        Travers won't quit -- Hal leans down to hear.

                                        TRAVERS
                            (hoarse whisper)
                      Where?

                                        HAL
                      -- Where? What are you --

        A gun barrel moves INTO VIEW as it presses against Hal's neck.
        Heldon and Ryan are right behind him. Travers instantly drops
        his act.

                                        TRAVERS
                      You said "we". Where are the rest?

        GABE - OUTSIDE THE FUSELAGE

        notes footprints in the snow -- fresh ones -- and kneels down
        to look at the cable wrapped around the tree. No ordinary
        accident. But before he can think about this, he gets an
        earful of gun barrel from Qualen, who is behind him.

        INSIDE THE FUSELAGE

        Qualen hustles Gabe inside the plane -- his hands are on his
        head, and his pack has been removed. Qualen throws the pack
        to Ryan and Delmer, who rifle through it, removing anything
        that could be a weapon -- they quickly confiscate Gabe's bolt
        gun and ice axe.

                                        TRAVERS
                      What's for dinner?
                            (Kynette tosses packet)
                      Ugh. "Dried Beef Slices With Barbeque
                      Sauce."
                            (tosses it back)
                      Try and make this edible.

        Travis looks at Hal's park ranger badge.

                      He doesn't have one. Just a wallet.

        Qualen tosses it to Travers, who glances through it.

                      Gabe Walker...

                      Too bad. Let me tell you what's on for
                      today. We'd like you to help settle a
                      wager. You see, we lost some
                      luggage --

        Travers motions to Ryan and Qualen, who shove Gabe and Hal
        forward in the cabin. Travers takes out the tracer monitor.

                                        TRAVERS
                            (showing them the blips)
                      See these? Now I've bet the gentlemen
                      behind you that you know enough about
                      this mountain range to lead us to each
                      of these, quickly, and that you'd be
                      happy to do so. They bet me you
                      couldn't and wouldn't.
                            (guns are clicked)
                      Now tell me -- who wins?

        Gabe and Hal eye each other -- no choice. Gabe nods.

                                        TRAVERS
                      Good dog. Now let's get this
                      expedition started.

        EXT. FACING MOUNTAIN - WIDE SHOT

        Hal and Gabe lead the "expedition" down a steep, but passable,
        descent, leading to --

        A NATURAL STONE BRIDGE

        that links Comb Bluff with the next mountain. Travers stops
        Gabe and pulls out the monitor.

                                        TRAVERS
                      Okay. Connect the dots.

        Gabe pauses as he holds the monitor up against the
        mountainscape.

        MOUNTAIN AND MONITOR

        The first blip is up a thousand feet -- it's a wall, and
        obviously not something for a novice. Gabe pauses a little
        too long -- Qualen nudges him with his gun. Gabe hands the
        monitor back to Travers.

                                        GABE
                      This way.

        Gabe, with Hal right behind, leads them up the wall -- it's
        not a straight climb, but there's a series of zig-zagging
        natural ledges that cut up the wall. Wide enough even for an
        amateur. The others follow Gabe and Hal's example.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

        EXT. MOUNTAIN WALL - WIDE SHOT - DAY - HAL AND GABE

        have led the gang further up the wall, using pitons and
        carabiner clips to create a guide rope. It's still just a
        matter of climbing relatively easy ascending ledges. Hal and
        Gabe lead them by jumping to the next ledge.

        CLOSER ON HAL AND GABE

        As Gabe hammers in a new piton, he turns to Hal.

                                        GABE
                            (sotto)
                      We don't have to do this. We know
                      these mountains -- they don't. If we
                      can get ahead --

                                        HAL
                      Can you climb faster than they can
                      shoot?

                                        GABE
                      We've got to try something. Think
                      we'll get a finder's fee after they
                      get all their "luggage"?

                                        HAL
                      Sure. All the bullets we can eat.

                                        GABE
                      That's not what really worries me.

                                        HAL
                      There's something else to worry
                      about?

                                        GABE
                      Yeah. Once they've got what they're
                      after -- they're gonna need a copter
                      to get out of here.

                                        HAL
                            (realizing)
                      Maggie.

        Gabe nods grimly -- and keeps moving up. The rest keep pace.

        THE WALL

        The climbers have reached a point of comparative comfort on
        the wall -- the ledge is now two feet wide. Travers takes out
        the tracer monitor -- the monitor shows that the first case is
        just above them.

                                        TRAVERS
                      Hold it.
                            (beat)                      
                      It's up there.

        "UP THERE" - AN OVERHANG

        juts out of the wall fifty feet above their position. As the
        rest of the wall above is completely sheer, it's obvious that
        the case, if it is above, has landed on top of a ledge.

        But this isn't easily accessible -- we MOVE DOWN from the
        overhang and can see there are only the smallest of handholds
        to get up there, and those are slick with ice and snow. Worse,
        the rest of the mountain bulges outward in a curve, making
        climbing almost impossible.

        ON THE LEDGE

        Travers holds his gun on Gabe, and motions up

                                        TRAVERS 
                      Fetch.

                                        GABE
                      I'll need the ice axe.

                                        TRAVERS
                            (laughs)
                      You've got to be kidding.

                                        GABE
                            (sighs)
                      Okay. How about some tape?

        Travers nods -- Kynette pulls a roll of tape out of Gabe's
        confiscated pack and throws it to him.


                                        GABE         
                      Crampons too.

        Travers hesitates, but nods -- Kynette throws him the iron
        spikes. Gabe fastens them to his boots.

        Gabe looks up -- this is going to be tough, even for him. In
        spite of the cold, he takes off his gloves -- that's how small
        these holds are -- and he meticulously tapes up his hands and
        his fingers.

        HIGH ANGLE - GABE

        moves up the wall with some ease at first -- there are
        hand-sized handholds, and decent footholds -- but twenty feet
        up, there's nothing. To keep going, Gabe has to painfully
        wedge his fingers into small cracks, essentially supporting
        his weight only by several fingerholds at any given moment.
        We can see from the angle that Gabe is at least 3,000 feet
        from solid ground. We can see from his face that he's trying
        not to think about it.

        ON THE LEDGE - TRAVERS AND QUALEN

        watch Gabe's slow progress.

                                        QUALEN
                      I don't trust him.

                                        TRAVERS
                            (indicating wall)
                      Where could he go?

                                        QUALEN
                      I'd rather he didn't show us.
                            (beat)
                      We don't need two guides.

                                        TRAVERS
                            (shrugs)
                      You win. Kill him when he gets down.

        GABE ON THE WALL - CLOSE

        Make that "if he comes down". Gabe is now in one of the
        worst positions possible for a free climb. He is moving up
        the underside of the overhang and is essentially hanging
        upside down, knifing his fingers into tiny cracks for support.
        It's excruciating -- both in terms of muscular effort, and the
        abrasions that come from forcing fingers into ice and rock
        again and again. Gabe keeps his hold with one hand and slides
        the other up, hammering it into a crack wedge with ice --
        some of the ice chips whistle past and down --

        -- finally, Gabe gropes one hand over the edge, and pulls
        himself onto

        THE OVERHANG

        Exhausted, Gabe pulls himself prone across the top. Something
        hard is underneath him -- Gabe recovers and brushes the snow
        off the money case that's underneath. It's battered from the
        fall, but is still barely holding together. Gabe manages to
        force open the trashed locks -- he looks inside the case, and
        fingers a band of $5000s.

                                        GABE
                      Jesus.

        ON THE LEDGE - TRAVERS AND QUALEN

        look up. They can see Gabe has made it -- but they can't see
        him, or the case.

                                        TRAVERS
                            (impatient, shouting)
                      Lower it down -- now!

        ON THE OVERHANG - GAB

        has no intention of doing this -- he snaps the case shut and
        looks over at a ledge that moves off from it -- and at the ice
        and snow above.

        ON THE LEDGE - TRAVERS AND QUALEN'S POV

        try to look up and locate Gabe. They can't. Until -- 

                                        GABE (O.S.)
                            (shouting down)
                      I've got a better idea. Why don't you
                      come up and get it?

        With the case, Gabe moves, back against the wall, on a ledge
        that skirts off the overhand -- from Travers and Qualen's
        point of view. Gabe can hardly be seen -- since the mountain
        bulges out as it goes up. Gabe's got a slight edge of cover.

                                        TRAVERS
                            (shouts to Heldon)
                      Get him!

        Heldon runs along the lower ledge, FIRING up at --

        GABE

        who has to flatten against the upper ledge -- bullets howl
        past at twenty per second, SPARKING against the lip of the
        rock -- it's cover, but not much --

        HAL

        looks up, worried --

        HAL'S POV - ICE AND SNOW
        
        piled by the ton from the storm, lie further above -- the ice
        holding it back already, already weakened by the sun, is being
        chiselled away by bullets --

        ON THE LOWER LEDGE - QUALEN

        grabs Hal and puts the gun to his head.

                                        QUALEN
                            (shouting)
                      Bring the money down, or we kill your
                      friend!

        Travers pushes the barrel away from Hal, shaking his head.

                                        TRAVERS
                      We can't.
                            (frowning)
                      And he knows it.

        WIDER ANGLE ON MOUNTAIN - THE PARALLEL LEDGES

        Gabe moves across his thing ledge as Heldon runs across his --
        Gabe ducks back and has to flatten even more against the wall,
        because his ledge is getting smaller --

        HELDON

        smiles, seeing Gabe's cover is gone -- Heldon's ledge is
        getting wider, so it's easier for him to fire up. Heldon moves
        out to the edge --

        GABE'S POV DOWN

        There's now nothing between Heldon and Gabe -- Heldon takes
        dead aim --

        GABE

        looks up, sweating it --

                                        GABE
                      Come on --

        THE ICE AND SNOW

        above finally give way, dropping an avalanche on

        GABE

        who drops the case and hugs the wall --

        THE AVALANCHE - WIDE VIEW ON MOUNTAIN

        Only now can we see how much snow and ice had been penned up
        on the mountain top -- tons of ice and snow sweep down the
        mountainside -- it SHATTERS the case against the wall as it
        easily swipes a SCREAMING Heldon off the ledge --

        TRAVERS, QUALEN AND HAL

        are safe at their vantage, but stunned at the sight of --

        THE AVALANCHE

        Heldon's machine fun FIRES uselessly as he's swallowed in an
        explosion of white -- as well as a flurry of green as the
        bills scatter amid the snow --

        -- then: quiet. The avalanche ends as abruptly as it started.
        The rumble dies down to complete silence.

        TRAVERS

        apoplectic, stares at seventeen million dollars worth of snow
        settling far below. He takes his gun, furious, and fires at

        THE UPPER LEDGE

        where Gabe was hugging the wall -- it's now blanketed with
        snow. Travers FIRES an entire clip at where Gabe used to be.
        The snow FALLS AWAY, revealing nothing but stark rock. Gabe
        has been swept away.

        HAL

        reacts and attacks Travers.

                                        HAL
                      You son of a bitch --

        Travers turns and pins Hal against the wall with the gun,
        ready to kill him too. But he's stopped by Qualen.

                                        QUALEN
                      No. We need him to get the rest of the
                      money.
                            (he isn't backing down)
                      If he dies we lose everything

        Travers, furious, takes the gun out of Hal's face.

                                        TRAVERS
                            (to Hal)
                      Get us out of here.

        Hal stares at Travers with absolute fury -- but he leads the
        gang back along the ledge in retreat.

        EXT. FURTHER DOWN THE MOUNTAIN - DAY

        Powdery snow is settling from the avalanche. From a cave in
        the rocks, Brett and Evan crawl out a little timidly.

                                        EVAN
                      What the hell --

        Evan takes a pair of overpriced binoculars and looks up --

        BINOCULAR POV - FAR UP ON LEDGE

        The figures are small, but it's clear that one is pointing a
        gun at an orange-jacketed figure.

        EVAN

        lowers the binoculars.

                                        EVAN
                      Brett -- you're not going to believe
                      this -- but a couple of guys are
                      holding a gun on Hal and forcing him
                      up the bluff --

                                        BRETT (O.S.)
                      I believe it.

        Evan turns to

        BRETT

        who has found both Heldon's broken body, and his gun, half
        buried in snow. Evan walks over, amazed.

                                        EVAN
                      What the fuck is going on here?

        Brett picks up the gun -- this is more an adventure than he
        ever dreamed of.

                                        BRETT
                      Let's catch up and find out.

        Brett and Evan grab their packs, and hurry onto a trail, as we
        return to --

        THE UPPER LEDGE

        where Gabe was. Nothing is stirring. Until, there's some
        movement ten feet from where Gabe was hugging the wall.

        It's a crevice in the mountain, about two feet wide -- a
        climber would call this a "chimney" -- and it's packed with
        ice and snow. It's also packed with

        GABE

        -- his hand gropes out -- and with some difficulty, he digs
        himself out, gasping and coughing. Gabe, coated with snow,
        leans against the wall and rests. Alive.

        INT. RANGER STATION - DAY

        Maggie is on the phone, pacing, as Frank is slumped in front
        of the radio scanner. Suddenly, the radio comes to life.

                                        HAL (O.S.)
                      -- Come in, Rescue Unit -- over --

        Maggie bolts over to the radio before Frank can react.

                                        MAGGIE
                            (keying mike)
                      Rescue Unit -- what's going on,
                      Hall? -- over --

        EXT. MOUNTAIN - WOODED AREA - DAY

        Travers has his gun pressed to Hal's temple.

                                        TRAVERS
                      No tricks, no procedural codes, no
                      personal messages -- just tell them
                      everything's under control and you're
                      taking care of the wounded.

                      We've reached the wreckage -- top of
                      Comb Bluff -- six injured, but they're
                      responding to treatment. Everything
                      A-OK. Over.

                      coming up after you -- over --

                                        HAL
                      Negative, Maggie. Winds are too
                      high, and the passengers' injuries are
                      all superficial. We're going to ride
                      out the storm here -- over --

        Travers yanks away the radio.

                                        TRAVERS
                      Have her come up.

                                        HAL
                      Forget it -- downdrafts would wipe her
                      all over the peaks --
                            (Travers starts to argue)
                      -- Not that I expect you to give a
                      shit, but it's our only copter.
                      You'll be stuck.

        Travers relents and hands the radio back.

                                        MAGGIE (O.S.)
                      I can handle the winds --

                            (breaking in)
                      Forget about it, Maggie, that's an
                      order -- acknowledge --

        INT. RANGER STATION

        Maggie looks out the window. The station's windspeed gauge is
        flying around so fast it looks like it might take off.

                                        MAGGIE
                      Acknowledged. Let me talk to Gabe --
                      over --

                                        HAL (O.S.)
                            (hesitates)
                      You can't. He's taking care of
                      passengers. Just like I should be.
                      Over and out.

        Maggie leans back in the chair, looks out at the storm, and
        tries not to worry. She fails miserably.

        EXT. MOUNTAIN - WOODED AREA - TRAVERS AND HAL

                                        TRAVERS
                            (snatching radio away)
                      Good. You might live longer than your
                      friend. Now --
                            (takes out monitor)
                      -- what?

        Hal takes the monitor -- the next blip is above, almost
        straight up. Hal motions to the wooded area ahead.

                                        HAL
                      The next one's on top of the peak.
                      This'll be long, but easy -- more like
                      a hike than a climb.

                                        TRAVERS
                            (suspicious)
                      It looks like a winding route.

                                        HAL
                      There's a more direct route. The East
                      Face. But it's the wall on the other
                      side, and it's smooth as glass. Maybe
                      a dozen guys in the world could do it
                      in good weather. Only a psycho would
                      try it in a snowstorm.

        Travers digests this, and motions Hal to move on as we --

                                                           CUT TO:

        CLOSE SHOT - GABE'S FACE

        is torn in pain. In spite of the cold and wind, he's drenched
        in sweat, half exertion, half fear. We pull back to take in

        THE EAST WALL - LONG SHOT

        Envision a wall. A really big wall. A really, really big wall.
        A wall that's as wide as it is high -- five thousand feet by
        five thousand feet -- narrowing to a domed peak at the summit.

        Now picture the same wall, checkered with ice. If this were
        horizontal, you or I couldn't walk on it without falling.

        Now picture the same wall with an orange dot, two-thirds of
        the way up it. The orange dot is

        GABE

        and he barely has the strength to hold on, much less go up.
        Gabe holds himself steady with one hand, gets a foothold, and
        swings another hand up to SLAM it against the wall.

        He's improvised gear -- he's tied a crampon to one hand. But
        it's as awkward as it sounds. Gabe moves up only a foot or so
        -- then pulls out the crampon, reaches up, and SLAMS it into 
        the wall, starting the painful process over again.

                                                           CUT TO;

        INT. DENVER MINT - WRIGHT'S OFFICE - DAY

        Wright's pacing around, trying to figure out what in his
        office he should break first. Davis shows up at the door.

                                        WRIGHT
                            (furious)
                      Okay -- I know it's not in San
                      Francisco. I know it's not here. I
                      know it's not in any fucking airport
                      from here to Montana. Where it's
                      not - we got that covered. Now, do
                      you have any ideas on where it is?

                                        DAVIS
                            (walking to a map)
                      There's no radio contact, sir. At all.
                      We're not receiving the tracer signal
                      from the cockpit's flight recorder.
                      Radar lost it after it went low here.

        He points to a huge part of Colorado. Hundreds of square
        miles.

                                        DAVIS
                      We have to assume it went down in the
                      storm.

                                        WRIGHT

                      That storm hasn't quit yet. Weather
                      service says we've got it until
                      tomorrow morning at least. Even if we
                      could get a plane up now, it'd be
                      impossible to see anything on the
                      ground. And --

        Wright slumps into a chair.

                                        WRIGHT
                      -- The roads are shut down, right?

                                        DAVIS
                      Most of this area doesn't even have
                      roads.

                      let me know the second that storm
                      starts to wind down.

        EXT. THE EAST FACE - WIDE SHOT - DAY - GABE

        is clearly exhausted and freezing -- his lips are blue, his
        eyebrows encrusted with snow. Wind still threatens to knock
        him off the wall -- but he forces himself on.

                                        GABE
                            (teeth chattering)

                            (new foothold)
                      A steak soaked with Glenlivet, cooking
                      over a steambath on fire.

        WIDER ON MOUNTAIN

        Gabe finally reaches the top of the wall, where it meets an
        enormous overhang of ice.

        GABE

        is right underneath where the ice flows over the wall. Gabe
        takes his handheld crampon and hammers it into the ice
        overhead with more force than usual. This one is going to have
        to hold.

        Gabe steels himself for a tough move -- with one hand gripping
        that crampon, he swings out, away from the wall.

        Only the crampon spikes jammed into the ice above his hand
        are keeping Gabe from falling. Gabe needs the second crampon
        to make the move up -- but that's not going to be easy to get.
        It's attached to his boot.

        As Gabe clings to the upper crampon, his body swaying, he
        reaches down with his free hand to loosen the other crampon.

        GABE'S POV - DOWN

        The ground is one slip and five thousand feet away. Gabe
        fumbles desperately with the buckles on the crampons -- but
        both his fingers, and the buckles, are frozen stiff --

        GABE'S FACE

        shows real, solid terror for the first time --

        GABE'S POV - DOWN

        Gabe gets the first buckle off -- then the second. The crampon
        is off his boot.

        GABE

        still swinging from one hand, takes the now-freed crampon and
        slams it into the ice. It doesn't hold -- but the force of
        Gabe's swing, pushing him away, has loosened the other
        crampon. Gabe only gets one more shot at this -- he swings
        the free crampon up with all his might -- it catches in the
        same split second as the other dislodges.

        But the hard part is over -- with the two crayons, Gabe
        quickly manages to climb up over the lip of

        THE ICE OVERHANG

        This is a field of ice sloping up to the top. Gabe pulls
        himself a few feet away from the edge, and puts the crampons
        back on his feet where they belong. It's now pretty simple for
        Gabe to run up the ice slope three hundred yards to

        THE SUMMIT

        which is a rocky, wooded area. Gabe seems to have a second
        wind now -- he runs to the other side of the summit. The other
        side is obviously the route Hal and the others will be
        taking -- beneath the summit is a winding, well-beaten path.
        Gabe finally arrives at a small shack with a sign nearby
        commemorating the "DOUGLAS EXPEDITION - 1933".

        INT. THE SHACK

        is just a small "point of interest" shed for hardy tourists
        who have hiked up this far -- there is a corny photo stand,
        where you stick your head through a hole, so your face is put
        on top of a cartoon climber hacking up a mountain. Gabe rushes
        past this to a glass display case on the wall.

        THE GORDON DOUGLAS DISPLAY

        has black and white photos of a square jawed 1930s climber
        with his expedition -- more important is what's beneath it.
        Douglas' original climbing equipment -- a coil of rope, some
        pitons, a hat, a cloth backpack, small binoculars, other odds
        and ends. Gabe prepares to smash the glass -- and hesitates.
        Respect.

                                        GABE
                            (sighing)
                      Sorry, Gordon -- I promise I'll have
                      it back tomorrow.

        Gabe SMASHES the glass as we move to --

        EXT. THE TRAIL - DAY

        Hal is leading Qualen, Travers and the others upward -- this
        is a comparatively easy route, but still tiring. The sun goes
        down beyond a facing, taller mountain. Ryan is huffing and
        puffing -- the altitude and exertion are getting to him. Hal
        allows himself a smile at his discomfort.

                                        HAL
                      Come on -- tourists take this trail.

        Qualen pokes Hal with the gun -- he moves on ahead.

        EXT. THE SUMMIT - DUSK

        It's getting dark rapidly -- Gabe has scaled a rock formation
        so he has a view of the rest of the summit --

        GABE'S POV - SCANNING THE TREELINE

        Gabe slowly looks along the trees of the summit -- looks
        pretty ordinary to us, but something must have caught Gabe's
        eye, because he swings back to look at one tree. With broken
        branches on top.

        GABE

        climbs down from his rock perch and rushes toward the tree.

        EXT. SUMMIT TRAIL - NIGHT

        This "expedition" reaches the top -- Hal is in the lead, with
        Qualen just inches behind. Qualen shoves Hal forward.

                                        TRAVERS
                      Is this it?

                                        HAL
                      Yeah. This is it.

                                        TRAVERS
                      Good. Get out of the way.

        Travers takes out the tracer and starts following the blip.

        ELSEWHERE ON THE SUMMIT - GABE

        frantically rushes around, looking for the case -- he spots a
        crater of snow, rushes to it and starts digging. Even below
        the snow, the tracer's blinking red light is glowing and
        visible. Gabe laughs as he digs it out.

        NEARBY ON THE SUMMIT - TRAVERS

        has his eyes glued to the tracer monitor, which shows the case
        is nearby.

                                        TRAVERS
                            (smiling)
                      This way.

        Qualen shines a light -- all of them push their way through
        the trees.

        TRAVERS

        is excited now -- he can't even wait for Qualen's flashlight,
        he intuitively races through the trees, dividing his attention
        between his surroundings and

        THE MONITOR

        which shows he's practically on top of the case -- finally

        TRAVERS

        shoves his way through some small pines -- he can see the
        blinking of the red tracer light ahead through the branches.

                                        TRAVERS
                            (calling behind)
                      It's over here!

        Travers shoves his way through the branches, and heads for the
        light -- but something's wrong -- Qualen comes up behind
        Travers and shines the light on

        A SNOWMAN

        cute, if hastily constructed, stands with a five-pebble smile,
        as well as Douglas' cap, in a clearing. The still blinking,
        still operable tracer is now the nose of the snowman. The case
        is leaned up against it.

        Travers runs over to the case, furious, and opens it. It's
        empty -- except for a single $5000 bill. Travers picks it
        up -- scrawled on the margin is "LET'S TRADE."

                                        TRAVERS
                            (incredulous)
                      He's still alive.
                            (furious)
                      He's still alive!
                            (to Qualen and the
                             others)
                      He can't be far away -- spread out!

        Qualen, Kynette, Delmer and Krystel fan out into the woods,
        each with a flashlight and a fun. Ryan, however, straps on
        nightfinder goggles and runs out without a flashlight.

                                        TRAVERS
                            (to Hal, brandishing gun)
                      Put your hands on your head.

        ELSEWHERE ON THE SUMMIT - GABE

        watches the chaos with a grin from a slightly elevated vantage
        point -- he can see the flashlight beams, all headed in the
        wrong direction. But he doesn't see

        RYAN - "NIGHTFINDER" POV

        With these goggles, light is amplified a thousandfold -- this
        isn't one of those infra-red, thermo-blob jobs -- it looks
        more like day for night photography. Even starlight is enough
        for Ryan to run easily through the thick woods -- and he's
        going in the right direction.

        GABE

        begins climbing down to level ground so he can circle closer
        to where Travers is holding Hal -- before he can get far --

        "NIGHTFINDER" POV - RYAN

        looks up, and can clearly see Gabe climbing down the small
        rock, twenty yards distant --

        RYAN

        smiles, looking macabre under the goggles, and opens fire --

        GABE

        is startled as the bullets impact inches over his head -- he
        jumps the last ten feet to the ground and is running even as
        he hits the ground -- more bullets hit where Gabe was a
        split second ago --

        RYAN

        chases Gabe, easily maneuvering through the trees --

        GABE

        runs too, trying to dodge Ryan's continuing fusillades -- Gabe
        knows this territory, but to him, it's still pitch dark -- he
        stumbles, and rams against trees --

        RYAN

        keeps coming up behind, closing the hap, Gabe's bright form
        just ahead --

        GABE

        comes out of the trees and finds he is on another part of the
        summit. All that's beneath him is

        GABE'S POV

        -- a sudden, sloping plunge down a field of ice. No escape
        route here -- anything that goes down this slide is going all
        the way to the ground far below.

        GABE

        is driven forward by a fresh burst of bullets -- he dives to
        the edge of the ice field and ducks behind a boulder -- the
        sole source of cover.

        ELSEWHERE ON THE SUMMIT

        Kristel, Qualen and Kynette, having heard the gunshots, are
        now rushing to Gabe's position --

        RYAN

        almost casually emerges from the woods. He can see there is
        nowhere for Gabe to have gone -- except behind the boulder. He
        walks toward it as if he had all the time in the world.

        GABE

        fumbles in his backpack and pulls out something from the
        Douglas exhibit -- an ancient flare that looks like a can of
        sterno. Gabe pulls out his lighter and tries to light it -- it
        resists and looks like a dud, but finally it catches, and as
        it ignites Gabe heaves it over the boulder at Ryan --

        RYAN - "NIGHTFINDER" POV - THE FLARE

        arcs over the boulder to fully ignite, turning everything
        into a blinding, agonizing flash of white --

        RYAN

        SCREAMS, putting one hand over the goggles, trying to rip them
        off --

        GABE

        bolts out from behind the boulder to rush him --

        RYAN

        instantly aware of what Gabe's doing, blindly shoots, fanning
        out in a semi-circle as he gets the goggles off --

        GABE

        just runs straight ahead to Ryan, getting to him before the
        machine gun field of fire can intersect his path -- Gabe
        tackles Ryan as he manages to get the goggles off -- both men
        fall to the ground, and --

        The machine gun CLATTERS away, landing on the edge of the ice,
        just out of reach -- Ryan, now recovered from the blinding
        flash, pulls an ice axe out of a pack sheath and swings it at
        Gabe -- Gabe rolls away in time, and gets to the machine gun,
        grabbing it -- But Ryan dives for Gabe, slamming into him --
        the force of it knocks the machine gun loose -- it skips down
        the ice slope -- but the momentum of Ryan's hit also carries
        both Gabe and Ryan over the edge, onto --

        THE ICE SLOPE

        Gabe and Ryan both tumble over the edge and start sliding
        down, Ryan face first on his stomach, Gabe head first and on
        his back -- both are in immediate agony, because

        CLOSE ON THE ICE

        -- it's covered with razor sharp, irregular ridges, both large
        and small, that slice through clothing and shred skin as they
        pick up speed --

        GABE'S UPSIDE-DOWN POV - THE ICE FIELD

        The edge and a five thousand foot drop are less than a hundred
        yards away --

        GABE AND RYAN SLIDING

        Ryan flails and SCREAMS as the ice gashes him from
        underneath -- Gabe, however, manages to flip over and to the
        side -- he lunges on top of Ryan and rides him down like a
        bobsled --

        GABE'S POV - END OF THE ICE SLOPS

        is coming up too fast --

        GABE

        tries to maintain his perch on Ryan, who is SCREAMING and not
        yet used to the idea of being a human sled -- he isn't
        remaining still enough to provide a smooth ride -- Gabe
        frantically reaches behind to Ryan's wrist to get the ice axe,
        trailing from a wrist strap, but Ryan's arm is thrashing away,
        threatening to toss off the axe --

        ON SUMMIT

        Qualen, Kristel and Kynette arrive at the lip, and look down,
        incredulous --

        QUALEN POV - GABE RIDING RYAN

        Gabe and Ryan, accelerating, have almost reached the edge --

        GABE

        finally grabs the ice axe, pulling it off Ryan's wrist -- just
        as they reach the precipice edge, Gabe loops the axe to his
        wrist and swings toward the ice with everything he's got --

        The axe's scythe-like blade catches on the ice, right at the
        lip of the precipice -- Gabe is wrenched to a painful halt,
        suspended over the drop, as what's left of Ryan, still
        SCREAMING, shoots over the edge --

        Gabe unhooks the axe, and gets another handhold. Gabe uses the
        axe to climb further down the ice to some rock -- finding
        easier hand holds, he quickly disappears into the darkness.

        QUALEN, KRISTEL AND KYNETTE

        look down -- Ryan's death scream is still echoing. Qualen is
        furious -- Gabe has escaped with the second case.

                                        QUALEN
                            (to Kynette)
                      Follow him!

        Kynette shines his flashlight below, illuminating the long,
        frozen streak of blood on the ice.

                                        KYNETTE
                            (gestures with light)
                      After you.

        INT. DOUGLAS TOURIST SHACK - NIGHT

        The expedition has holed up here for the night -- Travers and
        Qualen look upset. Things aren't going as well as they'd
        hoped. Kristel tries to get some candy out of a vending
        machine that's obviously empty. Kynette saws at some camp food
        with a distinctive knife -- the handle is a set of brass
        knuckles. Delmer guards Hal, who is bound, and seated by the
        souvenir photo stand.

                                        HAL
                      Well -- look at the bright side.
                            (beat)
                      At least you've only got to make the
                      split five ways now.

        EXT. MOUNTAIN LEDGE - NIGHT

        Gabe confidently drops down onto a large ledge that juts out
        from the wall -- obviously familiar territory for him. The
        ledge leads to a small, enclosed cave. Gabe takes out his
        penlight and shines it -- but the light looks dim. Batteries
        are low. Gabe pockets it, flicks his lighter and goes in --

        THE CAVE

        in the flickering light, we can see that no one has been in
        here for a while -- snow, dust, rocks -- but we should also
        recognize this from the photo seen earlier as Gabe, Maggie and
        Hal's hangout.

        GABE

        smiles with the memories -- then his face brightens with one
        memory in particular. Gabe rushes to a corner of the cave and
        opens a rock-lid to a hiding place.

                                        GABE
                      Please still be there -- oh,
                      please --

        Gabe reaches in the stash and finds an ancient half-full pint
        of Jack Daniels. The first thing to go right all day. Gabe
        uncaps it and gratefully gulps down a double shot. Peace, at
        last. Gabe smiles and leans against the wall, closing his eyes
        -- but he's startled instantly by a SCREECH -- Gabe's eyes
        shoot open --

        An aggressive rat scurries toward him on the floor.

        Gabe grabs a rock and CLOBBERS the rat off-screen, ending the
        screeches with one blow. Gabe's face first registers
        disgust -- then an idea. Then real disgust. Sighing, Gabe
        pulls out a pocket knife and opens the blade.

                                                           CUT TO:

        INT. THE CAVE - A LITTLE LATER - CLOSE ON GABE

        Gabe takes the now cooked rat carcass -- properly skinned and
        butchered -- off his knife blade. We can see from flickering
        shadows that a small fire is now burning in a cave -- we
        pull back to see

        THE FIRE

        which is built out of small bundles of $5,000 bills. It's safe
        to say that something like $500,000 is going up in smoke, and
        the fire's dying down. Gabe tosses a fresh band of bills on
        the flame. Gabe cools the knife in some snow, saws off a rat
        leg, and chews unhappily.

                                        GABE
                            (mouth full)
                      Mmm. Just like -- chicken.

        Gabe sparingly washes the bite down with a taste of Jack
        Daniel. It's going to have to last him. He has an entire rat
        to get through.

                                                          DISSOLVE TO:

        EXT. WIDE MOUNTAIN VIEW - DAWN

        The first rays of the sun start to poke through the mountains.
        It's stopped snowing -- the storm seems to be letting up.

        INT. RANGER STATION

        Very quiet in here. Frank is snoring, slumped over the radio.
        Maggie is wide awake and obviously hasn't slept -- her
        attention is fixed out the window.

        MAGGIE'S POV - WINDSPEED GAUGE

        The gauge is still flying around, but clearly shows that the
        winds are slowing.

        INT. DENVER MINT - WRIGHT'S OFFICE

        Wright is coiled at his desk, tense. Ten empty styrofoam
        coffee cups -- and dark rings under Wright's eyes -- make
        clear he hasn't slept. Wright's assistant bursts in.

                                        DAVIS
                      We've got a fix on the plane, sir --
                      we're getting a reading on the flight
                      recorder tracer --

                                        WRIGHT
                      Any visual? Any radio contact?

                                        DAVIS
                      Not yet --

                                        WRIGHT
                            (heading to the door)
                      Get the copters ready. We take off in
                      three minutes.

                                        DAVIS
                      The winds are still too strong --

                                        WRIGHT
                      Sorry to hear it. We're still going.
                      The plane might be intact.

        Wright drags the protesting Davis out the door.

                                        DAVIS
                      Sir --

                                        WRIGHT
                      Shut up. That fifty million isn't
                      coming out of my pension.

        EXT. MOUNTAIN TOP - DOUGLAS TOURIST SHACK - DAY

        Travers, Qualen and the rest of the expedition head out of the
        shack, a little groggy. Odds are no one got much sleep.

        Travers shoves Hal toward a sketchy "YOU ARE HERE" map of the
        mountain range, and hands him the tracer monitor.

                                        TRAVERS
                      Still interested in staying alive?

        Hal matches the monitor to the map -- the blip is higher up.

                                        HAL
                            (pointing to map)
                      It's up here. Somewhere on the Tower.
                      There's a way to cross over to the top
                      in about half a day.

                                        TRAVERS
                      Show me.

        Travers shoves Hal forward -- the others follow.

        ELSEWHERE ON THE MOUNTAIN/SUMMIT - BINOCULAR POV

        From about fifty yards off, someone watches Hal lead the gang
        away from the shack.

                                        BRETT (O.S.)
                      They're heading toward the opposite
                      edge. An easy way down.

        BRETT AND EVAN

        are crouched in the woods. Brett, gun in hand, has no idea how
        far out of his league he is. Evan looks like he's having
        second thoughts, but he can't hack down now.

                                        BRETT
                      I'll cut around this side, and wind up
                      in front. You come up behind them --
                      quietly. And we've got 'em.

                                        EVAN
                      Brett -- they've got five guns --

                                        BRETT
                      And you can collect them all after I
                      get the drop on 'em. Let's get moving.

        Brett, automatic held high, circles off through the woods.
        Evan reluctantly lopes off toward his assignment.

        BELOW - GABE'S CAVE

        Gabe pulls his jacket on -- reversed, with the grey lining
        out, so the orange won't make him so easy to spot -- and
        starts out towards the facing Tower -- his route, clearly, is
        going to be along the rock wall. It's relatively sheer, but
        there are shelves cut into it to make walking easy.

        MOUNTAIN TOP/SUMMIT - BRETT

        races quietly through the woods in a parallel path with Hal,
        who's guiding the hang. Brett circles around ahead of them,
        waiting. Before he can jump out --

        HAL'S POV - ON BRETT

        hiding ahead in the trees and rocks.

        HAL

        makes eye contact with Brett, realizes what he's doing, and
        shakes his head as violently as he dares -- no, don't --

        BRETT

        gives Hal a confident wink in response, then pounces in front
        of the gang, gun held high.

                                        BRETT
                      End of the line!

        Travers, Delmer, Kristel and Kynette are startled, but don't
        immediately comply. This throws Brett off his stride.

                                        BRETT
                            (nervous now)
                      You heard me! Drop the guns!

        Travers smiles and steps closer to Brett. The others walk up
        in front of Hal. Travers actually laughs.

                                        TRAVERS
                      "End of the line"? That's classic.
                            (beat)
                      You've got style. So, I'm going to
                      give you a three-count to figure out
                      how to turn the safety off.

        Brett doesn't even look down -- he responds by FIRING a short
        burst over Travers' head.

                                        BRETT
                      Nice try. I've got one of these at
                      home. Now drop 'em.

        All drop their guns -- Brett, unfortunately, realizes at the
        same time we do --

                                        BRETT
                      Hey -- where's the other guy --

                                        HAL
                            (shouting)
                      Brett, behind you!

        Too late -- Brett can only twist around half way before --

        QUALEN

        easily mows down Brett with his machine gun, riddling him with
        at least thirty rounds at close range. Brett falls dead into
        the snow. Qualen walks up to Brett's corpse, blood steaming in
        the reddening snow, and kicks it over.

        BELOW ON THE WALLSIDE

        Gabe, reacting to the sound of the machine gun fire, climbs
        up, but there's nothing he can do --

        TRAVERS AND QUALEN

        and the others pick up their guns.

                                        TRAVERS
                            (turning to face Hal)
                      Time to --

        Travers sees that Hal is gone -- he's escaped in the
        confusion.

        IN THE WOODS - HAL

        runs like his ass is on fire and practically collides with
        Evan, who is more panicked than ever.

                                        EVAN
                      What are we going to do --

                                        HAL
                      You came up here to jump the spur --
                            (pulls Evan's chute out
                             of his pack)
                      This'd be a great time to do it.

                                        EVAN
                            (panicked)
                      But --

                                        HAL
                            (quick)
                      Listen -- they don't know you're up
                      here -- I'll draw their fire, you've
                      got to make the jump and get help.

                                        EVAN
                      I don't -- I -- uh --

                                        HAL
                            (exasperated, grabs
                             chute)
                      Unless you want to do it the other way
                      around?

        Evan snatches the parachute and runs off. Hal, wasting no
        time, runs in the opposite direction, deliberately making as
        much noise as he can, slapping branches, stomping on rocks.

        EXT. WOODS - THE BANG

        runs into the woods -- Qualen and Kristel, hearing Hal's noisy
        retreat, run after him.  But Travers stops for a second -- he
        has spotted

        EVAN'S FOOTPRINTS

        in the snow -- not unlike a neon arrow.

        TRAVERS

        runs in the direction of the footprints and quickly closes the
        gap between him and

        EVAN

        who tries to pull on the chute and run at the same time --
        it's not easy. Evan closes one of the three buckles -- but

        TRAVERS

        bursts out of the woods and runs up right behind him --

        QUALEN AND KRISTEL

        in the meantime, get behind Hal in a clearing -- Kristel FIRES
        over his head.

                                        KRISTEL
                      Stop!

        Hal, caught again, freezes in his tracks.

        EVAN

        is still up and running -- he dodges Travers' fire, weaving
        through trees, getting the second buckle closed -- he sees the
        edge, just ahead, and puts on an extra burst of speed --

        TRAVERS

        does likewise, still firing -- his clip runs out, but this
        only buys Evan an extra few seconds --

        THE SPUR

        is a rock formation that just out like a diving board -- Evan
        runs like hell to the edge of it --

        TRAVERS

        is right behind him, and has slapped a fresh clip in place,
        but before he can shoot --

        EVAN

        dives off the edge and clasps the third buckle --

        ON THE LEDGE - GABE

        is directly below a few hundred feet -- looking up, he thinks
        Evan has made it -- but

        ON THE SPUR EDGE - TRAVERS

        throws himself down, aims quickly but carefully, and FIRES
        twenty rounds towards Evan's falling figure --

        EVAN - FALLING

        Evan LAUGHS -- he hasn't been hit --

        GABE - WATCHING

                                        GABE
                      Come on -- wait till you're out of
                      range -- don't pull it yet --

        LONG SHOT - EVAN FALLING

        Several seconds pass -- Evan is now several hundred feet down
        and apparently out of firing range --

        TRAVERS

        stops firing -- but doesn't seem unhappy at all.

        EVAN

        LAUGHS more and pulls the D-ring -- the parachute billows
        open, inflating --

        CLOSE ON THE PARACHUTE

        which has been shredded by bullets that hit the pack -- as
        quickly as it inflates, it deflates through dozens of
        holes -- whatever resistance is left vanishes as the canopy
        collapses.

        EVAN'S

        exhilaration turns to panic as he frantically pulls on the
        chute's guide lines -- but the more he does this, the faster
        the chute caves in -- he SCREAMS as the chute finally gives
        way and plummets right past

        GABE ON THE LEDGE

        who is powerless to do anything but watch --

        EVAN

        falls the long, full five thousand feet, desperately,
        uselessly, pulling in the lines of the tattered chute until
        he's tangled in it like a shroud --

        GABE

        turns away -- he can't watch Evan hit bottom -- he grimaces
        and looks up with absolute hate at

        TRAVERS

        who doesn't see Gabe -- he's laughing at Evan's desperation,
        which ends as his death scream is cut off.

        Hal is led over to the spur, with the other gang members
        behind him. Hal looks as angry as Gabe.

                                        QUALEN
                      Was that Walker?

                                        TRAVERS
                      No such luck.
                            (to Hal, smiling)
                      Cheer up. Everyone should die in a
                      spot this beautiful.

        ON THE LEDGE BELOW - CLOSE ON GABE

        who has heard this and is shaking with fury.

                                        GABE
                            (quietly)
                      Don't worry. You will.

        LONG SHOT OF MOUNTAIN

        On top, Hal reluctantly leads the gang away -- below, we can
        see Gabe start out on a parallel path along the ledges.

        EXT. RANGER STATION - HELIPAD - DAY

        Winds or not, Maggie is untying the helicopter's rotor from
        the bolts on the helipad. Frank, who has obviously just
        awakened, rushes out of the station.

                                        FRANK
                      Maggie -- what are you doing --

                                        MAGGIE
                      I'm going to go nuts if I sit here one
                      more hour.

                                        FRANK
                      Still a little breezy out, Mag --

        Maggie gets into the helicopter and starts the rotor.

                                        MAGGIE
                            (over engine's whine)
                      You coming?

        Frank hesitates, but climbs in the other side. The helicopter
        lifts off and heads toward the mountain range.

        EXT. MOUNTAIN - AERIAL SHOT - DAY

        The next obstacle Hal is leading the gang through is a
        buttress -- a large, stark boulder formation -- that lays
        between the mountain they've just come from, and the nearest
        mountain to it: the Tower. This is lower down from the
        summit -- it's solid and treeless.

        Hal and the rest of the expedition is totally exposed as they
        climb in single file up to the top. Terrain is flat enough
        that the climb amount to an uphill run on all fours.

        CLOSER ON HAL AND GANG

        Hal leads the gang forward -- and keeps casting anxious
        glances back at them. And beyond them. Travers notices this.

                                        TRAVERS
                      Forget about it. He's smart, but he's
                      not invisible.

        Hal looks back. Travers is right. There's absolutely no way
        Gabe can come up behind them without being seen.

        LOWER DOWN ON BLUFF

        where the bluff meets a tree-lined plain. Gabe, in hiding,
        watches Hal and the others go up. No, he can't follow them up
        the bluff's side without being seen. But Gabe moves closer to
        the bluff's base -- Gabe shoves through some trees to the
        beginning of

        THE "CHIMNEY"

        A crevice runs the entire length and breadth of the bluff.

        GABE

        pulls out his ancient binoculars, and scans the crack.

        GABE'S POV - THE CHIMNEY

        Starting with an outside view, we can see that the crevice
        runs all the way up, and through, the bluff -- but it's a
        zig-zag, not a straight line.

        Picture a mine shaft designed by a madman. The crack moves
        upward, then erratically to the side, then straight up again.
        The width of the crack is uneven, ranging from six inches to
        six feet. And that's just how it looks on the outside.
        There's no telling what the interior is like.

        Gabe turns the binoculars to the inside of the crack. It's
        hard to see much -- it's very, very dark. But it looks as if
        the crack goes all the way through the bluff, as well as all
        the way up it. On this route, Gabe can tunnel through the
        mountain instead of going up the side.

        GABE

        puts away the binoculars and wedges himself into the crack,
        starting the long process of going up -- and through -- the
        mountain formation.

        EXT. COLORADO WILDERNESS - PLANE CRASH SITE - DAY

        A frenzy of activity, as several dozen Treasury agents sift
        through the snow for the wreckage of the CT-39, some taking
        photos, some taking videotapes, some putting the pieces into
        bags for analysis. Many bags. Many small bags.

        WIDER ON CRASH SITE

        The Treasury plane has been completely pulverized by the crash
        and its subsequent explosion -- there are few pieces here that
        aren't charred, and fewer still that are any larger than a
        paperback book.

        WRIGHT

        unhappily walks through the carnage and past agents gathering
        up the plane, to a harried crash specialist from the FAA --
        ROSS STUART (40s) -- who is organizing the debris.

                                        WRIGHT
                      What can you confirm?

                                        STUART
                      Well, sir -- it crashed. That, I can
                      confirm.
                            (condescending)
                      We've been here just about one hour.
                      These events take months to analyze.
                      So if you'll excuse me --

        He walks away -- but Wright, pissed, spins him around.

                                        WRIGHT
                      No, I don't think I will. The reason
                      the FAA pays you is to exercise your
                      vast, amazing knowledge of these
                      "events". So I expect you to come up
                      with some stunning insights, something
                      a slow-witted fuck like me hasn't
                      already observed.
                            (gesturing to wreckage)
                      One: it didn't blow up in mid-air,
                      because the debris isn't widely
                      dispersed. But was there a bomb on
                      board that could have disabled it? I
                      wonder.
                            (pointing back)
                      Two: There wasn't an attempted
                      landing. Otherwise, there'd be debris
                      to the east of the wreckage, where the
                      plane was coming from. Did it come
                      straight down? That's got me
                      scratching my head too.
                            (gesturing back to
                             wreckage)
                      And three: the flight recorder's
                      tracer led us here in the first place.
                      So where is the goddamn thing? That
                      one's got me all aflush with
                      curiosity.

                                        STUART
                            (a little cowed)
                      You'll be the first to know.

                                        WRIGHT
                      Oh, I believe you.

        Wright storms off as agents delicately handle debris.

        EXT. TOP OF THE BLUFF/VISTA - DAY

        A vista. From this point, you can see everything else in the
        mountain range. The only thing left that's taller is the
        Tower, a hundred yards away. Between the two mountains lies a
        drop of a mere four thousand feet.

        Hal has led the rest of the gang up to the edge. Travers
        approaches him, furious.

                                        TRAVERS
                      I thought you said there was an easy
                      way across.

                                        HAL
                      There is. You might not like it much.

        Hal points

        FURTHER DOWN

        A steep two hundred yard downhill climb leads to a wire that
        bridges the two mountains. The same wire we saw at the
        beginning -- left behind from Susan Collins' botched rescue.

        TOP OF BLUFF - HAL AND TRAVERS

                                        HAL
                      Of course -- we'll have to do it hand
                      over hand. Seems I forgot my harness.
                      Sorry.

                                        TRAVERS
                      Don't be. Lead on.

        Hal is surprised to see Kynette pull a harness out of his pack
        -- the one Travers used earlier. Disappointed, Hal leads the
        downward climb, looking several hundred yards to

        THE CRACK

        running up, and through, the bluff, coming out on this side.

        HAL'S FACE

        registers a thought -- will he? -- then dismissal. Nah. He
        couldn't.

        INT. THE CRACK/CHIMNEY - CLOSE ON GABE'S FACE

        Gabe is sweating, straining in the dark, climbing up -- this'd
        be a good spot to pull back and take in the view, except --

        THE CHIMNEY

        -- there's nowhere to pull back to. There's about two inches
        of clearance between Gabe's chest and the rock, and about the
        same between his back and the rock. To the right, there is no
        light. At all. To the left, there's no light. Even above,
        there is no light, because the crack isn't straight -- nature
        isn't that obliging -- it zig-zags up. Gabe is well within the
        mountain rock. Nothing could be closer to being buried alive
        Gabe snakes through a spot where the crack goes straight up --
        he takes out his penlight and turns it on --

        GABE'S POV - INSIDE THE CRACK AROUND HIM

        even this dim light reveals scores of bats hanging on the
        wall, surrounding him, up and down, left and right --

        GABE'S FACE

        is stuck somewhere between nausea and the realization that
        he's made a big mistake.

                                        GABE
                      I didn't need to see that. I really
                      didn't.

        Gabe cuts the light and slithers up through the dark.

        EXT. RESCUE HELICOPTER - DAY

        Maggie and Frank are flying low and fast, over treetops and
        snow -- both are intently staring down --

        THEIR VIEW

        is nothing but empty wilderness. But a BUZZER goes off --

        MAGGIE AND FRANK

        turn their attention to the helicopter's heat scope, which
        shows something alive beneath them.

                                        FRANK
                      Got 'em -- they're under the trees --

        Maggie smiles and slows the copter over a clearing --

        EXT. WOODS/THE COPTER

        touches down. Maggie is out of it before the rotor has stopped
        turning, running into the trees.

                                        MAGGIE
                      Hal! Gabe!

        Maggie runs into the trees, headlong into

        A PACK OF WOLVES

        that are preying on -- a body. A pair of legs are gruesomely
        sticking out from the feast. One wolf turns to SNARL at Maggie
        -- but Frank runs up and pulls a gun from a holster.

        Frank aims high and FIRES twice to scare the pack -- the
        wolves run off. Maggie goes to the body -- Frank holds her
        back, but she goes ahead anyway, worried it might be Gabe --

        TIGHT ON MAGGIE

        as she examines the body --

                                        MAGGIE
                      It's Evan.
                            (she stands, looks up)
                      Parachute failed.

                                        FRANK
                            (not unkindly)
                      Damn fool. Why would anybody try that
                      in the middle of a storm.

                                        MAGGIE
                      Why would anybody try at all.
                            (sighs)
                      Get the bag.

        INT. BLUFF CRACK/CHIMNEY

        Gabe has a quick climbing rhythm now. He pulls himself up with
        his hands, then braces his body with his back, and pulls
        himself up again -- he's not looking up, because he can't see
        anything yet anyway -- naturally, this leads to --

        A head and rock collision. Gabe's head crashes against a new
        part of the crack, as the passage thins out. He gropes up.
        The passage is narrowing to the point that he can't get
        through it. Dead end.

                                        GABE
                      Should've taken that left turn at
                      Albequerque.

        Gabe backs down, and starts to slide across the side. With
        his back wedged against the rear wall, he uses his feet to
        push against the forward wall.

        GABE'S POV - BLACK

        Zero visibility -- Gabe can't see what he's shoving toward.
        There has never been light of any kind in here.

        GABE

        blindly pushes to the side, rattled by the difficulty of doing
        this in the dark.

                                        GABE
                      It's just like any other side move --
                      you can't see where the fuck you're
                      going, that's all --

        Gabe stops and fishes out his penlight. Turning it on, it's
        clear those batteries haven't gotten any more potent in the
        last few hours. Gabe shines it to the side.

        GABE'S POV - THE LIGHT

        is fading fast. A match's last gasp is brighter.

        GABE

        exasperated, puts the penlight in his mouth and moves on.

                                        GABE
                            (garbled)
                      Much better.

        Gabe inches on to the side. Looks up to see if the crack has
        gotten wider. It hasn't. Gabe mumbles something phonetically
        near "motherfucker" around the flashlight, aiming it up --

        GABE'S POV - UP

        No opening larger than a mail slot --

        GABE

        still cursing, still looking up, still moving to the side --
        he gets the opening he wants, but not where he wants it --

        The crack suddenly, drastically widens as he moves to the
        side -- since he's been bracing his back against the wall,
        Gabe falls out of control, twisting around, face down --

        Gabe bounces down the walls for several yards and catches
        himself by bracing his arms and legs against the crack. It's
        now five feet wide as he painfully brakes himself --

        GABE'S POV - THE PENLIGHT

        falls out of Gabe's mouth and tumbles down, ping-ponging from
        one side of the crack to the other as it tumbles a long, long
        way down -- even after the light is gone, we can still hear
        the penlight's receding clattering against the walls --

        GABE

        is now, literally, in a jam. There are no handholds, no
        ledges, and the walls are slick. All he can do is remain
        braced against the crack's walls until his already sore arms
        and legs give out.

        EXT. RESCUE HELICOPTER - NEAR BLUFF'S BASE - DAY

        Frank is now flying the helicopter -- a body bag is stashed in
        the back, and Maggie is in the passenger seat.

                                        MAGGIE
                            (motioning down)
                      Bring it down here.

                                        FRANK
                      Maggie --

                                        MAGGIE
                      Just do it, Frank.

        EXT. BLUFF BASE

        The copter touches down -- Frank doesn't turn it off. Maggie
        jumps out with a walkie talkie. Frank makes another try.

                                        FRANK
                      Maggie, this is dumb --

                                        MAGGIE
                      No it isn't. I'm going to find
                      Brett -- I don't want to have to talk
                      to his widow too. Fly Evan's body
                      back to base -- I'll call you when
                      I've found Brett. Or Hal. Or Gabe.
                      Or anybody.

        Maggie runs off into the snow as Frank lifts off. Maggie moves
        quickly through the snow, and it isn't long before she spots
        multiple tracks in the snow -- they lead toward, and up, the
        buttress. Now she's really confused. But with nothing left to
        do, she starts climbing up the side.

        EXT. WIRE CROSSING - HAL'S POV

        As we've caught Hal in mid-crossing, he's looking from whence
        he came -- the opposite side of the buttress, where Travers
        has a gun trained on him --

        HAL

        unhappily hangs high above the ground from the harness kindly
        provided by Travers --

        HAL'S POV - ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WIRE

        Kristel is waiting, also with a gun trained on him. Hal
        arrives and disengages -- the harness is pulled back.

        BUTTRESS SIDE OF WIRE

        Kynette pulls the harness back and hands it to Qualen, who's
        standing next to Travers.

                                        KYNETTE
                            (motioning up)
                      I'm going back.

                                        TRAVERS
                      Look -- this part is nothing,
                      believe me --

                                        KYNETTE
                      Walker should be coming up by now.

        Kynette, automatic strapped to his chest, rushes back to the
        buttress' summit.

        INT. BUTTRESS CRACK/CHIMNEY

        Gabe is just as we left him. Face down, arms and legs pressing
        against the five-foot gap of the tunnel walls.

        Carefully, Gabe takes one hand off the wall, gets out his
        lighter with the other, and ignites it for a look --

        GABE'S POV - UPWARD

        Just as the crack has widened below him -- it's wider above
        him. More important, it slants at an easy enough angle to
        allow him to walk up. If only he can get up there.

        GABE

        snaps the lighter shut, pockets it, and readies himself.

        Gabe steadily "walks" up the vertical passage by bracing
        himself with one leg and one arm -- then moving the other
        leg and arm up.

        Gabe repeats this until he has his hands on the curved edge
        where the crack snakes into a sideways passage. But there are
        no handholds that will allow Gabe to get a grip and simply
        swing over and climb up.

                                        GABE
                            (winded)
                      So much for the easy part.

        OVERHEAD ANGLE - THE CRACK

        Gabe takes a deep breath, readies himself, and shoves himself
        away from the wall with his arms, pushes himself into a squat
        against the opposite wall, hanging for a second with no
        support at all, and he springs from that all into

        THE DIAGONAL PASSAGE

        Gabe lands hard but flat on the passage and immediately starts
        backsliding into the drop, but he digs in with his boots and
        his hands. Safe at last. Gabe carefully stands in a crouch --
        and starts heading up.

        EXT. BUTTRESS TOP

        Kynette moves to the edge, lies flat, and looks down --

        KYNETTE'S POV - ON THE BUTTRESS SIDE

        Maggie is climbing up, but she's still some way down -- and
        the hood of her parka has been pulled over her head. All
        Kynette can see is what she's wearing: an orange parka.

        KYNETTE

        smiles and hits his headset radio.

                                        KYNETTE
                      He's on the way up. I could hear that
                      jacket before I could see it.

                                        TRAVERS (O.S.)
                            (over radio)
                      Then get the money, kill him and get
                      back here. Now.

                                        KYNETTE
                            (into radio)
                      I'll wait till he comes to me.

        Kynette flattens out to wait -- Maggie is coming up fast.

        INT. MOUNTAIN CRACK/CHIMNEY

        Gabe moves up through the diagonal section -- the crack is
        starting to go directly upward. Gabe looks up --

        GABE'S POV - TOP OF THE CRACK

        It's coated with snow, but not too much -- Gabe can faintly
        make out light shining through up there.

        GABE

        knows the top is twenty feet away. Gabe starts up the easy
        segment, his back braced against one wall.

        EXT. TOP OF BUTTRESS - KYNETTE

        is staring down intently at the climber below --

        KYNETTE'S POV - MAGGIE

        is now almost to the top -- sweating with exertion, she throws
        her hood back.

        KYNETTE

        keys his headset radio again.

                                        KYNETTE
                            (into radio)
                      Bulletin. The climber isn't Walker --
                      it's a woman.

        INT. MOUNTAIN CRACK/CHIMNEY

        Gabe, wedged near the top of the crack, is ready to dig
        through the snow -- but he hears the sound, muffled and
        distant, of Kynette talking. Gabe strains to hear -- a bad
        time to come up? Might be.

        EXT. BUTTRESS SIDE

        Maggie, tired, gets near the top and collapses, resting for a
        moment, her arms on the edge -- Maggie looks up and is very
        surprised to see Kynette, standing over her, smiling, his gun
        aimed down at her.

                                        KYNETTE
                      Rotten weather for a climb, huh?
                            (aims barrel)
                      I have two questions I'd like to
                      trouble you with. Ready?

        Maggie stares up, frozen -- whatever she was expecting, it
        wasn't this.

                                        KYNETTE
                      This first one's easy. Do you know a
                      man named Gabe Walker?

                                        MAGGIE
                      Yes.
                            (breathless, scared)
                      Where is he?

                                        KYNETTE
                      You don't know either? I am sorry.
                      That was question number two.
                            (lowers barrel)
                      Thanks for your time.

        As Kynette tightens his finger around the trigger --

        GABE

        appears -- he completes his run toward Kynette's back and
        kicks him over the edge --

        KYNETTE

        goes flying over Maggie, his shots going wild -- but he
        catches himself on the rock and comes to a painful but safe
        halt after skidding down ten feet --

        GABE

        yanks Maggie to her feet and onto the top. Maggie gets a good
        look at Gabe -- his clothes are slashed, he's covered with
        cuts, and coated with slime and dirt from the crack. He looks
        like he's just spent a week in Hell. Gabe doesn't react to her
        reaction -- he just grabs her hand and runs.

        QUALEN

        chooses this moment to show up at the opposite edge -- he
        fires and automatic BURST at Gabe and Maggie.

                                        GABE
                      Come on --

                                        MAGGIE
                      Where? --

                                        GABE
                      Here.

        Gabe jumps on a spot in the snow over the crack, caving it
        in -- Gabe falls two feet into

        THE CRACK - MAGGIE'S POV

        Gabe has grabbed, and is hanging from, a rope anchored to a
        piton on the edge of the rock. He's also glowering up at
        Maggie a little impatiently.

                                        GABE
                      Today, goddamit!

        Gabe rappels down the rope into the darkness.

        MAGGIE

        hesitates -- she's still getting used to the idea of being
        shot at --

        KYNETTE

        woozy but recovered, has climbed up -- he runs toward the
        opening, FIRING his gun --

        MAGGIE

        drops into the relative safety of the crack and rappels
        downward.

        Maggie reaches rope's end thirty feet down, as the vertical
        passage again becomes diagonal. Gabe is there waiting.

        KYNETTE

        reaches the edge of the crack and FIRES down into it --

        GABE AND MAGGIE - FURTHER DOWN

        -- bullets are RICOCHETING all over -- Gabe throws himself
        over Maggie to shield her.

        KYNETTE

        can't see what he's shooting at, so he mercifully stops.
        Seeing the rope, he bends down to climb after them --

        GABE AND MAGGIE - FURTHER DOWN

        Gabe reaches up and tugs gently on the rope twice --

        KYNETTE - REACHING FOR THE ROPE

        -- which is tied in a standard climber's slipknot and comes
        undone with a final tug -- the rope, freed of the piton, falls
        down, but Kynette firmly grabs hold of the end --

        GABE

        feels the rope go taut -- he yanks the rope down hard --

        KYNETTE

        gets more pull than he counted on and takes a head first fall
        into the crack, disappearing with a scream -- Qualen has just
        arrived in time to see this --

        GABE

        looks over as Kynette bounces past him, a few feet away -- the
        rope goes slack in his hand as Kynette falls below.

        UP ABOVE - QUALEN

        in frustration, FIRES a burst straight down into the crack --

        GABE AND MAGGIE - IN THE CRACK/CHIMNEY

        Gabe and Maggie move laterally through the crack -- now about
        thirty feet from where they started, so ricochets are a
        serious but decreasing problem.

        The crack narrows from five to three feet. Gabe edges Maggie
        down into it, and along a ledge moving to the side.

                                        GABE
                      This way.
                            (off Maggie's look)
                      I like the outside of the mountain
                      better too, but --

        Gabe and Maggie move along the ledge --

        QUALEN

        is still at the edge of the crack -- stymied. He's definitely
        not climbing down after them -- he pulls back from the edge.

        IN THE CRACK/CHIMNEY - GABE AND MAGGIE

        find a comparative point of comfort -- a toe-sized ledge.
        Maggie is moving ahead of Gabe.

                                        GABE
                      Stop.

                                        MAGGIE
                      We can't --

                                        GABE
                      I need to stop.

        Exhausted, Gabe braces himself against the wall.

                                        GABE
                            (looks at Maggie)
                      I'm glad to see you -- but Christ, I
                      wish you hadn't come.

        EXT. WIRE CROSSING - TOWER SIDE - DAY

        Qualen whizzes across the wire on the harness, easily making
        it to where Hal, Travers and Kristel are waiting.

                                        TRAVERS
                      Don't tell me --

                                        QUALEN
                            (disengaging)
                      He's still alive.

        Travers takes a couple of heavy swings at the connecting bolt
        with Hal's axe. Qualen grabs his arm before he can take a
        third swing -- and looks at his watch.

                                        QUALEN
                      For another two minutes.

        IN THE CRACK/CHIMNEY - GABE AND MAGGIE

        Gabe catches his breath. All this is taking its toll on him.

                                        MAGGIE
                      It hurts just looking at you.

                                        GABE
                            (still panting)
                      Try it from this side. Do you still
                      have your radio?

                                        MAGGIE
                      It's not going to work in here.

                                        GABE
                      Let's give it a try.
                            (she hands it to him)
                      I'm in bad need of a ride.
                            (keys it)
                      Come in, Rescue Unit --

        EXT. TOWER FACE - DAY

        Hal is leading the expedition upward along a ledge -- the
        radio, in Travers' pack, comes to life.

                                        GABE (O.S.)
                            (over radio)
                      -- Come in, Rescue One --

        Travers stares daggers at Qualen. Qualen looks to his watch.

                                        QUALEN
                      Patience.

        INT. RESCUE STATION

        The radio is reading Gabe loud, if not clear -- the
        interference of solid rock is garbling it. But we can see out
        the window that Frank is now between radios, carefully
        hauling Evan's body from the helicopter to the station on a
        collapsible gurney. No one else is in the station.

                                        GABE (O.S.)
                            (over radio, broken up)
                      -- Come in, Frank --

        INT. BUTTRESS CRACK/CHIMNEY

        Gabe, exasperated, stops for a moment.

                                        GABE
                      Is there anybody else on the radio?

        Maggie shakes her head no.

                                        GABE
                      I take a year off and the department
                      goes to hell.
                            (keys it)
                      -- Come in, Rescue Unit --

        TOP OF BUTTRESS - HIGH ANGLE

        We can see there are three holes punched in the snow along the
        crack's top --

        CLOSER ON ONE OF THE HOLES

        Recognizably the part of the crack Gabe and Maggie dove
        into -- but perched on the edge is a block of plastic
        explosive -- the detonator LED races down -- 0:20 -- 0:19 --

        A SECOND HOLE

        has been punched in the snow at the center point of the
        crevice's top -- another bomb has been planted there --

        A THIRD HOLE

        at the opposite end of the crevice has a third timer tied to
        a third pack of plastics --

        EXT. TOWER FACE

        Qualen is staring at his watch, but pointing the others toward
        the buttress.

                                        GABE (O.S.)
                            (via radio)
                      Come in, Frank -- over --

                                        QUALEN
                      Try to get thirty million in
                      entertainment out of this, because he
                      is definitely in for thirty million
                      worth of pain.

        Gabe's radio calls continue as Qualen extends his arm towards
        the buttress and starts a silent hand countdown, stage manager
        style -- five -- four -- three --

        INSERT - TIMER

        The LED runs down -- 0:02 -- 0:01 --

        THE BUTTRESS TOP

        is shattered by a huge blast as the first bomb detonates --

        INSIDE THE CRACK/CHIMNEY

        The walls are pulverized near the top and cave in, raining
        rocks further down towards --

        GABE AND MAGGIE

        who are hit by a blast of air booming down through the
        confined space -- Gabe drops the radio -- Maggie slips, but
        Gabe grabs her -- both slide down the crack, out of control,
        until it narrows to a three foot width -- and they stop --
        Gabe shoves Maggie against the wall and tries to protect her
        with his body as the rocks start to rain down --

        TOWER FACE

        Hal lunges at Qualen, but is held back by Travers.

                                        HAL
                      You sick fuck --

                                        QUALEN
                      Don't worry. They may still be alive.
                      That was the small one.

        RESCUE STATION

        Frank stops wheeling the gurney and looks up at the far-off
        blast, and the smoke, amazed.

                                        FRANK
                      Jesus -- that's some flare.

        INSIDE THE CRACK

        Rocks tumble down it, filling it in and sealing it off --

        FURTHER DOWN - GABE

        is braced over Maggie, protecting her from the first round of
        falling rocks, but rolling THUNDER in the crack announces that
        more is coming -- Gabe looks up as the noise gets closer --

        ABOVE IN THE CRACK

        The rockslide arrives -- the crack is filled in seconds with
        rocks and dirt, packing it in -- Gabe tries to hold on, but is
        shoved down by the falling rocks -- Maggie, however, is
        buried in the crack as it fills --

        GABE

        is knocked down to a point where the crack narrows -- he stops
        himself by jamming his body against the sides. Suddenly, it's
        quiet. A little dirt whistles through, but that's all.

        The cave-in has stopped, as it's filled in the crack above.

        And Maggie is in the middle of it.  Gabe unsheaths his ice axe
        and starts hacking up to get at Maggie. Dirt and rocks fall in
        his face as he digs --

        BOMB NUMBER TWO - INSERT

        Another LED is counting down from 3:00 -- 2:59 -- 2:58 --

        INSIDE THE CRACK

        Gabe frantically hacks at the ceiling of dirt -- rock and soil
        tumble down, but no sign of Maggie. Gabe uncovers one of
        Maggie's feet. Is it too late? Gabe digs up around her --

        Maggie realizes Gabe is there -- she starts kicking.

        Finally Maggie tumbles out of the cave-in -- gasping and
        coughing, but alive.  Gabe catches her and brushes the dirt
        off her face.

                                        GABE
                      Are you all right?

                                        MAGGIE
                            (terrified, coughing)
                      Why are they doing this?

        RESCUE STATION

        Frank, having lain Evan's body to rest, runs back to the
        helicopter, starts it up and takes off.

        INSIDE THE CRACK/CHIMNEY

        Gabe is leading Maggie horizontally through the crack, fast
        and furious --

                                        MAGGIE
                            (looks up)
                      We might be able to get up that way --
                      there's an opening --

                                        GABE
                      No -- there could be another bomb up
                      there -- even if there isn't, we could
                      get another cave-in. The only sure way
                      out is through the side.

        EXT. TREASURY PLANE CRASH SITE - DAY

        Treasury agents sift debris as Davis runs up to Stuart.

                                        DAVIS
                      I've got something here.

                                        STUART
                      Let's have it.

                                        DAVIS
                      There's an unconfirmed report of a
                      distress call made from a plane that
                      crashed.

                                        STUART
                      That's really, really interesting, but
                      --
                            (gestures around)
                      -- kind of old news, don't you think?

                                        DAVIS
                      This call was supposedly made from a
                      plane that crash landed. After it
                      landed.

                                        STUART
                            (waves it off)
                      Sounds like they got it wrong. Next
                      time you interrupt my work make sure
                      it's something I can use.

        INT. MOUNTAIN CRACK/CHIMNEY

        Gabe and Maggie cautiously move along a single ledge --
        finally, some light can be seen, thirty feet ahead, as they
        round a corner.

                                        GABE
                            (smiling)
                      Come on -- we're almost out.

        The crack narrows, and Gabe straddles it, putting his feet on
        the opposite edge to walk faster. But before he can go on --

        A HAND

        grabs one of Gabe's ankles from below and yanks him down --
        Gabe tumbles painfully, braking himself in front of

        KYNETTE

        bruised and bloody, who has survived the earlier fall and made
        his way out. His look is not a forgiving one.

                                        KYNETTE
                      Miss me?

        Kynette smashes Gabe's face with a devastating, brass-knuckled
        punch --

        GABE

        falls back, desperately grabbing at the walls to stop himself
        from going all the way down -- as he weakly tries to get up --

        KYNETTE

        calmly opens his knife, and re-laces his fingers into its
        brass-knuckle handle.

        TOWER FACE

        The gang and Hal watch the mountain top, with very different
        expectations and hopes -- their vantage point keeps them from
        seeing where the crack actually comes out.

                                        QUALEN
                            (looks to Hal)
                      You might say a few words for your
                      friends -- this is the one that will
                      bury them.

        BOMB NUMBER TWO - INSERT

        Ready to blow -- 0:10 -- 0:09 --

        IN THE CRACK - MAGGIE

        can only look down helplessly at

        GABE AND KYNETTE

        fighting -- Gabe is on his feet, but Kynette, slashing at him
        with his knife, is forcing Gabe to back up -- the crack is
        getting wider, and finding footholds while crab-walking
        backwards in the dark isn't east.

        Gabe's in a rotten fighting position -- as he has to spread
        his feet out wider as he backs up, he's always lower than
        Kynette.

        Gabe throws a punch at Kynette's stomach, but there's no power
        to it. Kynette hits Gabe with a brutal knuckle-duster punch --
        Gabe flies back several feet, somehow managing to straddle the
        crack walls -- which are now four feet apart. Kynette moves in
        for the kill.

        BOMB NUMBER TWO - INSERT

        The LED counts down -- 0:02 -- 0:01 -- 0:00 -- but doesn't
        detonate. A green light starts flashing, but the bomb hasn't
        gone off.

        IN THE CRACK/CHIMNEY

        Kynette moves in over Gabe and swings down with the knife --
        But Gabe grabs his knife hand, and adding his own force to the
        swing, imbeds the knife to the hilt in the rock wall,
        trapping Kynette's hand in the brass-knuckle handle.

        Gabe stabilizes himself on Kynette's trapped arm and gets a
        little payback -- three solid roundhouse punches to Kynette's
        face -- he then climbs up his pinned opponent, stepping up
        on Kynette's stuck hand as if it were a piton.

        TOWER FACE

        Qualen's smirk is wiped off his face. The bomb didn't work?

                                        TRAVERS
                      What happened?

                                        QUALEN
                      I'm not sure -- I set the timer --

        Qualen gestures helplessly, putting the radio in Hal's reach.
        Hal takes advantage of this, throws off Travers, and grabs the
        radio.

                                        HAL
                            (keying radio)
                      Gabe, it's a dud --

        But the second Hal transmits --

        BOMB NUMBER TWO

        detonates over the central part of the crevice, and as
        promised, it's even bigger than the first --

        INSIDE THE CRACK

        The bomb instantly blasts tons of rock down the crevice --

        GABE AND MAGGIE

        The RUMBLE of the approaching rockslide is unmistakable --
        Gabe shoves Maggie forward --

                                        GABE
                      Move!

        Maggie doesn't have to be told twice -- she and Gabe move out
        the narrowed crack quickly, but under the circumstances,
        this "running" looks damn slow --

        KYNETTE

        struggles with the stuck knife as the cave-in knocks him off
        the wall and buries him instantly --

        GABE AND MAGGIE

        cover the last ten feet, shoved forward by an airburst from
        the giant explosion -- they make it to the crack's edge at
        last, but on the

        OUTSIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN

        Gabe and Maggie still have to cling desperately to the sheer
        wall -- the airburst has turned the crack into a wind
        tunnel -- it's as if the mountain were trying to blow them
        out.

        TOWER FACE

        Hal, shocked, stares at the enormity of the explosion. Qualen
        looks serenely satisfied.

                                        QUALEN
                      When I was seventeen, I was a sentry
                      on the East Berlin boundary.
                      There was a problem, then -- too many
                      defectors were managing to sneak
                      through the wilderness to the west. A
                      man would take them through, every
                      night of every week -- a man like your
                      friend.
                            (beat)
                      He had quite a sense of humor. Every
                      time he got someone through, he'd
                      radio us at midnight to let us know
                      how many. "Five tonight." "Eight
                      more have been freed tonight." No one
                      could find the route. It made me look
                      bad.
                            (beat)
                      I looked day and night and finally I
                      found it. A tunnel. I didn't tell me
                      superiors. I put a charge there, with
                      a timer to trigger a radio receiver on
                      the detonator. At midnight. Our friend
                      made his radio report, and I heard him
                      say "seven" before the explosion.
                            (beat)
                      They pulled eight bodies out of the
                      tunnel, and I was promoted to
                      intelligence the next day.

        Hal, stunned, looks at the radio, realizing Qualen tricked
        him into detonating the bomb. Travers, grinning, takes the
        radio from Hal and pats him on the back.

                                        TRAVERS
                      Thanks. We couldn't have killed him
                      without you.

        GABE AND MAGGIE - ON THE WALL

        The force of the airburst, as brief as it is strong, is over.
        Dust slowly swirls out -- Gabe and Maggie raise their heads.
        Gabe looks back -- the crack is now sealed off. Gabe takes a
        piton and hammer from his belt and hands it to Maggie along
        with the rope.

                                        GABE
                      Knock this in the side. Make it firm.

        Maggie does as Gabe takes the binoculars out, and climbs out
        on a slim toehold so he can look up the wall.

        GABE'S POV - UP THE WALL

        Gabe whips the binoculars up to the top edge of the wall. It's
        blurry -- Gabe focuses the binoculars on -- the third
        bomb, visible on the mountain's edge. The LED counts down,
        but it's partly obscured. All Gabe can see is the seconds, not
        the minutes, that remain -- :42 -- :41 --

                                        GABE (O.S.)
                      Bad news. There's another bomb up
                      there. We've got to move quick.

        Gabe scans methodically but rapidly down the rock below. All
        smooth. Until -- Gabe swings the binoculars back. There's a
        lip ninety feet below, leading into the wall. A cave.

                                        GABE (O.S.)
                      Good news. There's a cave down there.

        GABE

        puts away the binoculars and swings back to Maggie -- she lets
        the length of rope drop. It's thirty feet long. Not even
        almost long enough to get to the shelter. Gabe leans against
        the crack wall, drained. Now what?

        HELICOPTER - MOVING OVER MOUNTAINS

        Frank is in the air, heading back out toward the range,
        frantically working the radio.

                                        FRANK
                      Maggie -- come in, Maggie, this is
                      Rescue One --

        TOWER FACE

        Frank's call is heard on the radio. Travers takes it, and
        takes charge.

                                        TRAVERS
                      There's our ride out of here. Everyone
                      out of sight -- except you, Kristel.
                            (hands her radio)
                      Make the distress call. You're so good
                      at it.

        All scramble up towards the clearing.

        INSERT - THE THIRD BOMB

        We can see what Gabe couldn't -- the timer has about two

        GABE AND MAGGIE - AT THE CRACK'S EDGE

        Gabe looks completely defeated. Can't go up. Can't go back in.
        Can't go down.

                                        MAGGIE
                            (frantic)
                      What are we going to do?

                                        GABE
                            (defeated)
                      Die. I'm sorry, Maggie. I'm sorry you
                      got into this.

        Gabe and Maggie fuse together in a tight embrace -- a final
        embrace. But Gabe opens his eyes as the rope, still in
        Maggie's hand, brushes his cheek. The end is frayed.

        Gabe's eyes light up. Inspiration. Gabe breaks off the embrace
        and snatches the rope from her -- he pulls at the end and
        furiously starts unravelling it.

                                        MAGGIE
                      What are you doing?

        EXT. TREASURY PLANE CRASH SITE - DAY

        Davis has just filled in Wright on the "unconfirmed" distress
        call. Wright looks furious.

                                        WRIGHT
                      He didn't think a distress call from a
                      crashed plane was "important"?
                            (Davis nods)
                      Get me a fucking radio! Now!

        EXT. HELICOPTER

        flying over the mountains.

        INT. HELICOPTER

        Frank is practically there, heading toward the buttress and
        the facing Tower.

                                        FRANK
                            (over radio)
                      Come in, Maggie, over --

                                        KRISTEL (O.S.)
                            (over radio -- "weak")
                      Alpha Charlie Niner -- please --
                      help --

        Frank recognizes the pilot's voice from the "distress call".

                                        FRANK
                            (over radio)
                      I copy, Charlie Niner -- what's your
                      position -- over --

        An aerial flare fires up, leaving a clear marker.

                                        FRANK
                            (over radio)
                      Sit tight, Charlie Niner -- I'm right
                      on top of you.

        GABE AND MAGGIE - AT THE CRACK'S EDGE

        Gabe is still unravelling the rope fiber -- it's three
        different segments wound together. The helicopter flies
        overhead -- and past.

                                        MAGGIE
                            (shouting, waving)
                      Frank! Down here! Frank!
                                        
                                        GABE
                      Forget about it. He can't hear you.
                            (hands Maggie some rope)
                      Tie these together. Tight.

                                        MAGGIE
                            (realizing)
                      -- Are you out of your mind --

                                        GABE
                      This is rope from the Gordon exhibit.
                      The way guys climbed then, they'd tie
                      on three at a time -- this rope'll
                      take around nine hundred pounds.

                                        MAGGIE
                      Gabe -- this rope is sixty years old
                      --

                                        GABE
                            (misses the point)
                      Yeah, they made it pretty good then.
                      Each of these strands ought to hold
                      about 300 pounds before snapping.

        Gabe rapidly ties the rope to the piton -- Maggie works on the
        third connecting knot as she does the mental calculation of
        what she and Gabe weigh together.

                                        MAGGIE
                            (dazed)
                      Ought to. About.
                            (beat)
                      Will it hold?

        Gabe takes the line from her and lets it drop. Ninety feet of
        what looks like twine.

                                        GABE
                      Depends on how big a breakfast you
                      had. You want to go first?

        Maggie's stunned -- but there's no choice. She starts the
        rappel down, and Gabe is close behind.

        INSERT - THE THIRD BOMB

        is ready to blow -- 0:12 -- 0:11 --

        MAGGIE AND GABE - RAPPELLING DOWN

        To make this even trickier, they have to swing over to the
        side about fifteen feet to get to the cave -- meaning they
        have to move down in pendulum type swings that put even more
        pressure on

        THE ROPE

        which looks sorely tested at one knot -- it's coming undone --

        MAGGIE AND GABE - RAPPELLING

        They swing down lower -- twenty feet to the cave, four
        thousand to the ground --

        INSERT - THE BOMB

        -- 0:04 -- 0:03 --

        MAGGIE AND GABE - RAPPELLING

        They reach the end of the rope -- six feet above the cave
        and fifteen feet away laterally.

                                        GABE
                            (shouting)
                      Swing towards it -- and drop!

        Maggie nods -- they start the swing over -- as they get over
        the cave's lip --

        THE ROPE

        snaps --

        MAGGIE AND GABE

        fall, landing roughly on the cave's narrow lip -- Gabe
        starts to slip over, but Maggie pulls him back as --

        ABOVE ON THE WALL

        The bomb detonates and starts raining debris -- an instant,
        massive rockslide --

        MAGGIE AND GABE

        dive into the small cave as the rockslide tumbles past --
        exhausted, they collapse on the cave floor.

        THE HELICOPTER - OVER THE TOWER

        Frank, obviously, is surprised by the nearby explosion.

                                        FRANK
                      What the fuck --

        But he sees Kristel in a clearing. Face down in the snow.
        First things first.

        EXT. TOWER/CLEARING

        Frank lands near her, and rushes over to her. Frank turns her
        over and breaks a capsule under her nose. She "wakes up" with
        a start and looks "terrified".

                                        KRISTEL
                      What -- who are --

                                        FRANK
                      Don't worry. I'm here to help.

                                        KRISTEL
                            (recovered)
                      Glad to hear it.

        Kristel sees the snap is off Frank's holster -- she grabs it,
        spins it around, and pulls the trigger. CLICK. Frank grabs
        her wrist with a move faster than you'd expect from him, and
        he yanks the pistol back.

                                        FRANK
                      Jailhouse load. First chamber's
                      empty --
                            (aims gun)
                      -- the rest aren't. Forgive me, but
                      things have been a little strange this
                      morning.

        Nearby, the helicopter radio crackles to life. Frank backs
        toward the helicopter, keeping the gun trained on Kristel.

        But Frank only gets to the helicopter door before --

        DELMER

        comes out of hiding and empties a clip from his automatic into
        Frank. Frank is pinned to the door by the fusillade before he
        can even get a shot off. Travers runs over to Delmer and
        shoves the barrel up.

                                        TRAVER
                      Stop!
                            (explaining)
                      You'll damage the helicopter.

        As if to punctuate this, Frank -- and the now ruined pilot
        side door -- fall to the ground. The radio continues to squawk
        as Travers grabs Frank's discarded gun.

                                        TRAVERS
                            (to Kristel)
                      Answer that.

        Kristel brushes the snow off her and goes over to the radio.

                                        STUART (O.S.)
                            (over radio)

                      Rocky Mountain Rescue One, over --

        EXT. TREASURY PLANE CRASH SITE - DAY

        Wright, davis, and an irritated Stuart huddle over a radio.

                                        STUART
                      This is Ross Stuart, Federal Aviation
                      Administration -- please identify --
                      over --

        EXT. HELICOPTER - DAY

        By now, the others have come out of hiding and up to the
        helicopter. Kristel grabs some papers from a plastic packet on
        the helicopter seat -- and keys the mike.

                                        KRISTEL
                      Copy, FAA. This is Margaret Deighan,
                      Rocky Mountain Rescue. Over --

                                        STUART (O.S.)
                      We have an unconfirmed report of an
                      air crash in your area, and a distress
                      call on this frequency -- can you
                      confirm -- over --

                                        KRISTEL
                            (keying mike)
                      Copy, FAA. Distress call came at
                      approximately eleven hundred hours
                      yesterday. I investigated -- the call
                      turned out to be a false alarm. Over.

        EXT. TREASURY PLANE CRASH SITE - DAY

        Stuart gestures with exasperated triumph.

                                        STUART
                      Please repeat, Rocky Mountain
                      Rescue -- distress call was a false
                      alarm? -- over --

                                        KRISTEL (O.S.)
                            (over radio)
                      Repeat, distress call was a definite
                      false alarm -- we've had several here.
                      Somebody's sick idea of a joke. Do you
                      require further assistance -- over --

                                        STUART
                      Not from you. Thanks, Rocky Mountain
                      Rescue -- over and out --

        Stuart shuts off the radio with finality.

                                        STUART
                      I don't want to say I told you so. But
                      I did. Can I go back to work now?

        EXT. HELICOPTER/TOWER CLEARING - DAY

        Kristel smiles and puts the radio mike back into its bracket.

                                        TRAVERS
                      I almost believed you myself.

        Travers smiles and turns, looking at

        HAL

        trembling with fury and grief, bent over Frank's body as the
        last trace of vapor -- his breath -- trails from his lips.
        He's gone. Hal gently closes the eyes of his friend.

                                        HAL
                            (quiet)
                      Goodbye, Frank.

        Travers moves up behind Hal and kicks him.

                                        TRAVERS
                      Time for number three. Unless you want
                      to have a longer conversation with him
                      elsewhere.

                                        HAL
                            (low)
                      Fuck off.

        Travers kicks him in the face, knocking him into the snow.

                                        HAL
                      I think I'll wait here. You just
                      murdered three of my friends. Sooner
                      or later, whoever's chasing you is
                      going to show up and return the favor,
                      and I'd love to watch.

        Travers puts his gun at Hal's forehead and shrugs.

                                        TRAVERS
                      Suit yourself. You see, we just had a
                      little interface with several branches
                      of the federal government -- one of
                      whose members I know has zero
                      imagination -- and I can tell you, the
                      cavalry just isn't going to make it by
                      this week.
                            (beat)
                      No, you're taking us where we want to
                      go. Because you want to return that
                      favor and you want to do more than
                      watch. You want to kill me -- more
                      than anything, even more than you want
                      to keep on breathing, and with a
                      little more time you pray you'll get
                      that chance.
                            (tightens trigger)
                      Am I right?

        Hal's answer is a stony, loathing stare. He gets up. But --

        INSERT - HAL'S HAND

        -- we can see Hal has palmed something from Frank's body.

        INT. CAVE - GABE AND MAGGIE

        Dust from the rockslide is drifting past the cave opening, but
        the worst is over. Gabe rolls Maggie over carefully.

                                        GABE
                      Are you okay?

                                        MAGGIE
                      My ears are ringing -- but I'm all
                      right. Gabe, what's going on?

                                        GABE
                            (shows money in his pack)
                      This. That plane crash -- it's a half
                      dozen guys who were smart enough to
                      steal fifty million bucks, but dumb
                      enough to drop it all over the range.
                      They've got Hal as a bird dog -- and
                      right now they're heading for the rest
                      of it.

                                        MAGGIE
                      Where?

                                        GABE
                      It's close to the lake -- Hal's
                      probably leading them on the slowest
                      possible route down to it.
                           (stiffly gets up)
                      I can get there first -- all I have to
                      do is make it along the north wall to
                      the Bitker ladder --

                                        MAGGIE
                      "All?" Jesus, Gabe -- what do you
                      expect to do then?

                                        GABE
                            (aching)
                      Something -- subtle.

        Gabe lurches towards the cave opening, looking more like
        Quasimodo than a champion climber. Maggie stops him.

                                        MAGGIE
                      I'm going with you.

                                        GABE
                      No way. You're climbing back down --
                      try to get to the station or find some
                      help.

                                        MAGGIE
                      I'm just as good a climber as you
                      are -- and right now, I'm definitely
                      in better shape.

                                        GABE
                            (hard)
                      And you're definitely not going --

        Maggie stares Gabe down. Guess who won all the arguments when
        they were together. Gabe's face is a portrait of familiar
        exasperation.

                                        GABE
                      Okay. Come on --

        As they move out of the cave together, Gabe favors one foot.

                                        GABE
                      -- but the second you slow me down,
                      I'm leaving --
                            (slips on sore leg,
                             Maggie catches him)
                      -- I'm leaving you behind. Understood?

                                        MAGGIE
                            (helping Gabe out)
                      Anything you say, Gabe.

        EXT. TREASURY PLANE CRASH SITE - ON CHUNK OF WRECKAGE

        If you have a good imagination, this corner of charcoal looks
        like it could have been --

                                        WRIGHT (O.S.)
                      One of the currency cases.

        WRIGHT AND DAVIS

        are standing over some of the wreckage. One of the suits bags
        and tags the "briefcase".

                                        DAVIS
                      We've tested the ash inside -- it's
                      the right paper.

                                        WRIGHT
                      What about the men?

                                        DAVIS
                      It's -- hard to tell. But forensics
                      says yes. All of them were in the
                      plane.

                                        WRIGHT
                            (sags with the news)
                      Everything's accounted for, then --
                      time to head back and start making
                      excuses.
                            (beat)
                      Fifty million bucks up in smoke, and I
                      just don't give a shit. It's one more
                      run of the press. But we lost five
                      good men and they aren't so easily
                      replaced.
                            (beat)
                      Especially a guy like Travers.

        EXT. MOUNTAIN TOP/TOWER - HELICOPTER - DAY

        Dedicated agent Travers leans in reasonable comfort against
        the helicopter and keys his headset mike.

                                        TRAVERS
                      Qualen. How far along are you?

                                        QUALEN (O.S.)
                            (over radio)
                      Not as far as we'd be with the
                      helicopter.

        FURTHER DOWN ON MOUNTAIN/TOWER

        Qualen, Kristel and Delmer follow Hal's lead down the side --
        it's not too steep a grade, but it's solid rock and it's
        covered with ice and fresh snow -- all have to brace
        themselves with their hands to keep from slipping down.

                                        TRAVERS (O.S.)
                            (over radio)
                      We have less than half a tank of fuel,
                      Eric -- if we burn it up treasure
                      hunting we'll never get off this rock.
                      Now -- how far away are you?

                                        QUALEN
                            (keys radio)
                      It looks like two miles, but --

        Qualen's foot slides out from under him -- he catches himself.

                                        QUALEN
                      -- it'll take some time.

                                        TRAVERS (O.S.)
                            (over radio)
                      Time we have -- Walker's dead,
                      Wright's an idiot. And our guide --

                                        QUALEN
                            (keys radio)
                      What about him?

                                        TRAVERS (O.S.)
                            (over radio)
                      As soon as he becomes a convenience
                      instead of a necessity -- kill him.

                                        QUALEN
                            (keys radio)
                      Agreed.

        HAL

        can only hear Qualen's end of the conversation -- but his face
        shows he can guess what they're talking about.

                                                           CUT TO:

        GABE'S FACE - CLOSE

        Gabe's rattled too -- but for a brand new reason -- we PULL
        BACK to see Gabe at

        THE WIRE'S EDGE

        where the wire -- that wire -- links the buttress with the
        facing Tower. Whipping in the wind, it looks risky -- but
        that's not the problem.

        Gabe stares at the other edge for a moment. Immobile.
        Remembering Susan's death. Gabe shakes out of it when --

                                        MAGGIE
                      Gabe?
                            (beat)
                      I'll go first.

                                        GABE
                            (shakes his head)
                      If I don't go first, I might not go at
                      all.

        Gabe hooks his ankles over the wire and starts dragging
        himself, hand over hand, across the abyss -- no safety line
        this time. As his weight pulls the line taut, the wind rocks
        him back and forth. Gabe steadily drags himself out --

        GABE ON WIRE - LONG SHOT

        Fatigue stops Gabe in the middle -- a half mile up, strung
        between two gigantic mountains, he looks as insignificant and
        alone as a man possibly can be --

        CLOSER ON GABE

        Panting with exertion, frozen -- he can barely hold his grip
        and has an elbow crooked around the wire for support. Gabe's
        eyes are shut -- he looks near collapse --

        FLASHBACK - GABE'S POV

        Gabe is falling from the wire in slow motion, trailing
        Susan -- she spirals out of reach as his line SNAPS him
        back --

        GABE'S

        grip unconsciously relaxes -- but his eyes jolt open and he
        clamps both hands shut on the wire. Gabe, drawing on some
        inner fury, drags himself with long, sharp yanks --

        MAGGIE

        tensely watches Gabe's crossing --

        OVERVIEW - GABE

        is about ten feet away from the end --

        GABE'S UPSIDE-DOWN POV - THE END OF THE WIRE

        looks a lot further away than that --

        GABE

        pulls faster -- and reaches the other side. Gabe maintains his
        hand grip and swings his feet onto the ledge, leaning back
        against the wall to catch his breath.

                                        GABE
                            (winded, shouting across)
                      Think you can beat my time?

        MAGGIE

        smiles -- this is more like the Gabe she remembers. She gets
        on the wire and starts across in a fast, easy rhythm.

        GABE

        watches her, grinning. Admiration for Maggie is washing away
        bad memories of Susan.

                                        GABE
                            (to himself)
                      Shit -- she is in better shape.

        Maggie pulls across fearlessly -- but --

        INSERT - THE BOLT

        on Gabe's side of the wire is giving where Travers had
        hacked at it -- just a millimeter, but it's pulling loose --

        GABE

        doesn't notice and shouts across at Maggie, now half way.

                                        GABE
                            (enjoying it now)
                      Quit sandbagging it -- I haven't got
                      all day --

        INSERT - THE BOLT

        is coming looser -- Maggie's quicker crossing is thrashing the
        wire and straining the bolt's weakened anchoring --

        GABE - WATCHING MAGGIE

        who is now twenty feet away -- fifteen -- ten -- five --

        INSERT - THE BOLT

        pops out of the wall as if it were shot --

        THE WIRE

        which was tight as a bowstring fires out into the chasm --
        Maggie, stunned and without options, lets go two feet short
        of the ledge --

        GABE

        drops low just as Maggie starts to fall and swings his arm out
        towards hers in one lightning-fast motion --

        THEIR HANDS

        catch --

        GABE

        maintains his grip on Maggie's hand, but her weight nearly
        pulls him off the ledge -- Maggie drags him down, the window
        goes out of his chest when it collides with the ledge's
        bottom, but their grip holds.

        All of this in a split second. Maggie hangs from Gabe's arm,
        locked in terror -- but skill wins out over fear. She finds a
        handhold with her free arm, and climbs up to the ledge with
        Gabe's help. Maggie collapses into Gabe's arms and they fall
        back against the wall, but Gabe's the one who's really holding
        on tight.

                                        GABE
                      That -- tears it.
                            (gasping)
                      You're not coming any further.

                                        MAGGIE
                            (just as breathless)
                      Gabe -- you're going to get yourself
                      killed --

                                        GABE
                            (breath almost back)
                      Maybe. But I'm not getting you
                      killed.
                            (she starts a reply)
                      Look, Maggie. I don't know what'll
                      happen when I catch up with Hal -- but
                      I've got to know one thing for sure --
                      that you're making it off this
                      mountain. Alive.

        Gabe's eyes are pleading. Maggie hesitates. But gives in.

                                        MAGGIE
                      Okay.

        Gabe lightly kisses Maggie -- he doesn't want to turn this
        into a farewell kiss, afraid that that's really what it might
        be. They stand -- and separate. Gabe moves away.

                                        GABE
                      Get on the trail and stay out of
                      sight.
                            (beat)
                      I'll see you on the ground.

        Maggie wonders if she will as Gabe vanishes around a corner.

        EXT. TREASURY PLANE CRASH SITE - CLOSE ON BODY BAG

        as the zipper is pulled down -- before we can see anything we
        mercifully reverse POV to

        WRIGHT, DAVIS AND STUART

        near a helicopter, look down with disgust. Davis turns away.

                                        WRIGHT
                      I give up. What was it?

        A SEARCH PILOT zips the bag back up.

                                        SEARCH PILOT
                      ID says this used to be your pilot.
                            (beat)
                      And we found him seven miles east of
                      the wreck.

        Davis and Wright look at each other, drawing the same
        conclusion.

                                        WRIGHT
                      A hijack.
                            (beat)
                      The plane was hijacked. Son of a
                      bitch --

                                        STUART
                      Oh, give me a break. Your pilot lost
                      it when the flight started going
                      south, and he bailed --

                                        SEARCH PILOT
                      Excuse me -- but there's no parachute
                      there. Check it yourself.

        Before this can go on, a FORENSICS AGENT runs up to Stuart
        carrying a recorder.

                                        FORENSICS AGENT
                      Sir -- we found the flight recorder --
                      it was driven twenty feet deep into a
                      crater. It was demolished, but we
                      salvaged the recording --

                                        STUART
                            (grabbing it away)
                      I've heard a thousand of these, Wright
                      -- whoever was at the stick is going
                      to begin by screeching the Lord's
                      Prayer and wind up screaming "Oh,
                      shit" at ground zero --

        Stuart clicks the recorder on with a flourish, but his smug
        look melts as the voice of FBI agent Matheson explains --

                                        MATHESON (O.S.)
                            (shouting, rushed)
                      -- the money's been stolen -- Travers
                      and the pilot were in on it -- the
                      pilot's dead, but Travers took the
                      cash and made a mid-air transfer to a
                      jet flown by Qualen -- controls won't
                      respond --
                            (screaming)
                      shiiiiii--

        Matheson is cut off by the sound of impact, which is followed
        by silence. Wright gently turns the recorder off.

                                        WRIGHT
                      Guess we're both right, Stuart. Thanks
                      for your expertise.
                            (turns to pilot)
                      Well?
                            (jerking a thumb back)
                      You'll be waiting till Groundhog's Day
                      for him to pull his head out of his
                      ass -- let's get it in the air!

        Wright, Davis and the pilot scramble into a helicopter --
        Stuart pauses, but goes after them.

        EXT. MOUNTAIN WALL/TOWER - HIGH ANGLE - GABE MOVING ON A
        LEDGE

        that's a little narrower than your coffee table. It's got
        irregular breaks, causing it to go up or down several feet --
        and Gabe is jogging it, leaping across the ledge's gaps,
        leaning toward the wall -- and away from the four thousand
        foot drop.

        Gabe's gotten his second wind -- he keeps jumping from ledge
        to ledge with the ease that comes from skill and familiarity,
        and with renewed purpose. Gabe makes the last jump to a
        section of ledge near the bottom of

        THE "BITKER" LADDER

        which consists of metal rungs woven into loose steel cable
        bolted into the rock, running two hundred feet to the top --
        something left behind by a past expedition, now a tourist's
        toy. And the bottom rung is three feet above Gabe's
        outstretched arms.

                                        GABE
                      Hasn't gotten any lower in the last
                      year.
                            (coiling for jump)
                      Bitker, you cheap bastard. Would
                      another four feet have killed you?

        Gabe leaps up, grabbing the bottom rung instead of a half mile
        of air, and he shoots up the ladder as we PULL BACK --

        WIDER ANGLE ON MOUNTAIN WALL

        A closer look at terrain seen earlier -- fifty yards away from
        the ladder, a waterfall is spewing out of the wall, giving the
        appearance that the mountain has sprung a torrential leak.

        As we track Gabe up the ladder, we can see where the water's
        coming from -- a whirling lake on top of the mountain. Its
        constant motion keeps it from totally freezing, but the lake
        is still coated with a veneer of ice, moving in thick chunks
        through circular currents on the surface.

        ELSEWHERE ON MOUNTAIN SLOPE - HAL AND GANG

        are negotiating the grade, which is slippery, thanks to the
        fresh, thick snow -- we can see from their relative position
        to the lake that Gabe has a lead on them. A very slight one.

        TOP OF LADDER - GABE

        pulls himself over and starts running -- as he does, he
        uproots a big, 3' x 3' park service sign commemorating the
        "BITKER CLIMB" and takes it with him, moving ahead into a

        WOODED AREA

        where Gabe replants the sign near the top of another slope.
        Gabe heads down towards some rocks -- -- and spots the third
        case, which took a tough landing on one rock -- it's shattered
        into halves, and the bands of $5000s are scattered around in
        the snow.

        Gabe rushes down behind a rock and starts gathering the
        cash -- soaked by the snow, they've frozen into ice bricks. As
        Gabe stuffs them into his pack, he's startled by something
        coming over the rock -- Gabe whirls around to face

        A RABBIT

        that's landed in the snow and looks a lot more frightened than
        Gabe was. Gabe leans back, relieved. For now.

        EXT. FURTHER UP ON SLOPE - HAL AND GANG

        are closer now -- but as they move down, Hal freezes in place
        as he sees the "Bitker" sign some distance ahead. The sign is
        out of place. A signal from Gabe -- he is alive. And here.

        Qualen and the others check the monitor. Hal takes the
        opportunity to back up to a rock formation and swiftly, subtly
        wedge something into a crack behind his back --

        INSERT - THE OBJECT

        is what Hal lifted off Frank's body -- a speed load cylinder
        from a revolver, with six fresh bullets in it.

        QUALEN

        checks the monitor -- the relative position shows they're --

                                        QUALEN
                      Almost there.

        -- but Qualen's grin is wiped away as he looks down at --

        THE MONITOR

        -- the tracer blip is moving -- fast -- away from their
        position!

        QUALEN'S

        face shifts from incredulity to realization to rage.

        All eyes are on the monitor -- Hal, at the rock formation, has
        one hand behind his back.

        INSERT - HAL'S HAND

        shakes a box of matches from his sleeve -- he slides a single
        wooden match halfway out of the pack -- and ignites it with
        his thumbnail --

        HAL

        moves away from the rock, to draw their attention from what
        he's been doing --

                                        HAL
                      Oh, no -- you didn't lose another
                      one, did you?

        Delmer clicks off his safety and aims at Hal -- Qualen runs
        into the woods, guided by the monitor -- Kristel follows.
        Delmer backs Hal up at gunpoint. Hal deliberately moves in a
        semi-circle, putting Delmer's back to the rocks.

                                        DELMER
                      What about him?

                                        QUALEN
                            (over his shoulder)
                      Kill him! Now!

        Delmer grins as he aims at Hal.

                                        DELMER
                      Tell me -- where would you like the
                      first half dozen shots to go?

        INSERT - THE MATCH

        has burned more than halfway down to the rest of the box,
        which is behind the speed load cylinder --

        HAL AND DELMER

                                        HAL
                            (hands up)
                      As long as you're taking requests --
                      how about -- the base of your spine?

        Delmer smiles and starts to squeeze the trigger -- Hal tenses
        up, it's now or never --

        INSERT - THE MATCH

        burns down to the box, igniting all the matches --

        ON DELMER

        as there is the sudden sound of six distinct, consecutive
        gunshots behind him -- the fire's blasted the powder in all
        the bullets. Delmer, startled, spins around and FIRES up,
        FIRES down, FIRES across -- by the time he realizes no one's
        there and he turns back around to find --

        -- Hal is gone, vanished into the woods.

        FOLLOWING QUALEN

        through the woods -- up a slope, around a tree, down another
        slope -- his eyes fixed on the screen and the blip that's
        zig-zagging just ahead of him.

                                        QUALEN
                            (tagging headset radio)
                      Travers. Get down here. Now.

        TRAVERS

        is trying to repair the helicopter door when the call comes.

                                        TRAVERS
                      Have you found the money?

                                        QUALEN (O.S.)
                      No. Walker has.

        Travers, furious, flings the door aside, jumps into the copter
        and starts the rotor.

        QUALEN

        is running alone, following the monitor lead -- until he sees
        a band of $5000s in the snow. Sure he's on the right track,
        Qualen picks it up and picks up his pace too. But we can see
        that behind him and higher up --

        GABE

        who is on a rise behind a rock, watches Qualen's futile
        pursuit from a distance, amused. Amused, until --

                                        KRISTEL
                      You would have lived longer, if you
                      weren't such a smartass.

        Gabe spins his head around -- and his temple smacks into
        Kristel's gun barrel.

                                        KRISTEL
                      You telegraphed this kind of stunt
                      with that joke snowman. Too bad for
                      you we're not all gullible.

        Kristel starts to squeeze the trigger.

                                        GABE
                      Good thing for Qualen you are.

                                        KRISTEL
                            (pauses, wary)
                      What do you mean?

                                        GABE
                      When he comes back, he's going to
                      shoot you and the other guy, grab the
                      money, and take off with Travers.

                                        KRISTEL
                            (squeezing trigger again)
                      No sale. Say "night-night" --

                                        GABE
                            (talking fast)
                      He already blew up one of your pals in
                      that crevice. And I've been in that
                      copter. It goes a hell of a lot
                      farther with two people than with
                      four.
                            (beat)
                      Am I wrong? Give him a buzz.

        Kristel eases back with the gun.

                                        KRISTEL
                      You've got my attention.

                                        GABE
                      You've also got all the money. And I
                      can show you how to get off the
                      mountain with it. Right now.

        ELSEWHERE ON MOUNTAIN - HAL

        tears into a clearing, trying to put some distance between him
        and Delmer -- as soon as he's out in the open, though,

        THE HELICOPTER

        thunders over Hal -- Travers FIRES down at Hal through the
        doorless pilot's side. Bullets kick up tufts of snow at Hal's
        heels as he runs down into a steep, sloping wooded area. The
        tree cover is too thick for Travers to take good aim. Looks
        like temporary refuge -- but

        INSIDE THE HELICOPTER

        Travers finds a new use for the search copter's heat
        scope -- using the blip that betrays Hal's body heat as a
        guide, Travers can still fire down through the trees at

        HAL

        who's still running down the grade -- he hasn't been hit yet,
        but there's an awful lot of bad luck in the air --

        TRAVERS

        banks the helicopter around and up for another pass.

        EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE MOUNTAIN/TOWER WOODS - QUALEN

        is slogging uphill after his own tracer blip -- which is
        turning back around and heading towards him. Qualen aims his
        gun and waits, but at the top of the hill --

        THE RABBIT

        that spooked Gabe earlier sticks its head up for a curious
        sniff. It has the tracer fastened to its neck with a currency
        band. Furious, Qualen FIRES at the rabbit -- it safely speeds
        away as Qualen smashes the useless tracer monitor and turns
        around.

        EXT. TRAVERS IN HELICOPTER - TRAVERS POV

        On the heat scope. The blip that represents Hal -- vanishes.
        Delmer, who has caught up, is at the edge of the tree-lined
        area -- he looks up at Travers.

                                        TRAVERS
                            (keying headset radio)
                      He's hiding twenty yards in -- be
                      careful.

        EXT. WOODS - DELMER

        "replies", beeping twice on the headset's ear button as he
        moves downhill into the woods, closely following Hal's
        tracks -- they lead up to the replanted "BITKER" sign. Just
        big enough to hide behind. Delmer smiles, and advances toward
        the sign --

        -- and looks behind it. Nothing but a mound of snow. Delmer
        looks again to the tracks, which lead toward

        A SMALL ROCK FORMATION

        also big enough to conceal Hal. Delmer moves toward it as --

        BEHIND THE "BITKER" SIGN

        the mound of snow shifts as Hal climbs out, silently shaking
        off the cover -- the snow hid him not only from Delmer, but
        from the heat scope as well --

        TRAVERS IN HELICOPTER

        hovers overhead, watching Delmer's blip on the heat scope --
        but Hal's blip returns, rushing ahead --

                                        TRAVERS
                            (keying headset radio)
                      He's right behind you!

        DELMER

        whirls around at the warning, his gun BLAZING, but Hal is too
        fast -- he swings the sign like a club, knocking Delmer's gun
        away into the snow. Before Hal can swing again, Delmer
        brutally punches Hal in the face -- stunned, Hal drops the
        sign --

        IN HELICOPTER - TRAVERS POV

        Travers can't do anything now but watch the heat scope as if
        it were a video game -- now it's just one big blip --

        DELMER AND HAL

        thrash around in the snow, pummelling each other -- Hal's
        getting the worst of it, as Delmer manages to get on top of
        him and deliver a series of punishing blows to his face. Ready
        to end it, Delmer tries to get the bolt gun off a clip on his
        front pack strap -- but he has trouble unfastening it. Hal
        rallies with a solid punch to Delmer's face. Hal gets Delmer
        off of him and follows with two more.

        Delmer is knocked away, landing on the sign board -- but clear
        from Hal -- another chance to get the bolt gun off --

        Hal quickly moves to the sign and grabs its post -- before
        Delmer can move off the sign's board, Hal's running forward.
        shoving the sign ahead of him with Delmer on top -- Hal lets
        go, and the sign, with Delmer, sleds downhill on the hard
        packed snow --

        TRAVERS IN HELICOPTER - TRAVERS

        can now see one blip moving quickly away from the other --

                                        TRAVERS
                            (into radio)
                      Something's moving fast down the
                      hill -- is it Tucker?

        HAL

        has found Delmer's fallen headset radio and put it on.

                                        TRAVERS (O.S.)
                            (over radio)
                      Answer me! Is it Tucker?

        Hal smiles and beeps twice -- affirmative.

        IN HELICOPTER

        Happy at last, Travers takes off after the blip, flying down
        the incline and staying just above the trees, strafing an
        intense fusillade at

        DELMER

        who's screaming as a storm of bullets rip through him and the
        sign and the surrounding snow, keeping pace with his downhill
        slide --

        TRAVERS IN HELICOPTER

        FIRES until his clip is empty -- he heads for the end of the
        tree line as his target comes out, skidding to a stop in the
        snow. Travers gleefully moves lower down for a closer look
        but is shocked to see

        DELMER - ON "SLED"

        Delmer's highly perforated body rolls off the sign as it
        finally skids to a dead halt.

        CLOSE ON TRAVERS

        who is apoplectic -- he's just shot one of his own men.

                                        HAL (O.S.)
                            (over radio)
                      Thanks loads.
                            (beat)
                      I couldn't have killed him without
                      you.

        Travers looks down at the heat scope -- blank.

        HAL

        is hiding his body "heat" under a rock formation.

        IN HELICOPTER

        Stymied, Travers furiously banks it away from the wooded area
        and circles around the mountain's other side.

        EXT. MOUNTAIN - SLOPING GRADE - GABE AND KRISTEL

        Gabe, hands on his head, moves down a slope near a mountain
        edge, ahead of Kristel, who's aiming her gun at his back.

                                        KRISTEL
                      How much further?

                                        GABE
                            (stops)
                      It's right over there.

        Gabe nods ahead, indicating what looks like a

        A SHED

        that is partially obscured by snow, about twenty feet distant
        across a snowy plateau.

        GABE AND KRISTEL

                                        GABE
                      It's a storage locker for the rangers.
                      Everything you need to get off the
                      mountain is in there -- skiis, food --
                      I'll show you --

        Gabe shows a sudden burst of enthusiasm and starts quickly
        moving ahead again -- Kristel suspiciously notices this --

                                        KRISTEL
                      Don't move.

        Kristel gets ahead of Gabe and walks backward, keeping her gun
        trained on him as she crunches through the snow.

                                        KRISTEL
                      Skiis, food -- and maybe guns too,
                      right?
                            (moves backward)
                      Keep walking. Not too close.

                                        GABE
                      We'd make better time walking straight
                      ahead. Qualen's not going to be
                      hopping down the bunny trail too much
                      longer.

                                        KRISTEL
                            (walking backward)
                      Right. So I'd better have one less
                      problem when he arrives.

                                        GABE
                            (knowing this means him)
                      Don't fuck up. You still need me to
                      show you a route off the mountain.

                                        KRISTEL
                      You've worn that one out, Walker --
                            (snaps back bolt)
                      -- I'll find my own way down.

        Kristel solidly plants her feet firmly to shoot Gabe, but her
        feet sink through the crystallized snow cover -- --
        Kristel completely disappears down through the snow as it
        collapses under her -- she's pulling the trigger and SHOTS
        go wild as she sinks and sinks --

        ON GABE

        who's had to drop flat on his stomach to avoid the same
        fate -- as he scrambles back to solid land, Kristel's SHOTS
        arc up through the snow toward him, and the snow crumbles
        around him -- but he bellies ahead as --

        ON THE SNOWDRIFT'S TOP

        Kristel's GUNSHOTS slow, and finally, stop, the very last of
        them loosening the snow around --

        THE "SHED"

        that was obscured by snow was a tall, three-sided park service
        sign shouting "WARNING -- SNOWDRIFT -- DO NOT CROSS" in eight
        different languages. The rest of the snow falls away from it,
        revealing a cautionary but cheesy illustration -- a
        stick-figure fatally sinking into the snow.

        GABE

        bellies ahead, flat on his stomach, testing the snow with the
        ice axe's staff -- only when he hits something solid with it
        does he get back up to his feet. But the sound of ice-crusted
        snow CRUNCHING above Gabe alerts him that --

        QUALEN

        has just hit the top of the slope and spotted him -- Qualen's
        gun BLAZES down --

        GABE

        is on the run, but it's that lead-footed, slow motion stuff
        that only happens in nightmares -- with every step, a foot
        breaks through the icy crust and sinks into two feet of
        snow -- Gabe stays just ahead of the barrage, making it into

        A THICK WOODED AREA

        which is very temporary refuge -- Qualen will be down in
        seconds. Gabe looks down the slope. Running is impractical. So
        he sits down.

        QUALEN

        arrives where Gabe was and looks down the slope --

        QUALEN'S POV - GABE

        is whizzing down the slope in a sitting position, using his
        back and his shoes as gliders, the ice axe as a rudder.
        Alpinists call this a "sitting glissade". Colorado climbers
        call it "butt skiing". Some psychos do this for fun.

        GABE'S POV - THE SLIDE

        is anything but fun -- Gabe can't control his speed or
        direction well at all -- Gabe barely manages to steer in and
        out of trees and boulders in his path --

        QUALEN

        starts running down the slope -- he doesn't have speed, but he
        does have the machine gun -- he FIRES short bursts at --

        GABE

        who tries to steer away from the line of fire -- Gabe is hit
        in the shoulder -- he slides out of control, and rolls down --

        -- to the slope's bottom. Gabe painfully lifts himself up and
        moves through the woods, coming out of the trees to

        THE LAKE

        The bridge that spans it is ahead of Gabe -- but there is
        nothing around but flat terrain. It's a beautiful sight, but
        no good for hiding. And Qualen is right behind him.

        EXT. MOUNTAIN SLOPE - HAL

        rushes down to Delmer's body -- in the snow, he finds the
        discarded machine gun and holds it up, but stray bullets from
        Travers' fusillade have made it inoperable. Hal tosses it
        aside and checks Delmer's bloody pockets for more weapons.
        Nothing. Just a couple of machine gun clips, and the bolt gun.

        EXT. MOUNTAIN TRAIL - MAGGIE

        is wending her way down a hiking trail on the opposite side of
        the mountain. In plain view,

        TRAVERS IN HELICOPTER

        is circling the mountain -- he spots Maggie from on high and
        moves down after her.

        MAGGIE

        hears the helicopter, and turns around -- she has no way of
        knowing it isn't Frank, so she takes off her jacket and waves
        it as a signal --

                                        MAGGIE
                      Frank! Down here!

        The helicopter moves down until Maggie can see --

        TRAVERS

        is at the controls.

        MAGGIE

        starts running, but it's useless. Nowhere to hide. Travers
        hovers over her, FIRING ahead of her, FIRING behind her, not
        to kill, just to make a point. He's in charge.

        EXT. MOUNTAIN TRAIL

        Maggie finally stops -- Travers lands the copter and opens the
        passenger door, keeping his gun trained on her.

                                        TRAVERS
                      Hop in. I know someone who'd like to
                      see you again before he dies.

        EXT. BOTTOM OF THE SLOPE - QUALEN

        moves down to the slope's edge, noting with pleasure the blood
        in the snow. Gabe is wounded, and he's left a trail as a
        bonus.

        Qualen moves out lakeside -- nothing visible but the thick,
        flat ice chunks circling in the currents. But Gabe's
        footprints and blood lead straight ahead to the bridge.

        Qualen starts to run across the bridge, but stares down --

        QUALEN'S POV - THE BRIDGE'S PLANKS

        The blood -- and slush from Gabe's boots -- end halfway
        across.

        QUALEN

        Smiles and shakes his head. Too obvious. Gabe is hiding
        underneath the bridge, in the three foot deep network of steel
        supports. Qualen slows his pace, staring down through the
        thin, but visible cracks between the planks.

        TIGHT CLOSE-UP - GABE'S FACE

        grimacing, shivering, ashen from his wound and exertion --
        lined shadows on his face confirm he is under the bridge.

                                        QUALEN (O.S.)
                      You've come a long way to die.

        QUALEN

        enjoying himself, slams a fresh clip into his machine gun.

                                        QUALEN
                      If you were smart, you'd have left
                      your friend behind. I would have.
                      There's no shame in staying alive.

        Qualen stops, staring down. Through the gaps, Gabe's parka is
        visible. Right where the blood trail ends.

                                        QUALEN
                            (aims down)
                      But you're not smart. And now you're
                      going to die from an overdose of
                      heroism.

        Qualen BLAZES the gun into the planks --

        UNDER THE BRIDGE - GABE

        is clinging to the steel supports of the small bridge,
        several feet ahead of where his empty parka is being
        shredded by the FUSILLADE -- without the parka, Gabe is
        freezing, and too many bullets are coming too close for
        comfort as they RICOCHET on the bridge's supports --

        QUALEN

        stops firing and kicks away the planks, which are a tangle of
        toothpicks at this point -- Qualen bends down --

        -- and sees there's nothing in the parka except for Gabe's
        back. Qualen's face registers anger and surprise as -- -- Gabe
        appears at the edge of the hole -- before Qualen can react,
        Gabe swings up with his ice axe, hooking it around the
        shoulder strap of Qualen's machine gun -- Gabe yanks down,
        and Qualen falls head first

        UNDER THE BRIDGE

        with Gabe -- Qualen catches himself by hooking an arm and a
        leg on one of the steel supports -- but both

        THE ICE AXE AND THE GUN

        fall, landing on separate chunks of ice floating underneath
        the bridge --

        IN THE SUPPORTS

        Gabe pulls himself through the girders to Qualen and punches
        him with his good arm, but Qualen is unfazed -- neither are in
        good position, it's like a fistfight on a jungle gym -- --
        Qualen steadies himself to savagely punch Gabe in his
        shoulder wound -- Gabe YELLS in pain and tries to block the
        next one, but Qualen punches him again, and Gabe lets go of
        the support, falling -- -- on the way down, Gabe grabs
        Qualen's leg with his good hand -- too low to grab the bridge,
        Gabe dangles just over the water, raising his legs above it as
        Qualen tries to kick him off -- -- Gabe holds onto Qualen's
        leg, and swings on it like a pendulum -- Gabe twists the leg
        -- Qualen loses his grip on the icy steel and lets go --
        both

        QUALEN AND GABE

        fall -- they land hard, not in the water, but on a
        raft-sized chunk of ice driven under the bridge by the
        current. Their weight teeter-totters the ice as they get up --
        they're in danger not just from each other, but from

        THE FAST APPROACHING WHIRLPOOL

        where the ice chunks are drawn into the fiercely swirling
        vortex that drains into the waterfall --

        ON THE ICE RAFT

        Qualen and Gabe circle each other like cautious boxers, as the
        ice itself swirls in the current -- if either makes the wrong
        move, they'll both go over. Gabe swings at Qualen, but Qualen
        throws a leg under Gabe and stiff-arms him down -- Gabe hits
        the ice hard, his chest hanging over the side -- Qualen moves
        in to shove him off -- but their combined weight on the same
        side of the ice starts to tip it over -- Gabe viciously
        kicks Qualen back, gashing his face with his boot's crampon as
        Qualen grabs the ice raft's opposite side, levelling it.

                                        QUALEN
                            (wiping the gash)
                      Stalemate, isn't it?

                                        GABE
                            (winded)
                      Not any more.

        Gabe, still prone, reaches out -- the chunk of ice with
        Qualen's machine gun is floating by. Gabe snatches up the gun
        and pulls the trigger. Nothing but an empty CLICK.

                                        QUALEN
                      Far more intimidating when it's
                      loaded.

        The chunk of ice with Gabe's ice axe floats by Gabe -- Gabe
        grabs for it, but misses -- as the ice raft spins around,
        Qualen manages to snatch it up -- Qualen scythes it down at
        Gabe, slamming the blade into the ice as Gabe rolls away --

        WIDER VIEW - THE ICE RAFT

        is nearing the center of the whirlpool -- the current is
        faster and stronger here -- if it doesn't swallow the ice
        raft, it will definitely upend it --

        QUALEN AND GABE

        stay on opposite sides of the ice raft for balance -- Qualen
        swings out at Gabe with the axe. Gabe ducks and tries to go
        low to hit Qualen with the gun, but Qualen swings the axe down
        again, whizzing right past Gabe as it sinks into --

        THE CENTER OF THE ICE RAFT

        -- a crack spiderwebs through the ice around the blade --

        GABE

        quickly reacts, jumping onto another bed-sized chunk of ice
        floating by, landing on his stomach and braking himself by
        digging his crampons in -- just as --

        QUALEN

        realizing what deep shit he's in, looks for another chunk of
        ice to make the same move -- to sees one just out of reach.
        Qualen pulls the ice axe out of the raft's center to drag the
        other chunk closer in -- -- as he does, the entire raft
        disintegrates under him -- Qualen plunges into the water, and
        tries to maintain a slippery grip on what ice is left --

        -- but now at the center of the whirlpool, Qualen is drawn
        into the vortex --

        GABE

        struggles to his feet and looks down, wincing --

        GABE'S POV - QUALEN GOING DOWN

        Qualen's inaudible scream is just a burst of rising bubbles as
        he shoots down to the bottom of the lake -- and beyond --

        QUALEN'S POV - UNDERWATER

        Qualen is shoved with incredible force and speed through the
        lake's tunnel drain --

        ON THE MOUNTAIN WALL - THE WATERFALL

        BLASTS OUT full force, hurling a still thrashing Qualen a
        half a mile to the ground below!

        GABE

        has no time to celebrate -- the chunk of ice he's on leaves
        him moments from the same fate. One more time around, and
        it's down the drain. Gabe takes a deep breath. No choice. He
        leaps --

        WIDER VIEW - THE ICE - GABE LEAPING

        -- from one chunk of ice to the other, running the way you
        would across stones in a stream, zig-zagging to catch the ones
        big enough to support him -- only his crampons keep him from
        sliding off, only his momentum keeps him from capsizing the
        ice chunks, which shoots away from him in his wake --

        GABE

        lands on an ice raft floating towards the bridge. No choice --
        Gabe lunges off the ice raft and reaches for one of the bridge
        supports -- his hand catches -- but it's slippery and he's
        weakened -- Gabe slides off, but --

        A HAND

        reaches down and grabs him --

        HAL

        pulls Gabe the rest of the way onto the bridge. Gabe's
        surprise gives way to a grin almost as big as Hal's.

                                        HAL
                            (eyeing Gabe's ruined
                             shirt)
                      Nice outfit.
                            (hands him his parka)
                      I know you never liked the orange, but
                      --

                                        GABE
                      Didn't care for the Smokey The Bear
                      hats, either. That's why I quit.
                            (pulls on parka)
                      You all right?

                                        HAL
                      I feel better than you look. I can
                      live with that.

        Gabe looks down at the parka -- it's completely full of
        bullet holes.

                                        GABE
                      Hardly seems worth zipping, huh?
                            (serious now)
                      Frank?

        Hal sobers -- shakes his head no. A cloud passes over Gabe's
        face.

                                        HAL
                      It's not over, Gabe. Travers took the
                      helicopter.

        INSIDE HELICOPTER - FLYING ELSEWHERE OVER MOUNTAIN

        Maggie's hands are cuffed to a bar on the helicopter's roof.
        Travers keys his headset radio while piloting the copter.

                                        TRAVERS
                            (into radio)
                      Qualen -- Kristel -- come in --

        HAL AND GABE ON BRIDGE

        Gabe hears Hal's borrowed headset radio crackling -- he holds
        his hand out to Hal.

                                        GABE
                      May I?
                            (dons it, keys it)
                      They can't talk right now, Travers.
                      Kristel's busy making snow angels --
                      and I'm not sure, but I think Qualen
                      is still falling.
                            (radio silence)
                      Any messages?

        A moment's silence -- then --

                                        MAGGIE (O.S.)
                            (over radio)
                      Gabe?

                                        GABE
                            (keying it)
                      Maggie --

        INSIDE COPTER - TRAVERS

        yanks the radio off Maggie and puts it back on --

                                        TRAVERS
                            (into radio)
                      You wanted to make a trade earlier,
                      Walker -- still interested?

                                        GABE (O.S.)
                            (pause)
                      I've got the money. Fly to the lake.
                      And if you touch her --

        Travers cuts off the radio, smiles, and banks the helicopter
        down around the mountain wall.

        GABE AND HAL ON BRIDGE

                                        HAL
                      Now what?

                                        GABE
                      I have no fucking idea.
                            (holds Qualen's gun)
                      Empty.

                                        HAL
                            (smiling)
                      Not for long.

        Hal fishes into his pockets and pulls out one of the ammo
        clips he took from Delmer, Gabe tries to force it into the
        gun's stock -- but it's the wrong size.

                                        GABE
                            (sagging against rail)
                      Why can't anything be easy?

        THE HELICOPTER

        thunders around the mountain wall, getting closer --

        HAL AND GABE

        have crossed the bridge, near the mountain edge -- Gabe, now
        wearing his pack again, nods over to the wooded area.

                                        GABE
                      Stay over there --

                                        HAL
                      Look -- let me --

                                        GABE
                      -- what, throw snowballs at him?
                      Just -- whatever happens -- get Maggie
                      out of here.

                                        HAL
                            (relenting)
                      Count on it.
                            (beat)
                      And Gabe? Thanks for tagging along.

                                        GABE
                            (smiles)
                      Thanks for asking. I forgot how much I
                      enjoyed rescue work.

        Gabe limps toward the mountain's edge as Hal runs into the
        woods.

        THE HELICOPTER

        blasts along the wall towards the lake -- the waterfall and
        the ladder are just ahead. The copter radio crackles --

                                        WRIGHT (O.S.)
                            (from radio)
                      Come in, Rocky Mountain Rescue --
                      urgent -- come in --

        Travers recognizes the voice -- frowning, he snaps off the
        radio and banks the helicopter up over the top --

        TRAVERS IN HELICOPTER - TRAVERS POV

        tops the precipice, revealing Gabe, standing on the end of a
        narrow spur -- it just out from the edge like a diving board.
        Gabe has his pack on one arm -- the money is visible. Gabe
        levels Qualen's emptied gun on Travers and the copter -- this
        bluff is all he has left.

                                        GABE
                            (over radio)
                      Remember that bet you made? About
                      whether I could find the money for you
                      or not?
                            (holds pack over drop)
                      You won.

        Travers helplessly flies in low, tight circles over Gabe and
        the spur -- if he shoots Gabe, the money falls too, Travers
        presses his gun at Maggie.

                                        TRAVERS
                            (into radio)
                      I'll kill her --

                                        GABE
                            (over radio)
                      You do, and the spring thaw's going to
                      be worth thirty million bucks.
                            (pause)
                      No rush. I'm sure you've got lots of
                      time.

                                        TRAVERS
                            (into radio)
                      All right. Drop the gun first.

                                        GABE
                            (into radio)
                      When she's safe on the ground.

        EXT. SPUR/COPTER

        Travers has no choice but to give in -- he gives Maggie the
        handcuff key, and she frees herself as he flies away from the
        spur, touching the copter down on the mountain top.

                                        TRAVERS
                            (to Maggie)
                      Get out.

        Maggie moves out the door and stares uncertainly at Gabe.

                                        GABE
                            (shouting)
                      Run!
                            (she doesn't)
                      Run!

        Maggie runs for the trees. When Gabe is sure she's safe, he
        throws the gun away -- but keeps the pack suspended over the
        edge.

                                        GABE
                            (into radio)
                      Now come and get it. My arm's getting
                      tired.

        EXT. HELICOPTER

        Travers flies the copter up and over, until he and it are five
        feet away from Gabe's position on the spur. Gabe is buffeted
        by the copter's wind, but stands firm. Travers levels his gun
        at Gabe through the open passenger door as Gabe heaves the
        pack in. Travers doesn't even look down -- he just stares at
        Gabe with hate as he prepares to shoot.

                                        GABE
                            (shouting)
                      Don't you want to count it?

        Puzzled, Travers takes his gun hand and rips open

        THE PACK

        The $5000s are there -- but they've been shredded by
        Qualen's earlier blast of gunfire. Few, if any, of the bills
        are passable.

        TRAVERS

        stares down, incredulous -- as he does --

        GABE

        rips open a perforated section of parka and yanks his bolt
        gun from his waist --

        Travers looks up and raises his gun at Gabe -- but Gabe fires
        first -- the bolt imbeds itself high in Travers' chest.
        Gasping, Travers drops his gun -- it falls over the pack and
        out the open door -- Travers clutches at his chest --

                                        GABE
                      Don't spend it all in one place, you
                      son of a bitch.

        Travers falls back in his seat and loses control of the
        helicopter -- it spins around, and Gabe has to instantly
        flatten to avoid the tail when it swings at him -- Gabe looks
        down as --

        THE HELICOPTER

        quickly begins to spiral down in wide, aimless circles --
        Travers has clearly lost control --

        GABE

        stares down coldly, waiting for the crash -- but --

        INSIDE THE COPTER - TRAVERS

        won't give up -- sweating, bleeding, he sits forward and
        grabs the stick, seizing control of the helicopter again --

        GABE'S POV - THE HELICOPTER

        stops its uncontrolled descent and begins to rise up and
        up -- with clear purpose --

        CLOSE ON GABE

        eyes widening with realization. Gabe gets up from the spur and
        starts running back towards the woods -- several hundred yards
        from safety -- before he can get very far --

        THE HELICOPTER

        tops the precipice edge and, sweeping low over the snow, it
        gets between Gabe and the trees, cutting him off --

        WOODED AREA - HAL AND MAGGIE

        watch, powerless --

                                        HAL
                      He's going to run Gabe down --

        TRAVERS IN HELICOPTER

        Ashen, hyperventilating, he's running on pure adrenalin and
        fury as he drives the stick forward --

        TRAVERS POV - GABE

        is stiff-legging it toward the edge of the mountain -- but
        he's too banged up to run fast through the thick snow --

        THE HELICOPTER

        with its skids skipping just over the snow overtakes --

        GABE

        as he throws himself flat into the snow -- the front of the
        skid misses Gabe by inches as it blasts over him --

        THE HELICOPTER

        moves out over the precipice edge -- Travers banks it wide to
        circle back around for another run --

        GABE

        gets back up as the helicopter swings back behind him --

        IN A WOODED AREA

        Hal rips the lining out of one of his pockets and stuffs it
        into one of the ammo clips -- Maggie stays back as he runs for
        all he's worth out into the clearing --

        THE HELICOPTER

        has circled back around, stopping at a hover far back in the
        clearing -- Travers intends to not just run Gabe over, but to
        run him off the edge as well --

        GABE

        lumbers as fast as he can towards the edge --

        TRAVERS

        knows he has Gabe nailed -- he shoves the stick forward --

        THE HELICOPTER

        flies forward, skids just inches over the snow --

        HAL

        runs out to where Travers is heading -- he lights the cloth
        in the ammo clip -- as

        THE HELICOPTER

        flies past

        IN THE CLEARING

        Hal hurls the clip, with its cloth "fuse" burning down, into
        the doorless side of the copter --

        INSIDE THE HELICOPTER

        -- the makeshift bomb bounces to the floor of the cockpit --
        Travers sees it and looks down, but --

        THE "FUSE"

        sputters out -- nothing but glowing embers in the cloth --

        TRAVERS

        smiles -- nothing to worry about -- he speeds ahead --

        CLOSE ON THE HELICOPTER'S SKIDS

        as they slice through the top of the snow towards --

        GABE

        as he runs toward the mountain's edge -- it's just a couple of
        feet ahead, but the copter is a couple of feet behind --

        -- as the copter overtakes Gabe, dipping even lower into the
        snow, he dives off the edge --

        FOLLOWING GABE - FALLING

        Gabe is at the ladder -- he falls the first twenty feet of the
        long drop, then grabs a rung on the cable ladder, very
        painfully stopping his fall -- but in the same split second --

        THE HELICOPTER

        skid meant to impale Gabe catches the top two rungs of the
        cable ladder --

        WIDE SHOT - THE HELICOPTER

        -- caught in the rungs of the cable ladder, the helicopter
        keeps flying out over the abyss, but as it pulls the cable
        ladder, it pops out the bolts that hold the ladder in place,
        rung by rung -- -- still going full tilt, the copter strains
        against the ladder -- thirty feet of it tethers the copter
        to the wall -- -- and Gabe is dangling from the center of
        it.

        ON THE LADDER - GABE

        has one arm hooked around a rung, hanging on for his life as
        the copter thrashes the ladder up and down --

        INSIDE THE COPTER

        Travers is disoriented by the jolt, and tries to maintain
        control -- he doesn't see --

        -- that the cloth fuse on the ammo clip has reignited -- it
        burns down to the clip, and fifty rounds explode like a
        string of firecrackers --

        -- Travers tries to shield himself as he is struck by airborne
        lead. Shrapnel blasts into the instrument panel --

        THE HELICOPTER

        still strains against the cable ladder but the engine goes
        dead -- the rotor blades slow --

        GABE ON LADDER

        Gabe stares in horror at the stalling rotor -- if it were
        possible for him to grip the ladder tighter, he'd do it now --

        ON THE HELICOPTER

        -- as the rotor WHOPS to a dead halt the copter arcs down
        and slams against the mountain wall -- the skids are still
        caught in the ladder, and it holds --

        GABE

        is shaken off by the massive impact -- he falls -- --
        landing on the helicopter, half in and half out of the
        cockpit! As Gabe scrambles for a solid hold --

        INT. HELICOPTER

        -- Travers, who has been shaken to the opposite side of the
        copter, reaches into his jacket and pulls out the pistol he
        took from Frank -- he aims at Gabe --

        INSERT - THE HELICOPTER SKID

        One of the two rungs holding the copter up bursts --

        THE HELICOPTER

        slips, now hanging from just a single rung -- -- and the
        impact of the slip makes Travers drop the gun -- it falls out
        the open passenger door. Travers scrambles up through the
        cabin to go after -- -- Gabe, who is trying to get off the
        helicopter and onto a solid part of the ladder before the
        whole thing goes down --           Gabe jumps for the wall as
        Travers scrambles behind him and --

        CLOSE ON THE HELICOPTER SKID

        -- as the last rung supporting the copter snaps in two --

        GABE

        grabs hold of the ladder as

        THE HELICOPTER

        plummets down -- but as it starts its fall --

        TRAVERS

        leaps from the falling copter and grabs Gabe's leg -- Gabe
        struggles to support both of them, but Travers, weakened from
        his wound, loses his grip on Gabe's leg -- he stares up in
        terror at Gabe as he clutches Gabe's snow-slick boot --

                                        GABE
                      Cheer up. It's a beautiful spot to
                      die.

        Travers slides off and away --

        THE FALL - LONG SHOT

        Travers SCREAMING as he free falls, trailing behind the
        helicopter -- we follow the entire four thousand foot drop --

        -- until the helicopter explodes when it hits the ground far
        below, and the fireball engulfs Travers just before he
        impacts into the explosion!

        GABE

        looks down at the burning wreck and clings to the ladder,
        closing his eyes for a moment in exhaustion. But the WHOPPING
        of another helicopter makes him look up --

        THE TREASURY HELICOPTER

        has shown up, a little too late to be of any help.

        INSIDE THE TREASURY COPTER

        Wright, Davis and Stuart look at the billowing flames of the
        wreck -- even from here, the burning money is visible,
        drifting up in the smoke. Wright turns to Stuart.

                                        WRIGHT
                      I'm no expert -- but what do you make
                      of that "event"?

        GABE

        is drained -- from somewhere, he finds the strength to lift
        his head up --

        GABE'S POV - THE WALL

        The section of ladder above him, of course, is gone -- he has
        to cover the fifty feet of wall above him by free climbing.
        There are holds that look easy enough for him, but --

        GABE

        leans back, gripping the ladder, too tired to move. Just the
        thought of one more climb drains him.

                                        GABE
                            (mumbling)
                      Forget it. No fucking way. I'm staying
                      right here. I've spent the night on
                      walls before -- some of the best
                      nights of my life have been spent
                      lashed to walls --

        Before Gabe can take this any farther -- a loop tied to the
        end of a rope falls to a stop next to him. Gabe looks up --

        ON THE EDGE - HAL

        has thrown the line down. Maggie is by his side.

                                        HAL
                      Remember -- keep your arms and legs in
                      the vehicle at all times --

        GABE

        puts the loop around himself and tightens it by rote -- even
        this action aches.

                                        GABE
                            (too tired to shout)
                      Fuck you --

        Hal and Maggie draw Gabe up -- Gabe pulls some of his weight
        by using hand and foot holds, but when he reaches

        THE PRECIPICE EDGE

        Hal and Maggie are both winded from the effort as they haul
        Gabe onto the top. Gabe unties himself, and collapses into
        Maggie's lap.

                                        HAL
                            (winded, coiling the
                             rope)
                      Jesus Christ -- you think you could
                      have put a little less effort into
                      that climb? I mean, what have you done
                      for me -- lately?

        Hal ends his harrangue and looks over -- Gabe has apparently
        revived, because he and Maggie are locked in the kiss of their
        lives. Hal stands, and smiles -- he walks toward the Treasury
        agents, who are scrambling out of the helicopter. Hal starts
        an explanation that's going to take a long, long time as --

        GABE AND MAGGIE

        break off their kiss.

                                        MAGGIE
                      Does this mean you're staying?

        Off Gabe's answering smile, we --

                                                            FADE OUT.

                                      SHOOTING DRAFT

                                           1985



                

               EXT. CHICAGO - NIGHT TO DAWN

               Thundering north through the glass canyons of the Loop, the 
               elevated train SCREECHES through the city awakening. As it 
               races north across the river past ancient factories giving 
               way to high rise splendor, lights glistening against the 
               dawn, we see the complex business of bringing a city to life 
               in the morning.

               On the Near North Side an assortment of revelers are winding 
               up their night on the town.

               The pressmen loiter outside the Tribune loading docks, and 
               fishing boats are outbound through the Chicago River locks.

               A streetsweeping crew moves through the Fulton Market, 
               Chicago's central meat and produce distribution center.

               At the Merchandise Mart platform the elevated train picks up 
               two old cleaning ladies wearing babushkas.

               EXT. ALLEY - DAY

               The el train RUMBLES north past the aging tenements of Uptown 
               into the Belmont Avenue Station.

               And down below, a garbage truck is slowly working its way up 
               the alley. A garbage man in city overalls WHISTLES to the 
               driver and the truck stops. He rolls a can to the grinding 
               jaw as the driver sits, tense and alert, scanning the street.

               There's something odd about this driver. And the garbage man 
               too, for that matter.

               EXT. EL PLATFORM - DAY

               SPIDER, a nervous looking black man, steps out onto the 
               platform. As the train pulls away we see him reach into his 
               shirt pocket and CLICKS his ball point pen a couple of times. 
               He WHISPERS into it. It is a concealed radio transmitter.

                                     SPIDER
                         Say, hey, Cub fans, I hope to hell 
                         y'all down there cause we got a big 
                         game today.

               He heads for the stairs and the street below.

               INT. TRUCK CAB - DAY

               The truck cab is equipped with a police radio. The driver, 
               RICH DONATO, adjusts the volume. Over the SPEAKER, HEAVY 
               WITH STATIC, we can hear the SOUND of the RECEDING EL TRAIN.

                                     SPIDER (V.O.)
                              (from radio)
                         The school bus be waitin.

               Donato motions for the garbage man.

               EXT. ALLEY - DAY

               EDDIE CUSACK jumps up on the truck's running board and sticks 
               his head in. On the seat beside Donato is a sledgehammer and 
               a sawed off automatic rifle. The two men stare at each other 
               as they concentrate on the CRACKLING RADIO.

                                     SPIDER (V.O.)
                              (from radio)
                         S'happenin, Doc?

                                     DOC (V.O.)
                              (from radio)
                         Hey, I got it all right here, my 
                         man. Jus be waitin on you.

                                     SPIDER (V.O.)
                              (from radio)
                         We ain't got far to go.

               EXT. EL STATION - DAY

               DOC is at the wheel of a late model Cadillac. Spider gets in 
               and they pull slowly away from the curb.

               EXT. EL STATION - DAY

               At the corner in a beat up Pontiac are officers MUSIC and 
               BRENNAN. The two rough looking detectives follow Doc's car 
               through half closed eyes.

               They also HEAR Spider's TRANSMITTER. The quality of the 
               reception improves as Spider and his antennae clear the steel 
               support structure of the el platform.

                                     DOC (V.O.)
                              (from radio)
                         This early bird shit just ain't my 
                         style.

                                     SPIDER (V.O.)
                              (from radio)
                         Dig it. Too close to real work for 
                         me.

               Doc and Spider talk in a nervous false bravado.

               EXT. ALLEY - DAY

               Eddie nods to Donato who grabs a walkie-talkie from the seat.

                                     DONATO
                              (to walkie-talkie)
                         O.K. Home Team. Ready in the bullpen.

                                     MUSIC (V.O.)
                              (from radio)
                         Copy Shortstop. Double play. We're 
                         with him now.

                                     SPOTTER (V.O.)
                              (from radio)
                         Center's in.

               SILENCE. Eddie looks at Donato.

                                     EDDIE
                         Where's Cragie?

               EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

               Two cops are against the wall separating the cemetery from 
               the El. CRAGIE, a weathered twenty-five year veteran; and 
               NICK KOSALAS, the new kid on the team. Cragie sits on a crate 
               with a styrofoam cup of coffee.

               Kosalas is trying to maneuver his cup lid off, and still 
               hold on to his walkie-talkie.

                                     DONATO (V.O.)
                              (from radio)
                         Talk to me left field.

                                     KOSALAS
                              (to mike)
                         Ready sir. Left Field in position.

               Cragie pulls a pint of whiskey from his pocket and sweetens 
               his coffee with a healthy shot. He notices Kosalas, who has 
               set down the thermos and is nervously moving from leg to 
               leg.

                                     CRAGIE
                         Have a shot, kid. A little nerve 
                         tonic.

                                     KOSALAS
                         What's the matter with you?

               Cragie grins and raises his cup to drink. His hand shakes 
               and he has to steady it with the other.

               The RADIO CRACKLES.

                                     SPOTTER (V.O.)
                              (from radio)
                         O.K., guys, runner on first base.

               INT. SPOTTER APARTMENT - DAY

               A spotter, KOBAS, covers the scene from an abandoned building 
               across the street.

                                     KOBAS
                              (to walkie-talkie)
                         Just turning on Paulina.

                                     EDDIE (V.O.)
                              (from radio)
                         Double Play, you got him in sight?

                                     MUSIC (V.O.)
                              (from radio)
                         Yeah, we got the on him. He's headin 
                         for the alley.

               EXT. ALLEY - DAY

               Eddie wrestles another garbage can into the truck's hopper 
               as Doc's car cruises slowly past.

               Eddie and Spider LOCK EYES for a split second.

               The car moves on and stops at the far end of the alley. The 
               lights switch off. After a moment, Spider and Doc leave the 
               car and check out the scene. Doc carries a satchel.

                                     DOC (V.O.)
                              (from radio)
                         I say nice and simple now.

                                     SPIDER (V.O.)
                              (from radio)
                         We real cool, Doc. We're frosty. We 
                         jus' doin' a little business, you 
                         know? Ain't no big thing.

               The two men slip into the back gate of an old tenement. They 
               pass through a gangway to the front of the building, and 
               climb the front stairs.

               Though we can no longer see them, we HEAR a DOOR OPENING, a 
               GREETING in Spanish, and FEET FOUNDING up the steps.

               The garbage truck GRINDS forward and halts again. Eddie comes 
               up to the cab. He is wearing a gun under his overalls. He 
               and Donato listen on the RADIO to the CONVERSATION coming 
               from inside the building.

               INT. COMACHO FRONT STAIRS - DAY

               A muscular Latino, POMPAS COMACHO, leads Spider and Doc down 
               the paint-peeling corridor. The SOUND of BABIES CRYING and 
               FAMILIES WAKING gives a sense of teeming humanity behind 
               every door.

               The Latino knocks at a door heavily fortified with burglar 
               bars. The door opens. The bars are unlocked.

                                     SPIDER
                         How y'all doin?

                                     VOICE (V.O.)
                              (from within)
                         It's O.K. O.K. Como esta?

               Pompas leaves the two men and heads down the stairs toward 
               the front door.

               INT. COMACHO APARTMENT - DAY

               Doc and Spider enter. They're patted down.

               A sleepy eyed Latino woman comes to stand in the bedroom 
               doorway. VICTOR COMACHO barks at her in Spanish, and she 
               disappears into the bedroom.

               EXT. ALLEY - DAY

               Eddie stands on the running board of the truck with Donato 
               at the wheel. They listen to the RADIO.

                                     DOC (V.O.)
                              (from radio)
                         Hey, man, we're clean, huh. We ain't 
                         fools.

                                     SPIDER (V.O.)
                         You do that real nice, Pancho. what 
                         say we get married.

               Eddie tosses a soiled Rubic's Cube into Donato's lap.

                                     EDDIE
                         Found you a present.

                                     DONATO
                         Shit, those things will fuck up your 
                         mind.

               EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

               Cragie is watching over the wall with his binoculars. He 
               looks back at Kosalas, who is hopping from foot to foot.

                                     CRAGIE
                         If you gotta take a leak, do it now.

                                     KOSALAS
                         I can't go wading in with my shlong 
                         flapping in the wind.

                                     CRAGIE
                         Sure you can. It's called diversionary 
                         tactics.

               Cragie laughs and swigs straight from the bottle. The RADIO 
               CRACKLES.

                                     BRENNAN (V.O.)
                              (from radio)
                         What's going on in the ballpark?

                                     DONATO (V.O.)
                              (from radio)
                         Don't get froggy. Wait for the green 
                         light.

               EXT. COMACHO STREET - DAY

               A painter's van passes Brennan's Pontiac and parks in front 
               of the building half way up the block.

               INT. BRENNAN'S CAR - DAY

               Music doesn't like this.

                                     MUSIC
                         What the hell is this cat up to?

                                     BRENNAN
                         Going to work asshole. What do you 
                         think.

                                     MUSIC
                         At this hour.

                                     BRENNAN
                         They got a hardass for a boss. Like 
                         us.

               EXT. COMACHO STREET - DAY

               As Music and Brennan watch from their car, the four painters 
               get out of their truck, unpack their ladders and tools, and 
               begin to carry their equipment into the building next door 
               to the stakeout.

               INT. COMACHO APARTMENT - DAY

               The room is small and bare. A selling den. VICTOR COMACHO 
               and TWO COUSINS, all young and vicious, are sitting around a 
               formica table with the two buyers, Doc and Spider. The 
               Comachos are heavily armed. There is plenty of tension all 
               around, but Doc seems a little more nervous than the rest.

               This is an enormous buy. Doc has placed a bowling satchel 
               full of bundled $20's, $50's, and $100's on the table. Victor

                                     SPIDER
                         This be better than jukin' Seven-

                         This one's got some balls, huh?

                         I don't juke anybody.

               Victor nods and one of the cousins brings in half a dozen 
               brick-sized bundles of cocaine from the next room.

               Doc slices into one of the bags and with the tip of his knife 
               he drops a bit into a glass vial. He adds clear liquid with 
               an eye dropper and it instantly turns purple.

                                     DOC
                         I say, awright. The royal colors.

               Eddie's eyes scan the scene as he sorts through a garbage 
               can with a stick.

               INT. PAINTER'S HALLWAY - DAY

               The painters carry their equipment down the long corridor 
               and enter a vacant apartment.

               A door opens in the corridor, and a naked toddler steps out. 
               A Latino teenager comes out to retrieve the child. He sees 
               the backs of the painters, and carries the toddler back 
               inside.

               INT. PAINTER'S APARTMENT - DAY

               The painters are not what they seem. Working quickly, 
               silently, they open their tool kits and lay out their 
               hardware: machine guns and automatics.

               TONY LUNA, a barrel-chested Italian mobster is running the 
               show and it's well rehearsed. His boys, GUS, VITO, and EENIE 
               move like oiled machinery.

               Vito turns on a radio to a Latino station to cover the SOUND 
               of their preparations. They remove the whole window from its 
               frame. Then they rest a wide plank on the window ledge.

               Three feet away is the window of the adjacent building and 
               silhouetted against the shade we can SEE the drug deal.

               Luna'ys check their weapons.

               They put on painters' masks and goggles.

                                     LUNA
                         Okay, by the numbers.

               He puts on his goggles.

               EXT. ALLEY - DAY

               Over the IDLING ENGINE of the garbage truck, Eddie and Donato 
               HEAR the deal going down on the RADIO.

               Eddie looks at Donato.

                                     EDDIE
                         Painters? That building's gonna be 
                         condemned!

               Like a coiled spring, Eddie leaps from the truck and runs 
               for the rear gate, gun in hand.

               INT. PAINTER'S APARTMENT - DAY

               Tony and his men face the window across the gangway. Two of 
               them hold sawed off double barreled shotguns. Tony counts it 
               down, and they all fire as one.

               One GIANT BLAST tears into the window. It disintegrates.

               The four men toss aside their empty guns, and grab other 
               guns.

               EXT. GANGWAY - DAY

               Eddie HEARS THE GUNFIRE and hits the wall. He sees the glass 
               showering down around him. He vaults over the backyard fence 
               and head for the porch stairs.

               EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

               Kosalas is finally pissing against the wall.

                                     KOSALAS
                         I knew it.

               Cragie is using the crate to climb the wall. He is up and 
               over, and falls to the ground on the other side. He's still 
               trying to get to his feet when Kosalas comes over.

               They start running, yanking their guns out.

               INT. COMACHO APARTMENT - DAY

               Doc and Spider are blown backwards in their chairs. One of 
               the cousins has fallen across the piles of money and drugs. 
               Victor and the other cousin are slumped on the floor. The 
               woman in the bedroom is screaming.

               Through the jagged glass around the window frame, Tony's 
               boys shove a broad plank.

               EXT. GANGWAY - DAY

               Three floors up, we see the "painters" rush across the gangway 
               to the other building.

               EXT. COMACHO BACK STAIRS - DAY

               EFREN COMACHO, the heavyweight guarding the back door, is 
               distracted by the SHOUTS and GUNFIRE upstairs. Eddie crashes 
               through the door and Efren spins just in time to meet Eddie's 
               blurring attack.

               The struggle on the landing is brief. Efren's size is no 
               match for Eddie's speed and power. With a grunt he sags to 
               the floor.

               Eddie leaps over him and bounds up the steps.

               EXT. COMACHO STREET - DAY

               Brennan, Music and Kobas are now on their way, using parked 
               cars to cover their advance toward the front door of the 
               Comacho building.

               EXT. COMACHO BACK STAIRS - DAY

               Eddie passes the second floor landing and takes a quick look 
               up the porch stairs. The door to the second floor apartment 
               starts to open behind him. He spins and kicks it.

               There stands a terrified old woman looking up the barrel of 
               his gun.

                                     EDDIE
                              (shouts)
                         Police! No se mueve!

               He spins and bounds up the stairway.

               INT. COMACHO APARTMENT - DAY

               The woman is huddled in a corner, still screaming. Tony comes 
               to stand over her, and coldly shoots her. Then he rips off 
               his mask and goggles as his boys clear the bodies and scoop 
               up the drugs and money from the table.

               Victor Comacho lies slumped against the wall, one side of 
               his face and one shoulder bloodied. He appears dead, eyes 
               open. But then he blinks once.

               INT. COMACHO BACK STAIRS - DAY

               Eddie has entered the rear of the apartment. He moves 
               cautiously forward.

               INT. COMACHO APARTMENT - DAY

               Tony and his partners start back over the gangway to the 
               other building. Vito is bringing up the rear.

               Suddenly Victor Comacho comes to life. He gets off A BURST 
               with his AUTOMATIC. Vito catches it in the back.

               EXT. ALLEY - DAY

               Donato is moving down the gangway when Vito's body -- followed 
               by the scaffold plank -- falls from the sky and CRASHES into 
               the pavement right in front of him.

               INT. COMACHO APARTMENT - DAY

               Eddie jumps into the living room doorway, gun drawn, and 
               takes in the carnage. He kicks the gun out of Victor's hand, 
               and bounds to the shattered bay window and looks down in 
               time to SEE --

               EXT. GANGWAY - DAY

               Donato jumps over the broken body, running through the gangway 
               toward the front of the building.

                                     DONATO
                         They're goin out the front!

               The bridge to the other building is gone, but there is a 
               large drainpipe running down the outside of the building. 
               Eddie climbs out on the shattered window sill, and stretches 
               for the pipe. The pipe is just out of reach. Pushing off 
               from the ledge, he jumps for the drainpipe, grabbing it on 
               his way down.

               The painters run down the stairs toward the front of the 
               building.

               EXT. COMACHO STREET - DAY

               Music, Brennan, and Kobas rush the front door of the Comacho's 
               building, and enter.

               EXT. GANGWAY - DAY

               Eddie lands on his feet and heads for the front.

               EXT. ALLEY - DAY

               Cragie and Kosalas brace themselves on each side of the rear 
               door to the Painters' building. Cragie is white with fear. 
               Kosalas kicks in the door. They enter.

               EXT. COMACHO STREET - DAY

               At the front of the building Donato emerges from the 
               passageway and he's met by a HAIL of GUNFIRE. He jumps back 
               and takes a more cautious look.

               Tony Luna and Gus make a run for the van. Donato steps out 
               from between the two buildings and raises his gun.

               But he hasn't seen Eenie, just coming out of the building 
               next door.

               Eenie fires and Donato goes down, wounded in the foot. But 
               before Eenie can get off another shot --

               -- Eddie leaps from the gangway and drops Eenie with a BURST 
               from his AUTOMATIC.

               EXT. COMACHO STREET - DAY

               Luna pulls out PEELING RUBBER, but he's nearly surrounded. 
               squad cars have pulled in blocking both ends of the street. 
               Another squad car screeches to a halt and both officers jump 
               out and start firing.

               Luna hits the fender of the squad car head on, knocking both 
               officers to the ground. He spins the van around with cops 
               FIRING from every angle, jumps the curb, and roars past the 
               roadblock on the sidewalk with pedestrians leaping in all 
               directions.

               INT. PAINTERS' BACK STAIRS - DAY

               Heart pounding, Cragie leads Kosalas blindly up the darkened 
               steps.

               INT. PAINTER'S HALL - DAY

               A door opens behind Cragie. He whirls and FIRES into the 
               darkness.

               The riddled body of a Mexican teenager, eyes wide with shock, 
               pitches into the hall.

               Kosalas, down the hallway, hugs the wall, petrified.

                                     KOSALAS
                         Cragie?!

                         It's O.K. I got the sonovabitch.

               Kosalas creeps ahead, gun drawn, just in time to see Cragie 
               pull a small handgun from his pocket and lay it in the boys 
               hand.

               Cragie looks up at Kosalas and their eyes meet.

               EXT. COMACHO STREET - DAY

               Luna's van, it's windshield shot out, takes the first corner 
               on two wheels. Behind him the police scramble for their blue 
               and whites. Half way down the block, the van lurches into an 
               alley.

               EXT. ALLEY - DAY

               The van hurtles down the alley, splashing through puddles 
               past the loading docks of a packing company. Parked along 
               one side of the end of the alley is a meat truck from the 
               opening montage. A loading ramp leads to the gaping rear 
               doors.

               The thieves have done their homework. The Luna gang slams up 
               the ramp into the rear of the meat truck.

               A bee fy compatriot in a blood stained butcher's smock pulls 
               several sides of beef along the rail and into the truck. 
               With the van concealed, the line of police cars ROAR splashing 
               by.

               INT. PAINTER'S HALL - DAY

               Cragie, kneeling over the body, looks at Kosalas eyeball to 
               eyeball.

               SCREAMS come from within the boy's apartment.

                                     CRAGIE
                              (yelling into the

                         Police! Stay where you are!

               They HEAR FOOTSTEPS pounding up the front stairs. Cragie and 
               Kosalas look up.

               Eddie appears at the front of the hall, gun drawn. He sees 
               the boy on the hallway floor.

               He approaches cautiously, taking in the body, the gun, Cragie 
               sitting against the wall, and the distraught Kosalas who 
               stands transfixed by the dead kid. Eddie goes to Kosalas.

                                     EDDIE
                         Take it easy, Kosalas.

                                     CRAGIE
                         The kid didn't dust him. I did.

               Eddie looks at Cragie.

                                     CRAGIE
                         Him or me, Sarge.
                              (pause)
                         The kid saw the whole thing.

               Both Eddie and Cragie look at Kosalas.

                                     CRAGIE
                         Tell him, Nick.

               It almost sounds like an order.

               Kosalas looks like he's going to be sick.

                                     KOSALAS
                              (softly)
                         Yeah, that's how it went down.

                                     EDDIE
                              (pause)
                         Stay here.

                         Take care of your partner.

               Eddie walks away.

               The gangway is now filled with squad cars, ambulances, and 
               cops.

               As the paramedics walk Victor Comacho to the ambulance, 
               bloody, bandaged, but very much alive, he and Eddie LOCK 
               EYES for a brief instant.

               Several ferocious looking Comacho relatives have been allowed 
               inside the police lines. One of them steps close to Victor.

               The lab technicians arrive.

               The throng of streetwise punks and horrified commuters are 
               across a roped off area.

                                     KOBAS
                         Get these people back out of here, 
                         wouldja.

               INT. PAINTER'S HALL - DAY

               Kosalas and Cragie are still with the body. The corridor is 
               blocked off by uniformed patrolmen.

               Kosalas is shakey. Cragie is tries to calm him down.

                                     CRAGIE
                         Look, it's no big thing, Kid. A 
                         friggin' dog and pony show. Some 
                         dumb ass questions by dumb ass 
                         bureaucrats. "When's the last time 
                         you were at the range?" Crap like 
                         that.

                                     KOSALAS
                         Look. It was a fuckin' accident. Why 
                         can't you just be --

                                     CRAGIE
                              (stiffens)
                         You born yesterday?! These ain't 
                         cops. They'll roast our ass just 
                         cause we carry a badge. Both of us.
                              (menacing)
                         We stick together on this, kid. We're 
                         partners, right?

               Kosalas nods.

               EXT. GANGWAY - DAY

               Donato sits on the ground as two paramedics work on his foot. 
               Eddie crouches beside him as one medic cuts away Donato's 
               ankle boot.

                                     DONATO
                         Aw man, don't do that. You know how 
                         much these things cost?

               He gasps as they draw the boot off. Donato grabs for Eddie's 
               hand, and squeezes against the pain.

                                     DONATO
                         Eddie. Scam this. A bait shop. Worms, 
                         minnows. Don't even need real worms. 
                         Storage problem. Got those rubber 
                         ones, you know?

                                     EDDIE
                         Yeah, what about the winter?

                                     DONATO
                         We winter in Florida. Rubber neck 
                         the beach bunnies. Aw, look at that. 
                         Ruined my brand new fence climbers. 
                         Hand made in Italy.

               Someone points Eddie out to Partida, an attractive, no-
               nonsense woman, who heads for him. Donato sees Partida coming.

                                     DONATO
                         Oh, fuck, Partida. I'm gonna tell 
                         her you shot me.

               The resentment the other cops feel against Partida is readily 
               apparent.

                                     PARTIDA
                         Cusack. You were in charge here?

                                     EDDIE
                         Does it look like it?

               Partida looks at the covered body nearby.

                                     PARTIDA
                              (to Donato)
                         And you were a principal in one of 
                         the shootings?

               Eddie nods.

                                     DONATO
                         OW! A goddamn Dr. Jekyll!

               Eddie smiles at Donato, who with his good foot, kicks at the 
               medic bandaging the wound.

                                     PARTIDA
                         Where's the officer who was involved 
                         in the other shooting?

                                     EDDIE
                              (pointing)
                         Third floor rear.

               As Partida heads for the building, another suited civilian 
               comes over to meet her. The civilian escorts a Mexican 
               grandmother.

               The old lady is agitated, jabbering in Spanish and pointing 
               at the cops.

               Eddie sees this, and then is pulled away as he helps one of 
               the medics lift Donato and carry him to the ambulance.

               Eddie helps Donato into the ambulance.

                                     EDDIE
                         Catch you later, Hopalong.

               INT. HEADQUARTERS - DAY

               The two Comacho lookouts who survived the raid, Efren and 
               Pompas, have been brought in for questioning. The 
               interrogation is taking place in a small room.

               Officers Brennan and Music are here with Eddie.

               The Comachos sit silent as stones.

                                     MUSIC
                              (to Efren)
                         You know that, Efren. When your big 
                         bad brother Luis gets the word, your 
                         ass is freeze dried and fried.

               Efren stares ahead. Music looks at Eddie who is fiddling 
               with the Rubic's Cube, to little success.

               Brennan takes Music's place. He kicks Pompas' chair hard.

                                     BRENNAN
                         Talk you hemorrhoid!

                                     POMPAS
                              (in Spanish)
                         Your mother fucks dogs in the street.

                                     BRENNAN
                         You wanna tune-up? Hey Sarge, you 
                         know why a Comacho's like a cue-ball? 
                         Cause the harder you hit 'em, the 
                         better their English gets.

               It's not a joke, but a threat. Pompas spits at Brennan. 
               Brennan is enraged, but Eddie pushes him back with a hand.

               Eddie faces the Comachos.

                                     EDDIE
                         We're jerking off here.

               Eddie goes out the door.

               INT. HEADQUARTERS HALL - DAY

               As Eddie emerges, he bumps into the Camacho's lawyer SANCHEZ; 
               thirty-eight, well dressed, smooth as silk.

               Sanchez sees the tableau in the room. As Cusack walks down 
               the hall the attorney follows him.

                                     SANCHEZ
                         Let's cut the shit, Cusack.

               Eddie ignores him.

                                     SANCHEZ
                         Option 1: you can send em downtown. 
                         If Judge Collins didn't get laid 
                         last night, you can probably get him 
                         to arraign my clients for loitering 
                         in their own hallway. He'll set bail. 
                         I'll take care of it. Option 2: 
                         release them here and now and we'll 
                         call it a day.
                              (pause)
                         Up to you.

                                     EDDIE
                         I like to see you earn your money.

               Sanchez backs off. We follow Eddie down the hall.

               INT. KATES' OFFICE - DAY

               The head of Area Four, COMMANDER KATES, is grilling Cragie 
               and Kosalas.

                                     CRAGIE
                         We come up the back stairs. We start 
                         cleanin' the hallway when the deceased 
                         pops out of a doorway with a 25 
                         automatic. I tell him to drop it, 
                         but he's comin. We had no choice. 
                         Kosalas here saw the whole thing.

               Kates turns to Kosalas.

                                     KATES
                         Did you?

               Kosalas looks haggard.

                                     KOSALAS
                         I was on another doorway...

                                     KATES
                         But you saw the action?

                                     KOSALAS
                         I saw him fall.

                                     KATES
                         And the kid was armed?

                                     KOSALAS
                         That's the way it went down.

                                     KATES
                         And you saw the weapon?

                                     KOSALAS
                              (nods)
                         Yes sir. I saw it in his hand.

                                     KATES
                         O.K.
                              (signs document)
                         Cragie, you'll be assigned to 
                         headquarters until the hearing --

                                     CRAGIE
                         Hearing? Who called for a hearing? 
                         The little fuck tried to shoot me in 
                         the back!

               Eddie enters. Kates looks up from his desk.

                                     KATES
                         Ms. Partida --

                                     CRAGIE
                         That piece of shit!

                                     KATES
                         Shut-up, Cragie.
                              (pause)
                         Partida has demanded a formal hearing. 
                         You will be under oath so the 
                         department will provide you with a 
                         lawyer unless you've got your own.
                              (stands)
                         An OPS Review Board member is waiting 
                         to talk to you. Doesn't sound like 
                         you got anything to worry about.

               Cragie gets up. Kosalas, sitting through this interview in 
               stunned silence stands also.

                                     KATES
                         Kosalas, you work with Cusack until 
                         this is over.

                                     KOSALAS
                         Yes sir.

               Kosalas and Cragie exit.

                                     EDDIE
                         I ain't got no time to nursmaid a 
                         rookie. I don't need a partner.

                              (explodes)
                         Your right! You don't need a partner! 
                         You need a goddamn keeper!
                              (slams fist on desk)
                         Jesus Christ! How do I explain this 
                         one upstairs?
                              (stands)
                         We gave you 600 man-hours, you took 
                         a month planning the damn thing, and 
                         what have you got to show for it? 
                         Nine bodies? A dead informant? One 
                         of my best men shot! For Christ's 
                         sake!
                              (stares at ceiling)
                         You're going to have me back on a 
                         beat busting perverts in the park.

               Kates sits, sighs, suddenly tired.

                                     EDDIE
                         We got a bigger problem. These 
                         Comachos aren't gonna take this lying 
                         down. The animals are out of the 
                         cages.

                                     KATES
                         Just what I need. A goddman war.

               Eddie turns to leave.

                                     KATES
                         Keep track of this business with 
                         Cragie?

                                     EDDIE
                         Yeah.

               The PHONE RINGS.

                                     KATES
                         I'll deal with upstairs.

               Eddie starts to leave again. Kates picks up the phone, and 
               puts a hand over the mouthpiece.

                                     KATES
                         Just get me some answers, huh.

                                     EDDIE
                         That's my job.

               Eddie exits.

               Kosalas, without an attorney, is being interviewed by Partida. 
               A court stenographer is silently typing.

                                     PARTIDA
                         ...you have the right to remain 
                         silent. You have the right to have 
                         an attorney present at all times. 
                         Anything you say may be used against 
                         you in a court of law...

               INT. EDDIE'S CAR - DAY

               Eddie and Kosalas are parked on an airport access road, 
               watching private planes land and take off. Eddie's car, a 
               five-year old Chevy, is wreckage. The quarter panels are 
               rusted, the radio antenna is a coathanger, and when Kosalas 
               pushes a tape into the cassette player, the windshield wipers 
               start moving.

               Kosalas pops the cassette out, the windshield wipers stop; 
               he throws the cassette into the glove compartment. But now 
               he can't get the door to stay closed.

                                     EDDIE
                         I'm going to have to fix that.

               Eddie has to shout to be heard over the sound of an airplane 
               passing directly overhead.

               Eddie glances at Kosalas who looks uncomfortable.

                                     EDDIE
                         You know, it's kind of interesting. 
                         That 16 year old in the hallway with 
                         the gun? Partida told me he doesn't 
                         have a record. The kid's never been 
                         arrested.

                                     KOSALAS
                         Yeah, well, you know, if you read 
                         the papers, cops only shoot honor 
                         students. Sole support of the family 
                         and all that.

               EXT. AIRPORT - DAY

               The airport bristles with corporate jets departing and 
               arriving.

                                     TOWER (V.O.)
                         ...Lear 9 Lima Kilo number 2 for 
                         landing -- wind south 20, altimeter 
                         two-niner-niner-two...

               And now comes a mystery jet, wearing no company colors, 
               banking in over Lake Point Tower and WHISTLING low over the 
               Planetarium to a touchdown.

               The white Learjet taxis to a halt at the far end of the field 
               as an undistinguished Buick rolls down the ramp to meet it.

               Eddie and Kosalas stand by their car, parked across the runway 
               from the Learjet.

               The jet's engines shut down, the door opens, and a grim but 
               handsome man emerges. LUIS COMACHO, a cruel and uncompromising 
               survivor, has arrived. With him is an incredibly beautiful 
               exotic woman.

               He is met by Pompas and Efren Comacho, the two lookouts who 
               survived the raid. And Victor Comacho, who was wounded in 
               the raid, is here with his shoulder bandaged.

               EXT. EDDIE'S CAR - DAY

               From where Eddie and Kosalas are standing it is impossible 
               to hear the conversation at the Learjet, but it is clear 
               that Luis Comacho is upset. They see Luis slap Pompas and 
               Efren. Then he grabs Victor by both arms, ignoring his wound, 
               and screams at him.

                                     KOSALAS
                         Nice fellow this Luis Comacho. Donato 
                         says they call him the Angel-of-Death.

               Victor grimaces, in great pain, and his knees buckle.

                                     EDDIE
                         Real sweetheart.

               INT. LUNA'S HOUSE - DAY

               In the dining room DIANA LUNA, a pretty 19 year old, helps 
               her 80 year old grandmother THERESA decorate a "HAPPY 
               BIRTHDAY" banner, some red and green crepe paper.

                                     MOLLY LUNA (O.S.)
                         Now?

                                     DIANA
                         No!

               Diana and her grandmother grin at each other. They are done. 
               Theresa stands back to admire their work.

                                     MOLLY (O.S.)
                         Now?

                                     DIANA
                         Mama!

               A PHONE RINGS

                                     DIANA
                         Daddy, would you get that!

               Diana rushes into the kitchen and comes right out with a 
               birthday cake, and sets it on the table next to some presents.

                                     THERESA
                         Bella.

               Diana goes to the stairs where her mother sits with her hands 
               over her eyes.

                                     DIANA
                         Keep 'em closed now.

               She leads her mother to the dining room.

                                     DIANA
                         O.K., open 'em.

               MOLLY LUNA opens her eyes. Theresa and Diana beam. Diana 
               kisses her mother who almost cries.

                                     DIANA
                         Happy birthday, momma.

                                     THERESA
                              (in Italian)
                         Happy birthday, Molly.

               Diana hands Molly a card from the table. Molly starts to 
               open it.

               Tony Luna burst in from another room.

                                     TONY LUNA
                         Molly! Pack me a bag! Quick! Ok? 
                         C'mon I'm in a hurry!

               Molly heads for the stairs, leaving behind the half opened 
               card.

                                     MOLLY
                         But Tony, why...?

                                     TONY LUNA
                         Business! C'mon, move. Do what I 
                         tell you!

               Molly goes upstairs. Diana is pissed.

                                     DIANA
                         Don't do it, momma! Make him pack 
                         his own bag.

                                     TONY LUNA
                         I ain't got time to put up with your 
                         bullshit today.

               Tony goes to the phone, dials, gets a busy signal, and slams 
               it down.

               Theresa sits down watching sadly.

               Diana goes to stand in front of her father.

                                     DIANA
                         Listen goddammit! It's momma's 
                         birthday! She deserves better'n this!

               Tony sorts through the closet looking for a jacket.

               Gamiani comes in puffing with a clumsily wrapped present 
               under his arm.

                                     GAMIANI
                         Hey, Tony. What's shaking? Sorry I'm 
                         late. I got stuck on Wacker. Some 
                         spook...

                                     TONY LUNA
                         Victor Comacho is alive.

                                     GAMIANI
                         Oh sweet Jesus.

               Diana is really angry at her father ignoring her.

                                     DIANA
                         You can't go now.

                                     TONY LUNA
                         Shut up!

               He slaps her. She slaps him back, turns, grabs her purse, 
               and runs out.

               Tony watches her go and turns to Gamiani.

                                     TONY LUNA
                         Put someone on the house. And you 
                         keep an eye on her.

               He nods out the door.

                                     GAMIANI
                         You got it, Tony. What about your 
                         uncle?

                                     TONY LUNA
                         What Felix don't know doesn't hurt 
                         him.

               Molly comes down with the bag. Tony takes it from her and 
               starts out the door. Suddenly he turns back, snatches 
               Gamiani's present from his hands, and thrust it at his wife.

                                     TONY LUNA
                         Here. Happy birthday.

               Tony rushes out the door. Gamiani goes to the phone.

               Molly is left alone in the doorway.

               EXT. EDDIE'S STREET - DAY

               Eddie parks in front of his apartment building, leaves the 
               car, and enters the building.

               INT. EDDIE'S HALL - DAY

               Dead on his feet, Eddie reaches the top of the stairs and an 
               object comes flying at him out of the shadows. ODELL, a slim 
               10 year old black kid, fakes a series of karate kicks at 
               Eddie.

                                     ODELL
                         Bow to your master!

                                     EDDIE
                         Later, Odell. It's been a rough one.

                                     ODELL
                         Y' tellin me! We all seen it on the 
                         TV!

                                     WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Odell!

                                     EDDIE
                         Bow to your master.

               Odell takes off.

                                     EDDIE
                         Hey, Odell. Here, make yourself crazy.

               The kid stops, and Eddie tosses him the Rubic's Cube.

               Eddie nears his apartment, we hear a MALE VOICE SINGING.

               INT. EDDIE'S APARTMENT - DAY

               The door is ajar. Eddie lives in a modest apartment. FRED 
               PIRELLI, a great bear of a man, 65, sings at the top of his 
               lungs. He is bent over the space heater, tearing it apart.

                                     PIRELLI
                         You look like shit.

                                     EDDIE
                         Thanks, pal.

                                     PIRELLI
                         They had a shot on the tube of you 
                         guys comin' out in front of the 
                         building. How's Donato?

               Eddie collapses on the sofa.

                                     EDDIE
                         Pissed cause he lost a shoe.
                              (pause)
                         Luis Comacho is in town.

                                     PIRELLI
                         He'll collect himself some scalps 
                         before this one's over. Your answering 
                         machine is on the fritz again. Some 
                         woman with a fantastic voice was 
                         callin' about comin' over this weekend 
                         ta help you with somthin', and then 
                         the tape went nuts.

                                     EDDIE
                         Want somthin' to drink?

                                     PIRELLI
                         Does the Pope shit in the woods? Is 
                         a bear Catholic?

                                     ODELL
                         Me too.

               Odell shows in the doorway. Eddie gets up and the kid tosses 
               him the Rubic's Cube -- all done.

               Eddie looks at it, and the kid goes into the kitchen.

                                     EDDIE
                         I hate smart ass kids.

               Odell laughs.

                                     PIRELLI
                         Gonna get down in the 30's tonight. 
                         Your pilot light is out.

               Eddie tosses the Cube into the waste basket and opens the 
               refrigerator.

                                     EDDIE
                         I've been told that more than once.

                                     PIRELLI
                              (seriously)
                         So, who you figure pulled out the 
                         rug? Gypsies? Mob?

               Eddie comes back into the living room, hands a beer and a 
               soda to Odell, and flops back on the sofa with his own beer.

                                     EDDIE
                         Somebody knew what they were doin'. 
                         They blew the top off an anthill.

               Pirelli reaches for his drink and Odell hands him the soda. 
               Pirelli grabs the beer before Odell can drink and switches.

                                     PIRELLI
                         I'd figure the Mob but Scalese ain't 
                         that stupid.
                              (pause)
                         Hah! Sombody put the valve in 
                         backwards.

               Pirelli and Odell turn to Eddie who tries to look innocent -- 
               but fails. Eddie purposefully studies the answering machine 
               on the coffee table in front of him.

                                     WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Odell! I ain't calling you again!

                                     ODELL
                         Later, fellas.

               Pirelli finishes with the heater, and gets up.

                                     PIRELLI
                         There. Heat.

                                     EDDIE
                         What was the Cubs final score?

                                     PIRELLI
                         8 to 1.

               Eddie punches a button on the answering machine. It spews 
               tape across the table.

                                     PIRELLI
                         Machines just don't like you.

               Pirelli grabs the machine, unplugs it, and carries it out 
               the door toward his own apartment.

                                     EDDIE
                         Maybe I don't like machines.

               EXT. SOLDIER FIELD - DAY

               The machine in question looks like a miniature tank. This is 
               the "Prowler," a robot anti-terrorist vehicle that is being 
               maneuvered around various obstacles in a demonstration for 
               the city's law enforcement agencies.

               The "Prowler" is amazingly agile. And its BULLHORN VOICE 
               breaks everybody up.

                                     VOICE
                              (from speaker)
                         Arretez! Halten Zie! Stop! Do not 
                         move! No se mueve!...

               The machine's three video eyes, searching the crowd 
               independently, give it the appearance of an extra-industrial 
               bug. One camera is mounted on a telescoping mast which extends 
               to give it the perspective of a giraffe. The thing seems 
               almost alive.

               Commander Kates is here, leading a contingent of departmental 
               brass. With them are several dozen officers and a gaggle of 
               city councilmen.

               The Prowler is being put through its paces by the FACTORY 
               ENGINEER. He controls the machine with a pistol-grip device 
               that looks like a small TV camera.

                                     ENGINEER
                         ...After the gyros are locked, any 
                         movement of the hand controller is 
                         duplicated by the 'Prowler.'

               He turns his hand to the right and the Prowler, 50 yards 
               away, sweeps its turret to the right, aiming the twin 30 
               calibre machineguns at the politicians. They move aside.

                                     ENGINEER
                         This simple control system means 
                         that even semi-skilled employees can 
                         operate the unit with a minimum of 
                         training. As they say, "Even a child 
                         can operate it."

               Standing with Chief Kates, Eddie watches the demonstration 
               with contempt. Kates turns to him.

                                     KATES
                         He's talking about you, Cusack. Pay 
                         attention. You're all gonna have to 
                         be qualified on this. It's the future.

                                     EDDIE
                         Just what the world needs, another 
                         gun without a brain.

                                     KATES
                         You're looking at the perfect cop. 
                         The damn thing follows orders.

               Eddie has seen enough.

                                     EDDIE
                         I got better things to do than play 
                         with toys.

               Kates is about to say something when the demonstrator 
               interrupts.

                                     ENGINEER
                         If the Commander will pick someone 
                         to try and elude 'Prowler,' we can 
                         show how our various target 
                         acquisition systems function.

               Kates points to Eddie, and smiles.

               Instantly the turret sweeps the horizon and locks on Eddie 
               as he walks across the astro turf.

               CLOSE-UP of the Prowler's hand controller.

               The MONITOR SCREEN shows the crosshairs on the back of Eddie's 
               head. ON THE SCREEN the digital readout says: LOCKED AND 
               TRACKING.

                                     MACHINE
                              (from speaker)
                         Bang. You're dead.

               Eddie keeps walking, seemingly oblivious to the Prowler. 
               Suddenly he whirls and ducks behind a wall out of the 
               Prowler's sight.

               He pops up with his gun pointed at the Prowler's controller.

                                     EDDIE
                         Drop it.

               The controller, scared shitless, drops the hand control.

               The Prowler dies -- the plug pulled.

               Eddie smiles at Kates, and exits.

               INT. MORGUE VIEWING ROOM - DAY

               The curtain is drawn back from the viewing window and the 
               Comachos SEE the bodies of their cousins. Luis is here with 
               Pompas, Efren, and Victor. Their attorney, Sanchez, has joined 
               them. They are speaking Spanish.

                                     SANCHEZ
                              (subtitle)
                         A war does no good for any of us. It 
                         can only make what is bad worse.

               Luis says nothing. He looks through the window at the bodies. 
               Finally he speaks.

                                     LUIS
                              (subtitle)
                         Get them out of here. Fix them up. I 
                         want them to be beautiful for their 
                         mother.

               He kisses his fingertips and touches the glass.

                                     LUIS
                              (subtitle)
                         I promise you, my brothers, there 
                         will be blood for blood.

               Sanchez sighs.

               INT. MORGUE HALL - DAY

               Luis Comacho storms out of the room into the corridor followed 
               by the others.

               Eddie and Kosalas are just entering. Victor spots Eddie and 
               turns to Luis.

                                     VICTOR
                              (subtitles)
                         This is the cop.

               The Comachos slow down. The two groups survey each other -- 
               Luis, hatred oozing from his eyes. And Eddie, without slowing, 
               looks the vicious Colombian over with cool contempt.

               Eddie walks by.

                                     LUIS
                         How much did they pay you to set up 
                         my brothers, Pig.

               Eddie freezes, makes a slow turn, and meets Luis' eyes.

               Suddenly Eddie moves, faster than anyone else can react to, 
               and he has Luis pinned to the wall, choking him.

                                     EDDIE
                         Stay off my streets, asshole. Or 
                         I'll bite your head off, and shit in 
                         your neck.

               He releases Luis just as quickly, and turns to walk out, 
               Kosalas backing with him, hand on gun.

               Luis gets some air back, and starts to scream.

                                     LUIS
                              (subtitle)
                         You're meat cop! Dead meat!

               The other Comachos have to restrain him.

               INT. MORGUE EXAMINING ROOM - DAY

               Retired detective HANK FLANNIGAN runs the high-tech morgue 
               where the bodies are stacked on trays like bakery buns. 
               Flannigan, a trim, bespectacled Mr. Clean, clicks his false 
               teeth between thoughts.

               The body on the exotic lab table is the gunman Eddie shot 
               during the raid. Eddie is here to confirm the identification. 
               His new partner, Kosalas, is with him, very uncomfortable in 
               this setting.

                                     FLANNIGAN
                         Eenie Verona is the gentleman's name.
                              (looks down)
                         You did a hell of a job on him.

                                     EDDIE
                         I was motivated.

               Flannigan has already pulled Verona's record. He hands it to 
               Eddie who passes it on to Kosalas without looking at it. 
               Kosalas concentrates on the file, uneasy with the dead.

                                     FLANNIGAN
                         Know him?

                                     EDDIE
                         He's a punk. Punk thief. Booster.

                                     FLANNIGAN
                         Looks like he graduated.

                                     EDDIE
                         He had a brother-in-law. They were 
                         tight. Served time together. 
                         Ganelli..., Gagleone...

                                     KOSALAS
                         Gamiani.

               Eddie looks at Kosalas who glances up from the report 
               triumphantly.

                                     FLANNIGAN
                         If I was you, I'd sit on him.

                                     KOSALAS
                         You figure he's connected?

               Eddie just smiles.

                                     FLANNIGAN
                         Looks like you're gonna be busy, 
                         Cusack. Uh, you gonna be using those 
                         Cubs' tickets?

               Eddie reaches into his pocket, and tosses a ticket to 
               Flannigan who grins.

               INT. EDDIE'S CAR - NIGHT

               Eddie and Kosalas cruise the Rush Street area at night. They 
               search the neon lit crowds on the sidewalks for a glimpse of 
               Lou Gamiani.

               EXT. GAMIANI'S STREET - DAY

               On a tree-shaded block of classic brownstones, the unmarked 
               car is parked at the corner.

               INT. EDDIE'S CAR - DAY

               Eddie is at the wheel wearing a sportscoat and sweater, 
               scanning the sports page. Kosalas is nervous and chatty, 
               bubbling. He's still reading the records from the morgue.

                                     KOSALAS
                         This Ganiani's a swinger, huh?

                                     EDDIE
                         He's just makin' up for the time he 
                         spent in the joint.

               EXT. GAMIANI'S STREET - DAY

               LOU GAMIANI, 55, Italian, and huge, comes out the front door 
               of a brownstone, and gives a perfunctory kiss to his aging 
               "Playmate", who stands in the doorway in a housecoat. Gamiani 
               comes down the steps, and jumps into a car.

               In the car with Gamiani, a fat man, TITO, is at the wheel. 
               They pull into the street passing the unmarked car.

               EXT. NORTH SIDE STREET - DAY

               Trailing Gamiani and his partner through the North Side 
               neighborhoods, they wind up in Lincoln Park.

               With considerable skill Kosalas and Eddie manage to stick to 
               them undetected.

               EXT. PARK - DAY

               Gamiani and Tito park by the botanical gardens and stroll 
               past the fields of flowers into the zoo. Eddie and Kosalas 
               follow.

                                     KOSALAS
                         Now what? They selling protection to 
                         the bears?

                                     EDDIE
                         Relax kid.

               EXT. CHILDREN'S ZOO - DAY

               Strolling among the baby elephants and fuzzy rabbits, the 
               two heavies could not be more out of place. Tito has a racing 
               form. Lou, tall enough to see over heads, looks like a loose 
               gorilla on the prowl. He is searching for somebody.

               Surrounding the incubators filled with hatching chicks is a 
               cluster of schoolchildren.

               They are having a ball.

               Eddie has noticed DIANA, a lovely 19 year old who is in charge 
               of the children.

               And she has noticed Gamiani. She's visibly upset.

                                     KOSALAS (V.O.)
                         What's this? Kinda young for that 
                         old fart ain't she?

                                     EDDIE (V.O.)
                         Just watch, kid. Learn.

               Diana leaves the children with the zoo lecturer.

                                     DIANA
                         Be back in a minute.

               She crosses to the two goons and looks up at Gamiani.

                                     DIANA
                         What do you want?

                                     LOU
                         Your Papa worries about you.

                                     DIANA
                         Get out of here, Lou. Leave me alone.

               Gamiani shrugs, his pal Tito seems embarrassed, but they 
               don't move.

               INT. GORILLA HOUSE - DAY

               The CHILDREN SCREAM, and LULU, the half-ton baboon flies 
               into frame, swinging down from the artificial branches of an 
               iron tree in the three story central cage. The children clutch 
               at Diana in delightful terror. The gorilla, inches away, 
               kisses the thick glass that separates them.

               Lulu swings to the upper branches and sits, arms crossed, 
               staring eyeball-to-eyeball at her human counterpart, Gamiani. 
               Tito eats popcorn.

               Eddie and Kosalas walk behind a mother and child, each holding 
               a balloon.

               EXT. LIBRARY - DAY

               Diana is on the front steps of the library saying good-bye 
               to two of the children from the zoo. She hands them over to 
               their mothers, and goes up the steps into the building.

               Gamiani and Tito pull over and park down the street.

               Eddie comes around the corner, and follows her in.

               INT. LIBRARY HALL - DAY

               The sign on the door tells us this is the city's Special 
               Education Program office. Diana enters the office and confers 
               briefly with another staff member.

               INT. LIBRARY HALL - DAY

               Through the open door of the Special Education Program office, 
               Eddie observes Diana chatting with her co-workers.

               INT. READING ROOM - DAY

               Eddie follows as Diana walks through the great hall past 
               long tables and out the other door.

               EXT. LIBRARY - DAY

               Diana comes down the steps, wading through the swarm of 
               homebound commuters, and catches a cab.

               And head and shoulders above the crowd, scanning the tops of 
               heads, is Lou Gamiani.

               Tito comes around the corner in his car, and pulls up to the 
               curb. Gamiani jumps in, and they take off after Diana's cab.

               Eddie and Kosalas follow in Eddie's car.

               EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

               Diana enters an apartment building.

               EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

               By the time Diana exits it is dark. She is with a friend, 
               and both are in some kind of Halloween costume. They catch a 
               cab.

               EXT. PARTY STREET - NIGHT

               The taxi stops in front of an ancient brick loft building. 
               Diana and her friend get out and hit the buzzer at an unmarked 
               door. The door opens and they disappears inside.

               Gamiani's car cruises past. It pulls up at the corner and 
               it's lights switch off.

               Eddie's car pulls up. Eddie hops out. Kosalas slides behind 
               the wheel.

               INT. EDDIE'S CAR - NIGHT

               Eddie leans down to the open drivers window.

                                     EDDIE
                         Hold here a second.

               Eddie goes to the back of the car, and Kosalas follows him 
               in the rearview mirror, losing sight when Eddie pops open 
               the trunk.

               Kosalas watches the party goers enter the building.

               There is a tapping at the window.

               Eddie has donned a baseball uniform, matching cap, and now 
               carries a baseball bat with a pair of cleats hanging from 
               it.

                                     EDDIE
                         Keep with Gamiani.

               Eddie tosses the keys back to Kosalas, and heads to the 
               building. Kosalas calls to him.

                                     KOSALAS
                         Bang a few for me.

               INT. PARTY STAIRS - NIGHT

               In the darkened stairway Eddie joins a group of outrageously 
               dressed characters. The door at the top of the stairs bursts 
               open on a punk-funk art student Halloween party.

               INT. PARTY - NIGHT

               A hundred people are jammed into the studio. It feels like 
               the Star Wars Saloon. The LIVE MUSICIANS match the look of 
               the party. The costumes are outrageous. Everyone is dancing.

               Eddie looks the place over. He spots Diana.

               Eddie walks over to her, grabbing a drink along the way. He 
               sidles up to Diana.

                                     EDDIE
                         Wanna play ball?

               She looks him over taking in the outfit, the bat.

                                     DIANA
                         Are you pitching?

                                     EDDIE
                         Some people say I've got a pretty 
                         good inside curve.

                                     DIANA
                         I don't know. You look strictly minor 
                         league.

               She smiles.

                                     EDDIE
                         I'm Eddie.

                                     DIANA
                         I make it Eddie-The-Cop.

                                     EDDIE
                         You've had a lot of experience with 
                         cops?

                                     DIANA
                         All bad.

               She is angry now, and walks away from him.

               Eddie watches her go, and is about to follow. He sets his 
               drink down, and turns to find a girl, luscious as hell, 
               dressed like a Frederick's wet dream, making eyes at him. 
               She takes his bat, and gives it a long, lascivious lick.

                                     EDDIE
                         You'll get slivers.

               He walks by her.

               INT. PARTY BACK ROOM - NIGHT

               Eddie steps over and around an assortment of wasted witches 
               and gooned out goblins snorting lines on the coffee table to 
               get to Diana who is tensely by herself.

               He grabs her purse.

                                     DIANA
                         Hey, what the hell do you think you're 
                         doing?

                                     EDDIE
                         I thought you knew all about cops. 
                         You don't put anything up your nose 
                         do you?

               Eddie searches Diana's purse. He find her drivers license.

                                     EDDIE
                         Diana Luna?
                              (pause)
                         You're Tony Luna's daughter?

               He drops the license into the purse and hands it back to 
               her. She stares him in the eye defiantly.

                                     DIANA
                         I don't know where he is, and I don't 
                         really give a shit.
                              (tired)
                         When are you people going to realize 
                         I don't have anything to do with my 
                         father.

               Eddie tries to give her his card.

                                     EDDIE
                         For when you need a friend.

               She won't take it.

                                     DIANA
                         I've got all the friends I want.

               Eddie puts the card into her purse.

                                     EDDIE
                         But do you have all the friends you 
                         need?

               She walks away angrily. Eddie watches her leave, and then 
               steps over a few of the wasted witches to get to the phone 
               on the drug laden coffee table. He dials.

                                     EDDIE
                              (to phone)
                         This is Sergeant Cusack. I want a 
                         team to cover a house on the southwest 
                         side.
                              (pause)
                         L-U-N-A, Anthony.
                              (pause)
                         Yeah. Crazy Tony Luna. I don't think 
                         he's around, but if he shows up bring 
                         him in.

               The dope-smoking party-goers stare at this cop in shock. One 
               of the ladies tries to casually cover the cocaine with a 
               magazine. Eddie hangs up the phone, and pushes past them to 
               the door.

                                     EDDIE
                              (nods)
                         Catch you later.

               He is out the door.

               INT. GYM - DAY

               Several plainclothes officers, some of them women, stand on 
               either side of the door with their backs to the wall, guns 
               at the ready. One of the men reaches out and POUNDS on the 
               door.

                                     OFFICER
                         Police! Open up!

               They rush the door and SMASH it, SHOUTING and scrambling 
               into the apartment.

                                     KOBAS (V.O.)
                              (from bullhorn)
                         Awright awright hold it.

               The instructor, Kobas, walks in criticizing their style.

                                     KOBAS
                         For Christ's sake! You tryin to get 
                         your partner killed, Jackson?

               This is not the real thing; only practice.

               CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL --

               INT. GYM - DAY

               The apartment is only a mockup set in the corner of this 
               vast skylit city warehouse. Runners race around the track at 
               the perimeter.

               On the wall are large photos and diagrams of the Prowler. 
               Below the photos are sign-up sheets for the required training 
               sessions.

               In another corner is the weight room, the ring, and the 
               workout area. Eddie is here, working out, sparring with a 
               partner who has large padded mits on each hand.

               INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY

               Brennan and a couple of buddies approach Kosalas as he ties 
               his gym shoes. Brennan is carrying a petition. He hands it 
               to Kosalas and looks around the room. He spots another cop. 
               Cragie is in the background putting on his jacket.

                                     BRENNAN
                              (shouts across the 
                              room)
                         Hey, Mahoney. I want you to help me 
                         get some signatures on this letter 
                         for Cragie.

               Brennan looks down at Kosalas who is hesitating. Kosalas 
               looks back at Cragie. There eyes meet. He signs.

               Cragie comes by and slaps him on the back.

                                     CRAGIE
                         Way to go, partner.

               INT. GYM - DAY

               We see Music talking to several cops working out the exercise 
               machines, and getting signatures on Cragie's petition.

               INT. GYM - DAY

               Eddie gives his sparring partner, Howard, a furious series 
               of blows, driving him back. They are kickboxing.

                                     HOWARD
                         Let's try the mitts for awhile.

               Eddie nods. He sees Cragie cross the gym and exit. As Cragie 
               goes out, Donato comes in on crutches. Everybody shouts a 
               greeting.

               Eddie sits down to change gloves, and take his footpads off.

                                     DONATO
                         Say, partner.

                                     EDDIE
                         How ya doing, Richie?

                                     DONATO
                         Swinging. How's this? Two G's, we 
                         get a sausage and beef stand stand 
                         outside Wrigley Field. You pass the 
                         beef, I take the cash. Free games. I 
                         got a contact downtown.

                                     EDDIE
                         How you gonna watch the game if you're 
                         hawking sandwiches?

                                     DONATO
                         Never thought of that. TV? Hey, I 
                         tell you about this nurse I met? 
                         Talk about physical therapy.

               The sparring partner returns, and Eddie goes back to practice.

                                     DONATO
                         She's got this friend just dying to 
                         meet you. Intensive care.

               Eddie grins.

               Brennan comes up to Donato, and hands him the petition. Donato 
               signs quickly.

                                     DONATO
                              (to Eddie)
                         Later, partner.

               Eddie nods to him, concentrating on the sparring.

                                     BRENNAN
                         Hey, Cusack. How about taking the 
                         gloves off long enough to sign this 
                         for Cragie.

                                     EDDIE
                         This about the hearing?

                                     BRENNAN
                         You bet.

                                     EDDIE
                         I pass.

                                     BRENNAN
                              (angry)
                         What the fuck's the matter with you?

                                     EDDIE
                         He's burnt, Brennan, and you know 
                         it. He was a good cop, but he ain't 
                         now.

               PUNCH! Eddie hits the mit so hard that Howard is knocked 
               back a couple of steps.

                                     BRENNAN
                         Get off your high horse, Cusack. He 
                         made a couple of mistakes, OK. The 
                         guy was a hero. What the fuck does a 
                         bunch of civilians know about comin' 
                         up some shithouse stairway day after 
                         day, scared outta your shorts.

               PUNCH! With a whirling kick, Eddie knocks the mit right out 
               of the Howard's hand, and across the gym.

               Eddie turns to face Brennan, nose to nose.

                                     EDDIE
                         We're all scared, Brennan. Cragie 
                         should have been off the street a 
                         long time ago. He's gonna hurt 
                         somebody else with his bullshit. 
                         Maybe even you.

               Eddie goes back to punching. Brennan storms out.

               EXT. LATIN STREET - DAY

               A funeral cortege makes it's way sedately down the street 
               past the Comacho owned pool hall. Two hearses, a flower car, 
               a limo, and several other cars with funeral stickers on their 
               windshields pass bye. The slain Comacho cousins from the 
               raid are being escorted to the cemetery.

               Luis Comacho is in the limo along with the woman from the 
               airport.

               INT. BRENNAN'S CAR - DAY

               Brennan and Music are following the procession. Brennan is 
               on the radio.

                                     MUSIC
                              (to mike)
                         The funeral director says they plan 
                         on cruisin right past luna's house.

               EXT. LUNA'S STREET - DAY

               Tito, one of Tony Luna's bodyguards, watches from the steps 
               of Luna's porch as a procession of cars follows the hearses 
               slowly up the street.

               At the end of the block, an old man is selling produce to 
               the neighborhood housewives off the tailgate of his truck. 
               They watch the procession in wonder.

               INT. EDDIE'S CAR - DAY

               The cortege passes the unmarked car down the block from Tony's 
               house. Eddie is watching. Kosalas is with him.

                                     KOSALAS
                              (to radio)
                         They're wastin' the show. Tony's not 
                         even in town.

                                     EDDIE
                         He'll get the word.

               Across the street, WE SEE another bodyguard joint Tito on 
               the front steps. They stand, arms folded, watching the 
               procession.

               INT. LIMO - DAY

               Luis Comacho takes a flower and tosses it out the window as 
               he cruises past the two goons. Their EYES LOCK. Tito walks 
               up and grinds the flower into the ground with his shoe.

               EXT. LUNA'S STREET - DAY

               Brennan and Music bring up the rear in their ummarked car.

               INT. LUNA'S HOUSE - DAY

               Tito, the body guard, picks up the phone.

               EXT. LAKE - DAY

               At the pay phone next to a lakeside bait shop, Tony Luna is 
               getting the word. He's worried.

                                     LUNA
                              (to phone)
                         What the fuck are you talkin about? 
                         Nobody's gonna touch nothin. Just 
                         stay put.
                              (pause)
                         I give a shit about their fuckin 
                         parade?

               A floozy slides up next to him, and he puts an arm around 
               her waist.

                                     LUNA
                              (to phone)
                         They wanna throw flowers we can fix 
                         it so they're pushing up daisys.

               He laughs. The girl joins in like she's supposed to.

               EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

               A tan Dodge rolls over the rutted scrapyard roadway, bouncing 
               toward the immense old warehouse along the river's edge. The 
               city seems to have abandoned this remote industrial area; 
               giant grain elevators, rusting freighters and vast scrapyards 
               surround us.

               INT. POMPAS' CAR - DAY

               Pompas and Efren Comacho drive through the gate and enter 
               the warehouse as the door opens for them.

               INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

               The car halts in the vast empty chamber. It is quickly 
               surrounded by members of the Comacho family. They begin to 
               unload the car. The trunk is filled with cases of heavy 
               ammunition.

               At the back of the warehouse, other Comachos are test firing 
               their weapons.

               INT. LUIS' OFFICE

               Luis is directing things as they are preparing for battle. 
               The weaponry spread on the table is astonishing.

               EXT. HARBOR - DAY

               Eddie's beat up Chevy is parked beyond the line of yachts 
               toward the end of the pier. Eddie gets out of the car. Kosalas 
               looks worried.

                                     KOSALAS
                         I can back you up.

                                     EDDIE
                         Stay by the radio.

               Eddie walks to the 75 foot steel cruiser tied to the end of 
               the pier.

               Eddie walks up the gangplank.

               EXT. YACHT - DAY

               An ape in a suit, ROCCO, appears.

                                     ROCCO
                         What the hell you doin' here? Off, 
                         asshole.

               Rocco goes for Eddie. A couple of quick blows and Rocco is 
               in the water. Eddie continues up the gangway to the rear of 
               the boat.

               EXT. YACHT - DAY

               Eddie finds FELIX (THE RAIL) SCALESE sitting on a chaise 
               lounge, reading. A beautiful girl lays on her stomach on a 
               deck pad typing at a personal computer terminal.

               Scalese looks up at Eddie. He is momentarily discombobulated, 
               but recovers.

                                     SCALESE
                              (referring to computer)
                         The modern age's answer to the crystal 
                         ball. Marvelous. If you know how to 
                         read it.
                              (pause)
                         Listen. If you have some extra cash, 
                         buy oranges. The price is low, and I 
                         can promise you the threatened 
                         trucking strike will be avoided.

                                     EDDIE
                         We talking about a bribe, Scalese?

                                     SCALESE
                         It's a prediction.

               Another beautiful bikinied girl comes by and gives Scalese a 
               tall cool drink.

                                     SCALESE
                         No. I wouldn't try to bribe Eddie 
                         Cusack.

               He drops the name with a smile. Eddie doesn't react.

                                     SCALESE
                         You're incorruptible. Untarnished. I 
                         hear they call you stainless steel 
                         on the street. Me, I think you're a 
                         fuckin' pain in the ass.

                                     EDDIE
                         Thanks.

                                     SCALESE
                              (frowning)
                         It's not a compliment.

                                     EDDIE
                         I'm looking for your nephew.

                                     SCALESE
                         Tony? Forget it. Tony Luna's none of 
                         your business.

                                     EDDIE
                         Wrong. Tony just made himself my 
                         business.

                                     SCALESE
                         No he didn't. We take care of our 
                         own. Just like the cops. Just like 
                         the Comachos. You understand.

               Eddie sits down next to Scalese and looks him in the eye.

                                     EDDIE
                         He shit on my turf, old man. And I'm 
                         going to nail him and anybody else 
                         tied to him. You understand, Felix?

                                     SCALESE
                              (with cool rage)
                         Nobody threatens Felix Scalese.

                                     EDDIE
                              (softly)
                         It's not a threat. It's a prediction.

               On the shore, Kosalas is honking the car horn to get Eddie's 
               attention. Eddie rises.

                                     EDDIE
                         There's a shitstorm coming. You better 
                         get yourself a good umbrella.

               The girl at the computer terminal watches him leave.

               EXT. YACHT - DAY

               Eddie walks by as Rocco, soaking wet, is pulling himself 
               from the water. Eddie pushes him into the water again.

               Kosalas is still sounding the HORN.

               EXT. HARBOR - DAY

               Eddie runs toward the car.

               EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

               A body lies in the flowers in the service area next to the 
               giant greenhouse. Several unmarked cars and two blue and 
               whites are parked in the dirt drive as Eddie and Kosalas 
               pull up. The cops have roped off the area. Music and Brennan 
               are there.

               Eddie looks at the body as Music comes over.

                                     MUSIC
                         Tony Luna's bagman.

               Kosalas looks at the body.

                                     MUSIC
                         They call that a Columbian necktie.

               Kosalas winces.

                                     MUSIC
                         They found the manager of Tony's 
                         restaurant hanging from a hook in 
                         his kitchen. Looked like someone 
                         tried to carve a canoe out of him. 
                         Tony's used car lot on Ashland is 
                         burning as we speak. The head salesman 
                         is a fried zuccini.

                                     KOSALAS
                         Oh Jesus. It's starting.

               Eddie stands to one side.

                                     EDDIE
                         Let's go.

               EXT. LUNA'S STREET - DAY

               A kid on a bike makes his way up the quiet tree-lined street, 
               tossing newspapers onto the porches of the block.

               Around the corner at the end of the block, the produce truck 
               starts slowly forward. As it turns onto Luna's block, a car 
               pulls up behind it and stops, blocking the street.

               The produce truck parks at the curb in front of the Luna 
               house. A neighbor from across the street approaches. The 
               front door of Luna's house opens, and Tito emerges, helping 
               Tony's aged mother down the steps to buy vegetables.

               INT. PRODUCE TRUCK - DAY

               On the floor near the wheelwell is the dead produce man.

               EXT. LUNA'S STREET - DAY

               The rear doors of the produce truck swing open. The neighbor, 
               Tito, and Tony's mother are instantly killed.

               From outside three Comachos enter the open front door of the 
               Luna house. We hear the SOUND of MUFFLED GUNFIRE from inside.

               INT. LUNA'S HOUSE - DAY

               Bits and pieces. A Shattered orange juice container. Eggs 
               cooking on the stove. A woman's vanity.

               On the floor; a woman's legs, a housecoat, slippers. A 
               silhouette of a Comacho in the hallway RAKING one of Tony's 
               guards.

               A family photo on the mantle which includes Diana and her 
               father is BLASTED to bits.

               EXT. LUNA'S BACK YARD - DAY

               One of Tony's men tries to escape through the back of the 
               house. He is pursued by a Comacho who guns him down.

               EXT. LUNA'S STREET - DAY

               Luis Comacho sits in a car in the next block surveying the 
               scene. The cousins are walking briskly out. They jump in a 
               car and drive off.

               INT. LUIS' CAR - DAY

               Luis nods to his driver. They pull away.

               EXT. LUNA'S STREET - DAY

               The street is QUIET again. Next door, a neighbor, wearing 
               only his underpants and carrying an old pistol, stands 
               trembling in disbelief.

               EXT. LAKE - DAY

               Pines reflect in the dappled lake as Tony Luna rows slowly 
               for shore. He ties up at the dock. He's taking his tackle 
               out of the boat when one of his boys comes running down to 
               the dock.

               We cannot hear the conversation but we can see Tony drop the 
               tackle box and we can hear his SCREAM echo across the water.

               EXT. EDDIE'S STREET - DAY

               Eddie runs down the rear stairs to Kosalas' unmarked car. He 
               opens the driver's door, pushes Kosalas across the seat, and 
               gets behind the wheel. He PEELS OUT.

               INT. UNMARKED CAR - DAY

                                     KOSALAS
                         Music's at the scene.

               Eddie picks up the mike.

                                     EDDIE
                              (to mike)
                         Was there a girl? Late teens. Reddish 
                         hair.

                                     MUSIC (V.O.)
                              (on radio)
                         Two male caucasians, two female. One 
                         mid-to-late forties. The other a 
                         grandmother.

               With the SIREN full out, LEANING ON the HORN, he simply puts 
               his foot on the floor and sends the car into a four wheel 
               drift that slides into a neat U-turn.

               EXT. LIBRARY - DAY

               Eddie leaves the car running, and burst through the main 
               entrance flashing his badge at the stunned security guards.

               INT. LIBRARY - DAY

               Eddie races through the corridors and reading rooms searching, 
               Kosalas arriving at his heels.

               INT. LIBRARY - DAY

               Gamiani tells Diana about her mother and grandmother.

               INT. LIBRARY - DAY

               Three Comachos; Pompas, Efren, and ANGEL, search for Diana.

               EXT. LIBRARY - DAY

               Lou Gamiani emerges from the building with Diana. She is 
               terrified.

               He checks out the scene, then descends the crowded steps and 
               crosses the street, keeping a sharp lookout.

               EXT. FLOWER SHOP - DAY

               Luis and Victor Comacho loiter by the outdoor flower stand 
               next to the library. They watch the activity on the library 
               steps.

               EXT. LIBRARY - DAY

               Distracted for an instant by a cluster of conventioneers, 
               Lou fails to notice the two Comachos who have fallen in step 
               behind them. He goes down with a gasp, almost silently, a 
               knife sticking from his back. A Comacho grabs Diana's arm. 
               She jabs him in the eyes, and runs.

               Diana disappears into the crowd.

               Hysterical citizens scatter in all directions. A woman stands 
               in horror unable to keep from looking at Gamiani's body lying 
               on the sidewalk. She SCREAMS.

               Eddie and Kosalas come crashing out of the entrance of the 
               museum.

               The girl isn't here.

               Eddie spots a commotion at the end of the block, under the 
               el station.

               He dashes down the steps and across the street with traffic 
               screeching to a halt.

               Kosalas flags down a blue and white, and barks for backup, 
               then tears out after Eddie.

               EXT. WABASH AVENUE - DAY

               In the shadow of the el tracks, Diana runs for her life, 
               racing north on Wabash through crowds of shoppers with the 
               Comachos moving relentlessly a half block behind.

               Opposite Marshall Field's, she abruptly cuts across traffic 
               and runs into an alley between the giant men's and women's 
               stores.

               With terror in her eyes, Diana runs, searching frantically 
               for a guard, a policeman, somebody with a gun. But the 
               Comachos are closing in on her.

               She dives through a revolving door into the building.

               INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY

               Diana runs past the perfume displays, notions, and lingerie, 
               and out the Randolph Street exit.

               EXT. RANDOLPH STREET - DAY

               Two Camachos, who stayed on the street, spot her as she 
               leaves.

               Racing through the alley, Eddie spots them running in the 
               next block.

               EXT. LAKE STREET - DAY

               Running east on Lake Street, she glances over her shoulder. 
               She doesn't see them. She ducks into the alley. But the 
               Comachos round the corner just in time to catch a glimpse of 
               her.

               EXT. ALLEY - DAY

               This alley leads to the lower level of Michigan Avenue. She 
               turns back to find the exit blocked by the Comachos. She 
               flees downward.

               INT. LOWER MICHIGAN - DAY

               The green flourescents of the "Emerald City" give a deathly 
               cast to the underground street as Diana rounds the corner, 
               and collapses against the wall. Her heart pounding like a 
               frightened deer, she has run as far as she can.

               Pompas Comacho and two of his colleagues come racing around 
               the corner. They spot her crouched against the wall.

               She starts to SCREAM but Angel grabs her by the collar and 
               pulls her up to his face and she stops, wide-eyed with terror 
               as he touches her throat with his knife.

                                     POMPAS
                         Come on, Chika. We gonna have some 
                         fun. You gonna take us to your father.

               We hear a loud metallic CLICK. We see the barrel of a huge 
               revolver. They wheel to see Eddie crouched, gun drawn, in 
               the alley entrance.

                                     EDDIE
                         Pompas, you're getting to be a fucking 
                         pain in the ass.

               The boys put their hands up, but Eddie doesn't see the third, 
               SAMO, coming up behind him.

               Angel grabs Diana by the hair, shielding himself, and starts 
               backing up the stairs that lead to the street.

                                     EDDIE
                         Let her go, pooch.

               Samo jumps Eddie, and the gun goes flying. It hits the 
               pavement and bounces off the high curb into the street.

               In a staggering blur Eddie takes out the Comachos, kicking 
               the last one end over end. But Angel and the girl have 
               disappeared to the street above.

               Eddie retrieves his gun and runs up the steps.

               EXT. STATE LAKE EL STATION - DAY

               With a knife at her side, Angel Comacho leads Diana up the 
               steps of the old el station. They pass through the turnstyle 
               out onto the platform just as the train pulls to in. Angel 
               forces her onto the train.

               Eddie comes pounding up the steps and onto the platform just 
               in time to stop the closing train door with his foot.

               INT. EL TRAIN - DAY

               Eddie wedges his way aboard and the train pulls out. The 
               passengers looks at him like he's crazy.

               Eddie works his way through the cars toward the rear.

               Angel spots him. Knife still in hand, he pulls Diana from 
               car to car past the terrified passengers until finally he is 
               cornered at the end of the train. Angel searches frantically 
               for a way out.

               Eddie enters. Diana sees him.

                                     ANGEL
                         Another step, and I take her head 
                         off.

                                     EDDIE
                         You don't have the balls.

               Eddie takes another step.

               Diana slams her elbow into Angel's groin, and breaks free.

               Angel jumps back. He breaks open the rear door and climbs 
               out.

               EXT. EL TRAIN - DAY

               Angel climbs up the back of the car onto the roof.

               Eddie's right behind him.

               The spectacular pursuit from car to car on the roof of the 
               speeding el train is witnessed by startled second-floor 
               secretaries whose desks look directly out at the roof of the 
               passing cars.

               VERY HIGH ANGLE

               Angel and Eddie's figures appear as specks, roaring through 
               the canyon of skyscrapers.

               ON TRAIN ROOF

               A low bridge forces both men to hug the roof of the train. 
               Eddie recovers first and grabs Angel, pulling him down. They 
               roll from side to side on the roof, nearly slipping over the 
               side. With a desperate shove, Angel breaks free. Eddie points 
               his gun at him. The train is now over the Chicago River. 
               Angel dives into the water.

               Eddie reholsters his gun and dives in after him.

               INT. EL TRAIN - DAY

               We see Diana's looking out the window of the train. She 
               follows Eddie's decent with her eyes.

               EXT. RIVER - DAY

               Dozens of startled pedestrians line the bridge railing as 
               Eddie swims toward Angel, bobbing in the middle of the stream.

               A hotdogger in a speedboat is racing up the river and Angel 
               is directly in his path. The skipper, showing off for his 
               passengers, doesn't notice him until he hears the sickening 
               THUNK under the keel. The boat's wake is suddenly red with 
               blood.

               EXT. RIVER BANK - DAY

               Eddie is helped from the water by a couple of passersby.

               He stands there, soaking wet, looking around.

               A crowd is gathering. We hear SIRENS in the background. Then 
               he spots her.

               Diana is standing on the bridge watching him.

               EXT. BRIDGE - DAY

               Eddie walks to Diana, and she folds into his arms. He holds 
               her a second.

               EXT. LAGOON - DAY

               Eddie, now in dry clothes, and Diana walk along the lagoon.

               They talk, argue, and she sits on a bench and cries. Eddie 
               comforts her.

                                     DIANA
                         Where are you taking me?

                                     EDDIE
                         Downtown first. Then I'm gonna place 
                         you in protective custody.

                                     DIANA
                         The hell you are!

                                     EDDIE
                         You'll be safe --

                                     DIANA
                         I'll take my chances.

               INT. EDDIE'S HALL - NIGHT

               Eddie and Diana climb the stairs.

               INT. PIRELLI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               The DOORBELL buzzes repeatedly.

                                     PIRELLI
                              (shouts)
                         Keep your goddamn pants on!

               Pirelli, padding across the floor in his shorts, looks like 
               a bear called out of hibernation. He has a service revolver 
               in his hand. He peers through the peep hole, then unbolts 
               the door.

                                     PIRELLI
                         This your idea of a social call?

               Eddie enters with Diana.

                                     EDDIE
                         Fred Pirelli, this is Diana. Diana 
                         Luna.

               Pirelli reacts to the name.

               Diana is in a daze, close to shock.

               Pirelli takes her and leads her to the couch.

                                     PIRELLI
                         C'mon, kid. Let's get you off your 
                         feet.

               Eddie motions him aside.

                                     EDDIE
                         Can you put her up till I find her 
                         old man?

                                     PIRELLI
                         Does a bear...?

                                     EDDIE
                         Am I putting you on the spot?

                                     PIRELLI
                         I spent 30 years on the spot. What 
                         ever you need.

               Eddie starts to go, and Diana reacts, suddenly frightened.

                                     DIANA
                         Eddie?

                                     EDDIE
                         I'll be right across the hall. I'm 
                         just gonna clean up.

               He leaves.

               INT. EDDIE'S APARTMENT

               Eddie falls fully clothed onto the mattress. The PHONE RINGS.

               He rolls over in disbelief, staring at the ceiling.

               It RINGS, and RINGS again and again and again. He finally 
               picks it up.

               INT. TAVERN - NIGHT

               This is the after-hours watering hole for the police force 
               and half the cops we've seen so far, including Cragie, are 
               clustered at the bar or playing darts at the back of the 
               room. There are a half a dozen women there also. Three of 
               them are cops.

               Kosalas is here too. He's been drinking. He leans against 
               the wall talking on the pay phone by the men's room.

                                     KOSALAS
                              (to phone)
                         Say, Eddie. Why don' you come by and 
                         tip a few?
                              (pause)
                         Cause I gotta talk to you.
                              (pause)
                         Yeah, I know. But we gotta talk.
                              (pause)
                         Please.
                              (pause)
                         Yeah, at Mike's.

               He hangs up and heads back to his table, passing Officer 
               Music at the bar.

                                     MUSIC
                         You oughta crash, man. You had a 
                         helluva day.

               EXT. TAVERN - NIGHT

               Two tough looking guys are watching the entrance to the bar 
               from a car parked across the street. We can HEAR the NOISE 
               from the BAR.

                                     FIRST HOOD
                         Love it, Flash. Gonna be a slide. 
                         Easy in, easy out.

                                     SECOND HOOD
                         Just a quick and dirty?

                                     FIRST HOOD
                         Yeah, yeah, nothin to it. You know 
                         the drill.

               They check their weapons.

               INT. TAVERN - NIGHT

               Everybody but Kosalas is having a good time. Donato, flanked 
               by two girls, foot up on a chair, entertains a small crowd.

                         He picks her up on Forty-third, and 
                         he's takin' in. She says, "Say, baby. 
                         Ain't no need for goin' downtown." 
                         An' she pulls back her skirt. So the 
                         dumb shit climbs in the back an' 
                         takes a piece...
                              (starts to chuckle)
                         ...an' leaves the keys in the front 
                         and locks the two of 'em in the squad. 
                         And he hasta kick out the window 
                         see, an' she starts screamin', "Rape! 
                         Rape!" An' they charge him with rape 
                         an' every other fuckin' thing in the 
                         book. Internal Affairs is gonna give 
                         him a kayak and a lantern an' put 
                         him out in the lake.

               A group laughs at the story. There is a stillness at the 
               front door. One of the hoods from outside steps in. He wears 
               a leather coat.

               The heads at the bar turn.

               He walks the length of the bar and enters the john. He is 
               obviously out of place in this saloon. Nobody has both hands 
               on the bar.

               The front door opens. The other hood steps in, walks up to 
               the bar, and orders.

                                     SECOND HOOD
                         Bartender. Gimme a black russian and 
                         a Courvoisier.

               The First Hood comes out of the bathroom and walks up to the 
               bar. Suddenly he whips a sawed-off shotgun from under his 
               coat.

                                     FIRST HOOD
                              (bellows)
                         Yo! Get your hands up motherfuckers. 
                         This is a ho --

               THIRTY HAMMERS CLICK. Thirty guns are drawn.

               The room is frozen. Only the JUKEBOX makes a sound. The two 
               hoods, eyes fixed on the array of iron pointed at them, can't 
               even swallow. Finally...

                                     SECOND HOOD
                              (to partner)
                         You stupid motherfucker.

               The cops swarm the hoods and in an instant they are on the 
               floor being cuffed and roughly handled. Kosalas is at the 
               end of the bar, frozen, his gun still in his holster.

               EXT. TAVERN - NIGHT

               Eddie gets out of his car and heads for the front door.

               INT. TAVERN - NIGHT

               The place is in an uproar -- everybody doubled up with 
               LAUGHTER -- as the two luckless hoods, handcuffed together, 
               are lying on the filthy tavern floor under a table. They 
               continue to berate each other.

               Eddie enters.

                                     SECOND HOOD
                         My old lady tol' me you was fucked 
                         up in the head. Do I listen? Piece o 
                         cake, you say. Snap, you say. Nothin 
                         to it, you say.

                                     COP
                         Shut up over there.

               Donato spots Eddie and calls to him.

                                     DONATO
                         Eddie! Partner! Meet Ruthie. Dental 
                         Hygienist. She's oral.

               Ruthie giggles.

                                     DONATO
                         And this is... Marlene. She works 
                         for a proctologist.

               Marlene swats at him.

                                     DONATO
                         Siddown, partner. I got a proposition 
                         for you.

                                     EDDIE
                         Not now, Donato.

                                     DONATO
                         O.K. O.K. But just let me plant two 
                         words in your brain. Alligator 
                         farming.

               Eddie shakes his head and walks to the back of the room where 
               Kosalas sits hunched over a drink, the only man in the room 
               not laughing. He looks up whens Eddie pulls over a chair.

                                     KOSALAS
                         Beer?

               Eddie nods, and Kosalas signals the waitress. There is a 
               long beat at Kosalas fidgets and Eddie waits.

                                     KOSALAS
                         Looks like I'm caught between the 
                         rock and the hard place, Sarge.

               Eddie just looks at him.

                                     KOSALAS
                         You know I really wanted to be a 
                         good cop, but... shit. It's hard 
                         enough sometimes just to stay alive. 
                         Comes so easy to you. You got all 
                         the fuckin' answers. Me, I'm still 
                         tryin' to find the questions.

               Eddie is still silent. Kosalas takes a swig of his beer, and 
               finally blurts is out.

                                     KOSALAS
                         Cragie planted the gun on the kid. 
                         Just wasted him, and then I... I 
                         don't know what to do about the 
                         hearing tomorrow...

                                     EDDIE
                         Tell the truth.

                                     KOSALAS
                         See. It's all so nothin' for you. If 
                         I talk straight every cop on the 
                         force will shit on me. If I don't... 
                         Cragie gets away with murder.

                                     EDDIE
                         And the chance to do it again. Next 
                         time he might take away a cop. That 
                         make any difference?

                                     KOSALAS
                         He's my partner.

                                     EDDIE
                         Your partner's selling you out, 
                         Kosalas. He kills an unarmed kid, 
                         and now he's risking your ass to 
                         save his own.

                                     KOSALAS
                         It was a mistake.

                                     EDDIE
                         It cost an innocent kid his life.

                                     KOSALAS
                         I know that! I KNOW THAT!

               He is too loud, and attracts attention.

                                     KOSALAS
                              (softly)
                         Jesus. I see that kid's face every 
                         time I close my eyes.

                                     EDDIE
                         Tell 'em like it is, Nick. I'll back 
                         you up.

               Eddie gets up and walks away.

               INT. TAVERN - NIGHT

               The two amateur holdup men are being hustled out to the paddy 
               wagon as Eddie heads for the door. Someone grabs his arm.

               It's Cragie, a little drunk.

                                     CRAGIE
                         Nice to see you out with the boys 
                         for a change, Sarge.

                                     EDDIE
                         Hello, Cragie.

                                     CRAGIE
                         They tell me my Sergeant wouldn't 
                         sign for me. You want to tell me 
                         why?

                                     EDDIE
                         You know why.

                                     CRAGIE
                         No. Tell me.

                                     EDDIE
                              (gently)
                         You were a good cop for a lot of 
                         years. You've passed your limit now 
                         Cragie.

                                     CRAGIE
                         Fuck you. Where do you get off?

                                     EDDIE
                         Right about here.

               Eddie walks out the door.

               INT. EDDIE'S HALL - NIGHT

               Eddie buzzes the door. Pirelli opens it. He lets Eddie in, 
               scans the hall, and closes it.

               INT. PIRELLI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Pirelli sets down his gun, and pours Eddie a cup of coffee.

                                     PIRELLI
                         She's havin' a bad night. Gave her a 
                         shot of brandy. Maybe she'll sleep.

                                     EDDIE
                         Giving liquor to a minor, Pirelli?

               He turns to leave.

                                     EDDIE
                         I'll be back right after the hearing 
                         tomorrow, and you can get some sleep 
                         then.

               INT. PIRELLI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Eddie cracks the door and peeks in. Diana sits on the bed, a 
               lonely forlorn figure.

               She looks at Eddie, and tries a smile that fails.

               Eddie walks over to sit on the bed next to her.

               She falls apart, and lies down, on the verge of crying, 
               collapsing so that her head rest in Eddie's lap.

               They are quiet like that for a moment, she curled into a 
               ball, Eddie stroking her hair.

                                     DIANA
                         What do you do when you don't have 
                         anyone?

                                     EDDIE
                         You find someone.

               She looks up at him.

                                     DIANA
                         Could you... Hold me for a while?

               Eddie lays on the bed beside her. She curls up in his arms, 
               and closes her eyes. Eddie's eyes remain open.

               INT. HEARING ROOM - DAY

               The Civilian Review Board is in the Office of Professional 
               Standards. The panel consists of eight civilians. It is a 
               real cross-section of the city of Chicago. Leon Partida chairs 
               the proceedings. We recognize several faces from the opening 
               bust.

               An old Mexican woman is on the stand facing the panel. Cragie 
               sits at a table with his representative, facing the officials.

               A female panel member is questioning the old woman.

                                     MALE PANEL MEMBER
                         How far were you standing from where 
                         your grandson was shot, Mrs. Murillio?

               The question must be TRANSLATED by a bumbling clerk, the old 
               woman answers in Spanish, then the answer is translated.

                                     CLERK
                         In the next doorway. Four meters.

               The room is packed. In addition to the police officers, 
               character witnesses, and friends of the dead kid, there are 
               a dozen reporters.

               Eddie enters and looks over the scene. He nods to Donato, 
               sitting at the rail with his foot propped up.

                                     DONATO
                         How you doin', Sarge?

                                     EDDIE
                         What's the score?

                                     DONATO
                              (nods toward witness)
                         Kid's grandmother says Cragie threw 
                         down the pistola.

               Eddie takes a seat. Officer Cragie is called back to the 
               witness stand.

                                     PARTIDA
                              (to steno)
                         Officer Cragie has already been sworn.
                              (pause)
                         Officer Cragie, you have heard Mrs. 
                         Murillio's testimony --

                                     CRAGIE
                         Yes, sir.

               Cragie is neat as a pin, humble, cooperative to a fault.

                                     PARTIDA
                         You have heard her tell this panel 
                         that she saw you lay the gun in her 
                         grandson's hand.

               He feigns compassion.

                                     CRAGIE
                         I'm not saying the woman would make 
                         this up. But there's no way she could 
                         have seen anything from where she 
                         was standing in a hallway that dark.
                              (pause)
                         Like you said, she's the boy's 
                         grandmother.

                                     PARTIDA
                         If it was dark, Officer, how were 
                         you sure Vega had a gun?

                                     CRAGIE
                         We were lucky. There was a glint of 
                         light, a reflection comin off the 
                         barrel of the weapon.

               EXT. EDDIE'S ALLEY - DAY

               A carload of Comachos, including Luis, cruises down the street 
               and parks in the alley next to Eddie's building.

               INT. OPS HALL - DAY

               The hearing is in recess and the hall is filled with smokers 
               and coffee drinkers.

               Eddie is getting a BUSY SIGNAL on the pay phone.

               Donato approaches.

                                     DONATO
                         You think he'll get a pass?

                                     EDDIE
                         You heard it all. What do you think?

                                     DONATO
                         If the hearing was over I'd have to 
                         put my money on the old lady.
                              (smiles)
                         But Kosalas's next. My bet's on 
                         Cragie.

                                     EDDIE
                         The kid may surprise you.

               Eddie dials the number again. Still a busy signal.

               INT. PIRELLI'S APARTMENT - DAY

               Pirelli has Eddie's answering machine plugged in, and is 
               tinkering with the insides.

               Diana comes into the living room, toweling her wet hair, 
               just out of the shower, but in her street clothes.

               INT. HEARING ROOM - DAY

               Kosalas is on the witness stand.

                                     PARTIDA
                         And right after you heard Officer 
                         Cragie's gun discharge, what did you 
                         do then?

                                     KOSALAS
                         I immediately advanced down the hall.

                                     PARTIDA
                         And what did you see?

                                     KOSALAS
                         The deceased, Vega, lying on the 
                         floor. Officer Cragie was checking 
                         his vital signs.

                                     PARTIDA
                         What happened then?

                                     KOSALAS
                         We recovered a .25 calibre automatic 
                         from the teenager's right hand.

                                     PARTIDA
                         Did you see that weapon in Vega's 
                         hand before Officer Cragie fired?

                                     KOSALAS
                         Yes, sir.

               Cragie leans back.

               A ripple is felt in the crowd. The reaction of the boy's 
               relatives, delayed by translation, is one of outrage.

                                     PARTIDA
                         No more questions.

               As Kosalas steps down he keeps his eyes on the floor ahead 
               of him avoiding eye contact.

               Eddie leans back in his seat. A couple of people get up and 
               head for the door.

               Eddie gets to his feet and heads for the door. Partida hits 
               the gavel.

                                     PARTIDA
                         I'd like to now call Sergeant Cusack.

               Eddie halts with his hand on the knob.

               INT. PIRELLI'S APARTMENT - DAY

               Pirelli works on the answering machine, but the phone is 
               reconnected. Diana is looking at photographs on the wall.

                                     DIANA
                         You made that uniform look good.

               Pirelli looks up.

                                     PIRELLI
                         That good looking gorilla next to me 
                         is Eddie's father. Better than good 
                         cop. Killed in the line of duty. 
                         '71.
                              (pause)
                         Another cop shot him. An accident.

               He goes back to the machine.

               INT. EDDIE'S HALL - DAY

               The Comachos come up the stairs, led by Luis. They stop at 
               Eddie's door. They pull out their guns, and kick the door 
               in.

               Across the hall, Pirelli's door opens, and Pirelli, holding 
               his pistol steps into the hall.

               The Comachos turn and fire, blasting Pirelli back into his 
               apartment.

               Through the open door we see Diana dash across the living 
               room.

               INT. PIRELLI'S APARTMENT - DAY

               Luis and his men burst in.

               Diana runs for the phone.

               A Comacho takes it from her and rips it from the wall.

               Diana is caught by two Comachos.

               INT. HEARING ROOM - DAY

               Eddie is on the witness stand.

                                     EDDIE
                         I can't comment on that. It was over 
                         before I got there.

                                     PARTIDA
                         You are his superior officer, are 
                         you not?

                                     EDDIE
                         Cragie's in my unit, yes.

                                     PARTIDA
                         Did you give the men their various 
                         assignments?

                                     EDDIE
                         I did.

                                     PARTIDA
                         Did you request that officer Cragie 
                         be on your TAC team?

                                     EDDIE
                         No, I didn't.

               Partida lifts a document from the table.

                                     PARTIDA
                         Sergeant... I have here a department 
                         document dated 24 September, of last 
                         year. It is a request by you, to 
                         your superiors, to have Officer Cragie 
                         transferred to another unit. Are you 
                         familiar with this document?

                                     EDDIE
                         Yes.

               The room listens to every word.

                                     PARTIDA
                         Why did you request his transfer?

                                     EDDIE
                         Maybe 30 years is too long for anyone 
                         to look at the city's guts, Mr. 
                         Partida.

                                     PARTIDA
                         What happened to this request?

                                     EDDIE
                         It was denied.

               Partida lifts another document.

                                     PARTIDA
                         This is a letter of support for 
                         Officer Cragie.
                              (hands it to him)
                         Everyone in his unit signed it but 
                         you.
                              (pause)
                         Why?

               Eddie glances over the letter and hands it back.

                                     EDDIE
                         I don't agree with what it says.

                                     PARTIDA
                         Are you saying you do not believe 
                         Officer Cragie is fit to work the 
                         streets of Chicago?

                                     EDDIE
                         That's what I'm saying.

               INT. OPS HALL - DAY

               The reporters are clustered around Eddie as he emerges but 
               he walks past them back to the pay phone. He puts in a quarter 
               and dials. Frowns.

               The cops in the corridor are passing the word about Eddie's 
               testimony, discussing it in little clusters. Their appearance 
               is frightening. Eddie dials another number.

                                     EDDIE
                              (to phone)
                         I just dialed 348-6610, and I get 
                         this funny buzz. Check the line for 
                         me? Thanks.

               Cragie, backed up by a couple of buddies, comes up to him.

                                     BRENNAN
                         Seems to me the man's got his tongue 
                         stuck to his asshole, Cragie.

                                     CRAGIE
                         Hey, that don't bother him. He's the 
                         fuckin White Knight.
                              (to Eddie)
                         You wanna take on the whole world by 
                         yourself? Now you're gonna get your 
                         chance, Sarge.

               They walk down the hall.

                              (from phone)
                         Sorry, sir, that number seems to be 
                         out of service. I've reported it.

               Eddie drops the phone.

               INT. OPS HALL - DAY

               Eddie races down the hallway past hostile clusters of former 
               friends.

               Roaring north on the boulevard without regard to traffic, 
               Eddie speeds toward his house in his rattling Chevy.

               Eddie rockets through the red lights LEANING on his HORN.

               INT. EDDIE'S HALL - DAY

               Eddie runs up the stairs, and slows when he sees Odell. The 
               boy is sitting on the floor, head in his hands, crying.

               Just past Odell, several uniformed policemen are standing 
               over Pirelli's body. They step back as Eddie approaches.

                                     COP
                         He was a friend of yours wasn't he?

                                     EDDIE
                         Yeah.

               Eddie hurries to the bedroom and back. He rushes out of the 
               apartment.

               Eddie runs for the Chevy and peels away from the curb.

               Eddie is on the radio, speeding west on Diversey Parkway.

               Music is standing on a streetcorner talking to a couple of 
               hookers.

               Down the street, Brennan waits in their unmarked car.

               Eddie squeals to a stop, hops out of the car, starts for the 
               pool hall.

               Eddie enters the poolhall.

               INT. POOL HALL - DAY

               The place is busy. Everybody in sight is either mean or ugly. 
               Eddie enters and a dozen pair of eyes are on him.

               The pool players not connected with this confrontation take 
               one look at him, hang up their cues, and split.

               Eddie heads for the back of the room. A pair of heavyweights 
               fall in behind him. One of them grabs Eddie.

                                     HEAVY
                         Hey, you ain't got no business back 
                         there.

                                     EDDIE
                         I want your opinion I'll beat it out 
                         of you.

               Eddie spins with deadly precision and catches them in mid-
               step and they go down like gut-shot rhinos.

               He heads for the rear hallway and everybody clears a path.

               He steps up to the door in back and kicks it in.

               INT. POOL HALL BACK ROOM - DAY

               A startled Camacho, DEGAS, looks up, straw in hand with a 
               line of coke on a mirror on his desk.

                                     EDDIE
                         Where is Luis?

                                     DEGAS
                         Get the hell out of here.

               Eddie grabs Degas by the hair and starts slamming his face 
               into the mirror which shatters with every blow.

                                     EDDIE
                         Talk to me, Degas, or I'll hit you 
                         with so many lefts you're gonna beg 
                         for a right.

               He holds up Degas' head to look him in the eye. Blood and 
               cocaine stain the man's face.

                                     DEGAS
                         He's coming here. He's on his way.

               Eddie lifts the head once and gives Degas one punch in the 
               face that sends him ass over teakettle across the floor.

               INT. POLICE COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - DAY

               Beneath the lighted map of Area 4, the police dispatcher 
               trying to raise Eddie's backup.

                                     DISPATCHER
                         We need a verification on a back-up 
                         for Unit 1462...

               The dispatcher at the next panel overhears the call.

                                     SECOND DISPATCHER
                         1462. That's Cusack, right?

               First dispatcher nods.

                                     SECOND DISPATCHER
                         Good luck finding a backup for that 
                         character.

               INT. POOL HALL - DAY

               Eddie opens the door and emerges from the back room. A dozen 
               Comacho goons have gathered. Behind them are another two 
               dozen hostile spectators. But no sign of the backup.

               He pulls out his gun. The remaining innocent bystanders split 
               for the exit. Eddie walks forward into the room. The Comachos 
               and their soldiers stand around him. Several have guns.

               Eddie keeps them under the point of his gun. He gets to the 
               door and has to turn his back on it to keep the gang in his 
               sights.

               A gun is pressed into Eddie's back. He drops his gun.

               Luis kicks Eddie across the room. Eddie lands at the feet of 
               the gang.

                                     LUIS
                         Take him apart.

               Eddie springs to his feet, and in the same motion decks his 
               nearest attacker. The battle is on. Hardwood pool cues crack 
               around him.

               The first four or five never get a chance to lay a finger on 
               him. Battered and broken, they litter the billiard tables 
               and floor. But Eddie is outnumbered 20 to 1.

               INT. TAVERN - DAY

               Cragie and Kosalas sit at the bar. The TV is off, and the 
               few customers pay attention to the police monitor.

                                     DISPATCHER (V.O.)
                              (from radio)
                         ...request verification for backup 
                         for unit 1462. Patrol 47, are you in 
                         the area.

                                     OFFICER (V.O.)
                              (from radio)
                         Squad. 47. We're having vehicular 
                         problems. Not able to respond.

               Cragie smiles. Kosalas looks ashamed.

               EXT. SQUAD CAR - DAY

               Two uniformed police sit in a cruiser.

                                     DISPATCHER (V.O.)
                              (from radio)
                         ...need backup at 18th and Halstead...

               One cop turns to the other.

                                     COP
                         Fuck him.

               INT. POOL HALL - DAY

               Coming at Eddie now from all sides, the Comachos wear into 
               him. Finally they begin to connect. Blind-sided, he goes 
               down and they are on him like jackals.

               They drag him to the top of the rear stairs, and kick him 
               down to the alley.

               It seems like they are about to finish him off when suddenly 
               all is quiet. The crowd parts. Eddie looks up through swollen 
               eyes to see Luis Comacho standing above him, cool as ice. 
               Luis reaches down and pulls Eddie's head up by the ear.

                                     LUIS
                         The sun comes up. You give me Luna, 
                         or the girl dies -- slow.

               Luis kicks him in the face.

               EXT. POOL HALL ALLEY - NIGHT

               Eddie opens a bloody eye and looks over his surroundings. 
               He's alone. He moves, a joint at a time, checking himself 
               out.

               Staggering to his feet, he opens a spiggot on the wall. He 
               lets the cold water wash over his head.

               INT. POOL HALL - NIGHT

               Donato hobbles through the deserted pool hall, his pistol in 
               his hand.

               EXT. POOL HALL ALLEY - NIGHT

               Donato comes out the back door of the poolhall, and finds 
               Eddie sitting on his haunches and resting against a wall 
               between two garbage cans.

                                     DONATO
                         I would have been here, Sarge. They 
                         kept it from me.

                                     EDDIE
                         You're Ok, Hopalong.

               Donato holsters his gun, and helps Eddie to his feet.

                                     DONATO
                         Listen, I'm havin' a drink with this 
                         friend of mine, name of Mickie. She 
                         works on a computer over in the 
                         Federal Building, FBI. I got here as 
                         soon as I heard.

                                     EDDIE
                         They got Diana Luna.

                                     DONATO
                         That's what I'm tryin' to tell ya. 
                         Mickie told me she read on the wire 
                         Tony Luna's comin' into Union Station 
                         at ten tonight.

               Eddie runs down the alley toward his car.

               EXT. TRAIN STATION - NIGHT

               Eddie's car pulls up. He gets out and runs inside.

               INT. TRAIN STATION - NIGHT

               A train sits at the platform. Tony Luna is walking down the 
               platform.

               INT. TRAIN STATION - NIGHT

               Eddie runs through the cavernous lobby.

               EXT. TRAIN STATION - NIGHT

               Eddie arrives in time to see Tony step into a waiting Cadillac 
               that immediately takes off.

               Eddie races up the ramp to his car.

               EXT. UNION STATION - NIGHT

               Eddie jumps into his car, and roars away in pursuit of the 
               Cadillac.

               EXT. CADILLAC - NIGHT

               Tony settles in, and then sees Scalese sitting calmly in the 
               back seat.

                                     TONY LUNA
                              (surprised)
                         Hello, Felix.

                                     SCALESE
                         Hello, Tony.

               Tony moves for his gun. The hood next to Tony relieves him 
               of his gun, using his own for persuasion.

                                     SCALESE
                              (sighs)
                         You see, Tony. You make no sense. 
                         You start a war... Waste people... 
                         Money... You're like a kid, Tony. 
                         You're a bad boy.

               Tony is scared. The driver spots something in the rearview 
               mirror.

               EXT. LOOP - NIGHT

               The Cadillac rockets through the empty orange-lighted canyons 
               of the financial district, with Eddie in hot pursuit.

               EXT. UPPER WACKER - NIGHT

               Roaring north on Wacker past an astonished group in front of 
               the Civic Opera House, the Cadillac drops out of sight on 
               the down-ramp to Lower Wacker.

               EXT. LOWER WACKER - NIGHT

               This bi-level street is as different as night and day. The 
               lower level's eerie green lights make us feel like we're 
               under water. Iron girders and concrete pillars support the 
               street above.

               LOW WIDE ANGLE

               The Cadillac races through this vast man-made cavern, past 
               the sub-level loading docks and service entrances of 
               skyscrapers above. City work crews and all night commercial 
               deliveries dot both the upper and lower levels of the chase.

               INT. EDDIE'S CAR - NIGHT

               Eddie is gaining in the battered Chevy. The Cadillac rockets 
               up the next ramp to the street level.

               EXT. UPPER WACKER - NIGHT

               The Cadillac zooms up from below, crosses the intersection, 
               and immediately takes the next down-ramp. Eddie flies up 
               from below, briefly airborne, barreling after them into the 
               tunnel.

               EXT. LOWER WACKER - NIGHT

               A block later the Cadillac heads topside again. Eddie takes 
               a gamble and goes straight ahead.

               At the next down-ramp, the Cadillac descends and Tony's boys 
               find themselves doing 70 knots side by side with Eddie in 
               the other lane.

               In the narrow concrete tunnel, the two cars battle each other 
               like bulls in a chute, each one trying to cut the other off, 
               bouncing from each other into the walls and back again.

               INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT

               The goon next to Luna is trying to get a shot off at Eddie.

                                     SCALESE
                         This sonovabitch is crazy!

               Tony sees his chance and he lunges for the gun. In the 
               struggle, the gun goes off and drills Rocco, the driver, 
               through the side of the head.

               EXT. LOWER WACKER - NIGHT

               The Cadillac ROARS out of control, its dead driver's foot 
               pressing the accelerator to the floor. Scalese, in the front 
               seat, tries to grab the wheel.

               Eddie is all over the road trying to avoid them. The river 
               and the curve are ahead.

               Scalese's car hits the median at high speed, rolls, and slides 
               SCREAMING into a concrete pillar and EXPLODES.

               Eddie stands on the brakes as his car slides alongside the 
               flaming wreckage.

               INT. EDDIE'S CAR - NIGHT

               Eddie's car is on fire now, and the doors have been rammed 
               shut. He kicks the window out on the passenger side.

               EXT. LOWER WACKER - NIGHT

               Eddie runs for his life. The explosion knocks him to his 
               knees.

               He gets up and moves away, looking back at Luna's and 
               Scalese's spectacular funeral pyre.

               EXT. LOWER WACKER - NIGHT

               The fire engines and police cars are arriving from every 
               direction.

               With the flames still lighting his face, Eddie is making a 
               call.

                                     EDDIE
                         You tell Luis I got Tony Luna for 
                         him. Get me a time and place.

               INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

               Diana is in bad shape. She is tied up. Numb with terror she 
               listens, not comprehending, as the Comachos discuss their 
               plans for her in Spanish.

               Luis comes over to her, and with his knife begins cutting 
               off part of her clothes.

                                     LUIS
                         Your cop friend is smart. Too smart 
                         and he dies. Then I take care of you 
                         personally.

               EXT. LOWER WACKER - NIGHT

               Eddie's car is totally ablaze. He walks past the streaming 
               hoses and slips into a parked blue and white, it's mars lights 
               still flashing. He roars off.

               INT. GYM - NIGHT

               The giant door opens, and a lone blue and white pulls in and 
               parks.

               The place is deserted except for the duty officer who sits 
               in his tiny office watching television with his half-naked 
               girlfriend.

               Eddie enters silently, glances into the duty office, and 
               heads to the other end of the large hall.

               In the background we see the practice apartment set, the 
               boxing ring, and several special task force undercover 
               vehicles seen before.

               INT. LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

               Eddie opens his locker and takes out his sawed-off automatic 
               shotgun. He checks the action. He loads it. He fills a duffle 
               bag with ammo and drops in another gun. He closes the locker 
               and heads out.

               INT. GYM - NIGHT

               The duty officer is still occupied. Eddie eases past him and 
               checks the key-board at the desk. He finds what he's looking 
               for. He lifts a set of keys from the hook.

               EXT. GYM - NIGHT

               From inside, we hear the SOUND of a TRUCK STARTING.

               EXT. EXPRESSWAY - DAY

               This city garbage van, an immense blue semi-trailer, is moving 
               south on the Dan Ryan at incredible speed, pushing traffic 
               out of the way like a battleship slicing through Sunday 
               boaters.

               Eddie is at the wheel.

               EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

               Among the dockside ruins of the old facility, Luis carefully 
               checks his snipers and lookouts. Shouting in Spanish, he 
               directs them into position.

               From the distance we see a signal from the Comacho stationed 
               at the top of a huge grain elevator overlooking the Calumet 
               Harbor.

               INT. GYM - DAY

               Kosalas enters. The place is in chaos. He joins the crowd 
               gathered in the center of the facility. Brennan and Cragie 
               are here. So is Music. Commander Kates has just arrived.

                                     KATES
                         What the hell is goin on?

                                     BRENNAN
                         Cusack made off with a truckload of 
                         armour.

                                     MUSIC
                              (shakes his head)
                         He's a fucking one man army now.

                                     CRAGIE
                         What'd I tell ya. The sonofabitch is 
                         crazy.

               Kosalas wanders through the wreckage. He is stunned. He is 
               starting to wake up.

                                     KATES
                         OK, everybody. No more games. Where's 
                         Cusack.

               The men all look at him silently.

               Kosalas turns on them.

                                     KOSALAS
                         I can't swallow this shit! Eddie 
                         Cusack's out there takin' on the 
                         world by himself. And you fuckin' 
                         heros are gonna sit on your goddamn 
                         asses!

               He is mad and loud.

                                     CRAGIE
                         Cool it kid.

                                     KOSALAS
                         Don't you fuckin' tell me to cool 
                         it. I won't cool it. I'm not going 
                         to fuckin' lie for you any more.
                              (to Kates)
                         I lied, Commander. He laid a gun on 
                         that kid. I saw the whole thing.

                                     CRAGIE
                         You little fuckin' bastard!

               Cragie jumps at Kosalas, but Kosalas is ready for him, and 
               braces Cragie against the wall.

               With one hand Kosalas slams Cragie again, and reaches down 
               with his free hand, lifting Cragie's pants leg and extracting 
               a drop-gun from it's concealed holster.

                                     KOSALAS
                         What's this for partner? Your next 
                         fuck up?

               Kates steps in and separates them.

                                     KATES
                              (to the others)
                         Get someone in the air. We're gonna 
                         find Cusack.

               INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

               Diana, now hanging from her wrists like a slab of beef, is 
               guarded by a couple of Luis' boys, eyeing her hungrily.

               Luis enters.

                                     LUIS
                              (subtitles)
                         Take off the gag. I want them to 
                         hear her.

               EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

               Luis scans the daybreak sky. He and Efren take up positions. 
               Above them and around them, every line of fire is covered.

               EXT. GRAIN ELEVATOR - DAY

               From the lookout's POV atop the towering grain elevator, WE 
               SEE several garbage trucks moving in and out of an adjacent 
               dump.

               One of them seems familiar to us.

               INT. TRUCK CAB - DAY

               Eddie's eyes search the harbour as he maneuvers slowly 
               alongside a rusting freighter. He stops and gets out.

               EXT. GRAIN ELEVATOR - DAY

               Eddie opens the rear of the truck and lowers a ramp.

                                     EDDIE
                         Here we go partner.

               He picks up his gun and a duffle bag from the cab and heads 
               out.

               INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

               The Comachos are ready and waiting. Luis walks through the 
               middle of the vast empty plant toward the front, checking on 
               his troops one last time.

               EXT. DOCK - DAY

               Against the grotesque shapes of the surrounding scrapyards, 
               Eddie moves quickly from one concealment to the next, crouched 
               low, advancing on the abandoned factory at the end of the 
               dock.

               He lays down his duffle and pulls out a Halliburton case. He 
               opens it.

               EXT. GRAIN ELEVATOR - DAY

               From inside the garbage truck WE HEAR an ENGINE STARTING. It 
               REVS a couple of times. And from within the container 
               compartment of the truck emerges the Prowler. It clatters 
               down the ramp.

               EXT. GRAIN ELEVATOR - DAY

               The lookout spots the Prowler moving down the dock. He can't 
               believe his eyes.

               He sights on the machine and FIRES.

               And in the distance, the Prowler senses the insult and 
               immediately turns its camera eye up to him.

               The lookout FIRES again. Immediately, the turret swivels and 
               the twin MACHINEGUNS ROAR.

               It's a long way down.

               INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

               The SOUND of MACHINEGUN FIRE from outside galvanizes the 
               Comachos. Luis runs through the long building toward the 
               front with half a dozen of his men, all SHOUTING.

               EXT. DOCK - DAY

               Eddies eyes watch the miniature monitor of the Prowler's 
               hand controller. On the monitor WE CAN SEE the Comachos 
               running out in the front of the factory from the camera on 
               top of the Prowler.

               Eddie gets up and moves toward the factory. He looks up at 
               several high broken windows.

               EXT. DOCK - DAY

               The Prowler is having a field day. It's electronic sensors 
               trace the source of every hostile shot and immediately return 
               a withering stream of hot lead that chews the surrounding 
               scenery -- and several Comachos -- to pieces.

               But Eddie has not figured out how to control the Prowler's 
               BULLHORN VOICE command system. It continues to BARK ORDERS 
               to the dead hoodlums in three languages.

               INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

               Luis runs through the empty plant toward the office screaming 
               to Diana's guards.

                                     LUIS
                              (subtitles)
                         Now! Do it now! Kill her!

               INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

               Diana, tied to the chair, is momentarily alone as the guards 
               rush out to the floor of the factory to see what's happening.

               The two guards, their guns flying from their hands, are 
               hammered back into the room by Eddie who blasts through the 
               door after them.

               Diana is petrified.

               INT. SQUAD CAR - DAY

               Kosalas and Kates are in the same car. Kosalas is driving.

                                     DISPATCHER (V.O.)
                              (from radio)
                         ...Harbor Patrol reports gunfire and 
                         explosions in the vicinity of Calumet 
                         Harbor...

                                     KATES
                         That's Cusack.

               Kosalas spins the wheel into a U-turn.

               INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

               The "Prowler" rolls around the corner, its brutal turret 
               bristling with firepower. It is driving Luis and the other 
               stupefied Comachos further back into the building.

               Eddie guides his deadly partner with the hand controller.

               The Comachos dive for cover and spray the miniature tank 
               with AUTOMATIC FIRE. But they are no match. Two continuous 
               streams of hot lead chew up the place, splintering the loading 
               dock and the catwalk hiding places and disintegrating the 
               structure, churning the Comachos to hamburger.

               COMACHO SHOT RINGS OUT

               Eddie goes down and the Prowler hand controller falls to the 
               ground, shattered.

               The Prowler goes berserk, SPRAYING DEATH in a 360 degree 
               circle until all the ammo is gone.

               Then SILENCE.

               Eddie touches the blood on the side of his leg. It's not 
               serious.

               It appears everyone is out of ammunition. But a few Comachos 
               are still hidden in the factory.

               Eddie is after them like a tiger. Victor, shoulder still 
               bandaged, never has a chance. He goes down, battered and 
               broken.

               But Luis has crept up behind Eddie. He jumps over a steel 
               plate. He's going for Diana, a long knife in his hand.

               Eddie reaches for a reload. Puts it in his magnum. Aims, and 
               blows Luis away just as he reaches for Diana.

               INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

               Across the littered battlefield, Eddie escorts Diana toward 
               the light streaming through the factory entrance. He takes 
               off his jacket and wraps it around Diana's shoulders.

               EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

               The pier is crawling with cops with more arriving every 
               second.

               A fire boat is extinguishing the blaze set by the Prowler's 
               incendiary ammunition.

               The bodies of the Comachos lying everywhere astound the 
               arriving "Home Team."

               Officer Kosalas screeches to a halt and jumps from his car. 
               Brennan and Music are running down the dock. Donato, a cast 
               on his leg, hobbles after them.

               EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

               Emergency vehicles are arriving, and more squad cars, paddy 
               wagons, and fire engines.

               Eddie walks by the cops toward an ambulance, now carrying 
               Diana. Kates calls out after him.

                                     KATES
                         Hey, Cusack!

               Eddie stops, slowly turns around.

               There is a long pause.

                                     KATES
                         I'm glad you don't follow orders.

               Eddie hands Diana over to the waiting medics, who put her in 
               the ambulance.

               We pull back further and further until we see the rest of 
               the Home Team. The ambulance, carrying Diana, pulls away 
               with it's lights flashing.

               Eddie walks down the pier alone.

                                         THE END

     NYFD Lt. GORDY PITT strains as he works the handle of an
     old-time, hand-cranked ice cream maker. It's a tough job
     requiring strength, patience and determination. In a
     nutshell, that's Gordy.

     Firefighter JUNIOR MONTINE, black Panamanian descent,
     watches Gordy crank away.

                               JUNIOR
                 Hear the big news, Lieutenant?
                 It's the twenty-first century.   We
                 got electricity now.

     Gordy keeps cranking.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                               2.

                 Got these supermarkets, too.   Big
                 places, freezers full o' ice
                 cream.

    Gordy stops.    Pops the lid.   Spoons out a dollop.

                               GORDY
                 Open up.

    He sticks the spoon in Junior's mouth.      Junior eats.
    Junior loves it. Gordy smiles.

                               GORDY
                 Screw the twenty-first century.

    The FIRE BELL SOUNDS.


3   INT. FIREHOUSE - VARIOUS SHOTS                                  3

    Everyone scrambles. The choreography's practiced,
    automatic. It's achieved without conversation.

    The channel surfer slides down the fire pole.     He's
    followed by the man who was upstairs snoring.

    Junior rips a sheet from the teleprinter. He hands the
    printout to the snorer, the company's "chauffeur."

    Feet jam into boots. Yellow trousers are hauled up and
    hitched with suspenders.

    Yellow jackets are whipped on.

    The chauffeur TURNS OVER the PUMPER'S huge MOTOR.

    Firefighters take their stations on the truck. Headsets
    go on. As the fire company's lieutenant, Gordy rides
    shotgun. The chauffeur hands him the printout. As the
    engine moves out under lights and SIREN, Gordy speaks to
    the men over the headsets --

                               GORDY
                 Second alarm. Multiple dwelling

4   EXT. SPANISH HARLEM - STREETS - NIGHT                           4

    The ENGINE SCREAMS and HONKS through the city.

5   EXT. SPANISH HARLEM - TENEMENT - NIGHT                          5

    FLAMES ROAR from the upper stories of this slumlord's
    shitbox. An engine and ladder company are on-scene
    attacking the fire with hoses. Neighbors gawk. Gordy's
    engine company arrives. Gordy hits the ground, moves to
    a battalion chief. The chief's terse orders are drowned
    out by the NOISE of the EQUIPMENT, fire and men. Gordy
    moves back to his company, who have already hooked the
    engine up to water.

                            GORDY
              Top story's fully involved. We're
              supporting inside. Two lines up
              the stairs.

    He points to Junior and then to the channel surfer, MIKE
    SHEA, a veteran firefighter of Irish descent.

                            GORDY
              Junior and Mike --

    He points to the chess player, SAL DIBIASE, another FD
    veteran, Mediterranean descent, and then to the rookie,
    RONNIE BOOK, a New York melting pot mutt.

                            GORDY
              -- Sal and Ronnie.

    The chauffeur, ART WESTPHAL, German-Irish, stays with the
    engine as Gordy grabs a fire axe and leads his two two-
    man hose teams into...


6   INT. TENEMENT                                                   6

    Gordy and his men charge the stairs dragging the heavy
    hoses. Rats head past in the opposite direction,
    deserting the burning building.


7   THIRD FLOOR                                                     7

    They meet fire on the third floor. On goes the water.
    Gordy quickly checks rooms on the floor for occupants,
    using the axe to open locked doors, then taps Junior and
    Mike, indicates "up." Begins leading the hose team up
    the stairwell. Sees something and yells a warning --

                            GORDY
              Stairs're screwed. Hug the wall.


8   FOURTH FLOOR                                                    8

    They reach the fourth floor.    There's fire everywhere.
    And then...
                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                             4.

8    CONTINUED:                                                    8

     They see a FIREFIGHTER from the other company. He has
     fallen through a gaping hole in the floor of the hallway
     above. He's pinned under a large section of heavy
     debris, coughing and screaming for help as fire rages
     around him. To Junior and Mike --

                                   GORDY
                  Knock it back!

     They turn the hose on the flames as Gordy moves to the
     trapped firefighter. Gordy tries lifting the debris,
     can't budge it. He starts chopping at it with the axe.

     Chunks of plaster fly as the axe bites again and again.

     Gordy hacks off a large piece of debris. He levers his
     axe under the portion still trapping the firefighter.
     Mike moves to help. Gordy heaves up on the axe. The
     debris lifts. He heaves harder. It lifts more,
     until...

     Mike slides the firefighter out. Gordy yanks his axe
     free. The debris collapses. Gordy moves to the
     firefighter.

                                FIREFIGHTER #1
                  Two floors up. I heard
                  screaming... Couldn't get there.

                                   GORDY
                  Where?

                                FIREFIGHTER #1
                  End of the hall.


9    GORDY                                                         9

     takes off. Charges the next flight of stairs. Reaches
     the fifth floor. Tries to reach six, but there's too
     much fire. He's beaten back... but not before he hears
     the FAINT sound of SCREAMING.


10   NEW ANGLE                                                     10

     Gordy looks down the fifth floor hallway to an apartment
     door at the end. Between him and the door is the gaping
     hole in the floor. It's too big to jump. He starts
     running. He's gonna jump it.

     Gordy reaches the edge of the hole. Leaps with all he's
     got. At the same time, he swings the axe, point-first.
     Slams it into a spot high on the wall, and...

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                               5.

10   CONTINUED:                                                     10

     Gordy swings over the hole on the axe handle.

     He hits the other side running. Drives a shoulder into
     the door at the end of the hall.


11   INT. TENEMENT APARTMENT                                        11

     Gordy bursts in. It's an inferno. He looks up. Knocks
     his axe on the ceiling. Hears desperate POUNDING back.

     Gordy climbs a table. Starts whacking upward with the
     axe, attacking the peeling, crumbled plaster overhead.

     Gordy is trying to hack a hole into the room above, but
     he's not doing it fast enough. He won't beat the fire.


12   INT. TENEMENT - HALLWAY                                        12

     Gordy calls down to his men.

                                GORDY
                  Give me the hose!

                                MIKE
                  This place is gone! It could
                  flashover any second!

                                GORDY
                  Give me the goddamn hose!

     Beat.   Mike and Junior pass the hose up.


13   INT. TENEMENT APARTMENT                                        13

     Gordy aims the nozzle at the hole he started in the
     ceiling. Turns it on full jet.

     Gordy's barely able to hold the hose as the high-pressure
     stream bites into old, decayed plaster.

     Bit by bit the ceiling falls away.       Gordy's almost
     through to the room above, when...

     Falling debris severs the hose. Gordy's lost pressure.
     He hasn't broken through. The building's coming down.
     He's gotta get outta there.

     Gordy's not going anywhere. Picks up the axe.       Attacks
     the hole again furiously, until finally...

                                                             6.

14   GORDY                                                         14

     breaks through! A small hole, which he quickly widens,
     to reveal... a terrified Latino family gaping down at
     him, their room ablaze around them. Gordy reaches up.
     Speaks to them in Spanglish --

                             GORDY
               It's okay... Esta bien, esta
               bien... Come with me... Con mio...


15   INT. TENEMENT HALLWAY                                         15

     Gordy lowers the family through the floor hole.


16   EXT. TENEMENT                                                 16

     Gordy carries the family's small child outside. He
     passes the child to its grateful parents, while...

     The rescued Firefighter sits on a curb looking at a hero
     and shaking his head in disbelief and admiration.


17   INT. UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT - BEDROOM - MORNING            17

     ANNE PITT, thirties, reaches out and KILLS the ALARM.
     She rolls over. The other half of the bed's empty. We
     hear a CHILD'S VOICE from another room.


18   INT. MATT'S BEDROOM                                           18

     Anne opens the door to find an exhausted Gordy sitting on
     the floor with their four-year-old son, MATT. They're
     building a K'nex spaceship.

                             MATT
               Look what we made!

                             ANNE
               Nice rocket... That took a while.

                             GORDY
               He was awake when I got home.   His
               throat still hurts.

                               ANNE
               Shit.

                             MATT
               That's a bad word.

                               GORDY
               You're right.
                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                                  7.

18   CONTINUED:                                                        18

                                ANNE
                  Sorry.

     She feels Matt's forehead.    Gordy's done it already.

                                GORDY
                  No fever.

                                ANNE
                         (to Matt)
                  You better see Dr. Bob.
                         (to Gordy)
                  And this time, no opening fire
                  hydrants to play in till he's
                  completely well.

                                GORDY
                  Yes, ma'am.

     She leans down and kisses him.      There's passion in it.

                                ANNE
                  How was your shift?

                                GORDY
                         (shrugs)
                  The usual.

     She yawns.    Starts heading out.

                                ANNE
                  Dreamed I did a triple axel in an
                  ice skating championship.

                                GORDY
                         (beat; calls after
                          her)
                  Come back and let me see those
                  legs again.


19   INT. BATHROOM - DAY                                               19

     Gordy holds Matt in his arms as water pours over them.
     It's the second child he's held in the last few hours.
     This one is his, this one is safe at home and unafraid:
     what a father wants for his child. We see the deep
     affection Gordy has for his son. He holds Matt tightly,
     skin to skin, and kisses the boy's wet head...

     Anne opens the shower door.       She's on the phone.

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                               8.

19   CONTINUED:                                                      19

                                ANNE
                  Dr. Bob can squeeze him in at
                  twelve. I have a patient
                  relations meeting at twelve-
                  fifteen. Can you take him?

                                GORDY
                  I have a game. But yeah, if we do
                  the handoff at the doctor's.

                                 ANNE
                         (into phone)
                  Yes, he'll be there... Thanks.
                         (hangs up; to Gordy)
                  Five-of in front of Dr. Bob's.
                  Don't be late.
                         (to Matt)
                  Let's get you out, sweetie. Your
                  father just can't keep you dry.

     She leads Matt out. Closes the shower door. Gordy
     sticks his face into the water. Looks back, finds...

     Two bare butts, Anne's and Matt's, are pressed against
     the shower door's foggy glass. OFF Gordy, laughing --


20   EXT. SPANISH HARLEM - BASKETBALL COURT - DAY                    20

     It appears the entire neighborhood's crammed against the
     chain-link fence around the court, yelling and cheering
     as a team of local kids from the NYFD Athletic League
     plays a team of local kids from the NYPD Athletic League.

     Gordy's an NYFD coach, exhorts his team at the top of his
     lungs.

     The rivalry's intense. The game close.       The noise
     deafening. Bets are going down.

     NYFD goes up by one in the final minute.

     Gordy disses a cop coaching the opposing team.

     LUIS is one of Gordy's kids. A small but talented
     fifteen-year-old. Luis steals the ball. Drives for an
     unguarded lay-up to put the team up by three... And
     misses. An opponent recovers the ball. The flow shifts
     toward the other end, but Luis is slow adjusting,
     devastated at missing the easy "two." Gordy yells at him
     to defend.

                                GORDY
                  Luis, get back! Pick up your man!

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                           9.

20   CONTINUED:                                                  20

     Luis shakes it off. Hustles back on "D" as his man gets
     the ball. The opponent's a step ahead. Goes up... And
     Luis gets there to reject him. The crowd loves it. The
     BUZZER SOUNDS. NYFD wins.


21   SAME SCENE - GORDY AND LUIS - MOMENTS LATER                 21

     In the game's immediate aftermath. NYFD celebrating
     around them. Gordy's proud of Luis.

                                GORDY
                  We lose, win, whatever. But one
                  thing we never do. We never, ever
                  give up. Right?

     OFF Gordy, smiling at Luis...


22   SAME SCENE - LATER                                          22

     The crowds are gone. Gordy checks his watch and starts
     off, when a SOUND draws his attention.


23   GORDY'S POV                                                 23

     Luis walks along the inside of the chain-link fence
     around the court. A neighborhood gangbanger and his crew
     match Luis step for step outside the fence, rattling the
     fence, clearly trying to intimidate him.


24   BACK TO SCENE                                               24

     Gordy stalks walking toward them.    Calls --

                                GORDY
                  Luis...

     Seeing Gordy approach, the gangbanger and crew drift off.
     Reaching Luis --

                                GORDY
                  What was that about?

                                LUIS
                  Told 'em I wouldn't play with 'em
                  anymore.

     But Gordy sees Luis is scared. And he sees the
     gangbanger and crew hovering nearby waiting for Gordy to
     go.

                                                                 10.

25   EXT. SPANISH HARLEM - BODEGA - DAY                                25

     THROUGH the window, we see Gordy delivering Luis to a
     Latin man, clearly Luis's father and the bodega's owner.
     We don't hear the words, but we can tell Gordy's
     complimenting the boy to his dad.

     Gordy emerges.    Checks his watch.   Whistles up a taxi.


26   INT. TAXI - DAY                                                   26

     Traffic jam on Park Avenue South. Gordy's anxious.
     Checks his watch. He's late. To the cabbie --

                               GORDY
               Try Fifth.


27   EXT. 68TH AND MADISON - DAY                                       27

     Anne waits on the corner with Matt, playing with his
     spaceship. She checks her watch. It's five of twelve.


28   INT. TAXI - DAY                                                   28

     Fifth Avenue's also a parking lot.

                               GORDY
               Shit.

     He jams money in the pay dish.

                             GORDY
               I'm getting outta here.


29   EXT. FIFTH AVENUE                                                 29

     Gordy exits the cab and takes off running.


30   ANNE                                                              30

     checks her watch again.   She's pissed now.

     In b.g., a cop leaves his police cart to write a ticket.

     A caravan of Lincoln Navigators passes Anne and turns
     east on 68th.


31   GORDY                                                             31

     turns onto 68th. As he runs, he jumps, trying to see
     Anne and Matt over other pedestrians.

                                                              11.

32   ANNE                                                           32

     In b.g., the Navigators pull up at a building flying the
     Colombian flag. Latin and American men in suits get out
     of the Navigators.


33   EXT. 68TH - BETWEEN FIFTH AND MADISON                          33

     Gordy dodges pedestrians.     Still trying to get a glimpse
     of Anne and Matt.

     The cop we saw writing tickets earlier is walking the
     other way. Gordy nearly collides with him. At the last
     moment, the traffic cop shuffles Gordy aside.

                                 GORDY
                  Sorry.

     Gordy reaches the corner. Sees Anne and Matt. Whistles.
     In b.g., behind Gordy, we see the cop get into a brown
     Ford.


34   ANNE AND MATT                                                  34

     hear the WHISTLE.     Matt sees Gordy.

                                 MATT
                  There he is.

     Matt waves.


35   GORDY                                                          35

     waves back, shrugs an apology to Anne as he starts across
     the street, when...


36   INTENSE FLASH                                                  36

     suddenly lights up the intersection.

     In SLOW MOTION:


37   SHOCK WAVE                                                     37

     wave rolls up 68th past Madison...


38   HUGE BALL OF FLAME                                             38

     erupts behind Anne and Matt...

     We hear the ENORMOUS BANG of the explosion...

                                                             12.

39   WINDOWS                                                       39

     are sucked into millions of fragments, a hailstorm of
     glass...


40   GREAT CHUNK OF METAL                                          40

     -- an engine block -- flies from the ball of flame...


41   ANNE                                                          41

     instinctively pulls her child to her...


42   GORDY                                                         42

     sees the engine block tumbling through the air toward his
     wife and son.

     His scream is lost in the thunderous ROAR all around.


43   GORDY'S POV - IN SLOW MOTION                                  43

     The engine block is about to hit Anne and Matt, when...

     A FedEx TRUCK, WINDOWS SHATTERED, SKIDS past, wiping out
     Gordy's line of sight. When the truck clears...

     Anne and Matt are gone. The corner's empty.   Just Matt's
     spaceship, slowly falling to the ground...


44   BACK TO SCENE                                                 44

     There's a horrible SCREECH. A TAXI SKIDS sideways to
     avoid the FedEx truck and hits Gordy. He's in the air,
     tumbling, then smacks to the ground.

     Gordy looks up, through the smoke and falling debris.
     Then struggles to his hands and knees.

                             GORDY
               Anne!

     He tries to stand, then falls down, screaming in pain, a
     large shard of glass embedded in his leg.

     People come to help him, but Gordy only cares about
     finding Anne and Matt. He looks around desperately but
     can't see them, when...

     His eyes go to the spaceship, in pieces on the pavement.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

44   CONTINUED:                                                     44

     Gordy screams out his agony --

                                GORDY
                  Noooooo!!!


45   EXT. COLOMBIAN CONSULATE                                       45

     The blast detonated here. Some men from the Navigators
     are dead. MIKE BRANDT is not. Rises from the
     devastation, gun in hand, as SIRENS wail in the distance.


46   EXT. 68TH AND MADISON - LATER                                  46

     Emergency personnel - EMS, NYPD, NYFD -- swarm the area.

     Two white plastic sheets cover two bodies.

     Across the street, PARAMEDICS work on Gordy's leg.

                                PARAMEDIC #1
                  We're gonna give you a shot.

     Gordy's oblivious to the pain.     Shoves him away.

                                GORDY
                  I need to see them!

                                PARAMEDIC #1
                  We gotta help you right now.

                                PARAMEDIC #2
                  We've done all we can for 'em,
                  Gordy.


47   ANOTHER ANGLE                                                  47

     FBI agent JOE PHIPPS ducks under the police tape.     REGGIE
     DRAY, a young agent, meets him. As they walk --

                                DRAY
                  Device functioned in front of the
                  Colombian Consulate just as a
                  motorcade full of brass arrived.

                                PHIPPS
                  Who were the brass, and why were
                  they here?

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                DRAY
                  No one's talking yet, but it
                  smells high-level. There were
                  Colombians and Americans in the
                  cars. Three of 'em ate it. Guy
                  on the phone --

     He indicates Brandt, talking on a cell phone.

                                DRAY
                  -- is one of the survivors.
                  Name's Brandt. C.I.A.

     That gets Phipps' interest momentarily. Then, as they
     continue toward the consulate, he notices security
     cameras on the building.

                                PHIPPS
                  Check the surveillance cameras?

                                DRAY
                  We're pulling up the video now.

                                PHIPPS
                         (stops; looks around)
                  Where's N.Y.P.D. on this?

                                DRAY
                  They know it's ours. They're
                  helping with shoe-leather.

     Phipps' eyes go to the white sheets up the street.

                                DRAY
                  We got two dead bystanders, a
                  mother and four-year-old son. The
                  father's over there with a leg
                  wound.
                         (indicates Gordy)
                  Guy's a lieutenant with the New
                  York F.D.

                                PHIPPS
                  Anybody talk to him yet?

                                DRAY
                  We've been giving him room.


48   BACK TO GORDY                                                  48

     In b.g., Mike, the veteran firefighter in Gordy's engine
     company, looks under the sheets with a cop.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

     Junior puts a gentle hand on Gordy's shoulder.

                                JUNIOR
                  Gordy.

     Gordy looks up him, meets his eyes.

                                JUNIOR
                  Me and Mike are here.

                                GORDY
                  ... I was late... They shouldn't
                  have been there...

                                JUNIOR
                  It's not your fault.

                                GORDY
                  I need to see them.

     Mike has walked up, lays a comforting hand on Gordy.

                                MIKE
                  No. You don't need to see 'em
                  that way, Gordo.

     Junior spots a news camera crew focusing on Gordy's
     grief, calls at a cop.

                                JUNIOR
                  Get those goddamn people outta
                  here!

     Phipps, approaching with Dray, addresses the same cop.

                                PHIPPS
                  Put that tape out fifty more
                  feet.

     The cop begins moving the camera crew back.     Phipps
     continues to Gordy.

     A Paramedic looks up at Mike.

                                PARAMEDIC #1
                  He needs to go to the hospital.
                  We can't take that glass out.

                                MIKE
                  If he's not bleeding to death,
                  leave him. He's not moving till
                  they do.

     Phipps has heard and understands.      To Dray, re:
     bodies --

                                PHIPPS
                  Chalk 'em and move 'em.

     Dray goes. Phipps turns to Gordy and the two
     firefighters standing with him. Addresses Mike --

                                PHIPPS
                  We gotta get on this quick.   I
                  need to talk to him.

     Beat.   Mike nods.   To Gordy --

                                PHIPPS
                  Mr. Pitt, if you can you tell
                  me... What'd you see?

                                GORDY
                         (looks up; beat)
                  What'd I see? I saw my family
                  die.

     Mike puts a restraining hand on Gordy.

                                MIKE
                  This guy didn't do the bombing,
                  Gordo. He's just trying to get
                  the people who did.

     Beat.   Gordy eases up.   Then, after a moment, defeated --

                                GORDY
                  I didn't see anything except the
                  explosion.

     Beat.   Phipps sees that's all he's gonna get.

                                PHIPPS
                  I know this is hard. I'm sorry I
                  had to bother you.

     Phipps goes. Gordy looks over as the bodies of Anne and
     Matt are placed on gurneys and rolled away. Chalk
     outlines are all that remain of his family. Beat.

                                MIKE
                  We're gonna roll you to the
                  hospital now and get that glass
                  out.

                                                               17.

               Whatever it takes. But I got a
               bomber in the wind. I need

               need it now.


50   INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT                            50

     Gordy's on a gurney on an I.V., his thigh heavily
     bandaged. Junior and the rookie, Ronnie, are with him,
     but there's no chatter -- Gordy's shut down, oblivious to
     everyone around him.

                  wouldn't have to go home right
                  away, but they're cutting him

                  Want me to stay at home with him?

                                MIKE
                  Rookie's taking the first shift.
                  I'm just getting the schedule at
                  the firehouse rearranged now.

     Mike goes back to the phone, and Sal crosses to Gordy.
     He puts a hand on Gordy's shoulder, grips it firmly.

                                 SAL
                  Hey.   Got here as fast as I could.

     Gordy sees him, but says nothing.

                                SAL
                  I know it sucks... It really
                  sucks...

     Gordy can't go there.     Beat.     Sal releases his grip.

                                   SAL
                  How's the leg?

                                RONNIE
                  Cut's deep, but no major vessels
                  were severed. He's got a load 'o
                  silk holding it all together.

     Junior, who stepped off to talk to a cop, now comes back.

                                JUNIOR
                  Just came over the police radio...
                  Consulate surveillance cameras
                  caught the bomber in the act. He
                  was disguised as a cop.

     Gordy looks over.     What Junior just said has triggered
     something.

                                GORDY
                  ... I saw him... I saw a cop.

     Gordy yanks out his I.V., and starts to get up.

                                                         (CONTINUED)

     But Gordy's already on his feet, already moving.

                                GORDY
                  I gotta help 'em get the bastard.


51   INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE - FBI INCIDENT CENTER - NIGHT           51

     A well-lit, sectioned-off area of the garage secured by a
     chain-link fence.

     Phipps enters.      As he passes Dray, already there --

                                PHIPPS
                  How long before we have a secure
                  computer network?

                                 DRAY
                  An hour.   They're building it now.

     Phipps moves to a FORENSIC EXPERT hovering over a table
     of small fragments.

                                PHIPPS
                  What do you got?

                                FORENSIC EXPERT #1
                  Pieces of a pager oxidized with
                  trace elements of Semtex.
                  Probably the triggering device.
                  They dial it up, probably from a
                  cell phone, and boom...

     He picks up a microchip.

                                FORENSIC EXPERT #1
                  ... This is the memory chip. I
                  can build it into a working pager
                  and maybe get a number readout.

                                  PHIPPS
                  Do it.

     Phipps moves to the next work area, where another
     FORENSIC EXPERT studies video from a consulate
     surveillance camera.

                                                             20.

52   ON SCREEN                                                     52

     in super slow-mo, we see a cop -- the one who later
     bumped into Gordy -- in front of the consulate. His hat
     is pulled down over his eyes, almost concealing his
     tinted glasses. As the cop faces more toward the camera,
     the expert freeze-frames. To Phipps --


53   FORENSIC EXPERT #2                                            53

                               FORENSIC EXPERT #2
                 That's as much face as we get. He
                 was careful to duck the camera.

                               PHIPPS
                 Run a total analysis. I want to
                 know if this asshole's right or
                 left-handed. I want everything
                 you can get outta this film.

     Phipps keeps moving, enters an eerie recreation of the
     blast site. Streets, buildings, etc. are marked out on
     the garage floor. Pieces of the Navigators rest in front
     of the area marked "consulate;" parts of an NYPD traffic
     scooter rest in front of the Navigators; "X's" mark where
     Anne and Matt were standing.

     Phipps crosses to another AGENT.

                               PHIPPS
                 Any helpful information coming
                 outta Colombia?

                               AGENT
                 Not yet. Sat-Intel hasn't picked
                 up any related data-traffic,
                 either.

     Dray walks up.

                               DRAY
                 Gordon Pitt's here. He says he
                 saw a cop at the scene.


54   SAME SCENE - LATER                                            54

     Gordy, accompanied by Mike and Ronnie, sits in front of a
     video monitor. Phipps and Dray look on.


55   ON SCREEN                                                     55

     a police cart pulls up outside the consulate.

                                PHIPPS
                  The cart was stolen from the
                  Central Park Precinct yesterday.

     The cop gets out of the scooter.

                                GORDY
                  That's him. That's the son of a
                  bitch I bumped into.

     The cop tickets a vehicle, then walks west out of frame.

                                PHIPPS
                  The bomb's in the cart.

     reverses the video, freeze-frames on the cop.

                                PHIPPS
                  We think the bomb was triggered by
                  a cell phone. The guy doesn't
                  have one in his hands here. Did
                  you see a cell phone when you ran
                  into him?

                                GORDY
                  ... No.

                                PHIPPS
                  How much time passed between then
                  and the explosion?

                                GORDY
                  ... Seconds... Five, ten...

                                PHIPPS
                  We think maybe he got into the
                  brown Ford. You see him then?

                                GORDY
                  All I cared about was getting to
                  my wife and boy.

                         (to Phipps)
                  Guy still had enough time to get
                  out a phone and dial it in.

                  We might need to call you in again
                  to look at some photos.

     Beat.   Gordy looks back at the grainy image of the cop.

     A bagpiper plays "Amazing Grace."

     REVEAL Gordy holding Matt's small coffin as Anne's is
     lowered into the ground. Gordy's men are around him,
     along with many other NYFD personnel, family and friends.

     A second bagpiper farther away in the cemetery, picks up
     the song, begins playing it in a round with the first.

     Matt's coffin is taken from Gordy.    As it is lowered...

     A third bagpiper, farther away still, begins playing the
     song with the other two. One by one the first and second
     bagpipers finish their rounds, until there is just the
     third -- a haunting, mournful wail off into the distance.
     And then...

     There's only silence.

               I cannot speak for The Wolf or his
               actions. I would only repeat that
               the leftist guerrillas in Colombia
               are not terrorists but freedom
               fighters in a war being waged

     with a sign reading "IPC" (Indigenous People's Committee).

     The FBI agents listen to live audio from the IPC office.

     DOMINGUEZ and ROSETTA cower as Gordy vents his pent-up,
     end-of-the-world rage using the bat the way we saw him
     use a fire axe.

     Gordy approaches Ortiz-Dominguez with the bat.      Backs him
     up against a desk.

                This isn't the way to do things.

     Gordy still doesn't move.

                              FBI SURVEILLANCE AGENT
                These guys're only mouthpieces.

     Beat.   Then Gordy swings the bat.   Hard.   And...

     Destroys the computer monitor next to Ortiz-Dominguez.

     Gordy tosses the bat aside.    To the shaking Latin --

                              GORDY
                How's that for collateral damage?


68   INT. FBI (NEW YORK) - PHIPPS' OFFICE - NIGHT                    68

     Gordy sits across from Phipps.    Dray is present.

                              PHIPPS
                Mr. Ortiz-Dominguez has agreed not
                to press charges if you make full
                restitution.

                              GORDY
                I've already paid. With my
                family.

     Beat.   Phipps sees it's pointless to insist.   To Dray --

                              PHIPPS
                Take care of it.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

68   CONTINUED:                                                    68

     Dray heads out, passing Mike Brandt, who enters.

                                PHIPPS
                  Gordy, this is Mike Brandt.

                                BRANDT
                  Mr. Pitt.

     Gordy just looks at him.

                                BRANDT
                  I'm very sorry for your loss... I
                  lost people, too.

                                PHIPPS
                  ... Mike was in the motorcade that
                  day... He's the chief U.S.
                  intelligence officer overseeing
                  Colombia.

                                BRANDT
                  Don't worry, Mr. Pitt, we're gonna
                  get the son-of-a-bitch.

                                GORDY
                  You know where he is?

                                BRANDT
                  We believe The Wolf's in hiding
                  in an area of Colombia controlled
                  by the E.L.C., extreme Marxist
                  guerrillas... He thinks he's in
                  a safe haven.

     Brandt lets "thinks" sink in.

                                PHIPPS
                  I know it's hard for you right
                  now, Mr. Pitt. We're all sorry.
                  But why don't you go home.
                  We're taking care of things.

     Beat.   Brandt proffers a business card.

                                BRANDT
                  Here's my card. Call me any time.

     Gordy takes it.    Just sits there a long moment, then --

                                GORDY
                  What kind of twisted people do
                  things like this?

     Beat.   Brandt and Phipps don't have an answer.

                                                          27.

69   INT. NEW YORK TIMES - BULLPEN - DAY                        69

     Gordy talks to a Latin reporter, ERNIE OROSCO.

                             OROSCO
               You interested in the big picture
               or all the unpleasant details?

                             GORDY
               My family died because of what's
               going on down there. I want to
               know all I can.

     Orosco searches for a starting point.   Then --

                             OROSCO
               Well, basically, the situation in
               Colombia sucks...

     As Orosco continues...


70   MONTAGE - DAY/NIGHT                                        70

     Over the course of a week:

     1. Gordy takes pictures, etc., off a wall in his home.
     He pins up photos of Anne and Matt at the top of the
     wall. Beneath them he pins up a large map of Colombia.

                             OROSCO (V.O.)
               ... The government's been fighting
               different Marxists factions for
               over thirty-five years. For most
               of that time, it was winning...


71   NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY                                    71

     2. At the New York Public Library, Gordy uses microfilm
     files and computer access to the web to search out
     information on Colombia and The Wolf.

                             OROSCO (V.O.)
               ... Suddenly the guerrillas began
               chopping 'em up. High-tech
               weapons and equipment, well-
               trained troops, aggressive hit-
               and-run tactics, all financed by
               extortion, kidnapping and
               collecting taxes from dope
               growers. It's big money, and they
               put it to use...

                                                              28.

72   GORDY                                                          72

     3. Gordy pins up various Colombia-related articles and
     pictures on the wall, including the surveillance camera still of
     The Wolf from the front page of The New York Post.

                              OROSCO (V.O.)
                ... The government got scared. In
                1998, to jump start peace talks,
                it gave a coalition of guerrilla
                groups temporary control over much
                of southern Colombia... The first
                communist stronghold on an
                American continent...


73   GORDY                                                          73

     4.   Gordy draws a line around the guerrilla zone.

                              OROSCO (V.O.)
                ... But there've been few talks
                and no peace. And the Colombian
                military can't get near the
                guerrilla zone, especially around
                the town of Caguan, where the
                E.L.C. kicks ass and takes no
                prisoners...


74   GORDY                                                          74

     5.   Gordy circles and labels the ELC-controlled area.

                              OROSCO (V.O.)
                ... And that's where we come in.
                Supposedly, to help eliminate
                narcos operating in the guerrilla
                zone. But some well-informed
                people think that's just an excuse
                to hit the guerrillas themselves,
                since they're wrapped around the
                drug trade... We're there, we're
                involved... If we stay, the only
                real question is which Vietnam War
                we're gonna have. The one some
                feel we could've won or the one we
                lost...


75   GORDY                                                          75

     6. Gordy watches a documentary about Colombia which
     shows rebels, army troops, death squads, firefights, and with
     atrocities and bodies on both sides.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                                  29.

75   CONTINUED:                                                         75

                                OROSCO (V.O.)
                  ... Bottom line? The place is as
                  dangerous as a snakepit. You've
                  got the different guerrilla groups,
                  C.I.A., F.B.I., D.E.A., Colombian
                  military, U.S. military, right-
                  wing death squads -- and the only
                  thing they've all managed to do is
                  destroy a beautiful country and
                  inflict suffering on the real
                  people... Hey, I'm Colombian, and
                  I'll never go back...

     OFF Gordy's packed wall...


76   SAME SCENE - ANOTHER DAY                                           76

     As Gordy closes the front door, REVEAL Mike, the
     firefighter, who's just come in and now stands staring at
     the wall, clearly whelmed by the level of compulsion this
     must have required.

                                MIKE
                  Haven't heard from you in a couple
                  days.

                                 GORDY
                  Been busy.

                                 MIKE
                  Yeah.   I can see that.

     Gordy's obsessed, totally consumed by his project.      He
     points at a picture of heavily-armed guerrillas.

                                GORDY
                  E.L.C. attack platoon... These
                  assholes kill innocent people all
                  the time in Colombia.

     Gordy indicates a newspaper article.

                                 GORDY
                  Thirteen dead in a bus.
                          (indicates another)
                  A market. Twenty-seven dead.
                          (another)
                  A whole family... Anne and Matt
                  didn't mean shit to them.
                          (indicates The Wolf)
                  Or him.

     Mike interrupts, trying to divert him to something else.

                                MIKE
                  Hey, we never turned down free
                  beer, and rookie's buying, you
                  believe that? He certified today,
                  he's off probation.

                                GORDY
                         (still looking at
                          wall)
                  Ronnie couldn't find a fire with
                  both hands.

                                 MIKE
                          (smiles)
                  Yeah.   Let's go tell him that.

     Gordy doesn't react.     Beat.      More serious now --

                                  MIKE
                  C'mon, Gordo.

     Gordy hears the tone. Looks over and meets Mike's eyes,
     seeing the genuine concern there.

                                MIKE
                  We aren't gonna let 'em drink all
                  the beer, are we?

     OFF Gordy...

     They've emptied a few pitchers.

                  Yeah.   I'll get more.

     we see the President's National Security Advisor step up
     to a podium to give a statement.

                                NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR (V.O.)
                  Today, at 0700 hours Eastern
                  Daylight Time, a joint United
                  States/Colombian strike force
                  launched a full-scale assault at a
                  base camp of the Army of Colombian
                  Liberation, or E.L.C., in Southern
                  Colombia. The purpose of the
                  mission was to punish the people
                  behind the brutal bombing in New
                  York City ten days ago... We are
                  presently evaluating after-action
                  reports from Special Operations
                  Group, but feel confident that we
                  have accomplished our mission...

     Cheers throughout the bar.         Mike quiets them.

                  the New York bombing, the
                  terrorist known as The Wolf, is
                  among the enemy dead.


79   NEW ANGLE                                                      79

     Big cheers now. Toasts all around. Everyone in the
     place is happy for Gordy, who sits there a moment trying
     to absorb the news, then buries his face in his hands.

     Ronnie polishes chrome on the truck.

     Gordy holds up the broken remains of his ice cream maker
     as Junior looks on.

                  I'm gone three weeks and this
                  place falls apart.

                  Who backed over that?... My tools
                  still here?

81   INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS - NIGHT                                81

     Art's sleeping. Gordy opens his locker. There are old
     pictures of Anne and Matt still taped inside. He glances
     at them quickly, then pulls out his tools.


82   INT. LIVING AREA - NIGHT                                      82

     Mike's channel-surfing again. Gordy goes by the door,
     carrying his tools and looks in.

                               GORDY
                 You ever stay on one channel long
                 enough to hear what they're
                 saying?

     Whereupon Mike lands on CNN.

                               CNN ANCHOR (V.O.)
                 -- a surprise today --

     And then we're on another channel.

                                GORDY
                 Go back!   Go back!

                                MIKE
                 What?

     But Gordy has charged in and grabs the remote from Mike,
     switches channels back to CNN.

     we see a CNN anchor with an over-the-shoulder graphic
     showing the still of the cop from the consulate
     surveillance camera with "The Wolf" superimposed.

     On screen, we now see a homemade video of a masked figure
     wearing a camo floppy hat and a hunter's mesh face mask
     with a strange-smiling face painted on it in camo earth
     tones. The Wolf's body is hidden shadow, the voice
     digitally altered to a deep bass growl.

                               THE WOLF (V.O.)
                 You thought you killed me. You
                 didn't. I'm still here...

     We see Gordy's demeanor shift, retreating to the
     obsessive, seething hatred he showed before.

      The Wolf slaps his palm for emphasis.

                   ... Venceremos.

      The tape ends.    Mike shakes his head.

      OFF Gordy, his spark of life suddenly extinguished...


83A   EXT. ROW OF TOWNHOUSES (WASHINGTON, D.C.) - DAY                 83A

      Brandt's on the phone.    He's pissed.

                   ... Senator, the failure of one

                   there...

      DONALD UPDEGRAF, Brandt's number two, enters.

                   Mr. Pitt, Mr. Brandt'll have to

84    INT. GORDY'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY                         84

      Gordy's mood is dark. It's not improved by hearing the
      bullshit in Updegraf's reply.

                                 GORDY
                   Tell him not to bother.

      He slams down the phone. Rips up Brandt's business card.
      He's alone with his frustration, with his rekindled
      hatred and rage. OFF Gordy, glaring at the photo of The
      Wolf on his wall...

      Armed police lead Rottweilers through the newly-arrived
      passengers. FIND Gordy in line. He wears jeans, polo
      shirt, Timberlands, carries a backpack.

      Gordy advances to an IMMIGRATION OFFICER, hands over his
      documents. The agent studies Gordy's passport.

                                 IMMIGRATION OFFICER
                   Business or pleasure, senor?

                   ... Pleasure.

      The agent looks up at Gordy.         Looks back at the passport.
      Beat.

                  One moment, senor.

     The agent gets the attention of an IMMIGRATION SUPERIOR,
     and the two of them confer out of earshot a moment. The
     Superior looks over at Gordy. Then approaches.

                                IMMIGRATION SUPERIOR
                  If you would come with me,

                                GORDY
                  Is there a problem?

     The customs Superior closes the door.      Beat.

                                IMMIGRATION SUPERIOR
                  We know who you are, Mr. Pitt.

                                GORDY
                  Says so right there in my
                  passport.

                                IMMIGRATION SUPERIOR
                  We're aware your wife and child
                  were killed in the bombing in New
                  York.
                         (off Gordy's look)
                  We have C.N.N. here, too.
                         (then)
                  It's better for you to visit
                  another country. For your own
                  sake.

                                GORDY
                  ... You giving me a choice?

                               IMMIGRATION SUPERIOR
                  Yes. But not about staying in
                  Colombia.

     He opens the door, addresses two armed policemen in
     Spanish. Turning back to Gordy --

                                IMMIGRATION SUPERIOR
                  These men will escort you onto
                  whatever flight you wish.

     He holds out Gordy's passport.     Beat.   Gordy takes it,
     starts out. As he goes --

                  It's The Wolf you're after, yes?

     Gordy stops, turns back. He says nothing, but the look
     on his face speaks volumes.

                                IMMIGRATION SUPERIOR
                  ... Then I've just done you a
                  bigger favor than you know.

     Gordy doesn't respond.    Just turns and goes.


87   INT. IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS AREA - OUTSIDE OFFICE -              87
     DAY

     Gordy's flanked by the armed policemen, one with a
     Rottweiler. As they walk, a PA announcement in Spanish
     is repeated in English...

                                PA ANNOUNCEMENT (V.O.)
                  ... Avianco flight 42 to Panama

                  Avianca flight 42 to Panama City
                  is now open for boarding.

     OFF Gordy, having heard the announcement --


88   EXT. PAN AMERICAN HIGHWAY (PANAMA) - DAY                          88

     The highway terminates here, far short of Colombia. The
     idea is to inhibit the northbound migration of people and
     drugs. From this point south lies the Darien Gap, a
     thick rain forest traversed only by rough trail.

     A cab with a Panama City logo pulls up at road's end.
     Gordy gets out with the Panamanian CAB DRIVER. The Cab
     Driver indicates a Panamanian man waiting there with a
     .9mm on his hip.

                                CAB DRIVER
                  My cousin, Ever.

     Ever and Gordy exchange nods.

                                GORDY
                  How far's Colombia?

     The Cab Driver indicates distant mountains.

                                CAB DRIVER
                  Beyond those mountains... The
                  trail is very dangerous, but do
                  not worry, Ever will get you
                  there... You can pay him then...
                  You can pay me now.

     Gordy pulls out his wallet, pays the Cabbie.

                                CAB DRIVER
                  Gracias, senor.

     The Driver gets back inside the cab.    Out the window --

                                CAB DRIVER
                  Que la vaya bien.

     He drives off. Gordy looks to Ever. Ever smiles,
     motions him to follow, then turns south and starts
     walking. As Gordy falls in behind...


89   EXT. DARIEN GAP - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY                         89

     Gordy and Ever pass through pristine tropical rain
     forest.


90   NEAR STREAM                                                   90

     rushing fiercely through the jungle, Ever uses his
     machete to cut two lengths of bamboo. He hands one to
     Gordy and indicates how they'll ford the stream. Gordy
     nods, then follows Ever's lead into the perilous, belly-
     deep water. They struggle to maintain their balance,
     even with the sticks. When they reach the opposite bank,
     Ever signs okay to Gordy and smiles.


91   HELICOPTER CARCASS                                            91

     They pass the carcass of a crashed and burned-out
     helicopter, when...

     Two dangerous-looking men armed with assault rifles step
     out of nowhere onto the path ahead of Gordy and Ever.
     Gordy and Ever stop. Gordy glances at Ever. Ever's
     focused on the men and clearly doesn't like what he sees.
     Gordy looks back. The armed men advance toward them
     carefully, rifles in the ready position. Gordy watches
     them approach, wondering who they are and what they're
     going to do. Ever, frightened, takes a half-step back,
     then swings the length of bamboo fast and hard, and...

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                                 39.

      He smashes it into the base of Gordy's head, knocking
      Gordy out.

      The men run up. One man covers Gordy, while Ever and the
      other man rifle his pack and toss his pockets. They take
      his passport, wallet, and an NYFD T-shirt. And then
      they're gone.


92    CLOSE ON HUMMINGBIRD                                             92

      Hovering over Gordy as he comes to.     As it flies off...


92A   GORDY                                                            92A

      sits up. Feels the bloody lump on his head. It hurts,
      but it's not serious. He searches his pockets and
      backpack, realizes the passport and wallet are missing.

      Gordy stands. Looks around. He's alone.      He's in the
      jungle... He keeps heading south.


93    EXT. DARIEN GAP - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY                            93

      Gordy trudges on. The thick jungle's hot and humid,
      full of STRANGE SOUNDS and shadowy animal movements.

      Gordy's going uphill, when he rounds a bend in the trail,
      and...

      He meets a man coming the other way. Alarm gives way to
      the realization that the man is followed by a number of
      people, including women and children. As they pass
      Gordy, it's apparent they're refugees from their haunted
      expressions and crude backpacks heavy with possessions...

      Gordy addresses the passing people.     Indicates where he's
      standing.

                                  GORDY
                   Aqui?   Colombia?...

      No one replies. Then a small COLOMBIAN GIRL comes up and
      gets his attention. She runs back up the trail a short
      distance and stops. She draws a line in the dirt.

                                  COLOMBIAN GIRL
                   Panama.

      She jumps backward over the line.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                              40.

93   CONTINUED:                                                     93

                                COLOMBIAN GIRL
                  Colombia.

     She does it again.

                                COLOMBIAN GIRL
                  Panama... Colombia.

     She smiles. At the sound of a sharp WHISTLE, however,
     she runs back quickly, passing Gordy and rejoining her
     family. Her father hands her a machete and a Zippo
     lighter, says something to her. Whereupon the little
     girl returns to Gordy and holds the items out to him.
     Beat. Gordy takes them.

                                GORDY
                  Gracias.

     The little girl runs back again, and Gordy watches the
     refugees disappear around the bend. Then turns back
     uphill and approaches the line the little girl drew in
     the dirt. Looks down at it. Crossing over means he
     walks into a world dangerous enough to cause these people
     to flee for their lives, and...

     Just as Gordy charged into the fire-engulfed tenement
     past a tide of more sensible rats going the other way, he
     now steps over the line and advances into Colombia.


94   EXT. PARQUE NACIONAL LOS KATIOS (COLOMBIA) - DAY/NIGHT         94

     Where the rain forest of Darien continues in Colombia.

     Darkness sets in as Gordy follows the trail downhill.    At
     night, the JUNGLE'S EVEN NOISIER. When...

     EVERYTHING GOES QUIET. Gordy slows. And suddenly,
     AUTOMATIC WEAPONS begin to POP somewhere. Not close, but
     not far, either. A FEW BURSTS, some SINGLE SHOTS -- the
     call and response of an ambush -- and then SILENCE. And
     then the nighttime JUNGLE NOISES return.

     As Gordy walks on...


95   EXT. PARQUE NACIONAL LOS KATIOS - MORNING                      95

     The sun is already cooking the jungle as Gordy reaches a
     break in the trees, sees a small town ahead.

                                                               41.

96    NEARBY - MOMENTS LATER                                         96

      Gordy has left the trail. He lowers his pants just
      enough to expose his injured thigh. A bandage covers the
      wound made by the glass shard. Gordy unwraps the
      bandage, revealing...

      A wad of cash is hidden inside, along with a photo of
      Anne and Matt. A long, livid scar marks the wound.

      Gordy studies the photo of Anne and Matt a moment, then
      removes some cash from the wad and re-wraps the money and
      photo inside the bandage.


97    BACK ON TRAIL                                                  97

      Gordy heads into the town.


98    EXT./INT. CHIVA - NIGHT                                        98

      One of the colorful, wretchedly overcrowded buses that
      ply Colombia's back-country roads.

      As the chiva jolts and shudders over the dirt road, Gordy
      sleeps. He's an object of some curiosity -- not only a
      gringo, but a virtual Gulliver in comparison to the
      small-statured Colombians pressed in around him.


99    EXT. FINCA (COLOMBIA) - DAY                                    99

      A sprawling farm/estate deep in the countryside. Beyond
      the hacienda, we see a military compound containing tents
      and three heavily camouflaged helicopter shelters. A
      recently arrived Light Observation Helicopter (LOH) sits
      on a chopper pad with its rotors still turning.


100   INT. HACIENDA - DAY                                            100

      Full of manned hi-tech command-and-control and
      surveillance equipment. A Colombian military operations
      officer, ROCHA, waits with an aide.

      Brandt arrives with Updegraf.

                              BRANDT
                Find your fucking leak?

                              ROCHA
                Not yet. And it could be your
                fucking leak.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                                42.

100   CONTINUED:                                                      100

                                 BRANDT
                   All due respect, Noel, it's not
                   likely... And we don't need the
                   whole world looking into what
                   we're doing down here... We find
                   the son-of-a-bitch again, we're
                   bypassing protocols...

      Updegraf has had papers handed to him and interrupts --

                                 UPDEGRAF
                   Check this out.

      He hands a paper to Brandt.    Brandt reads it.

                                 BRANDT
                   Jesus Christ...

                                 UPDEGRAF
                          (to Rocha)
                   The man whose wife and son died in
                   New York. One of your units found
                   his passport and credit cards on
                   some gunrunners near Panama.
                   Gunrunners say they left him
                   alive.

                                 BRANDT
                   What, he thinks he can get The
                   Wolf himself?

                                 ROCHA
                   We have too much time and too many
                   people invested to have a loose
                   cannon walking around.

                                 BRANDT
                          (beat; hands papers
                           to Rocha)
                   Throw out the net. Have him
                   picked up... Just make sure no one
                   kills him.

                                                        FLASH-CUT TO:


101   EXPLOSION                                                       101

      Boom!   An ENORMOUS EXPLOSION.      And...

                                                                43.

102   EXT./INT. CHIVA - NIGHT                                         102

      Gordy bolts awake from the nightmare with a scream. He
      looks around at the startled faces in the crowded bus,
      unsure where he is for a moment before he gets his
      bearings. The dream lingers, depressing him.


103   ANGLE - AHEAD OF CHIVA                                          103

      An oncoming bus flashes its headlights. As the buses
      pass, the ONCOMING DRIVER yells to Gordy's chiva driver.

                              ONCOMING DRIVER
                Inspecion militar. Chequeo de
                papeles.


104   SECOND CHIVA                                                    104

      keeps going. Gordy's chiva slows to a crawl, and the
      Driver calls back.

                              GORDY'S CHIVA DRIVER
                Inspecion militar. Chequeo de
                papeles.

      Various passengers gather their things and begin to
      disembark in a hurry. To anyone who'll answer --

                              GORDY
                Habla Ingles?... Que pasa?

      A MAN IN A YANKEES CAP is among the people getting off.
      He answers in accented English.

                              MAN IN YANKEES CAP
                There is a military checkpoint up
                the road. They inspect everyone's
                papers.


105   BUS                                                             105

      starts to pick up speed again. Gordy gets off just in
      time. To the Man in the Yankees Cap --

                              GORDY
                Where are all of you going?

                              MAN IN YANKEES CAP
                We walk around.

      The man heads into the forest.   Beat.   Gordy follows.

                                                              44.

106   EXT. FOREST - NIGHT                                           106

      To the Man in the Yankees Cap as they walk --

                              GORDY
                None of these people have papers?

                              MAN IN YANKEES CAP
                Some have the wrong papers. Some
                have none...

      The man puts a finger to his lips, hushing Gordy.
      They've come abreast of the checkpoint, which can be seen
      in the distance through the trees. Colombian soldiers
      have the chiva blocked as they perform their inspection.
      The chiva's DIESEL GROWLS loudly. When suddenly...


107   FIGURES                                                       107

      We see figures moving in the forest between the group and
      the checkpoint. And then...

      The forest erupts in a deafening fusillade of AUTOMATIC
      WEAPONS FIRE being directed at the soldiers at the
      checkpoint. In the same instant, an RPG takes out a
      Colombian Army humvee in a bright, fiery EXPLOSION.

                                MAN IN YANKEES CAP
                Alsuelo!


108   MAN                                                           108

      The man pulls Gordy down as the group hits the dirt.   The
      GUNFIRE continues. On the ground, to Gordy --

                                MAN IN YANKEES CAP
                Guerrilleros.

      The attack rages furiously for twenty seconds, then wanes
      to sporadic GUNFIRE. Other WEAPONS are FIRING now,
      too -- clearly the Army is finally mounting a defense.
      And then...


109   FOREST                                                        109

      We hear the sound of PEOPLE CRASHING through the forest.
      They're running toward Gordy and the group. The CRASHING
      GETS CLOSER. And now Gordy begins to hear the BREATHLESS
      PANTING of the guerrillas in retreat. BOOTS THUD past
      Gordy's head. When suddenly...

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                              45.

109   CONTINUED:                                                    109

      One of the running guerrillas trips over Gordy and goes
      sprawling. The guerrilla, wearing the motley uniform of
      an irregular soldier, whips a look back, and...

      Gordy finds himself staring into the battle-hardened eyes
      of a fierce young woman. In a heartbeat...

      The woman jumps back to her feet, and   joins her comrades
      laying down a suppressing FIRE at the   soldiers. Spent
      cartridges rain down around Gordy, as   the AK-47 ON FULL
      AUTO chops loudly over his head. And    then...


110   NEW ANGLE                                                     110

      The guerrillas are gone.

      The Man in the Yankees hat hauls Gordy up, yells --

                                 MAN IN YANKEES CAP
                   Vaya!

      The group is in the greatest danger now -- caught between
      the fleeing guerrillas and the soldiers, who are giving
      chase and will shoot anyone or thing in front of them.
      Everyone in the group scrambles to his or her feet and
      begins to run. And...

      Soldiers do notice them and begin to FIRE.


111   FOLIAGE                                                       111

      BULLETS SHRED the foliage around Gordy, whipping past his
      head... He and others keep running. A man goes down when
      a BULLET BITES into his leg. Gordy slows, but the Man in
      Yankees Cap won't let him stop to help. Slams him hard
      on his back. Keeps pushing Gordy forward. A few moments
      later, we hear M-16's on FULL AUTO back where they left
      the man.

                                 MAN IN YANKEES CAP
                   His trouble is over.


112   EXT. SMALL RIVER                                              112

      The powerful TORRENT ROARS through the forest.

      Gordy and the others reach the near bank, where the path
      drops into the water to reappear on the opposite bank.
      The Man in the Yankees Cap is in the lead. He plunges
      into the fast water up to his waist. Gordy and the rest
      splash in behind, struggling to cross against the swift
      current. The Man in the Yankees Cap reaches the far
      bank. Takes two steps, and...

                                                             46.

113   EXPLOSION                                                    113

      BOOM!   An EXPLOSION rips into him.


114   GORDY AND OTHERS                                             114

      stop mid-stream, but one of the group, a young woman,
      believing the blast was caused by the pursuing military,
      continues struggling to cross. An OLDER MAN looks, sees
      the blast-hole.

                                OLDER MAN
                  Mina.

      Gordy realizes the old man's saying "land mine."   To the
      young woman --

                                GORDY
                  No!

      Gordy moves to catch her.   Just manages to stop her as
      she reaches the far bank.   Gordy points to where the land
      mine detonated.

                                GORDY
                  Mina... Mina...

      Beat. Slowly, the terrified young woman responds to the
      strong, calm tone of command in Gordy's voice and the
      unpanicked, reassuring look on his face.

      Gordy brings her back to the group, which fights to stand
      in the rushing river. He indicates for them to hold
      hands for stability. Motions for them to stay.

                                GORDY
                  Alto.


115   GORDY                                                        115

      leaves the group in the middle of the river. The GUNFIRE
      is now FAR-OFF AND SPORADIC. He crosses to the water's
      edge on the far bank. Pulls the Zippo from his pack and
      leans over. Uses the flame to illuminate the mud and
      rock immediately in front of him. Scratches lightly at
      the ground with the machete, searching for mines. Finds nothing
      in that spot. And steps onto it.

      Searching the ground and scratching at it with the
      machete before each step, Gordy inches toward the Man in
      the Yankees Cap. Three steps from the river...

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                               47.

115   CONTINUED:                                                     115

      He finds a small, round anti-personnel mine the size of a
      hockey puck. He inches past it. Moves past another.
      And another. To the writhing Man in the Yankees Cap --

                                 GORDY
                   Don't move... Don't move...


116   NEW ANGLE                                                      116

      Finally, Gordy reaches him. One of the man's legs is
      missing below the knee. He's bleeding from various other
      wounds as well. Gordy uses the Zippo to inspect the area
      for more mines. Then kneels in a footprint.

                                 GORDY
                   You'll be okay... You'll be okay.

      He takes a bandanna from the man and ties a tourniquet
      around his thigh. By way of distracting him --

                                 GORDY
                   Guerrilla bastards.

                                 MAN IN YANKEES CAP
                   No... Military... To stop
                   guerrillas.

      Beat.   Gordy finishes the tourniquet, when he sees...


117   YOUNG MAN                                                      117

      has left the group and emerged from the river in a
      different place to avoid the mines.

      Gordy's eyes go to something glistening in front of the
      young man -- a taut nylon line ten inches off the ground.
      The kid's about to hit it. Gordy shouts --

                                 GORDY
                   No!   Alto!

      The young man hears the alarm in Gordy's voice and
      stops... But not before he plants his next step, and...

      The trip wire bows against his shin, and...

      Gordy ducks, covers the Man in the Yankees Cap, and...

      Nothing happens. The young man just stands there, frozen
      in position, his leg still bowing the line.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                              48.

117   CONTINUED:                                                    117

      Using the Zippo again to light his way, Gordy advances to
      the young man. He follows the trip wire to where a Coca-
      Cola can hangs from a nearby tree. On closer inspection,
      Gordy can see the can is sleeved around a grenade.
      There's no pin in the grenade. The can keeps the
      grenade's arming spoon in place. The trip wire's
      designed to yank the can off, allowing the grenade to
      explode at chest level... And the can's almost off.

      Gordy burns through the monofilament trip wire. Then
      carefully slides the Coke can back over the grenade.


118   MAN IN YANKEES CAP - MOMENTS LATER                            118

      When Gordy returns, the man's dead.    OFF Gordy, looking
      down at the NY logo on the cap...


119   EXT./INT. ANOTHER CHIVA - DAY                                 119

      Gordy sees a sign for a town as the chiva rumbles along.

      He pulls out his map.


120   INSERT - MAP                                                  120

      Gordy finds the town, which lies along a river. He
      traces a road from the town. The road runs south through
      the town of Mompos, and eventually reaches Caguan, the
      ELC capital.


121   BACK TO SCENE                                                 121

      A COLOMBIAN WOMAN is looking over Gordy's shoulder.

                                 COLOMBIAN WOMAN
                   No autobusses para este lugar.
                   Solamente el barco en el rio.

      She leans over, traces the river, which also runs to
      Caguan.

                                 COLOMBIAN WOMAN
                   El rio.


122   EXT. FERRY DOCK - DAY                                         122

      The FERRY'S WHISTLE TOOTS.    Lines are cast off.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                                49.

122   CONTINUED:                                                      122

      Two plainclothes federales have been watching the ferry
      load and now relax their vigil. One man holds a Xerox of
      Gordy's passport photo. The other bites into an
      empanada, which breaks open and spills its contents down
      the front of his shirt. His partner finds it funny. He
      doesn't. And while their attention's occupied...

      Gordy hurries by, oblivious to the federales' presence,
      and just manages to hop onto the ferry as it pulls away.


123   EXT. FERRY - DAY                                                123

      The ferry's the only means of travel south, and it's
      packed. Gordy picks his way through. The only other
      gringo on the boat is a geek in a plaid shirt and gimme
      hat that says "Deerborn." The geek, PHILIP ARMSTRONG,
      looks like a talker, and Gordy tries to avoid eye
      contact. He's too late.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                   Hey, yo, dude, here's a seat, man!

                                 GORDY
                   No, that's okay --

      But Armstrong's already throwing a bag off the bench.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                   I was hoping for someone I could
                   communicate with.

      He sees Gordy hasn't moved.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                   Only room's at the back near the
                   bano, and I'd advise against it,
                   unless you like poop.

      Beat.   Gordy sits.   Immediately --

                                 ARMSTRONG
                   Philip Armstrong. Assiniboia,
                   Sasketchewan, Canada.
                          (indicates his hat)

                                 GORDY
                   ... Gordy Pitt.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                   Hey, howya doing? I love Germany.

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                  GORDY
                   Austria.   American now.

                                  ARMSTRONG
                   I love America. Never been to
                   Austria. Where from in America
                   would that be?

                                    GORDY
                   New York City.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                   I don't like New York City.
                   Buildings're too big. What kinda
                   work you in?

                                 GORDY
                          (hesitates, then)
                   Coffee. I buy beans.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                   Can't drink caffeine. Makes my
                   stomach do the rumba. I like that
                   commercial guy with the sombrero
                   and the mule, though. Headed
                   upstream, eh? Where to?

                                    GORDY
                   Caguan.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                   ... You've never been to Caguan,
                   eh?

                                 GORDY
                   How do you know?

                                 ARMSTRONG
                   'Cause no one in their right mind
                   would ever go back. Caguan's in
                   the guerrilla zone run by the
                   E.L.C. E.L.C. as in 'Extra
                   Loathsome Communists.' They don't
                   care, and they kill. I'm going
                   there myself. But I have a 'get
                   outta jail free' card.

      Armstrong doffs his cap, undoes a safety pin securing a
      card inside the crown. Shows it to Gordy. Sotto --

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                 ARMSTRONG
                   E.L.C. travel pass. I can go
                   anywhere I want.
                          (by way of
                           explanation)
                   Everyone needs equipment fixed.

      Armstrong carefully returns the card to the hat. And now
      his voice takes on a noticeably more measured tone --

                                 ARMSTRONG
                   If you don't have one of these,
                   you don't want to be up there,
                   Gordy.

      Beat. Gordy's contemplating the warning, when his eyes
      go to a small, sleepy boy standing nearby on the cramped
      deck, leaning against his father. Gordy reaches over and
      taps the boy. The boy looks over. Shrinks away at the
      sight of the large gringo. The father notices and looks
      at Gordy, who stands, indicates his seat.

                                   GORDY
                   Por favor.

      The father's also apprehensive, doesn't move.

                                 GORDY
                   Con mucho gusto.

      Finally, the father accepts, sits down with the sleepy
      boy on his lap. Nods his thanks at Gordy, who then gazes
      down at the son. A kid about Matt's age. Armstrong
      recognizes the look of a caring dad.

                                   ARMSTRONG
                   Got kids, eh?

      OFF Armstrong, as Gordy walks away...


124   EXT. JUNGLE - DAY                                           124

      Two Colombian armed man wearing guerrilla uniforms
      bearing a distinctive ELC patch are walking a trail, when
      the man in front notices something odd. He stops. Leads
      the other man back a few steps. Looks into the foliage
      along the trail. Something doesn't seem right. He
      extends his AK-47. Prods a hump of greenery with the
      rifle butt, and in a flash...

      The greenery suddenly transforms into two men wearing
      face-paint and full-body military camouflage gear and
      pointing twin cocked-and-locked CAR-15 assault rifles at
      the heads of the startled guerrillas.

                                                                52.

125   EXT. CIA HACIENDA - DAY                                         125

      Brandt stubs a butt as a Colombian SOG group does killer
      training nearby. Updegraf opens the door. To Brandt --

                              UPDEGRAF
                One of Rocha's infiltration teams
                just radioed in... We got our big

126   EXT. FERRY - DAY                                                126

      Gordy stands along the rail looking out at the lush,
      beautiful countryside sliding past.

      Armstrong joins him.

                               ARMSTRONG
                That little kid and I had a nice,
                long snooze... We're almost to
                Mompos.
                        (gazing out)
                Beautiful country.

                                GORDY
                It better be.    A lotta people're
                dying for it.

                              ARMSTRONG
                       (looks overboard)
                Y'know, I haven't noticed one
                darn body floating downstream
                this whole trip, have you?

      Gordy doesn't respond.    Beat.

                              GORDY
                I was thinking... Maybe we could
                travel together into Caguan. You
                could show me around.

                              ARMSTRONG
                       (shakes his head)
                Pass is only good for one person,
                if that's your idea, which I think
                it is... Besides, I can't risk
                traveling around up there in the
                company of a big gringo with a
                dumb-ass cover story about coffee
                beans.

      Gordy looks over.   Armstrong smiles back.     Beat.

                   I've got money. I'll buy the pass
                   from you.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                   I've worked too hard for it. And
                   you don't have that kind of money

                   Mompos... You want to have some
                   fun, we'll hook up later. I
                   always schedule a stopover. To
                   sample the local wares and such.
                          (winks)
                   Life can be what you make it here
                   on the frontier.

                                 GORDY
                   No, thanks.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                   Gotta get off the boat anyway.
                   Mompos is the last stop. From
                   here into the guerrilla zone you
                   can only travel by panga... If you
                   change your mind, I'll be at the
                   Tropicale later. It's a gringo
                   bar. Just follow the cockroaches.


127   NEW ANGLE                                                  127

      They see the beginnings of Mompos. Two 4x4 trucks are
      parked on the riverbank. Lean, clean-cut men in jeans,
      tight shirts, cowboy boots and sunglasses lean on the
      truck and watch the ferry pass.

                                 ARMSTRONG

128   SAME SCENE - FEW MOMENTS LATER                              128

      The ferry pulls up to the dock. The dock street is a
      culture clash of shanty bars and Amazon Indian traders,
      of big-wheel SUVs and mule carts. There's a definite air
      of menace.

                              ARMSTRONG
                Federales are looking for someone.

      Gordy follows Armstrong's look to two plain-clothes
      federales, one fat and one thin, standing near the dock
      watching the boat pull up.

      When Gordy glances back, Armstrong is gone.


129   EXT. MOMPOS FERRY DOCK - DAY                                129

      Gordy disembarks amid the throng of passengers, when the
      FAT FEDERALE confronts him.

                              FAT FEDERALE
                Senor Pitt?

      Gordy looks up in surprise at him and the thin federale
      backing him up.

                              FAT FEDERALE
                You'll have to come with us.

                              GORDY
                Why?

                              FAT FEDERALE
                Come with us, please.

      He clamps a hand on Gordy's arm. Gordy shakes it off and
      starts running. Almost immediately, he's tackled to the
      ground by the thin federale. Two more federales join in.

      Gordy's not gonna go down easy, though.

      Even as only one against four, Gordy's a formidable
      challenge. He's strong, and he's committed all the way.
      He's not getting kicked out of this country again. It's
      not a clean or artful fight. There's no karate. It's
      four men trying to tackle a bull, and...

      The bull gets away.


130   EXT./INT. MOMPOS - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY                      130

      Gordy sprints down streets with the federales in pursuit.

                                                               55.

131   GORDY                                                          131

      jukes into a local bar.


132   ANOTHER ANGLE                                                  132

      Gordy pounds out the back of the bar into a littered
      courtyard, where he's surrounded by ten-foot walls.


133   FEDERALES                                                      133

      blast through the bar.


134   GORDY                                                          134

      runs, jumps, launches off a beer keg, and...


135   TOP OF WALL                                                    135

      He reaches the top of the wall and pulls himself up.
      He's looking out across a block-long run of corrugated
      tin roofs. Takes off across the roofs, each step
      thundering, as...


136   FEDERALES                                                      136

      burst into the courtyard. Two men hastily build a stack
      of boxes, etc., against the wall.


137   GORDY                                                          137

      runs as fast as he can across the rooftops, when...

      A section of roof gives way beneath his feet, just as...


138   NEW ANGLE                                                      138

      One of the federales finally mounts the wall, looks
      across the rooftops... and Gordy's gone.


139   GORDY                                                          139

      lands inside a warehouse room amid sacks of rice, beans
      and coffee. The building is dark and dusty. He lies
      still and listens. FOOTSTEPS approach across the tin
      roof overhead. Gordy burrows into the bags of rice,
      pulls them over him.

                                                              56.

140   FEDERALE                                                      140

      on the roof peers down through the hole. Scans the
      warehouse room below with a mini-Mag-Lite.


141   GORDY                                                         141

      sees the flashlight beam move past. He holds his breath.
      Beat. Then the FOOTSTEPS pass on, RECEDE down the roof.
      And Gordy can breathe again.


142   EXT. MOMPOS STREET - NIGHT                                    142

      Gordy makes his way along the main drag of the frontier
      town. A noisy, neon-lit strip of bars and brothels.
      Everyone's packing a gun. A new Dodge City, where death
      squad sicarios cruise past in 4x4's BLARING SALSA.


143   INT. TROPICALE - NIGHT                                        143

      In here, the MUSIC'S LOUD ROCK 'N' ROLL. Gringo music
      for a gringo bar. The place is busy, with plenty of
      local "hostesses" for the men. Even Armstrong, standing
      half-crocked at the bar, is flanked by two scantily-clad
      women. He's got a spoon hanging off his nose. So does one
      of the girls. Armstrong's trying to hang a spoon on the
      other.

      Gordy slips into the bar. Spots Armstrong through the
      crowd. Sees Armstrong's not wearing his cap, when...

      The girl with the spoon on her nose turns slightly,
      revealing she's wearing the cap. It's on backwards, but
      now Gordy can see the "Deerborn" logo clearly.

      Gordy wants the guerrilla travel pass inside the cap.
      It's a desperate move, but he's got no choice. Starts
      toward the girl, when...

      Gordy sees the thin federale enter the front door. The
      thin federale sees him at the same time. Begins moving
      in on him.

      Gordy moves faster toward the girl.   And...

      The girl unwittingly does him a favor by taking off the
      cap and setting it on the bar, where it's easier to grab,
      and then turns her attention to Armstrong's antics.

      The thin detective fights through the crowd after Gordy.

      Gordy's almost to the hat.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                              57.

143   CONTINUED:                                                    143

      Armstrong's still having trouble with the second girl's
      spoon.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                   I never met a nose I couldn't hang
                   a spoon on.

      Gordy reaches the bar, snags the cap. Glances back, sees
      the thin federale closing in, turns to run out the back,
      when...

      A strong hand stops him. The hand belongs to the Fat
      Federale. And now the thin federale's there, too,
      wielding a stun gun where Gordy can see it. People in
      the bar fall silent. Everyone but Armstrong, who's
      finally hung the spoon on the second girl's nose.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                   Yahtzee!

      And now Armstong also realizes something's up. Turns and
      sees Gordy. Sees the cap in Gordy's hand as the Fat
      Federale addresses Gordy --

                                 FAT FEDERALE
                   Come along, Mr. Pitt.

      Whereupon Armstrong shouts drunkenly at Gordy --

                                 ARMSTRONG
                   Police catch you trying to steal
                   my hat, you asshole?!

      He staggers toward Gordy.    Grabs the hat.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                   Fucking hat thief!

      Armstrong takes a drunken swing at Gordy, but...

      Instead of hitting Gordy, Armstrong accidentally-on-
      purpose clocks the fat detective. Then hisses into
      Gordy's ear, clearly not that drunk --

                                 ARMSTRONG
                   Get outta here --

      But then Armstrong's legs won't work as the thin federale
      jams the stun gun against his neck, and 10,000 volts
      surprise the Armstrong neural network.

      Gordy moves against the thin federale in anger, when...

      The Fat Federale ZAPS him with another STUN GUN, just
      behind the ear... And Gordy gets to know the floor, too.

                                                                  58.

144   EXT. MOMPOS JAIL - NIGHT                                          144

      The building's ancient, constructed of wood and adobe.


145   INT. MOMPOS JAIL - CELL - NIGHT                                   145

      The jail might be old, but the cells are secure enough.
      They're also unsanitary and thoroughly unpleasant.

      Gordy and Armstrong are led in by the federales. The Fat
      Federale has Armstrong's hat. He looks it over,
      wondering why Gordy wanted it. Then decides he could
      give a fuck and tosses it to Armstrong. Clangs the cell
      door shut and locks it. Leaves shaking his head.

                                 FAT FEDERALE
                 Gringos...

      Armstrong's still unsteady on his feet and sits down on
      the metal bunk.

                               ARMSTRONG
                 That stun gun wasn't cool.

      Armstrong looks down at himself.

                               ARMSTRONG
                 Haven't peed my pants in a real
                 long time.

                               GORDY
                        (beat)
                 You shouldn't have helped me.

                               ARMSTRONG
                 Yeah, well, I guess all these
                 assholes down here are just
                 starting on my nerves.

      Gordy's silent.   It's over.   He's come up short.   He's
      going home.

                                ARMSTRONG
                 So what the hell did you do to
                 land us in here? And don't jerk
                 me around, eh?

      Beat.   Gordy sits.

                               GORDY
                 The Wolf killed my wife and son
                 in New York.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                                59.

145   CONTINUED:                                                      145

                                 ARMSTRONG
                   ... Oh, you're that guy, eh? I'm
                   sorry, man... And what, you came
                   down here to even things out?

      Gordy just looks at him.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                   Did you even have a plan?

                                 GORDY
                   Yeah. Go to Caguan, find The Wolf
                   and kill him.

      Armstrong just shakes his head.    Beat.


146   DOOR TO CELL AREA                                               146

      BANGS open. Federales lead in two men -- the two
      guerrillas surprised earlier by the heavy-camouflaged
      infiltrators. The federales are armed with batons and
      stun guns, taking no chances. It's clear the rebels
      weren't brought here without a struggle, either -- both
      are cut and bruised. The tougher-looking of the two has
      taken a real beating. This beaten man is jammed face-
      first against the bars of Gordy's cell. He makes eye
      contact with Gordy while the other rebel is unbound and
      put into a cell. Then the beaten man is shoved into the
      cell. A solid, brick wall separates them from Gordy and
      Armstrong. Armstrong's seen the patches on their
      uniforms. To Gordy, sotto --

                                 ARMSTRONG
                   E.L.C.

      Beat. Armstrong sees the look on Gordy's face.      By way
      of a warning --

                                 ARMSTRONG
                   If you can't kill them, don't even
                   talk to them.

      The GUERRILLAS are MURMURING in the other cell. One of
      them LAUGHS. OFF Gordy, listening to the LAUGHING...


147   INT. GORDY AND ARMSTRONG'S CELL - NIGHT                         147

      Two or three A.M. Armstrong's dozing. Gordy's still
      listening to the MURMURING of the REBELS on the other
      side of the wall, when...

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                              60.

147   CONTINUED:                                                    147

      There's a flurry of activity outside the cell area.   The
      door opens. Soldiers enter with some federales.

      Gordy watches the soldiers move past his cell.    Rocha is
      with them. And then...

      Brandt appears at the bars, looks in at Gordy.

                                 BRANDT
                   Enjoy your trip?

      Gordy stands, approaches.

                                 BRANDT
                   We asked you to leave it to us.

                                 GORDY
                   And you guys still haven't got
                   him.

                                 BRANDT
                   It's not over yet... The guys next
                   door are in The Wolf's elite
                   bodyguard unit. Where he goes,
                   they go. We're gonna ask
                   questions. And we're gonna get
                   answers... And you're staying
                   right here till our bomber's dead.

      Brandt goes. Moments later, a TORTURED SCREAM is heard
      on the other side of the brick wall, waking Armstrong
      with a start.


148   EXT. MOMPOS - VARIOUS SHOTS - NIGHT                           148

      In a field near Mompos, a canopied truck backs into
      position. Men in guerrilla uniforms with ELC patches get
      out and pull back the canopy, revealing mortar tubes
      pointing skyward on a bed of sand.


149   ELC GUERRILLA                                                 149

      unit armed with AK-47s and Light Anti-Tank Weapons
      (LAWs) infiltrates the town.


150   ANOTHER TWO-MAN ELC GUERRILLA TEAM                            150

      sets up a single mortar position overlooking the town.
      One of the men checks his watch. Beat. He signals. The
      other man drops a MORTAR down the tube. WHUMP.

                                                               61.

151   TWO MORTARS                                                    151

      go in the tubes on the truck.   WHUMP, WHUMP.


152   ANOTHER ANGLE                                                  152

      BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! A water tower, the Mompos fire
      station and the town's power supply are direct hits.

      WHUMP, WHUMP, WHUMP...


153   INT. JAIL - CELLS                                              153

      People react to the sounds of the MORTAR ATTACK on the
      town. The lights go out. Brandt, Rocha and their men
      quickly lock the guerrillas in their cell and head out.


154   EXT. JAIL                                                      154

      As MORTARS CONTINUE to fall on the rest of the town, the
      unit of guerrilla infiltrators open up on the front of
      the jail with LAW ROCKETS.


155   EXT./INT. JAIL                                                 155

      KA-BOOM! The front door and wall of the jail
      disintegrate under the multiple LAW attack.


156   NEW ANGLE                                                      156

      Brandt, Rocha and the soldiers, approaching the front
      door inside, are hammered by the massive concussion of
      the BLAST and flung across the room, apparently dead.


157   ANOTHER ANGLE                                                  157

      The powerful, concussive shock-wave channels into the
      cell area. Gordy's slightly protected by a wall.
      Armstrong, standing at the bars, is thrown into the
      opposite wall and knocked unconscious.


158   GUERRILLAS                                                     158

      charge inside with AKs BLAZING.   Surviving soldiers and
      federales SHOOT back.

      The blasts have caused fires in the building. Severed

      through the tinder-dry structure.

      The guerrillas take out the soldiers and federales, with
      few casualties to themselves. They make their way toward
      the cell area.

      EXPLODING AMMO and stored FUEL CANS accelerate the fire.

      The guerrillas reach the cells. Two men see Gordy and
      draw down on him. The others move to the next cell.

      Guerrillas plant small explosive charges on the hinges of
      the cell containing their two captured comrades. Beat.
      The HINGES BLOW. The beaten man and the rebel with him
      are freed, and the guerrillas quickly retreat the way
      they came.

      Gordy sees flames spreading into the cell area.


160   GUERRILLAS                                                      160

      dead.


161   EXT. MOMPOS STREET - OUTSIDE JAIL                               161

      A truck pulls up. The guerrillas get in.    The TRUCK
      SCREECHES OUT as...


162   4X4                                                             162

      full of sicarios SKIDS onto the street, far ahead of the
      truck. The sicario driving punches it, and...


163   TWO TRUCKS                                                      163

      ROAR toward each other. A game of chicken. With GUNS.
      Men in both vehicles OPEN UP -- the sicarios with magnums
      and Uzis, the guerrillas with AKs. SLUGS RIP through
      automotive steel. Casualties are taken. When...

      The 4x4 catapults completely over the guerrillas' truck,
      disintegrating into spare parts and dead occupants, as...


167   GUERRILLAS                                                            167

      A severely-dazed Brandt, bleeding from the nose and ears,
      slowly gets to his knees, crawls out of the burning
      building and collapses outside.


169   INT. GORDY AND ARMSTRONG'S CELL                                       169

      There's fire and smoke everywhere. Gordy picks up the
      metal bunk and slams it against a wall. Slams it again.
      Breaks the metal apart. Then levers a long side rail in
      the cell door. He heaves. Heaves again. The fire's
      licking at him, but Gordy's undeterred. He heaves again,
      and...

      This time, the door gives. Gordy picks up Armstrong's
      cap, then picks up Armstrong, who's starting to come
      around. Puts Armstrong over his shoulders in a fireman's
      carry.

                                    GORDY
                   Don't breathe.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                          (weakly)
                   You're not running through the
                   fire, eh?

                                 GORDY
                   Close your mouth.

      Because running through the fire is just what Gordy's
      gonna do. As he disappears into the flames...


170   EXT. JAIL - NIGHT                                                     170

      The town's in complete chaos.         There are fires
      everywhere.
                                                              (CONTINUED)

      Still stunned and bleeding, Brandt looks from where he
      lies on the ground as...

      Gordy bursts out of the inferno carrying Armstrong.
      They're singed and smoking, but they're alive. Gordy
      drops Armstrong, pats himself and Armstrong down,
      knocking out the burning embers on their clothes and
      hair, when...

      Gordy's eyes meet Brandt's. The two men hold the look
      for a moment. If Brandt could speak, he'd be yelling at
      Gordy to stop, not to go on. And Gordy knows it. But
      Gordy's not stopping. Picks up Armstrong again and moves
      off toward the waterfront.


171   EXT. MOMPOS WATERFRONT - NIGHT                                 171

      There's less chaos here.    The fires are in the distance.

      Gordy arrives carrying Armstrong.    Sets him down.

                                 GORDY
                   I'll find a boat to take us
                   upriver.

      He starts to go.    Armstrong stops him.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                   No. I told you. The pass is only
                   good for one person. And you're
                   too dangerous to travel with.

      Beat. Gordy reaches over and takes Armstrong's cap.     He
      looks inside. There's no pass.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                   It hasn't been there since we
                   landed.

      Gordy's at a loss. He tosses the cap back.      Just looks
      at Armstrong. Beat. Armstrong sighs.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                   Aw, hell... I was through with
                   this place anyway...

      He takes off a boot. Shakes out some money and the pass.
      He hands the pass to Gordy.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

171   CONTINUED:                                                       171

                                 ARMSTRONG
                   I'll call ahead and tell Felix I'm
                   not coming, and you're my
                   replacement. He'll meet you in
                   Caguan and take you to the
                   plantation... What do you know
                   about diesel engines?

                                 GORDY
                   All the fire trucks are diesels.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                   You'll have to be Austrian, eh?
                   They hate Americans. Name's gotta
                   change, too, in case they're
                   watching the news.
                          (beat)
                   It'll buy you a little time to
                   look around Caguan. But you'll
                   never find The Wolf.

      Beat.   Gordy sticks out his hand.

                                 GORDY
                   Heinrich Beckmann.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                   Huh?

                                 GORDY
                   My Austrian name.

      Armstrong shakes hands with Gordy.     Armstrong doesn't
      let loose right away. Beat.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                   Luck got you this far. But up
                   there, luck doesn't make it.
                   I hope you know you're gonna die.

      OFF Gordy, about to step over another line...


172   EXT. RIVER - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY                                 172

      As dawn breaks over the river, FIND Gordy sitting in a
      motored panga being steered by a local BOATMAN. Gordy
      reaches into a pocket and pulls out the photo of Anne and
      Matt. He looks at it for a few moments. Then pockets it
      again.


173   SAME SCENE - LATER                                               173

      The panga passes a dead body floating downstream.

                                                               66.

      the riverbank.

                La zona guerrillera.


175   SAME SCENE - MOMENTS LATER                                     175

      The panga rounds a bend, and...

      Two souped-up bass boats filled with heavily-armed ELC
      guerrillas move to intercept it.

      The Boatman slows, puts the panga in neutral and keeps
      his hands in sight.

      One boat of guerrillas pulls alongside. The other sheers
      off and stops a short distance away, ready to open fire.

      Gordy shows the guerrillas his travel pass. One of them
      takes it. Reads. Looks Gordy over. Then starts to rip
      the pass in half, when...

      He stops. Grins. It's a big joke. He hands back the
      pass, searches the boat quickly and waves the panga on.

      OFF Gordy's relief as the panga heads on...


176   EXT. CAGUAN TOWN DOCK - DAY                                    176

      The panga arrives, and Gordy gets out. He's met by
      FELIX. Felix has a 9mm in a shoulder holster. Felix
      doesn't look the least bit happy.

                                FELIX
                Beckmann.

                                GORDY
                Yeah.

                                FELIX
                Come with me.

      Felix leads him towards a Land Cruiser.

                              FELIX
                Armstrong should have called
                sooner. We don't like changes
                here... If I didn't need the
                equipment fixed, I'd send you
                back.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

      They reach the Land Cruiser.

                                 FELIX
                   But now we have to see the E.L.C.
                   Supervisor for Caguan.

      It's a prospect that seems to concern Felix almost as
      much as Gordy. Off which, as they get into the Toyota...


177   INT. ELC SUPERVISOR'S OFFICE - DAY                              177

      The ELC SUPERVISOR for Caguan may be a Marxist, but the
      clean, well-ordered office is nicely appointed, with a
      big-screen Sony and leather furniture. The TV's TUNED TO
      CNN. A photo on the wall depicts him as a younger man
      wearing guerrilla cammies bearing with an ELC patch and
      holding an AK-47. A brass nameplate reading "Supervisor"
      rests on a neat desk, behind which stands the man himself
      -- a hardened, former guerrilla fighter proud of his
      position. He's not in cammies now -- his uniform now
      consists of casual but nice tropical clothing and a fat
      Rolex.

      Felix is a subordinate here. He and Gordy stand across
      the desk as the Supervisor examines Gordy's travel pass.
      Gordy's nervous about what could appear on the TV in the
      b.g., but tries not to show it.

                                 ELC SUPERVISOR
                   Your passport was stolen.

                                 GORDY
                   In Mompos.

                                 ELC SUPERVISOR
                   ... Mompos is a shithole. Not
                   like Caguan... Why didn't
                   Armstrong come?

                                 GORDY
                   He was arrested in Ecuador. He
                   got drunk and fooled around with a
                   police officer's wife.

      The Supervisor just looks at him, assessing Gordy's face
      for signs he's lying. Gordy's expression stays the same.

      Felix respectfully interjects.     It's almost a plea.

                                 FELIX
                          (in Spanish)
                   We need to fix the equipment. We
                   have delivery deadlines to meet.

                                                        (CONTINUED)

177   CONTINUED:                                                    177

      A long beat. The ELC Supervisor hands the travel pass
      back to Gordy. In a hard tone to Felix --

                                 ELC SUPERVISOR
                          (in Spanish)
                   He's your responsibility. Don't
                   let him out of your sight.

                                    FELIX
                   Si.   Gracias.

      As Felix leads Gordy away...


178   INT./EXT. LAND CRUISER (CAGUAN) - DAY                         178

      Gordy and Felix pull away from the Supervisor's H.Q.
      Felix resumes his former tone of command.

                                 FELIX
                   The Supervisor made you my
                   responsibility... You don't go
                   anywhere without me, you
                   understand?

                                    GORDY
                   No problemo.

      Gordy peers out the window intently as they drive,
      looking for a lucky break, looking for The Wolf,
      searching the face of every man. He doesn't see The
      Wolf, but what he does see surprises him. The ELC
      Supervisor was right: Caguan's no Mompos. It's a third-
      world town, armed troops are visible, and there's a lot
      of bad shit behind Colombia's revolutionaries, but here
      the streets are calm and orderly. It's quiet, almost
      eerie, as people go about their business. OFF Gordy,
      seeing another side of the guerrillas...


179   INT./EXT. LAND CRUISER/COUNTRY ROAD - DAY                     179

      Felix turns off at the entrance to a lane leading to the
      plantation. The entrance is guarded by a 4X4 "Rat
      Patrol" assault truck and four heavily armed ELC
      guerrillas.

                                 GORDY
                   The E.L.C. guards your coffee
                   beans?

      Felix thinks he's joking. Until he looks over and sees
      Gordy's actually being sincere.

                   ... Coffee beans? Shit.
                   Armstrong didn't tell you much...


180   INT./EXT. LAND CRUISER - PLANTATION - DAY                   180

      They approach a hacienda and outbuildings. The
      accoutrements of agriculture are present -- tractors,
      sheds, cats, etc. -- but clearly, this is no family farm.
      There are lots of serious-looking men around. More ELC
      guerrillas stand guard.


181   FELIX                                                       181

      stops the car. He and Gordy get out. Felix begins
      leading Gordy toward two rows of long, open-walled sheds.

                                 FELIX
                   The problem's with the diesel
                   generators. The sons-of-bitches
                   keep breaking down.


182   NEW ANGLE                                                   182

      They pass four very large pits, where green leaves steep
      in a thick, foul-smelling liquid.

                                 FELIX
                   We're using portables to keep
                   production going, but they don't
                   supply enough power to the heat
                   lamps, and we have to dry a lot
                   of... 'coffee beans.'


183   ANOTHER ANGLE                                               183

      They're now walking between the two rows of sheds, where
      portable gas GENERATORS THRUM, and...

      Gordy can see long, wide platforms inside. Above the
      platforms are multiple arrays of powerful heat lamps.
      Spread out and drying beneath them is a half-acre or two
      of converted cocaine.


184   IN ANOTHER SHED                                             184

      workers pack and wrap one-kilo bricks of coke for
      shipment.

                                                               70.

185   GORDY AND FELIX                                                185

      approach the two giant diesel generators.

                              FELIX
                We can fix anything, but these
                keep dying on us... You'll start
                now. I'll have tools brought to
                you.
                       (beat)
                Armstrong's a magician with them.
                Let's hope you have his skill.

      Felix walks over to a guerrilla with an AK-47 and speaks
      to him. Then goes. Whereupon the guerrilla crosses to
      Gordy and takes up a sentry position over him.


186   SAME SCENE - LATER                                             186

      Gordy has the diesels partially dismantled. The
      guerrilla sentry is still right there. Felix returns.

                              FELIX
                Well?

      Gordy has to think of something fast.    Beat.   He throws a
      machine part against a wall angrily.

                              GORDY
                I can't work with these pieces of
                junk.

                             FELIX
                Junk? These generators cost a
                fortune.

                              GORDY
                Then treat them that way.

                              FELIX
                       (beat, then)
                Armstrong always fixes them.

                              GORDY
                Armstrong wants your money. He
                makes them work, but he doesn't
                fix them... To do this right, we
                gotta order parts from Europe.
                In the meantime, I can make
                something temporary. There must
                be a machine shop in town.

                              FELIX
                ... Yes.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                                    71.

186   CONTINUED:                                                          186

      Gordy stands.

                                 GORDY
                   Let's go.

      OFF Felix, forced to acquiesce...


187   INT./EXT. LAND CRUISER (CAGUAN) - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY               187

      Felix is driving. Again, Gordy uses the opportunity to
      look for The Wolf. It's a long-shot, and he knows it.
      But it's all he can do.


188   EMPTY STOREFRONT                                                    188

      They pass an empty storefront. A sign on the large,
      front plate glass window says "Cine" and "Sabado."


189   BAR                                                                 189

      They pass a bar. Felix watches it go by with something
      like a look of desire. Gordy registers the look and the
      connection to the bar.


190   INT. MACHINE SHOP - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY                             190

      Gordy selects spare parts.

      A clerk wraps the parts in an old newspaper, and...

      Gordy realizes his picture is on the paper.       He smears
      grease from his hands over it.


191   EXT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY                                             191

      Gordy finishes loading the parts into the Land Cruiser.

                                 FELIX
                   Let's get moving.

                                 GORDY
                   I'm thirsty. How about you?   Want
                   to get something to drink?

      Felix pauses. We see the look of desire again. Gordy's
      definitely struck a chord. But Felix quickly stifles it.

                                 FELIX
                   We have to get back.

                                                         (CONTINUED)

                                                               72.

191   CONTINUED:                                                     191

                                 GORDY
                   I've been working all day out in
                   the sun. I need a drink... nice
                   cold beer? How about it? I saw a
                   bar in town.

      Felix really wants to, but still hesitates.

                                 GORDY
                   With the spare parts, I'll have
                   the generators running in two
                   hours... We have time for a
                   couple beers.

      Beat.   Finally --

                                  FELIX
                   Okay.   Just a beer. Maybe two.


192   INT. BAR - NIGHT                                               192

      They've had a lot more than two beers. Felix has,
      anyway. He's drunk. He's also in love with a waitress
      on his lap, a cute gordita named BERTA. He pats her.

                                 FELIX
                   This is mine. This is the reason
                   I come here... right, Berta? Me
                   amas?

                                 BERTA
                          (playing along)
                   Si, amor.

      Somebody whistles for a drink, and Berta goes.

                                 FELIX
                   ... She's hot, isn't she?

                                  GORDY
                   Yeah.

      Long beat.    Gordy makes the play he's been contemplating.

                                 GORDY
                   Armstrong said to watch my butt
                   around here. I guess the fucking
                   Americans come down and shoot
                   everyone all the time.

                                 FELIX
                   Especially now, since the bomb in
                   New York.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                                 73.

192   CONTINUED:                                                       192

                                 GORDY
                   Yeah, I heard about it.   Who did
                   it?

      Felix is just loose enough.

                                 FELIX
                   The Wolf, and they'll never catch
                   him.

                                   GORDY
                   Ever see him?

                                   FELIX
                   Once.

                                   GORDY
                   Where?

                                 FELIX
                          (beat; eyes Gordy)
                   If you know too much around here,
                   it can get you killed.

      Gordy's gotten all he'll get from Felix.     He feigns
      nonchalance, smiles.

                                 GORDY
                   Tell me what doesn't get you
                   killed around here.

      Gordy takes a swig of beer.      When...

      Gordy sees the Beaten Man from the jail in Mompos.       The
      man has just walked in with another guerrilla.

      Gordy barely avoids being seen as the guerrillas cross
      the room. At the bar, the bartender puts out two crates
      of beer. The guerrillas take the beer and head out. No
      money's changed hands. When they're gone, to Felix --

                                 GORDY
                   We'd better get back, huh?

                                 FELIX
                          (checks his watch)
                   ... Shit. It's late.


193   EXT. BAR - NIGHT                                                 193

      The two guerrillas are just driving away in a big-
      wheeled, high ground-clearance Suburban as Gordy and
      Felix emerge. Felix is weaving.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                                 74.

193   CONTINUED:                                                       193

      Gordy keeps his eyes on the Suburban's tail lights and
      opens the Land Cruiser's passenger door for Felix.

                                 GORDY
                   You're too drunk. I'll drive.


194   EXT./INT. LAND CRUISER                                           194

      Gordy gets in. Felix hands Gordy the keys.        Then slumps
      against his door and closes his eyes.

                                 FELIX
                   One day, I'm going to screw Berta.

      Gordy STARTS the CAR and drives after the Suburban.


195   EXT./INT. LAND CRUISER (CAGUAN) - NIGHT                          195

      Gordy follows the Suburban as Felix rambles --

                                 FELIX
                   ... I'll take her to a small
                   restaurant... We'll have lobster
                   and drink lots of wine... I'll get
                   her drunk... We'll drive home...
                   I'll carry her inside... I'll kiss
                   her... And then, I'll screw her in
                   my bed...

      The Suburban pulls up next to a house.       There are armed
      guerrilla guards outside.

                                 FELIX
                   ... And when I am done screwing
                   her, she'll never want to look at
                   another man again...

      Gordy drives past the house as the Beaten Man and the
      guerrilla with him get out of the Suburban and start
      carrying the beer inside. And a moment later...

      Felix comes around with a start.

                                 FELIX
                   What the fuck are you doing?!

      He unholsters the 9mm and points it at Gordy.

                                 GORDY
                   Hey, easy... What's the problem?

                                                         (CONTINUED)

                                                                75.

195   CONTINUED:                                                      195

                                 FELIX
                   You're going the wrong goddamn
                   way!

                                 GORDY
                   I am?... Looks different in the
                   dark...

                                  FELIX
                   Turn around!

      Gordy turns the car around.     Felix keeps the gun on him.

                                 FELIX
                   You drive where I say... Or the
                   Supervisor will have us both shot.

      Gordy drives back. They approach the Suburban and the
      house once more. This time it's on Felix' side. Felix
      gives the guerrilla guards a wave as they go by, and...

      Gordy's eyes go to something he couldn't see coming the
      other way: a large propane tank next to the house.


196   EXT. PLANTATION - VARIOUS SHOTS - NIGHT                         196

      The work in the sheds continues.    Heat lamps dry down the
      long tables of coke.


197   GUERRILLA GUARDS                                                197

      are more vigilant at night, patrolling the grounds with
      posted teams.


198   WORK LIGHTS                                                     198

      illuminate the two big diesel generators as Gordy
      continues his overhaul. He has two sentries now. One
      wears a combat vest, and as Gordy works, his eyes go to
      the grenades hanging on the vest's front.


199   EXT. PLANTATION - DIESEL GENERATORS - DAY                       199

      The sun's over the yardarm now, blazing hot, and Gordy's
      still working under the watchful eyes of the guards.

      Nearby, a group of guerrillas is playing soccer, when...

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                              76.

199   CONTINUED:                                                    199

      A man is injured, and his teammates call for one of
      Gordy's guards to substitute. The man in the combat vest
      responds. The game is shirts and skins, and he's joining
      the skins. Puts down his AK, strips off his combat vest
      and shirt, and runs in.

      Gordy's eyes go to the vest and the attached grenades.
      With the other guard still watching him closely, however,
      there's nothing Gordy can do.


200   SAME SCENE - LATER                                            200

      The soccer game rages back and forth. Suddenly, an open
      man gets the ball. Breaks toward the goal.

      Gordy sees the player about to go one-on-one with the
      goalie. He cheers the action loudly, whereupon...

      Gordy's guard turns to see what's happening, and...

      Gordy grabs a grenade.    Almost gets it into a tool box,
      when...

      The player kicks wide, the guard looks back, and...

      Gordy covers the clattering of the grenade's dropping
      into the tool box by picking up a large wrench... But the
      grenade's still visible as now...

      Felix comes around the corner. He's sleepy and hungover.
      And pissed by Gordy's lack of progress.

                                 FELIX
                   It's afternoon. Yesterday, you
                   said it would only take two more
                   hours.

      Gordy wipes his hands on a rag, throws it on the grenade.

                                 GORDY
                   I have this one ready to go.

      Gordy reaches up and hits the start button on the
      GENERATOR. It SPUTTERS, but won't catch. Felix just
      looks at him. Gordy makes an adjustment, and...

      This time,   the ENGINE TURNS OVER. PURRS like new. The
      heat lamps   brighten in a row of sheds. Felix winces as
      the DIESEL   ROAR makes the hangover hammers in his head
      pound even   harder.

                                 FELIX
                   What about the other one?

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                                      77.

200   CONTINUED:                                                            200

                                 GORDY
                   I just need another part from
                   town, and it's five more minutes.

                                    FELIX
                   ... Shit.     Fine. Let's go.

      Gordy grabs the tool box.

                                 FELIX
                   Why're you bringing the tool box?

                                 GORDY
                   The old part's in there. I need
                   to match it, and it's all greasy.

      Felix buys it and heads off.          As Gordy follows him...


201   EXT./INT. LAND CRUISER (CAGUAN) - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY                 201

      They pass the "Cine" in the storefront. The ELC
      Supervisor's big-screen TV is being wheeled in.


202   GORDY                                                                 202

      sees an attractive woman playing with some children.


203   GORDY AND FELIX                                                       203

      drive past the bar.        Gordy notices Felix doesn't even
      glance at it.

                                 GORDY
                   Berta working today?

                                    FELIX
                   Ha!   Puta!

      We see that, whatever this means, it's an unexpected
      complication for Gordy.


204   INT. MACHINE SHOP - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY                               204

      Gordy chooses the spare part.

      The clerk wraps the part in newspaper.

                                                                 78.

205   EXT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY                                          205

      Gordy loads the part into the Land Cruiser.   To Felix --

                              GORDY
                You as thirsty as I am?

                                FELIX
                No.

      Felix gets into the Land Cruiser.


206   EXT./INT. LAND CRUISER (CAGUAN) - DAY                            206

      Gordy climbs in.   Felix starts driving.   Gordy's down to
      final straws.

                              GORDY
                We can't stop for one beer?

                              FELIX
                There's beer at the plantation.

                              GORDY
                       (thinking fast)
                There's no Berta at the
                plantation. I like drinking beer
                around pretty girls, not a bunch
                of guys with automatic rifles.

                              FELIX
                To hell with Berta.

                              GORDY
                What happened? Last night you
                were in love with her.

      There's a beat. Felix glances at Gordy.     Decides it's
      safe to confide.

                              FELIX
                ... I had a dream... I fed her
                lobster, got her drunk, and she
                rejected me for another man.
                       (off Gordy's look)
                Dreams tell the future.

                              GORDY
                ... That wasn't a dream, that was
                the alcohol talking... You saying
                two men can't go have a beer and
                look at women's breasts because
                of pink elephants?... Nothing
                makes any sense down here.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                                 79.

206   CONTINUED:                                                       206

      Felix pulls out his .9mm.    Gordy doesn't blink an eye.

                                 GORDY
                   Go ahead and shoot me, and you
                   fix the goddamn generator. Part's
                   in the back.

      Beat.   OFF Felix, thinking it all over...


207   INT. BAR - NIGHT                                                 207

      A replay of last night. Felix is pretty wasted.    Berta's
      in his lap again. In Spanish --

                                 FELIX
                   You know I'm your man, baby.

      Someone whistles for a drink. Berta starts to stand.
      Gordy slips her twenty US dollars to stay. She does.

                                 GORDY
                   I have to piss.

      Gordy crosses, exits into the bano.


208   EXT. BAR - BACK - MOMENTS LATER                                  208

      Gordy drops out the bathroom window.


209   EXT./INT. LAND CRUISER - MOMENTS LATER                           209

      Gordy gets the grenade from the tool box. He slides it
      just inside the top of his pants, with the spoon hooked
      over the waistband. He finds some wire. Then searches
      for something else. Finds a piece of string and checks
      its length. From Gordy's reaction, we understand it's
      too short.

      Gordy opens doors and checks seat pockets. Nothing. He
      checks the glove box. No long string there, either. But
      he does find two rubber bands. Gordy studies them a
      moment, thinking. Tests their elasticity. Then pulls
      out the Zippo and thumbs it. The lighter still works.

      As Gordy pockets everything and walks off...


210   EXT. CAGUAN - VARIOUS SHOTS - NIGHT                              210

      Gordy steals through town, hiding when he sees someone
      coming. He's re-tracing the route he took the night
      before, when he followed the Beaten Man's Suburban.

                                                               80.

211   "CINE"                                                         211

      He passes the "Cine" in the storefront. A movie's
      beginning to play on the supervisor's big-screen TV.   The
      place is packed. No one sees Gordy, who moves on.


212   GORDY                                                          212

      continues to make his way through Caguan, when...

      He rounds a corner, and there's a four-man ELC patrol,
      two in a truck and two out. Gordy turns, starts heading
      back, when...

      One of the GUERRILLAS calls to him.

                              GUERRILLA
                Alto!

      Gordy stops. The two standing men walk toward him. The
      other two men get out of the truck to provide backup.

      One guerrilla approaching Gordy stops short and stands
      off, cocked-and-locked, as the other comes up. Gordy
      carefully produces the travel pass. The guerrilla looks
      it over. In butchered Spanish --

                              GORDY
                Yo trabajo con Felix. Felix --
                       (indicates)
                -- la cantina. Con Berta.

      The attractive woman we saw earlier playing with the
      children now walks up holding the hand of a small boy.    A
      guerrilla waves them on. The woman and boy hustle by,
      glancing at the face of this big gringo in trouble as
      they pass. They hurry on toward the nearby "Cine."

      OFF Gordy, as the guerrilla indicates for him to start
      walking to the truck...


213   INT. BAR - NIGHT                                               213

      The guerrilla patrol has taken Gordy to Felix, still
      sitting with Berta in his lap.

                              FELIX
                Are you trying to get us both
                killed?

                              GORDY
                I went for a walk. I figured you
                wanted to be alone with Berta.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                            81.

213   CONTINUED:                                                  213

                                 FELIX
                          (to the guerrillas;
                           in Spanish)
                   I'll make sure he's on a shorter
                   leash.

      The patrol leader looks at Felix hard. Then nods. The
      guerrillas go. Felix dumps Berta onto her feet, stands.
      Felix looks at Gordy, shakes his head.

                                 FELIX
                   Shit...


214   INT. LAND CRUISER - NIGHT                                   214

      Gordy and Felix get in.

                                 FELIX
                   You're working all night,
                   Beckmann. That generator gets
                   fixed, and you're out of my hair
                   in the morning.

      Felix jams the car in drive.

      Gordy looks down, sees the spoon of the grenade exposed.
      As he readjusts his shirt to cover the spoon...


215   EXT. PLANTATION - DIESEL GENERATORS - NIGHT                 215

      Felix is right there supervising for himself as Gordy
      finishes working. Gordy stands. He stares hopefully at
      the MACHINE. Then pushes the starter, and... VRROOM!
      The heat lights in the second row of sheds brighten.

      Gordy turns to Felix.

                                 GORDY
                   That make you happy?

      No response.

                                 GORDY
                   Where's my money?

                                 FELIX
                   You'll get it in the morning.

                                                               82.

216   INT. HACIENDA - STOREROOM - NIGHT                              216

      Felix yanks the dangling cord and turns on the lights.
      The room's a mess. All kinds of rubbish. There's a
      washtub sink. There's a cot.

                              GORDY
                This where Armstrong stays?

                              FELIX
                This is where you stay... A boat
                will take you down river at seven.

      Felix closes the door. We hear a LOCK TURNING. Gordy
      moves to the door and tries it. It's definitely locked.
      Through a small window, he can see the lights in the
      sheds and the ever-vigilant nighttime ELC sentries
      patrolling the grounds. The DIESELS ROAR in the b.g.

      Gordy turns back. Readjusts the grenade digging into his
      belly, then hooks it back inside his pants. He turns off
      the light. Moves to the adobe wall opposite the door.
      THROUGH another small window, he can see it's dark in
      this direction.

      Gordy rummages through the refuse lying around the room.
      We see some rubber tubing. We see some rope. Gordy
      finally finds a piece of sharp metal. He moves to the
      wall with the window. With the DIESELS covering the
      noise, Gordy starts chiseling away at the adobe.


217   EXT. PLANTATION - NIGHT                                        217

      The big-wheeled guerrilla Suburban drives in.


218   INT. STOREROOM                                                 218

      Gordy is making slow progress through the wall, when he
      hears the VEHICLE arrive. He moves to the window by the
      door and looks out. Sees the Suburban. Four guerrillas
      are getting out, including the Beaten Man. Felix meets
      them. The Beaten Man exchanges words with Felix. Felix
      indicates Gordy's room. As the Beaten Man continues to
      question Felix...

      Gordy realizes he's fucked. He can't get through the
      wall fast enough. His eyes go to water dripping from a
      pipe leading to the washtub sink. He moves to it. Finds
      the water pipe underneath that feeds the tap. Cranks
      shut the master valve on the pipe. Wraps his hands
      around the pipe and pulls. Nothing. Jams his feet
      against the wall for leverage and pulls harder... And
      this time, he yanks the pipe free from the sink. He
      finds the rubber hose. Fits an end over the pipe.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                                   83.

218   CONTINUED:                                                         218

      Quickly lashes it on with some wire. Then cranks on the
      master valve. High-pressure water streams from the hose.

      Gordy sneaks a peek out the window. The Beaten Man's
      still questioning Felix. The sound of the hose water is
      being covered by the DIESELS.

      Gordy crosses the room, extending the hose to the hole
      he's made in the wall. He aims the stream at the hole.
      Thumbs the end of the hose to make the water jet even
      harder... And watches the jet begin eating away at the
      old adobe and brick, just as it ate through the crumbling
      plaster in the Spanish Harlem tenement.


219   EXT. PLANTATION                                                    219

      The Beaten Man finishes with Felix. Felix begins leading
      the guerrillas toward the storeroom.


220   INT. STOREROOM                                                     220

      Gordy's made progress, but hasn't broken through yet.
      And he won't, not in enough time. Under his breath --

                                 GORDY
                   Come on, baby... come on, baby...

      And just then...


221   EXT. PLANTATION                                                    221

      WHAM-WHAM-WHAM, one of the DIESELS Gordy repaired suffers
      a spectacularly loud internal breakdown. The heat lights
      dim in a row of sheds. Felix and the guerrillas stop to
      see what's happening. At which point, the generator now
      BURSTS into FLAMES.


222   BACK TO GORDY                                                      222

      He smiles.

                                 GORDY
                   Just in time...

      And we realize that he'd planned on the diversion, as...

      The water jet breaks through.      The hole's still small.
      Gordy begins to widen it.

                                                              84.

223   EXT. PLANTATION                                               223

      Felix, the Beaten Man and the other guerrillas resume
      their march toward the storeroom.

      They reach the storeroom. Water's pouring out under the
      door. Felix unlocks the door and opens it to find...


224   INT. STOREROOM                                                224

      Gordy's gone. The Beaten Man signals two men to go out
      the hole. To the other man --

                              BEATEN MAN
                       (in Spanish)
                Organize the others. Find him.

      The man goes. Outside, we hear him SHOUT orders to the
      guerrillas guarding the plantation. The Beaten Man turns
      to Felix. Felix is terrified. In a pleading tone --

                              FELIX
                       (in Spanish)
                He can't be far. You'll catch --

      BANG! The Beaten Man SHOOTS Felix in the head. Then
      exits. OFF Felix, dead, his blood mixing with the water
      still streaming across the floor...


225   EXT. PLANTATION - MOMENTS LATER                               225

      The guerrillas report to the Beaten Man. They can't find
      Gordy. To the men guarding the plantation --

                              BEATEN MAN
                       (in Spanish)
                Keep looking.

      He signals his men to come with him.   They get into the
      Suburban. Whereupon we FIND...


226   UNDER SUBURBAN                                                226

      Gordy's hanging onto the chassis. With the large tires
      and high ground-clearance, there's just enough room to
      get his legs over the rear axle. He's just finishing
      rigging up a rope he took from the store room -- the
      rope's slung from one side of the chassis to the other,
      to support Gordy's back. He hears the ENGINE START,
      grabs the transfer case, and...

                                                             85.

227   SUBURBAN                                                     227

      ROARS off with Gordy suspended below.

      The rear DRIVE SHAFT WHIRS madly, inches from Gordy's
      face. And, with each bump in the road, even with heavy-
      duty off-road shocks and springs, the undercarriage of
      the Suburban comes within inches of crushing Gordy's
      legs. ROCKS are PINGING everywhere. The dirt and the
      dust are choking. Even for a short distance, it's going
      to be a long, dangerous ride.


228   EXT. SUBURBAN (CAGUAN) - NIGHT                               228

      As the TRUCK BLASTS down back roads and through the
      darkened town...


229   GORDY                                                        229

      continues to suffer underneath. Even with the rope
      supporting him, he has to hold on with two hands.

      A vicious jolt suddenly loosens a grenade. It starts to
      slip free. Gordy can't stop it without letting go. The
      grenade falls, and...

      Gordy shoots out a hand and grabs it. Barely. The spoon
      just hanging on the end of his fingertips. Gordy can't
      use his other hand to get it. He needs the hand to hold
      onto the car. The grenade begins to slip. He's going to
      lose it. And just as it falls...

      Gordy does the only thing left. He slips a finger
      through the loops of the grenade pin. Just barely snags
      the grenade before it drops to the road. And then...

      Carefully, slowly -- praying that each bump doesn't jar
      the grenade off the pin -- with his other arm shaking and
      screaming in pain as he maintains a grip on the transfer
      case -- Gordy eases the grenade back onto his stomach,
      where he gets a better grip. Jams the grenade back.
      Then grabs onto the undercarriage once more, in time to
      relieve the muscle-tearing strain on his arm.


230   ABOVE GORDY'S WORLD                                          230

      the Suburban passes the "Cine."   The movie's over, just
      letting out.

231   EXT. GUERRILLA HOUSE - NIGHT                                 231

      The Suburban pulls up to the well-guarded house Gordy saw
      the night before. The men get out and go inside, leaving
      the SUBURBAN RUNNING, clearly planning to leave again
      right away.

                                                               86.

232   GORDY                                                          232

      carefully lowers himself to the ground. Slides out on
      the side away from the house. Hides behind a large
      wheel. The brightly-lit house is surrounded by coconut
      trees. Gordy watches the guards. When the guards aren't
      looking, he runs to the nearest tree. The sounds of the
      SUBURBAN'S ENGINE covers his footsteps.


233   TREES                                                          233

      Gordy moves from tree to tree when the guards aren't
      looking, when he reaches one tree, and...


234   NEW ANGLE                                                      234

      THUNK!   A coconut hits the ground next to him, and...

      One of the guards comes to investigate.

      The guard gets closer. Gordy inches around the tree. He
      can't get away without being seen. He nudges the coconut
      with his toe. Nudges it harder, causing it slowly to
      roll away, and...

      The guard picks it up. Never sees Gordy in the shadow of
      the tree, pressed against the trunk. The guard shows the
      coconut to a guard near the house, then walks back.


235   GORDY                                                          235

      sneaks to another tree. Then reaches the house. He
      moves to a window. Peers into a room. No one's there.
      But we hear the sound of VOICES. Gordy creeps along the
      wall. Looks into another room, and...


236   INSIDE                                                         236

      is a group of ELC guerrillas, including the Beaten Man,
      packing suitcases, etc. Leaving in a hurry.


237   GORDY                                                          237

      scans the faces. Except for the Beaten Man, no face is
      familiar. A man with his BACK TO us stands, and there's
      nothing familiar about him, either. When...


238   ANOTHER ANGLE                                                  238

      Directly in front of us, another man emerges from a room.
      He's also in ELC guerrilla camo.
                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                             87.

238   CONTINUED:                                                   238

      OFF Gordy, looking intently at the man.


239   FLASHBACK - SURVEILLANCE TAPE                                239

      The face of the cop outside the consulate.


240   MAN (PRESENT)                                                240

      in the room.    His face looms larger as he ADVANCES
      TOWARDS us.


241   FLASHBACK - COP'S FACE                                       241

      when he bumped into Gordy on E. 64th Street.


242   CLOSE ON MAN (PRESENT)                                       242

      in the room.    It's the same face.


243   BACK TO GORDY                                                243

      He's found The Wolf, when...

      Suddenly, a guard appears, and...

      Gordy freezes. Eases into the shadows. His dirty face
      and clothes blend in just enough. The guard moves past.


244   ANOTHER ANGLE                                                244

      When the coast is clear, Gordy moves to the large propane
      tank. He takes out the grenade. Puts the rubber bands
      around it, spoon and all. Grips the grenade in his hand,
      holding the spoon down, and yanks the pin. And then...

      Slowly, slowly, Gordy begins releasing his grip, allowing
      the rubber bands to take on the pressure of the spring-
      loaded spoon. If they'll do it... if the spoon goes now,
      Gordy's going up in the blast.

      Gordy continues to relax his grip. The rubber bands
      stretch. Stretch more. Keep stretching until they're
      barely holding the spoon... but they're holding it.

      Gordy quickly, carefully wires the grenade to the propane
      tank. Then takes out the Zippo, pulls it apart and
      removes the lighter fluid-soaked cotton. Holds the
      cotton just above the grenade and squeezes with his
      fingers. And...
                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                               88.

244   CONTINUED:                                                     244

      Lighter fluid drops onto the rubber bands.    Gordy
      squeezes out as much as he can onto them.

      Then Gordy gets the hell out of there.   He finds cover.
      Ducks down. And waits.


245   CLOSEUP - GRENADE                                              245

      The lighter fluid is dissolving the rubber bands.


246   BACK TO SCENE                                                  246

      Gordy suddenly hears a woman's gentle SINGING.    He looks
      in the direction of the sound, and...

      Gordy sees the attractive Woman and the boy approaching
      on the road. She's singing a gentle song in Spanish.

      Gordy's eyes flash with alarm.   He glances at the house.


247   CLOSEUP - GRENADE                                              247

      The lighter fluid continues dissolving the rubber bands,
      which are now beginning to lose their elasticity and
      stretch from the pressure of the spoon.


248   BACK TO SCENE                                                  248

      Gordy looks back at the Woman and boy, closer now,
      walking toward the house.


249   FLASHBACK - NEW YORK                                           249

      Anne and Matt wave to him across Madison Avenue.


250   BACK TO SCENE (PRESENT)                                        250

      Gordy sees the Woman pull the boy close to her, lovingly.


251   FLASHBACK - NEW YORK                                           251

      The BOMB EXPLODES, and Anne moves to protect Matt.


252   CLOSE ON GORDY (PRESENT)                                       252

      He realizes the horror of what will happen.   And...

      WIDER

      Gordy bursts from his hiding place.

                                    GORDY
                   No!    Stop!   Alto!

      The Woman and Boy look over in alarm, see Gordy running
      toward them and yelling.

                                    GORDY
                   Get back!


253   INSERT - GRENADE                                                 253

      The rubber bands are about to break.

      The Woman sees Gordy.       Screams toward the house --

                                    WOMAN
                   Claudio!!


255   GUARDS                                                           255

      see Gordy running.       They OPEN FIRE.


256   MEN                                                              256

      STOP FIRING.       Gordy's too close to the Woman and Boy now.


258   GORDY                                                            258

      reaches the Woman and Boy now. Pulls them down.       Covers
      them protectively with his body, when...

      KA-BOOM! A gigantic EXPLOSION lights up the night and
      utterly destroys the house.

      rains down for what seems like forever.    Dust fills the
      air.


261   GORDY                                                          261

      opens his eyes. Gets to his hands and knees.     Sees the
      Woman and Boy are safe, when...

      A vicious kick in the ribs lifts Gordy off the ground,
      rolling him away from the Woman and child.

                               THE WOLF
                You bastard!

      The Wolf's alive and unhurt.     Angrily punts Gordy again.

                              THE WOLF
                You think you can kill The Wolf?!

      A boot in the face this time.

                              THE WOLF
                You think you can kill The Wolf?!

      A piece of paper has fallen from one of Gordy's pockets
      and fluttered to the ground nearby. The woman picks it
      up, and we see...

      It's the photo of Anne and Matt.

      The woman stares at the photo a moment, as...

      Gordy absorbs another blow.    He tries to stand.

                              GORDY
                You killed my wife and son --

      Whack! The Wolf slams the butt of an AK-47 against
      Gordy's skull. Gordy drops hard. The Wolf reverses the
      AK. Points it at Gordy's head, about to pull the
      trigger, when...

      The Woman lays a hand on The Wolf's arm.

                               WOMAN
                Claudio.

      The Wolf doesn't take his eyes off Gordy.    The Woman
      squeezes his arm. Implores him --

                               WOMAN
                Claudio.

      The Wolf glances over. Meets her eyes a moment. Sees
      the photo in her hand. Glances up into her eyes again.
      They hold the look. A whole conversation exchanged
      without words. Then The Wolf turns back to Gordy, lying
      in a pile on the ground. Beat. To Gordy --

                                 THE WOLF
                   You were just saved by your
                   guardian angel.


262   INT. UNDERGROUND BUNKER - DAY                                  262

      Dark and dank. Excavated clay walls and floor. Heavy
      door. A bare overhead bulb provides some light.

      Gordy lies on a metal bed frame. One of his legs is
      chained to the bed. He's in pain from being kicked --
      but the physical aches are nothing compared to the
      anguish he feels for having failed.

      The door's unlocked and opens. Daylight streams in from
      above as The Wolf enters with two guerrilla bodyguards.
      He moves to the middle of the room. Looks at Gordy.

                                 THE WOLF
                   One of the men in the jail with
                   you in Mompos is dying. He was
                   burned in your explosion.

      Gordy just looks at him.

      The Wolf signals a bodyguard, who crosses to Gordy and
      frees his leg from the chain.

                                 THE WOLF
                   You want to kill me? Come and
                   kill me.

      The bodyguards are smiling. Gordy hesitates, then
      springs for The Wolf, and...

      The Wolf immediately fells him with a choppy-looking
      karate combination. The Wolf's no Jet Li -- his style's
      a throwback, even ugly, but it's well-practiced and
      brutally effective. Even still, Gordy springs back right
      away... and The Wolf drops him again.

                                 THE WOLF
                   You Americans think you have all
                   the answers. And really, you're
                   so naive...

      Gordy comes up swinging. Gordy's a barroom fighter. If
      he can touch you, you're in trouble. He never gets
      close. A vicious front kick folds him, and a fist drives
      him to the floor. The Wolf stands over him.

                                 THE WOLF
                   ... You see one peasant with a
                   gun, and you never ask why he has
                   to have it. You just run to give
                   your billions to the nearest
                   soldiers, no matter how merciless
                   or corrupt they are.

      The last kick really hurt Gordy.    He's slow rising.

                                 THE WOLF
                   That's why I'm teaching America a
                   lesson... that's why there'll be
                   more bombs... and more families
                   like yours will pay the price.

      The Wolf wants to pique him, but this is pouring gasoline
      onto fire. Gordy explodes off the ground. The
      suddenness and fury of the rush catch The Wolf off guard.
      Gordy drives him backward. Slams him against a wall.
      Then hooks an arm around the back of The Wolf's neck and
      drives the other fist like a piston into his abdomen.
      All his weight behind the punches. Trying to break ribs
      and crush them into The Wolf's heart, when...

      A bodyguard slams the butt of an AK into Gordy's kidneys.
      Gordy takes the blow standing. The guard delivers a
      second, much harder shot, and Gordy drops to his knees in
      agony. Beat. The Wolf recovers from the hammer-blows to
      his midsection. And then...

      He makes Gordy pay for the punches. Lands blow after
      blow on Gordy's face. Beats the living shit out of
      him... and leaves him unconscious on the dirt floor.

      The black becomes a BLUR. The BLUR becomes a hazy
      glimpse of Selena. She's sitting on the metal bed frame
      nursing Gordy's wounds. The CLACKING sound CONTINUES --
      it's made by SEA SHELLS that dangle from a bracelet on
      Selena's wrist. The shells knock together as she washes
      Gordy's wounds.

      Gordy's still in a deep fog from the beating, barely
      there at all.

                                 GORDY
                   ... Who are you?

                                 SELENA
                   My name is Selena.

                                   GORDY
                   ... His wife?

                                   SELENA
                   Yes.


      Beat. The sea shells clack. Gordy loses consciousness
      again, and everything goes...

      This time, when Gordy opens his eyes, there's no
      blurriness. It's a new day. He's better. Selena's
      walking to him with a tray. The SHELL BRACELET CLACKS as
      she approaches.

                                   GORDY
                   Why feed me?    Why not just kill

      Gordy doesn't have an answer.         Beat.    He tastes the meal.

      Selena watches him a moment, troubled by something.

                   The men in jail with you in

                   I'm not one of them.   I'm here for
                   my own reasons.

      Selena watches him another moment. Decides he's telling
      the truth. She reaches into a skirt pocket, then extends
      her hand toward Gordy. He looks up. She's holding the
      photo of Anne and Matt. Beat. Gordy takes the photo.
      Looks at his wife and son. Selena sits next to him.
      Another beat. Then, off the photo...

                                 SELENA
                   Claudio used to be a teacher. I
                   was a medical aid worker. We met
                   in Guatemala, in an Indian village
                   called Guamaunco. We were married
                   there. Sophia, our daughter was
                   born there. Claudio was kind and
                   loving, and we were happy... We
                   were there four years when the
                   civil war broke out... The
                   guerrillas were all around us, but
                   left us alone... Then they made an
                   attack on the army nearby. The
                   next night, soldiers came to our
                   village. They were led by
                   American 'advisors'... They
                   accused us of helping the rebels.
                   Our women were raped. Our men
                   were tortured. Our homes were
                   burned... We crawled out into the
                   fields, but they threw grenades,
                   and Sophia...

      Selena hesitates, choking back her emotions.

                                 SELENA
                   ... my baby girl was hit by
                   shrapnel... she bled to death in
                   Claudio's arms.

      She looks into Gordy's eyes. The look says she
      understands and shares Gordy's pain because she's
      suffered her own painful loss. She looks away again.

                    Claudio joined the guerrillas.
                    When that war ended, we moved to
                    the next war, and the next... Each
                    fight has only deepened his
                    hatred. And poisoned his soul.

       Beat. Selena suddenly stands, uncomfortable, not wanting
       to discuss it. She goes to the door and knocks. OFF
       Gordy, as the door opens, and Selena exits...

                    make for a P.R. problem.

                   I don't care what the Puerto
                   Ricans say.
                          (then, off Updegraf's
                           look)
                   Which part of the word 'war' don't
                   you understand? Our mission down
                   here isn't just about catching The
                   Wolf.

                                 UPDEGRAF
                   ... What about Gordy Pitt?

                                 BRANDT
                   He was told not to be here... The
                   first choppers'll hit it at 2200.


271   EXT. ELC JUNGLE VILLAGE - NIGHT                               271

      It's RAINING buckets. Most of the people inhabiting the
      village have been driven under roofs or indoors.

      Guerrillas drag Gordy roughly up out of the bunker into
      the tropical DOWNPOUR. They march him out into the open.
      Throw him to the ground. A man draws his pistol as Gordy
      gets to his hands and knees. The GUERRILLA puts the
      pistol to Gordy's forehead.

                                 GUERRILLA
                   It's time, gringo.

      Beat.   He extends a bar of soap with his other hand.

                                 GUERRILLA
                   Bath time... You stink, gringo.

      The guerrillas laugh. Gordy throws the soap in the mud.
      Gets to his feet. Points his face up into the soothing
      rain... When he hears ARGUING and looks over to see...


272   WOLF AND SELENA                                               272

      are inside a small house nearby, obviously fighting about
      something. Selena emphasizes her argument by slapping
      her hand. The Wolf storms off, and we hear a DOOR SLAM.
      Selena is left alone, disconsolate, framed in the window.
      She looks up and sees Gordy outside. Her eyes meet his.
      OFF their look...

                                                              99.

273   EXT. CIA HACIENDA - FRONT PORCH - NIGHT                       273

      It's POURING here, too. In b.g., assault preparations
      are underway in spite of the rain. Brandt checks his
      watch. Then lights another butt from the one he just
      smoked. Stares off into the distance, his thoughts
      intense and far away. Updegraf emerges, crosses.

                              UPDEGRAF
                The weather system's intensifying.

                               BRANDT
                        (distracted; beat)
                What?

                              UPDEGRAF
                The storm's gonna be real bad for
                at least twelve hours. Here's the
                data.

      He hands a paper to Brandt. Cops a puff off Brandt's
      cigarette while Brandt reads.

                              UPDEGRAF
                Air ops says it's too heavy for
                the Blackhawks. Also, Sat-Intel
                is saying the clouds're too thick,
                and we're blind.

                              BRANDT
                       (beat; pissed)
                Got any good news?

                              UPDEGRAF
                Yeah. The creeks are rivers
                around Caguan. Unless The Wolf's
                a fish, he's not moving... And
                there's fresh coffee.

                              BRANDT
                Only good thing down here... Put
                everyone on red till tomorrow
                night. And then, I don't care if
                there's a typhoon, I want those
                fucking rotors turning.

      Beat. Updegraf goes. Brandt crumples the fax and
      pitches it. Then sees he got fax ink on his hands. OFF
      Brandt, holding his mitts out in the rain, trying to wash
      off the stains...


274   INT. UNDERGROUND BUNKER - DAY                                 274

      Selena brings Gordy food. She's extremely subdued.
      Leaves the tray and starts back to the door.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                                 100.

      Then stops.     Turns back to Gordy.

                                 SELENA
                   I tried to stop him.

      She holds Gordy's eyes a moment.       Her look is grim,
      haunted.

                                 SELENA
                   He's gone back.

                                 GORDY
                          (beat; realizes)
                   The United States? Another bomb?

                                    SELENA
                   Yes.

                                    GORDY
                   Where?

      She doesn't answer.

                                    GORDY
                   Where?

                                 SELENA
                   ... Washington D.C.

                                 GORDY
                   Where in Washington?

                                 SELENA
                   ... He had pictures of a
                   building...

                                 GORDY
                   Which building?

                                    SELENA
                   I don't know.

                                 GORDY
                   We can't let it happen.

                                    SELENA
                   It's too late.     No one can stop
                   him now.

                                 GORDY
                   We'd never make it.

                                 SELENA
                   I got down here from New York...

      Beat.   She just looks at him, weighing her chances.

                                 GORDY
                   How many more kids have to die?
                   And for what?

                                 SELENA
                   ... I'm his wife...

                                 GORDY
                   If you don't stop it, you're as
                   much to blame as he is.

      Beat.

                                 SELENA
                   I can't.

      She moves to the door and knocks. The door opens.
      Selena's gone. OFF Gordy, sagging...


275   INT. AIRPORT (QUITO, ECUADOR) - DAY                           275

      Passengers are lined up to board a flight to Mexico City.
      FIND a man in line wearing a crisp business suit and tie.
      The clothes, a haircut and horn-rims have made The Wolf
      nearly unrecognizable.


276   EXT. SKY - NIGHT                                              276

      The front's moved through.    The night is clear.


277   EXT. ELC JUNGLE VILLAGE - NIGHT                               277

      Water drips from jungle leaves and the eaves of
      buildings. We see the bustling life of the place, the
      families, the women and children who live with and
      support the well-organized and high-tech guerrilla
      military. The village is simple but decidedly not
      primitive. These people have generators, a satellite
      dish and a school with a computer. At night, the school
      is a TV room. Right now on the tube Daffy's getting his
      beak blown off.


278   SOLDIER                                                       278

      pets his child and kisses his wife as he goes off to
      guard duty.

                                                               102.

279   ELC OFFICER                                                     279

280   MAURO                                                           280

      sits next to Selena on the porch of a house. He plays
      with the shells of her bracelet as she stares off into
      the night.


281   EXT. CIA FINCA - NIGHT                                          281

      The Blackhawks, black and menacing, sit on an illuminated
      tarmac as:

      Heavily armed troops in black uniforms and assault vests
      load up.

      Door gunners check mini-guns.

      Ground crews yank arming ribbons on rocket pods.

      A co-pilot in a specially rigged helmet tests his forward
      mini-gun: wherever he looks, the gun points.

      Pilots finish checklists, and...

      Chopper ENGINES start WHINING. ROTORS begin to TURN.
      The noise mounts to an incredible ROAR.


282   ANGLE - L.O.H.                                                  282

      The small helicopter's rotors are also turning. Brandt
      stands at the chopper door with Updegraf. Slams the
      magazine on a Glock .45, making sure it's in solid, then
      slides the pistol into his shoulder holster. He checks
      his watch. Loud, to Updegraf --

                                 BRANDT
                   It's time to make The Wolf howl.

      He takes a last drag on his cigarette, passes the butt to
      Updegraf to finish and gets in the rear of the L.O.H. as
      Updegraf scoots clear.


283   L.O.H.                                                          283

      THROTTLES UP and SCREAMS away.


284   BLACKHAWKS                                                      284

      one by one in quick succession, lift off the deck and
      follow the L.O.H. into the night sky.

                                                               103.

285   INT. UNDERGROUND BUNKER - NIGHT                                 285

      Gordy's on the bed. The guard lets Selena in. She
      crosses toward the food tray near Gordy... but she's not
      there for the tray. Moves past it to Gordy's leg and, to
      Gordy's surprise, begins unlocking the shackle.

                              SELENA
                We're going with you.

      When Gordy's free --

                              GORDY
                How do we get out?

      She hands Gordy a length of pipe secreted in her dress.

                              SELENA
                The guard is the only one close.
                When we're past him, we can slip
                into the jungle. Mauro's waiting
                for us there.


286   EXT. SKY - HELICOPTERS - NIGHT                                  286

      The Blackhawks and L.O.H. fly map-of-the-earth, a few
      feet over triple-canopy rain forest.


287   INT. L.O.H. - NIGHT                                             287

      Brandt's in the rear seat wearing a headset. The L.O.H.
      PILOT, wearing night-vision goggles, checks his GPS,
      speaks to Brandt via headset --

                              L.O.H. PILOT
                Lead chops are twenty seconds out.


288   INT. UNDERGROUND BUNKER - NIGHT                                 288

      Selena whispers to Gordy at the door.

                              SELENA
                He's on the right... No needless
                killing.

      Gordy moves to the right side of the door. Selena
      knocks. The door swings inward to the left. Selena
      exits with the tray. The guard reaches to close the
      door, and Gordy brings the pipe down hard on his head,
      knocking him out. Gordy retrieves the guard's AK-47.

                                                               104.

289   EXT. ELC JUNGLE VILLAGE - NIGHT                                 289

      Gordy and Selena ascend the bunker steps. They stop at
      the top and peer into the village. An armed guerrilla
      approaches, unaware of their presence. Gordy fumbles
      with the AK-47, looking for the safety switch on the
      strange weapon. Selena reaches over and expertly flicks
      it off. When...

      They hear the sound of the CHOPPERS.

      The guerrilla approaching them stops and looks up.
      And...


290   ANOTHER ANGLE                                                   290

      WHOOM! The first wave of BLACKHAWKS FLASHES OVER the
      village. Selena and Gordy barely have time to duck as
      ROCKETS EXPLODE into ground targets, and front and door
      MINI-GUNS SPIT BULLET-STREAMS that RIP THROUGH people and
      STRUCTURES. And then the first wave's past.


291   GUERRILLAS                                                      291

      In the momentary lull after the first wave, guerrillas
      run to pre-arranged fighting positions. Women and
      children are screaming.


292   SELENA                                                          292

      pulls Gordy from the steps. They start to run. But not
      far. Just seconds after the first wave of Blackhawks has
      left, the second wave hits.


293   BLACKHAWK CO-PILOT'S POV (NIGHT-VISION)                         293

      The village and all its details are visible as different
      shades of green.

      We see rockets streak toward parked guerrilla vehicles.

      We see rockets trail fire toward the TV in the school,
      which is then obliterated in a FIERY EXPLOSION.

      Wherever the co-pilot looks, the forward MINI-GUN aims
      its hellish RAIN OF BULLETS. We TRACK WITH a running
      guerrilla and see him chopped down, then SWIVEL TO a gun
      pit and watch the men there eat lead.


294   GORDY                                                           294

      He sees the burning school. Watches the continuing
      slaughter caused by the ROCKETS and MINI-GUNS.

                                                              105.

295   INT. L.O.H.                                                    295

      Circling over the action. Brandt listens to RADIO
      CHATTER from the Blackhawks. The village is being
      decimated. Brandt's dream come true.


296   GUERRILLA                                                      296

      He LAUNCHES a shoulder-fired SURFACE-TO-AIR-MISSILE (SAM)
      at the L.O.H., just before a MINI-GUN GETS him.


297   INT. L.O.H.                                                    297

      The Pilot sees the SAM launch.

                                 L.O.H. PILOT
                   SAM coming.

      He hits a button, and...


298   EXT. L.O.H.                                                    298

      Two thermite parachute FLARES SHOOT from rocket tubes and
      IGNITE. Immediately after, the L.O.H. banks. And...

      The SAM ZIPS past the hot, bright flares.


299   EXT. ELC JUNGLE VILLAGE                                        299

      The second wave's gone. Gordy and Selena start to run
      again. Buildings burn. The SCREAMING's endless. Gordy
      almost trips over the burned body of a child. And now...


300   THIRD WAVE                                                     300

      BLASTS in over the treetops. These are the Blackhawks
      carrying the assault troops. They use a "skid 'n' git"
      maneuver to insert the men, coming in hot, MINI-GUNS
      BLAZING, barely touching down as the soldiers spill out,
      then tipping forward to gain speed and quick peeling out
      in a hard right turn.

      Gordy and Selena hit the dirt again as the choppers come
      in and land the troops, and the ground BATTLE ERUPTS.

      The assault team's GROUND COMMANDER, an American Army
      Captain, radios his men via comm-link --

                                 GROUND COMMANDER
                   We're going for body count.

                                                                 106.

301   GORDY AND SELENA                                                  301

      There's a break in the fighting nearest them. They jump
      up and start running for the trees edging the compound.


302   SOLDIER ON GROUND'S POV (NIGHT-VISION)                            302

      Gordy and Selena sprout from the ground and run.     The
      SOLDIER OPENS FIRE.


303   BACK TO GORDY AND SELENA                                          303

      BULLETS TWITCH the smoke around them. A SLUG PLUCKS the
      AK from Gordy's hand. They're almost to the trees.


304   SOLDIER ON GROUND'S POV (NIGHT-VISION)                            304

      Gordy and Selena are in his sights.     They'll never make
      the trees. When...

      The Soldier's head WHIPS AROUND TO FACE a guerrilla
      FIRING at him. He KILLS the guerrilla. Then looks back
      at Gordy and Selena, and...

      They're gone.   Into his comm-link --

                              SOLDIER (O.S.)
                Two in the jungle.

                                 GROUND COMMANDER (V.O.)
                Hunt 'em.


305   EXT. JUNGLE                                                       305

      Sounds of GUNFIRE. EXPLOSIONS in the compound flicker
      light through the dense foliage. Selena leads Gordy to
      a bush and pulls back leaves, revealing Mauro, cowering
      fearfully, clutching an old leather doll to his chest.
      Selena takes Mauro's hand, grabs a small pack lying next
      to him, then leads Gordy off through the jungle.


306   SOLDIER'S POV (NIGHT-VISION)                                      306

      He SEARCHES the jungle. Up ahead, Selena, Mauro and
      Gordy are visible for a split second when they run
      through a gap between in the foliage. The Soldier moves
      after them.

                                                                 107.

307   EXT. RIVER                                                        307

      Selena, Mauro and Gordy reach the fast-flowing water.

                                 SELENA
                   We have to swim.

      Gordy spies two empty fuel cans nearby. He gets the
      cans, throws them in. Then picks up Mauro.

                                   GORDY
                   Go!

      Selena jumps in. Gordy and Mauro follow. They swim for
      the fuel cans. Gordy, with Mauro clinging to his neck
      and still clutching the doll, gets an arm over one can.
      Selena just manages to grab the other.


308   SOLDIER'S POV (NIGHT-VISION)                                      308

      He REACHES the river. Sees Gordy, Mauro and Selena
      bobbing downstream hanging onto the cans. OPENS FIRE.


309   EXT. RIVER                                                        309

      BULLETS WHIP the water around Gordy, Mauro and Selena.
      They hide behind the cans. BULLETS PING OFF the METAL.

      They're swept through some rocks, blocking them from the
      Soldier, who FIRES anyway. BULLETS CHIP the STONE.

      There's one more clear shot after the rocks. They're
      almost around a bend. The Soldier aims. BANGS! And...

      Selena's hit.      Gasps.   Gordy looks over, calls.

                                   GORDY
                   You okay?

      Selena endures the pain.      Hides it behind iron eyes.

                                 SELENA
                   Your hired soldiers can't shoot.


310   EXT. ELC JUNGLE VILLAGE                                           310

      The village is a silent, smoking ruin. Everyone who
      lived there is dead. Troops check the faces of the
      bodies of the men against the freeze-frame of The Wolf
      outside the Colombian consulate in New York.

      The L.O.H. lands.     Brandt's met by the Ground Commander.

                                                         (CONTINUED)

                                                              108.

310   CONTINUED:                                                     310

                                 GROUND COMMANDER
                   No sign of The Wolf. Two people,
                   possibly a third, got away.
                   They're in the river.

      Brandt moves back to the L.O.H., gets in.   A moment
      later, the chopper's up and away.


311   EXT. RIVER                                                     311

      Gordy, Mauro and Selena are still floating, hanging onto
      the cans, when they hear the sound of a HELICOPTER.
      Gordy looks, sees the L.O.H. flying downstream ten feet
      off the river.

                                 GORDY
                   Under the water!
                          (to Mauro)
                   Uno, dos, tres...

      He takes a big breath and holds it. Mauro understands
      and does the same. They go under. So does Selena.


312   INT. L.O.H.                                                    312

      The Pilot scans the river with his night-vision goggles.
      Brandt studies the night-vision monitor in front of him.
      There's nothing but river.

      They zoom by the two fuel cans, but see nothing.


313   EXT. RIVER                                                     313

      Gordy, Mauro and Selena surface, gasping for air.


314   INT. L.O.H.                                                    314

      The chopper rounds a bend in the river... And there are
      the two armed guerrilla "customs" boats. The boats open
      up, and the L.O.H. Pilot banks away.


315   EXT. RIVER                                                     315

      The L.O.H. sweeps back in on the customs boats. ROCKETS
      LAUNCH from the pods. One customs BOAT goes up in a
      massive EXPLOSION. The other boat scoots.

                                                                      109.

316   INT. L.O.H.                                                            316

      The Pilot sees the second boat go.

                                    L.O.H. PILOT
                   Not tonight.

      He sweeps in again. Triggers more missiles. We watch
      the second customs boat go the way of the first.

      Brandt only cares about the primary target.

                                 BRANDT
                   They couldn't have made it this
                   far. Go back upstream.

      As the chopper banks...


317   EXT. RIVER                                                             317

      Gordy hears the L.O.H. again.          The three of them duck
      again, and...

      WHOOM! The CHOPPER ZIPS by just overhead. And continues
      on. A moment later, Gordy, Mauro and Selena re-surface.
      OFF them, as the copper recedes upriver...


318   EXT. RIVER - DAWN                                                      318

      Gordy and Selena float side-by-side, still holding onto
      the cans. Mauro's asleep on Gordy's back, his arms
      around Gordy's neck. Weakened by her wound, Selena keeps
      bobbing below the surface. Gordy pulls her up.

                                 GORDY
                   Hang on. We just have to keep
                   floating a little bit more...

      Suddenly, in the growing light, Gordy sees Selena's blood
      in the water and realizes she's wounded.

                                    GORDY
                   You were shot.

                                    SELENA
                   ... I'm okay.

                                 GORDY
                   We gotta get you outta the river.


319   GORDY                                                                  319

      kicks them all to shore.

319   CONTINUED:                                                     319

      He climbs out of the river carrying Mauro. As Gordy
      ascends the bank, Mauro wakes up, terrified. Gordy
      tries to soothe him.

                                  GORDY
                   Esta bien.   Esta bien.

      But Mauro squirms free, and immediately, Mauro runs back
      to his mother. Selena uses sign language to tell him
      everything's okay. OFF Gordy's surprised look --

                                 SELENA
                   He can't hear or speak.

      Gordy just looks at them a moment. Then moves to Selena.
      Re: Mauro, as Gordy examines her arm --

                                 SELENA
                   He's a war orphan. I adopted him.

      Beat.   Gordy finishes checking the bullet wound.

                                   GORDY
                   You're lucky.

      He uses part of his shirt to make a pressure bandage.   As
      he ties it around Selena's arm, she looks around.

                                  SELENA
                   I know where we are. There's a
                   secret trail nearby that leads
                   toward Mompos.

                                   GORDY
                   Can you walk?

                                 SELENA
                   It's just my arm.

      Gordy admires this woman's bravery. Selena stands.
      Mauro's clutching her skirt. Gordy looks at him.

                                 GORDY
                   How do you say 'hello'?

      Selena looks at Gordy a moment. She signs "hello" for
      him, her seashells clacking as she does it.

      Gordy taps Mauro to get his attention. Tries out the sign
      for "hello." The boy just looks at him... then reaches
      out and takes Gordy's hand, shows him the correct way to
      do it. Gordy tries again. Mauro nods "yes" and smiles.
      Gordy smiles back.

                                                               111.

320   EXT. JUNGLE - DAY                                               320

      Selena, Mauro and Gordy follow the secret trail, which
      ends below a large waterfall. Gordy wonders what they do
      now, when Selena keeps walking, suddenly disappears behind
      the ROARING CASCADE. Beat. Gordy follows.


321   BEHIND WATERFALL                                                321

      The trail continues, curtained by the falls. Gordy joins
      Selena and Mauro. Mauro's excited by the experience of
      being inside the waterfall. Gordy holds him, lets him
      touch the sheet of water flowing past.

      They walk to the other side of the waterfall.   Gordy
      follows Selena and Mauro through.


322   EXT. JUNGLE                                                     322

      Gordy emerges from the waterfall, and...

      He's surrounded by Colombian soldiers with guns. More
      soldiers point guns at Selena and Mauro. Gordy raises
      his arms.

                              GORDY
                Yo soy Americano... Gordy Pitt...
                Gordy Pitt...


323   INT./EXT. TAXI (WASHINGTON D.C.) - DAY                          323

324   EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - DAY                                      324

      A Blackhawk lands in the clearing. The Colombian
      soldiers escort Gordy, Selena and Mauro to the chopper.
      The chopper door opens. Brandt's inside.


325   INT. BLACKHAWK - MOMENTS LATER                                  325

      Everyone's aboard and buckled in. Everyone's tired. The
      chopper lifts off. Selena's glaring at Brandt, who
      pushes a headset at her, shouts over the ENGINE WHINE --

                              BRANDT
                F.B.I.'s on the radio.     Tell 'em
                everything you know.

      Gordy's her protector, intervenes.    Grabs Brandt's arm.

                                  GORDY
                   They both get asylum.    And she
                   needs a medic.

                                   BRANDT
                   On the plane.

                                 GORDY
                   What about the asylum?

                                 BRANDT
                          (beat)
                   They'll get it. But she's in my
                   custody till we're done with her.

      Beat. Gordy hates going along with Brandt, but has no
      choice, nods to Selena. She takes the headset. As she
      puts it on, Brandt sees her pack. Takes it and opens it.
      He inspects it, then hands it back. Gordy glares at him.
      Brandt meets his eyes. A long beat. Then --

                                 GORDY
                   He wasn't even there.

      Brandt doesn't reply. Just holds the look a moment
      longer. Then looks out the window and ignores Gordy.


326   INT. UNION STATION (WASHINGTON, D.C.) - DAY (AFTERNOON)         326

      The daily tide of humanity flows through the railway
      terminal. We see people in business suits, tourists,
      families, a group of kids on a field trip. And standing
      in the middle of it all, we FIND...


      CLAUDIO

      Now in casual clothes. He's looking over the beautiful
      and busy station. Contemplating the devastation and

      A Lear stops by a convoy of black government Suburbans
      parked on the tarmac. FBI agents Joe Phipps and Reggie
      Dray are among those waiting by the cars. The Lear's
      door pops, and Gordy, carrying a sleeping Mauro, emerges
      with Selena. Brandt and a medic follow.

      Mauro, still sleeping, is buckled up in the far back
      seat between Gordy and Selena. Phipps, Dray and Brandt
      crowd the second row. Phipps extends photos to Selena.

                                 PHIPPS
                   These buildings best match what
                   you described to us.

      Selena leafs through the photos of various Washington
      monuments, government buildings, etc. She reaches the
      last photo.

                                 SELENA
                   I don't recognize anything... I
                   saw only parts of the building...
                   I'm sorry.

      Phipps wants to keep her positive and willing.

                                  PHIPPS
                   That's okay.   We'll keep trying.

                                   SELENA
                   I think   it's a public place. He
                   said he   wanted the people of
                   America   to feel the terror.
                   'Terror   is all they understand.'
                   He said   it over and over...

                   Put in all the extra undercover we
                   can.

      Selena looks over at her son sleeping in Gordy's arms.
      She lovingly brushes the hair off his forehead, rattling
      her seashells. The leather doll is about to fall from
      Mauro's fingers. Selena takes the doll and puts it into
      her bag. Then looks out at the passing scenery. OFF
      Selena, in the land of her husband's enemy --

      Brandt, Phipps, Dray, Selena and Gordy -- along with the
      rest of the entourage -- walk through the interagency
      nerve center. Gordy carries Mauro, still asleep.

      They stop at the door to a large conference room.
      Selena's ushered in. Gordy starts to follow. Phipps
      stops him.

                                 PHIPPS
                   My people will debrief you in

                   to a safe house across the
                   street... He'll be well cared for.

      Gordy exchanges a look with Selena. Beat. She nods her
      reluctant approval. Gordy hands the boy to an agent.


332   INT./EXT. LOCKUP GARAGE - DAY                                    332

      Claudio opens the door of a cheap rental garage in an old
      commercial strip. He steps inside. There's a rental van
      and a big Ducati motorbike against a wall. Claudio
      straps a black bag onto the bike, then rolls it out and
      shuts the garage. Pulls on helmet and STARTS the BIKE.
      As Claudio speeds into traffic --

      Selena is seated at a table covered with photographs,
      Washington, D.C. coffee table books, guide books, etc.
      Brandt, Phipps, et al stand around her. Phipps flips
      through the pages of a large coffee table book for Selena
      to see.

      A small conference room devoted to everything having to
      do with the interagency interest in The Wolf. Photos of
      evidence, time lines, charts, etc. cover the walls.

      Gordy's tired, being debriefed by two FBI AGENTS.

                                 FBI AGENT #1
                   ... Did Claudio leave with anyone

                                 GORDY
                   I was underground. I couldn't see
                   anything.

                                 FBI AGENT #1
                   Did you hear anything about his

      Security tightens all over the city.    Among the images we
      see:

      A forklift places huge planters -- really decorative
      barricades -- to re-route traffic near vital buildings.

                 ... No...

       He reaches for another book. As he does, he topples a
       stack. Selena's eyes fix on one book cover.

                               SELENA
                 He had that book! Let me see it!

       Phipps hands it to her. It's a guidebook to Washington.
       Selena flips through it. Stops at a photo.


338    CLOSE ON PHOTO                                                       338

340   EXT. UNION STATION - DAY                                       340

      A man sits on a bench. He's wearing sunglasses and a
      baseball cap. He puts a shoulder bag on the bench, takes
      something out, then gets up and walks away, when...

      Suddenly, two tourists and a hot dog vendor are right on
      him. One of 'em jams a concealed gun jammed into his
      ribs, while the other two hustle him forcefully to a van.
      He's shoved inside. His bag's tossed in. The van drives
      away.

      Agents press the man hard to the floorboards. His bag's
      tossed. It's empty. The guy's clean. It's not Claudio.
      OFF the agents, holding an innocent man...

      Selena watches as Phipps plays a surveillance video of
      Union Station. Phipps suddenly freezes the image. Zooms

                 He was there yesterday. Just

                 the dogs haven't found anything,
                 so maybe we're ahead of him.

                 He takes his time. Like he told
                 you, he enjoys it.

      Beat. Selena's overwhelmed by the experience of seeing
      her husband on the tape, by her betrayal of him. She
      grows queasy. Leans on the table for support.

                   him.

      Dray goes. There's a long beat.     Brandt looks at the
      freeze frame.

                                 BRANDT
                   He always hid his face. Why's he
                   giving us a clear picture now?

      Beat.   The bathroom TOILET FLUSHES.   Selena emerges.

                                 PHIPPS
                   Feeling better?

      Phipps nods to Brandt, who turns to two of his agents,
      one a female.

      Gordy's on his feet, looking at The Wolf evidence, etc.,
      on the walls. He can't keep his eyes off it. It's
      reminiscent of what he constructed on his wall at home.
      The second Agent's not in the room.

                   Pitt.

                   I've told you all I know.

                                 FBI AGENT #1
                   We gotta be sure.

      Gordy's eyes go to numbered evidence photo.       It's a
      picture of a seashell. He points to it.

                                  GORDY
                   What's that?

                                 FBI AGENT #1

                   Eleven.

      The Agent refers to an index sheet as the Second Agent
      returns. He's holding a document. To Gordy --

                                 FBI AGENT #2
                   Mr. Pitt, you said Selena told you
                   she had a daughter.

                                 GORDY
                   She was killed in Guatemala.

                                  FBI AGENT #2
                   According to tests on the blood
                   we drew on the plane, Selena's
                   Rhesus F-six. She's genetically
                   barren. She couldn't possibly
                   have had kids.

      Gordy doesn't understand.     Why would she have lied?

      The first Agent finds what he's looking for in the index.

                                 FBI AGENT #1
                   Number eleven, small seashell with
                   a hole in it... That was found in
                   the getaway car used in the
                   bombing in New York.

      OFF Gordy's face...

                                GORDY
                No.


351   FLASHBACK - ELC JUNGLE VILLAGE                                 351

      Selena and Claudio argue inside the house. Selena slaps
      the back of one hand into the palm of the other.


352   FLASHBACK - THE WOLF'S VIDEO TAPE                              352

      Claudio sits on his parked motorcycle. He sees Selena
      emerge. Drops his helmet visor and STARTS the BIKE.

                                                                 121.

      Gordy bursts in, sees Selena's not there.

                              GORDY
                Where's Selena?!

                              PHIPPS
                She went to see her son.

                               GORDY
                She's lying!   She's The Wolf!

      Gordy runs out.   Phipps and others follow.      OFF Brandt...


356   INT. BATHROOM                                                     356

      Brandt bursts in. He searches. Finds Mauro's leather
      doll behind the toilet. The head's detached. Brandt
      looks inside, and...

      We see a block of reddish Semtex plastic explosive and a
      chemical fuse.

                                 BRANDT
                Everybody out!     Clear this floor!

      Gordy jumps downstairs, four steps at a time.


358   INT. CORRIDORS                                                    358

      Institute personnel evacuate offices.


359   EXT. LATIN AMERICAN INSTITUTE - STREET - VARIOUS ANGLES           359

      Selena and the agents cross the street toward the safe
      house.

      Claudio GUNS the BIKE toward them.

      Selena hears the BIKE. Sees Claudio coming. Uses the
      front edge of her hand to strike the female agent hard in
      the throat. The agent falls to her knees trying to suck
      air through a crushed windpipe. Selena whip-kicks the
      other agent to the ground.

      Claudio brakes hard next to Selena, who takes the female
      agent's pistol and spare magazines as...

                                                            122.

360   GORDY                                                        360

      bursts outside, followed by Phipps et al.

      Claudio OPENS FIRE with a MACHINE PISTOL, hitting two
      agents and scattering Gordy, Phipps and the rest. Selena
      SHOOTS the two escort people dead, then BLASTS away at
      the other people pouring out of the institute as she
      straddles the Ducati behind Claudio, and the powerful
      BIKE SCREAMS off down the street.

      Gordy jumps to his feet and runs after them.


361   EXT. BUILDING'S TOP FLOOR                                    361

      BOOM! A MASSIVE EXPLOSION spits flame out of the windows
      of the building's top floor.


362   PEOPLE                                                       362

      dive for cover.   Debris showers the street.


363   GORDY                                                        363

      keeps moving.


364   STREET IN FRONT OF INSTITUTE                                 364

      runs one way in the direction the Ducati's headed. Far
      down the block, the bike turns right onto another one-way
      street.


365   GORDY                                                        365

      spots an alley on his right and turns into it.


366   EXT. ALLEY                                                   366

      Gordy's now moving parallel to Claudio and Selena,
      sprinting hard toward another one-way street, which
      crosses the alley ahead. He doesn't know if he'll
      intercept the bike, but it's his only shot.


367   EXT. STREET                                                  367

      Claudio GUNS the BIKE down the second street, parallel to
      Gordy's alley. He and Selena reach an intersection with
      the one-way street. A right turn will complete the "U"
      and take them back toward Gordy. Straight ahead, the
      street they're on is one-way in the opposite direction.
      Claudio hangs right and cranks on the speed.

                                                               123.

368   EXT. ALLEY                                                      368

      Gordy's almost to the next street. He can hear the WHINE
      of the DUCATI growing closer. When...

      A truck stops ahead of him and blocks the alley.

      Gordy veers into a walkway between buildings.


369   EXT. STREET                                                     369

      A parked   car suddenly pulls out in front of the speeding
      Ducati.    Claudio can't swerve around it. SLAMS ON the
      BRAKES.    The car's driver, frightened and flustered by
      the near   collision, is slow moving out of the way.


370   EXT. TOWN HOUSE - BACK YARD                                     370

      Gordy bursts through a gate. Sees back steps leading to
      the open door of a second-story over a garage and charges
      the steps.


371   EXT. STREET                                                     371

      The driver of the car finally backs up. Claudio aims the
      DUCATI through a narrow gap and ZOOMS on.


372   INT. TOWN HOUSE GARAGE                                          372

      Gordy blows into the second story of the garage, a
      converted old-time carriage barn. He's in the old
      hayloft. On the opposite side of the loft, a double
      door built for loading in hay is open above the street.
      Gordy sprints for the opening, and...


373   EXT. STREET                                                     373

      The Ducati tears around traffic, when...

      Gordy leaps out of the hayloft, launches himself off a
      parked car as the DUCATI SCREAMS past, and...

      He just manages to grab Selena and yank her off the bike.

      Selena's arms are wrapped around Claudio -- when Gordy
      rips her out of the saddle, Claudio goes, too. The three
      of them tumble to the ground as the speeding Ducati
      spins, flips and disintegrates.

                                                              124.

374   CLAUDIO                                                        374

      in leathers and a helmet. He takes the fall better than
      Selena. Gets to his feet. Looks for the guns they
      dropped. Before Claudio can get to a gun, Gordy's on
      him. They grapple. Gordy pounds Claudio hard. Once.
      Twice. When...


375   SELENA                                                         375

      side-kicks Gordy. He sags. She front-kicks a heel into
      his spine and between his shoulder blades. Gordy lets go
      of Claudio and drops. Selena's relentless, kicks Gordy
      repeatedly as...


376   CLAUDIO                                                        376

      gets the pistol. Turns.   Aims the gun two-handed at
      Gordy's head, and BANG!


377   DRAY                                                           377

      SHOOTS Claudio dead from the mouth of the alleyway down
      the block. The first SHOT CRACKS the back of Claudio's
      helmet. The second SHOT punches through and exits his
      visor in a bright red mist of blood.


378   SELENA                                                         378

      bolts.


379   GORDY                                                          379

      goes after her.


380   DRAY                                                           380

      EMPTIES a CLIP at Selena, but he doesn't have a clear
      shot and misses.


381   SELENA                                                         381

      sees a walkway between houses and turns in.


382   SAME SCENE - BEAT LATER                                        382

      Gordy turns in behind her.

                                                             125.

383   EXT. WALKWAY                                                  383

      Selena has ten yards on Gordy, but he's closing. She
      knows she can't outrun him in a straight line. Jukes
      through a gate into...


384   EXT. ANOTHER TOWN HOUSE - BACK YARD                           384

      A shovel lies in the grass. Selena scoops it up and in
      one motion, spins back toward the gate, launches it
      blade-first with all her strength, timing it perfectly,
      as Gordy runs through the gate, and...


385   GORDY                                                         385

      just barely evades the sharp shovel edge headed for his
      face. It doesn't hurt him, but it stops him, and Selena
      breaks toward an open door of the house.


386   INT. TOWN HOUSE - VARIOUS SHOTS                               386

      Selena blasts into the bottom floor, runs through a
      playroom. Gordy's right behind her.


387   SELENA                                                        387

      mounts a stairwell. A girl's descending. Selena grabs a
      pigtail and flings her down the stairs, and...


388   GORDY                                                         388

      gets there just in time to keep the screaming girl from
      falling all the way to the bottom. He sits the uninjured
      girl down and continues on.


389   SELENA                                                        389

      runs toward the living room, which is undergoing a
      renovation. Without stopping, she tears through the
      plastic covering the doorway to seal in dust from the
      rest of the house. She topples what she can into
      Gordy's way. Throws nails down behind her. Grabs a
      circular saw and hurls it back at Gordy, just missing him
      and shattering a large wall mirror.

      Selena's a soldier, taught to pick up and use whatever
      weapons she finds as she moves through a battlefield --
      this battlefield gives her a crowbar, which she keeps as
      she runs out through plastic covering the other doorway.

                                                              126.

390    ARCHWAY                                                       390

       leads into the dining room. Selena runs in. Gordy's
       right on her heels. Selena pulls down dining room chairs
       in front of Gordy. He vaults one but trips over the
       second and falls.


391    SELENA                                                        391

       blows through a swinging door into the kitchen, slamming
       into a Hispanic maid, who's coming to investigate all
       the noise. Both women tumble. Selena gets right back
       on her feet. She breaks out a window with the crowbar
       and exits onto a fire escape as Gordy blasts in from the
       dining room.


392    OMITTED                                                       392

395    EXT. TOWN HOUSE - FIRE ESCAPE                                 395

       The window Selena slipped through easily is small for
       Gordy. He gets hung up on the glass, losing precious
       seconds. Selena's already halfway up when Gordy hits the
       fire escape steps.

       The fire escape ends at a top floor window. Selena
       BREAKS out the GLASS with the crowbar and goes in.


396    INT. TOWN HOUSE - VARIOUS SHOTS                               396

       Selena's in a teenager's bedroom. The teenager's got
       headphones on, oblivious to everything. Selena darts
       through a bathroom into a second bedroom.


396A   GORDY                                                         396A

       enters the first bedroom behind her.


397    WOMAN                                                         397

       IN GARDENING CLOTHES and holding a digging tool stands on
       a stairwell landing, alarmed and confused by the chaos
       she hears in her house. She had started down the stairs
       but now has turned back at the sound of the WINDOW
       BREAKING on the top floor. Calls.

                               WOMAN IN GARDENING CLOTHES
                 What's going on?

                                                              127.

      runs into the hallway at the top of the stairs, above the
      woman.

                               WOMAN IN GARDENING CLOTHES
                Who are you?   What are you doing
                in here?

      sees an open rooftop door at the top of a flight of
      stairs and charges upward without answering.


400   GORDY'S                                                        400

      in the hallway a second later. Meets the Woman In
      Gardening Clothes, who's now come up the stairs. She
      screams. Swipes at him with the digging tool, making
      three deep scratches in his face. Gordy doesn't stop.


401   OMITTED                                                        401


402   EXT. TOWN HOUSE - ROOF/ADJOINING ROOFTOPS                      402

      This is where the woman was gardening, tending a rooftop
      flower bed. Selena emerges, crushes plants as she runs
      to the next town house roof.

      Gordy hits the roof behind her.


403   SELENA                                                         403

      As Selena runs from rooftop to rooftop along the row of
      town houses, we see her warrior determination and
      discipline. She's thinking ahead and she never
      hesitates. Her big problem is she's being pursued by an equally
      well-trained and determined firefighter. And
      he's not far back. One tumble, and he'll catch her.
      Selena strains harder.


404   SELENA                                                         404

      vaults a gap.   Moments later, Gordy vaults it.

405   SELENA                                                         405

      finally runs out of roof. She looks down. A fire escape
      ladder leads down to an interior, ground-level courtyard
      of a small foreign embassy. Still holding the crowbar,
      Selena takes the ladder down.

                                                              128.

405A   MOMENTS LATER                                                 405A

       Gordy reaches the ladder. Selena's ahead of him by a
       floor, hurrying down two rungs at a time. Gordy doesn't
       fuck with the rungs. Just swings over the edge of the
       roof, grabs the side-rails lightly with his hands,
       squeezes the rails with the insides of his boots and lets
       gravity take over.


406    EXT. EMBASSY - COURTYARD                                      406

       The fire escape leads down to a second-story balcony
       running around the inside wall of the courtyard. Twin
       staircases lead from the balcony to ground level, where,
       across the slate-paved car court, a wrought-iron gate
       opens onto the street.

       Gordy hits the balcony a half-second after Selena. He
       grabs her. Selena swings the crowbar to break his arm.
       Gordy has to let go. Selena heads for the stairs leading
       to the ground.


407    GORDY'S                                                       407

       got one chance to intercept Selena. The balcony's too
       high for him to jump, but the courtyard's ringed with
       trees -- they're not close, but they're not far, either.
       Not for a man craving revenge for the deaths of his wife
       and son, a man who also slides down fire poles for a
       living.

       Gordy runs down the balcony. Gains speed. Jumps.
       Launches off the balcony railing. And hurtles himself at
       the trunk of a medium-sized tree. He hits the trunk.
       Hangs on. And slides to the ground. And now...


408    ANOTHER ANGLE                                                 408

       He's between Selena and the only way out.   And there's no
       way she's getting past him.

       But that's not what Selena's thinking. She attacks with
       the crowbar, and Gordy can only retreat in the face of
       the vicious onslaught. He finds a nearby garbage can.
       It's full, heavy, but he manages to lift it, spilling
       garbage as he uses the can to block the blows from the
       crowbar. The CROWBAR THWOCKS into the can over and over,
       the sound ECHOING LOUDLY in the small courtyard.

       Selena swings again, and Gordy moves to block the hit.
       It's a feint. She swings under the can and hits a leg.
       It hurts like hell, he stumbles, but he stays on his
       feet, still holding the can. Selena goes for his head.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                                129.

408   CONTINUED:                                                       408

      Gordy raises the can. Thwock! Thwock! The can's all
      dents. There's garbage everywhere. She feints high and
      then swings low again, a wicked blow to the knee. Gordy
      stumbles badly this time. Selena breaks for the gate.
      Gordy sees her and, with all his might slings the can
      across the slate pavers, and...

      The can takes Selena's legs out from under her. She
      falls hard. Gets back to her feet quickly and starts to
      run, when...

      Gordy hits her like a linebacker. Slams Selena against a
      brick wall. Gets behind her and slips a mighty arm
      around her thin neck. Selena squirms hard, kicks
      backward, going for the balls, kneecaps, insteps, doing
      whatever she can to hurt Gordy and get free. But she's
      not in a position to do a lot of damage -- and she'd have
      to kill him before he'd let go.

      Gordy's got his arm locked in a police chokehold around
      Selena's neck. Uses his weight to force the smaller
      woman down onto her knees. Presses her harder, till
      she's sitting back on her legs. Selena can't drop out of
      the hold, and her legs are immobilized. All she can do
      is scratch. But Gordy's oblivious. They're alone in the
      courtyard. Body to body. Head to head. He's pumped
      with fury and hatred. He tightens the chokehold. Hisses
      in her ear --

                                 GORDY
                   You killed them.

                                 SELENA
                          (beat; with
                           contempt)
                   One woman, one boy -- they mean
                   nothing next to the thousands
                   who've been slain.

      Gordy hears it.    It only drives him to a deeper fury.

                                 GORDY
                   They were my family.

      Gordy's blind with rage. Chokes her neck hard.
      Summoning all the power in him, first to shut off her air
      and blood, and then to continue squeezing, relishing her
      every dying moment, until he's snuffed out the life of
      the person who took Anne and Matt from him. And...

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                                   130.

408   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                   408

      He can't... it's all he's wanted since he saw Anne and
      Matt die, but now he can't do it. He's a firefighter.
      He saves lives. If he kills Selena, Gordy crosses into
      her world, into Brandt's world, into the brutal nightmare
      destroying Colombia and all the places like it, and becomes
      part of that sadness and death... And...

      Gordy relaxes the chokehold enough so she can breathe.
      Selena gasps for air. The impulse to murder has left
      Gordy. There's a new resolve...

                                 GORDY
                   The killing ends here.

      Beat.   Selena pants.

                                 SELENA
                   It will never end.


409   NEW ANGLE                                                           409

      Under which an EMBASSY SECURITY GUARD emerges from the
      building. He sees Gordy and Selena -- a large man
      holding a smaller woman in a chokehold. Draws his gun.

                                   EMBASSY SECURITY GUARD
                   Let her go!

      Gordy looks up at the nervous guard pointing his gun.
      Selena screams.

                                 SELENA
                   Please help me!

                                   EMBASSY SECURITY GUARD
                   Let her go!

                                   GORDY
                   No.    You don't understand.

                                 SELENA
                   He's trying to kill me!

                                 EMBASSY SECURITY GUARD
                   Let her go, or you're dead!

      He's going to shoot. Gordy has no choice.       As he lets
      Selena go and stands --

                                 GORDY
                   Hold us both till the police get
                   here.

                                                               131.

410   ANOTHER ANGLE                                                   410

      It's too late. Selena stomps a heel into the Guard's
      knee, crushing it, then twists the gun from his hands.
      She points it at him and pulls the trigger, and...

      In his agitation, the guard never took the safety off.
      Selena glances quickly at the gun to find the safety.


411   ANOTHER ANGLE                                                   41

      In the same moment, Gordy grabs the crowbar from the
      ground.


412   SELENA                                                          412

      flicks off the safety and points the gun again.


413   GORDY                                                           413

      hurls the crowbar with all his might, and...


414   NEW ANGLE                                                       414

      The GUN FIRES, just as the crowbar hits Selena, spoiling
      her aim. The bullet creases the guard's arm. Selena
      recovers. And the next BULLET...


415   ANOTHER ANGLE                                                   415

      Isn't hers. It's from Phipps' GUN. It takes Selena in
      the middle of the back and explodes her heart on its way
      through her body. She's dead on her feet. Her body
      crumples to the ground and empties its blood in a large
      pool that quickly spreads over the slate.


416   OTHER AGENTS                                                    416

      move in to help the guard as Phipps holsters his pistol.
      He walks to Gordy. The two men share a long, silent
      look. It's over. Gordy looks again at Selena's body in
      its pool of blood. Then turns and goes.


417   BRANDT'S                                                        417

      entering the courtyard as Gordy walks out.   Brandt's seen
      Selena. He's smiling.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                 BRANDT
                   We got the bitch.

      Gordy hits him. One of the jackhammer blows he slammed
      into Claudio in the bunker. A hard fist deep in the gut
      that drives all the wind from Brandt and drops him to his
      knees. Beat. Gordy's voice is cold and hard --

                                 GORDY
                   You're no better than she is.

      And Gordy goes.


418   INT. FIREHOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY                                 418

      Gordy cranks away on the repaired ice cream maker. He's
      wearing civvies. He stops cranking, spoons out a huge
      dollop into a bowl.


419   INT. FIREHOUSE - TRUCK BAY                                     419

      Gordy hands the bowl to Mauro, who's playing in the front
      seat of the pumper. Mauro tastes it. Thumbs up. Gordy
      smiles.

      Mike and the other men on Gordy's old shift are watching.
      To Gordy --

                                 MIKE
                   It'll be good to get you back.

      Gordy turns to them. Looks into the faces of these men,
      the people closest to him in the world. Beat. Then --

                                 GORDY
                   It's good to be home.

      Gordy's still in pain, still missing the wife and son
      he'll never see again. But Gordy's gonna be alright.

      Mauro's gonna be with him. There'll be fires to put out
      and lives to save and basketball games and the multitude
      of miseries and joys the firefighters in Spanish Harlem
      see each and every day.

      As we PULL BACK, OUT and AWAY from the old brick edifice
      from which the big red truck will come, bringing help...


                                                    FADE OUT.

          On the window there are half a dozen beautiful orchid

                          FABIO
           And I love you Don Luis. Like a
           brother.
                         
          He turns to Marco.
                         
                          DON LUIS
           Can you believe this guy Marco?
           We started when we were little...how
           old were we Fabio?
                         
                          FABIO
           Ten.
                         
                          DON LUIS
           Ten year old bastards stealing
           apples from the carts in the market.
           After all we've been through.
           And now we're on top, he wants to
           leave...
                         
                          FABIO
           Luis, I'm going to be honest with
           you. You remember I had that
           operation?
           3.
                         
                          DON LUIS
           That was last year.
                         
                          FABIO
           Since then, I'm not a hundred
           percent. And you can't do this
           thing if you're not a hundred
           percent. I'm tired.
                         
                          DON LUIS
           So you'll take a rest.
                         
                          FABIO
           You know how many times we should
           have been dead?
                         
                          DON LUIS
           I don't even want to count.
                         
                          FABIO
           Neither do I. But you gotta think.
           How lucky we are to still be alive.
                         
                          DON LUIS
           Yeah. That's right. We're alive.
           And what about the future of this
           thing we built?
                         
                          FABIO
           It's yours. It's not my thing any
           more.
                         
                          DON LUIS
           I'm not going to talk you out of
           it, am I cabron?
                         
                          FABIO
           I'll always be there for you Luis.
           Just pick up the phone, I'm there.
                         
                          DON LUIS
           I'm gonna hold you to that. You
           bastard.
                          (EMOTIONAL)
           I'm going to miss you.
                         
                          FABIO
           And I'm going to miss you.
                         
                          DON LUIS
           OK. Enough of this sentimental
           bullshit. Next we'll be crying
           like two old women. Come on! One
           last drink, huh?
                         
          He pours the liquor into the glasses.
                         
                          DON LUIS
           To the future.
           4.
                         
          They tap glasses.
                         
                          FABIO
           Bueno.
                         
          They shoot the liquor down. Fabio rises.
                         
                          DON LUIS
           So. Business is all clear?
                         
                          FABIO
           All clear.
                         
          He hands Don Luis a computer disc.
                         
                          FABIO
           It's all here.
                         
                          DON LUIS
           No other copies?
                         
                          FABIO
           You even have to ask?
                         
                          DON LUIS
           Hey.
                         
          He shrugs. Opens his arms. The two men embrace. Close
          as brothers.
                         
                          FABIO
           Adios Marco. Make sure he doesn't
           get in too much trouble.
                         
                          MARCO
           Adios Don Fabio. I'll do my best.
                         
          And with that, Fabio exits the garden. Don Luis watches
          him, sad to see his friend go. Sighs deeply, pours himself
          a whiskey, downs it, turns to Marco.
                         
                          DON LUIS
           Kill this motherfucker.

          Two men, holding automatics in their laps sit in the back,
          the driver in the front. They see Fabio very contained,
          calm, walking towards them. The driver turns the engine
          on. Fabio slips into the passenger seat. The car takes
          off.
                         
          Fabio explodes. Smashes the dashboard. Over and over.
                         
                          FABIO
           This fucker! The motherfucker!
                         
          He keeps banging the dash.
           5.
                         
                          DRIVER
           Not OK Boss?
                         
                          FABIO
           This bastard thinks I'm an idiot.
           Playing it all mellow and shit.
           If he would have yelled and screamed
           and threatened to kill my whole
           family, it would have been OK. We
           have an hour to get out of here.
           At most.
                         
          Off the nervous looks of the guys in the car...
                         
          EXT. CAT'S HOME - DAY
                         
          Fabio's car comes to a screeching halt. Fabio exits to
          three other gunmen, nervous, on edge. The gunmen from the
          car take defensive positions. Fabio runs up the stairs.
                         
          INT. CAT'S HOME - DAY
                         
          Cat is still at the table drawing, when she hears the
          screeching of tires, the fast footsteps outside. She senses
          a storm coming. Fabio bursts in. His wife sees his tension
          filled face.
                         
                          MOTHER
           Fabio?
                         
                          FABIO
           We've got ten minutes.

           Cataleya, go pack!
                         
                          CAT
           I'm packed Mama.
                         
          Cat is strangely calm, just sits at the table. Watches as
          Fabio takes the family picture off the wall, pries the
          frame back, extracts a small chip hidden inside the frame,
          comes over to Cat.
                         
                          FABIO
           Listen to me my darling. Just in
           case of anything. This...
                         
          He holds the chip up.
                         
                          FABIO
           This is your passport. Do you
           understand?
                         
          She nods. He places the chip in her hand, takes a card
          out of his pocket.

                          FABIO
           You find yourself alone? You go
           to the address on this card. Show
           it to the man at the front gate.

           I don't understand papa.
                         
                          FABIO
           You don't have to understand. You
           just have to listen, and remember.
                         
          As Cat looks at the chip.

          As Fabio's men keep a sharp lookout, two SUV's come rolling
          down the street. Their fingers work the triggers of their
          weapons. The two SUV's roll up. The blacked out windows
          roll down.

          Fabio writes on top of Cat's drawing, rips the page off,
          folds it, puts it in her pocket, removes a medal from around
          his neck, drapes it over hers.
                         
                          FABIO
           And this will keep you safe.
                         
          Cat looks down at the medal.

                          FABIO
           The Cataleya orchid. It comes
           from one place on Earth. Our place.
           My mother, your grandmother, used
           to grow them. Every morning I
           would wake up to the sight of them.
           The smell of them. That's why I
           named you after them. It reminds
           us of who we are.
           7.
                         
          He kisses her on the forehead. His wife appears at the
          doorway with two suitcases.
                         
                          MOTHER

           They said he's not home yet.

           OK. OK.
                         
          He hangs up. Puts his phone back in his pocket. Walks up
          to Fabio's men.
                         
                          MAN

          As they are exiting the house through a rear door, the
          shots ring out. They see another black SUV rushing up the
          street.
                         
                          FABIO
           Back!
                         
          He pushes his family back inside. Fabio runs to the window.
          Sees his men on the losing end of a gun battle. As the
          men fall, and others run up the stairs firing as they
          retreat toward the front door...
                         
                          FABIO
           Too late. Get ready!
                         
          The Mother drops the suitcases and runs to the rear room.
          Fabio comes over to the unnaturally calm Cat.
                         
                          FABIO
           I love you very much.

           I love you too Papa.
                         
          CLOSE ON FABIO'S HAND
                         
          Reaches under the table where Cat is sitting, takes a gun
          strapped there. Next to the gun is a big knife.
                         
          And then footsteps, coming fast outside, draw his attention.

           Alicia!
                         
          His wife runs into the room toting two big assed assault
          rifles. She tosses one to Fabio. Both of them take up
          shooter's positions facing the door.
                         
          ANGLE ON CAT
                         
          Sitting at the table, very still. Watching.
                         
          ANGLE ON HER MOTHER AND FATHER
                         
          Facing the front door, hands gripping their assault rifles,
          sweat dripping down their faces, chests heaving, waiting,
          waiting, to blow anyone who comes through the door to
          kingdom come.
                         
          But they never get the chance because...
                         
          BBBBRRRRAAAAKKKKKK!!!!!!!!
                         
          Machine gun fire shatters the windows on both sides of the
          room, tearing into their bodies before they even get one
          shot off. Tearing the orchid plants there to shred.
                         
          Cat watches in mute disbelief, shocked, as her parents
          bodies are riddled with heavy caliber rounds making them
          twitch and dance like marionettes on wires. Their blood
          splattering across the room, across her.
                         
          And then...
                         
          Silence. Silence so complete it is deafening in it's
          absence of any sound. Cat just sits in her chair.
                         
          And then the door bursts open and four gunmen storm into
          the room, their assault weapons trained on the only living
          thing in the room.
                         
          Cat. Marco enters.
                         
                          MARCO
           You in the kitchen. You, the
           bedroom. You, the back.
                         
          The gunmen scatter. Marco has his inquisitive eye on Cat,
          who does not drop her eyes, impossible to read.
                         
          One of the GUNMAN strides over to Cat, jams a gun to her
          head. Cat does not move a muscle. Does not blink.
                         
          ANGLE ON MARCO
                         
          Examines the frame Fabio dug the chip out of.
                         
          ANGLE ON THE GUNMAN WITH THE GUN TO CAT'S HEAD
                         
          He chambers a round, is about to pull the trigger...
           9.
                         
                          MARCO
           Hey! What are you doing?
                         
          As the other gunmen begin to tear the house apart, looking
          for something, Marco strides over to Cat. The frame in
          his hand.
                         
                          GUNMAN
           Don Luis said kill everyone.
                         
                          MARCO
           He also said no names.
                         
                          GUNMAN
           She won't remember.
                         
          He is about to pull the trigger.
                         
                          MARCO
           HEY!
                         
          The gunman stops.
                         
                          MARCO
           She's a kid.
                         
                          GUNMAN
           So what?
                         
                          MARCO
           What do you mean so what? You
           take a kid, teach them, they have
           value.
                         
          The gunman takes his gun, lifts Cat's lip, looks at her
          teeth.
                         
                          GUNMAN
           I couldn't even get ten bucks for
           her in the street.
                         
          The gunman is about to pull the trigger again.
                         
                          MARCO
           Are you stupid or what? Here.
                         
          Marco hands him some cash.
                         
                          MARCO
           Here's twenty asshole. Go do your
           job.
                         
          Scowling, the gunman joins the others in ripping the house
          apart, looking for something.
                         
          Marco calmly goes to the fridge, takes out two bottles of
          water, cracks the caps, sets one down on front of Cat as
          he sits opposite her. Her hands are in her lap.
           10.
                         
                          MARCO
                          (SOFTLY)
           Remember me Cataleya?
                         
          Cat shakes her head no.
                         
                          MARCO
           I was at your confirmation. My
           name is Marco, and I was a very
           good friend of your father. I see
           he gave you his medal.
                         
          Alluding to the medal around her neck.
                         
                          MARCO
           The Cataleya orchid. His symbol.
           Your name. That's good. This way
           you will always remember him.
                          (BEAT)
           I know this is a terrible thing
           for you to have seen.
                         
          All the while his men are searching, frisking the bodies
          of the dead, even tearing the heels off their shoes.
                         
                          MARCO
           Some things are too complicated
           for a kid to understand. This is
           one of them. But I am going to
           try explain it and make it very
           simple for you. So you understand.
           Now, you know who Don Luis is?
                         
          Cat responds, shakes her head yes. Her hand slips
          imperceptibly under the table.
                         
          CLOSE ON HER HAND
                         
          Touches the handle of the knife taped there.
                         
                          MARCO
           Of course you do. He was your
           father's best friend since they're
           kids. He's like an Uncle to you.
           You know he has always been good
           to your family, don't you?
                         
          Again Cat shakes her head.
                         
                          MARCO
           This house, the food you eat, the
           clothes you wear. Even your school
           fees. All this comes from Don
           Luis. You know that?
                         
          Again Cat shakes her head.
           11.
                         
                          MARCO
           But when someone is good to you
           and you are not good to them back,
           then bad things happen. Things
           like...
                         
          He alludes to the riddled bodies of her dead parents.
                         
                          MARCO
           This.
                         
          Cat looks from the bodies and back to Marco, no emotion in
          her eyes.
                         
                          MARCO
           I know you are a smart girl. You
           do well in school. So I know this
           is not too complicated for you to
           understand. Am I right?
                         
          Cat nods.
                         
                          MARCO
           Good. Now, your father had
           something that belonged to Don
           Luis. A little thing. No bigger
           than...
                         
          He holds up his thumbnail.
                         
                          MARCO
           This. Maybe it was in this.
                         
          He holds up the frame, shows where the chip was dug out of
          the wood.
                         
                          MARCO
           Do you know what I am talking about?
                         
          Cat nods.
                         
          CLOSE ON CAT'S HAND
                         
          Gripping the knife handle.
                         
                          MARCO
           Excellent. Do you know where it
           is?
                         
          Cat nods.
                         
                          MARCO
           Well, if you give it to me, Don
           Luis will be very grateful. And
           very generous. He will make sure
           that you are clothed, fed, and
           sent to the very best school. You
           will have everything you want.

                          MARCO (CONT'D)
           But if you don't give it to him,
           he will be very unhappy. And you
           see what happens when he is not
           happy, yes?
                         
          Cat nods yes.
                         
                          MARCO
           So why don't you just give that
           little thing which belongs to him.
           Will you do that?
                         
          Cat hesitates for a moment, and then removes one hand from
          underneath the table, her fist closed tight. Marco smiles,
          kindly. He holds out his hand.
                         
                          MARCO
           You are a smart girl.
                         
          Marco opens his hand.
                         
                          MARCO
           And in this life, smart girls get
           everything they want. What do you
           want Cat?
                         
          And just as she is about to open her hand...
                         
          CLOSE ON HER OTHER HAND
                         
          Under the table, gripping the handle of the knife taped
          there.
                         
                          MARCO
           Just tell me sweetheart...what do
           you want?
                         
          In a flash, the knife is whipped out and buried into Marco's
          unsuspecting, open palm. Driven with such force, the knife
          pierces through the back of his hand, and sticks into the
          table beneath; pinning his hand. Marco wants to scream
          but there is so much pain, nothing escapes his throat.
                         
                          CAT
           (in his ear)
           To kill Don Luis!
                         
                          MARCO
           AAARRRGGGHHHH!!!!!
                         
          The men searching look up, and before they can react, Cat
          races past them.
                         
                          MARCO
           Get her!
                         
          TRACK WITH CAT
           13.
                         
          As she runs through the rooms of the house, sprints to the
          bathroom where one foot hits the toilet, springing her
          onto the ledge of a very small window. As she looks back,
          she sees the gunmen in hot pursuit. And she jumps, head
          first. Barely squeezing her small frame through the tiny
          window.
                         
          And she drops...
                         
          Six feet down, onto a ledge, that is just beneath the
          window. She flattens against the wall, holding onto the
          medal of her father.
                         
          ON THE BATHROOM
                         
          One of the gunman comes to the window, cannot fit through,
          looks out, does not see anybody across, then hears something
          beneath him, looks down, sees the tip of a shoe below.
          Puts his gun out the window, points it down, and....
                         
          BBBBRRRRAAAAKKKKKKK!!!!!!
                         
          Lets loose with a barrage from his weapon.

          She watches as the bullets split the cement all around her
          feet. Coming inches from ripping into them. And then the
          barrage stops.
                         
          ON THE GUNMAN
                         
          His clip runs out. And as he fumbles to slam another one
          in...
                         
                         ON CAT
                         
          She hears the pause. Looks out over the sprawl of houses
          that stretch up and down the steep hillsides of the favela.
          She looks down at her open palm at the small chip her father
          gave her. Pops the chip in her mouth, swallows, leaps
          over the small divide between her house and the next roof,
          and takes off running.
                         
          ON THE GUNMAN
                         
          Gets the clip to fit, sees Cat heading off across the roof,
          out in the open, exposed, vulnerable. He lifts his gun to
          shoot, when the gun muzzle is slammed up, peppers the
          ceiling with bullets. The gunman turns to Marco, holding
          his bloody rag wrapped hand.

          Cat leaps from one rooftop to another, shinnies down a
          drain pipe onto another roof.

          ANGLE ON THE GUNMEN
                         
          Jumping down from the window of Cat's home, start to sprint
          across the roof in hot pursuit.

          She drops down to another roof, this one filled with a
          vegetable patch, where an old man is gardening.

          Marco exits Cat's house, wrapping his bloody hand tightly
          with a piece of his shirt.

          He orders four more gunmen who have just zoomed up on
          motorcycles. The souped up rice rockets take off in four
          different directions.

          As she comes off the last rooftop, down into a small alley.
          She sprints across to a small door. She kicks at the door,
          which gives way and enters...
                         
          AN OPEN COURTYARD
                         
          Where a half dozen women are doing laundry by an open tap.
          They look up to the sight of this little girl in the blood
          splattered school uniform, do not say a word. And neither
          does Cat. She just runs through to a small gate on the
          far side of the courtyard, opens it, and disappears. One
          of the women casually hangs one of her wet sheets over the
          gate, hiding it.

          They crash through the vegetable garden. The old man deftly
          kicks a rake leaning against the wall. It falls in between
          the rows of tomato vines.
                         
          When the gunmen sprint through, the first one trips over
          the rake, goes crashing through the vines, which causes
          the two men behind him to also trip and fall. The fourth
          man hurdles his fallen cohorts, bounds over the roof.
                         
          And the fifth man, looks at the old man. Knows what he
          has done. Shoots him dead before jumping off the roof.

          They enter the laundry yard. The women don't even look
          up. The gunmen look around, just see laundry hanging from
          the fence, do not see the hidden door. Race back out.

          She runs down a steep alley, filled with people sitting
          outside their homes, chatting, playing dominoes.
                         
          At the end of the alley, two motorcycles appear. The riders
          see Cat, as she sees them. They turn their bikes into the
          alley...
                         
          VRROOOM!
                         
          And bear down on Cat.
                         
          Cat sprints back up the hill. She goes to escape into one
          of the open doors, but she finds that one after another
          the doors have closed shut, the people fled inside.
                         
          The bikes eat up the hill. Cat's legs are no match for
          them. It seems she will be caught any second. She ducks
          down a street where laundry is hung on a concealed metal
          pipe running the length of the alley. As Cat ducks through
          the sheets the gunmen gun their bikes right towards her,
          tear through the sheets...
                         
          AND THE CONCEALED METAL PIPE CATCHES THEM ACROSS THEIR
          THROATS.

          hill.
                         
          AND JUST AS SHE DOES...
                         
          Marco, in an open top jeep, with three of his gunmen ON
          BOARD, comes rolling up the road. He sees Cat.

          Cat comes over the top of a hill, the soot of the chimney,
          mingled with the blood of her parents, staining her dress.
          The doors and windows all along the street are shuttered
          tight. Her eyes search the curb as she makes her way down
          the street. When she hears the sound of a vehicle. She
          looks up to a jeep turning the corner.

           And you say you have something for
           us?
                         
          He turns to Cat, who nods yes.
                         
                          AMERICAN 1
           May I see it?
                         
          Cat takes a beat. Puts her fingers down her throat. And
          throws up all over the man's desk.
                         
                          AMERICAN 1
           Oh jeez...
                         
          Cat reaches into the goop on the desk and comes up with
          the chip. She hands it over to the man behind the desk,
          who takes a handkerchief out and takes it from her,
          gingerly. He looks at the chip, looks at Cat.

           Yes...my passport.
                         
          INT. AIRPLANE - DAY
                         
          Cat watches out the window as the plane's landing gear
          drops and the city of Miami spreads out before her in all
          it's shimmer and glistening glory.

           We are making our final approach

           Please fasten your seat belts.
                         
          She looks down at the medal around her neck. A tear forms
          in her eye. Rolls down her cheek. Impossible to tell if
          it is a tear of joy or sadness.
                         
          INT. JETWAY - DAY
                         
          Cat, with a plastic envelope holding her travel documents
          around her neck, accompanied by an airline rep, walks down
          the jetway toward the entrance to the airport, where a MAN
          is standing. Looking directly at her.
                         
          All the passengers are filing to the left as they leave
          the jetway, but as Cat and her escort approach the man...
                         
                          MAN
           Come with me.
                         
          He walks to the right.
                         
          INT. PRIVATE OFFICE - DAY
                         
          Cat stands in front of a rotund bureaucrat, with the man
          who escorted her, handing over her passport.
                         
                          BUREAUCRAT
           She's the one?

           She is indeed.
                         
          The Bureaucrat looks at her passport. As Cat glimpses
          through the slatted window looking out over the Customs
          floor, where all the other passengers are being processed
          in long lines.
           22.

           You must have done something pretty
           important to get the royal treatment
           little lady.
                         
          Cat says nothing. He stamps her passport.
                         
                          BUREAUCRAT
           Welcome to America.
                         
          Cat looks at him, not sure if this is good news or bad
          news.

          Cat looks out the window of the car at the skyline passing
          by, silent, filled with wonder.
                         
                          MAN
           You like music?
                         
          Cat looks at him, doesn't respond. He turns the radio on.
          A god awful C&W song comes on. Cat looks at him for a
          moment, then reaches over, turns the radio off. Goes back
          to looking out the window.
                         
          EXT. BOARDING SCHOOL - EVENING

          Cat does not respond, she just stares out the window.
                         
                          MAN
           It's been a long day for her.
           Here's the check for the year's
           tuition.
                         
          He hands over a check.

           allowance for the first six months.
                         
          He hands over a wad of bills.

          She places the money in an envelope with Cat's name on it,
          and puts the envelope into a drawer.
                         
                          HEADMISSTRESS

           incidentals.
                         
          She hands a twenty to Cat. Who takes it without saying a
          word.

          Three dozen girls of all ages go about their business.
          Some do homework on their beds, others do their hair, dance,
          run around.
                         
          And suddenly, at the sound of a door opening, they all
          stop and look in the same direction at Cat and the MONITOR
                         
                          MONITOR

           Wake up is at seven. Sweet dreams.
                         
          She exits. All the girls stare at Cat. No one makes a
          move. In the silence, you can hear a pin drop, until...
                         
          The biggest girl in the dorm, a head taller than everyone,
          and twenty pounds heavier, with bully written all over her
          face, saunters down the aisle right towards Cat. Her name
          is...
                         
                          SHERRI
           I'm Sherri. And you are?

           Very tired.
                         
          The girls all around twitter. Sherri looks back at them,
          no good rising on her smirking face.

           Well, 'very tired', I'm sure you
           want to lay down and rest your
           little head?
                         
                          CAT

           There's your bed...
                         
          She points halfway down the aisle to an empty bed. Cat is
          about to walk towards it, when Sherri puts a beefy hand in
          her chest.
                         
                          CAT
           But it's gonna cost you.
                          (BEAT)
           Twenty dollars.
                         
          Cat looks at Sherri. Looks at the other girls all hanging
          on every word, waiting to see what jumps off.
                         
          Cat considers, then reaches into her jumper and extracts
          the twenty dollars the headmisstress gave her. Hands it
          over to Sherri.
                         
                          SHERRI
           A week. Peace has it's price,
           y'know what I'm saying?
                         
          Cat says nothing, just stares at Sherri.
                         
                          SHERRI
           Are we clear on that?
                         
                          CAT
           Twenty dollars a week.
                         
          Sherri opens her sweatshirt to reveal a fanny pack. She
          unzips it, puts Cat's twenty in with a wad of other
          twenties.
                         
                          SHERRI
           We got a smart one!
                         
          The other girls hoot and whistle. Sherri removes her hand
          from Cat's chest.
                         
                          SHERRI
           You can go now.
                          (BEAT)
           In peace.
                         
          Cat still says nothing. She walks up the aisle past all
          the other girls, who remain silent. It is only after Cat
          has laid down on her bed, that the laughing and twittering
          resumes.
           25.
                         
          Cat stares at the ceiling, her hand reaches inside her
          jumper, takes out the medal her father gave her. She holds
          it close in her hand, just lays that way.

          Cat makes her way down the hall. At the end of the Hall
          is a door marked EXIT. But she is not looking at the exit
          she is looking for something else. And she finds it. A
          door marked: HEADMISTRESS.
                         
          Cat tries the door, it is locked. She takes her father's
          medal from around her neck, and uses it to pop the lock.
          Looking left and right to make sure the coast is clear,
          she enters.

          name on it.

          Cat pours the contents of the bottle out into the cloth.
          Seals the bottle. Puts it down. Then takes the cloth and

          find two very interesting things.
                         
          1. A twenty dollar bill on each bed.
                         
          2. Sherri fast asleep, her hands and feet tied to the post
          of the bed with belts, her shirt pulled up, her money belt
          gone. And the word THIEF written in magic marker across
          her stomach. And the drawing of the Cataleya orchid.

                          TICKET AGENT
           Hola chica, where are we wanting
           to go today?

          INT. BUS STATION - DAY
                         
          Cat, barely up to the window, hands the ticket agent the
          piece of paper her father gave her. The woman looks at
          the paper.
                         
                          TICKET AGENT
           Chicago is not next door, you know.
                         
                          CAT
           How much?
                         
          Cat holds up the envelope from the headmistresses office.
                         
          MONTAGE DAY/NIGHT
                         
          The landscape of America passes by through the window of a
          bus. Clutching a new Lara Croft comic, nibbling on a big
          Mac and fries out of a bag, Cat sees...
                         
          The sugar cane harvests in the Florida wetlands.
                         
          Two big fat black women sitting on the porch of a shack
          shelling peas in the deep South.
                         
          The Steel Mills of Pittsburgh fire up.
                         
          The endless expanse of corn and wheat stretching from
          horizon to horizon across Ohio.
           27.
                         
          The giant milk barns of Indiana with their hundreds of
          cows.
                         
          And finally, sees the great city of Chicago looming in the
          distance as the bus hurls down the highway towards it.
                         
          EXT. CHICAGO BUS TERMINAL - NIGHT
                         
          As seedy as any bus terminal. People bustling, people
          hustling. A veritable cauldron of humanity bubbling with
          the good, the bad, the ugly. The predators and the prey.
                         
          Cat exits into this stew of life, looks around, checks
          things out. As she is checked out in turn by some pretty
          sleazy types.
                         
          Cat ignores the eyes following her, walks up to a dwarf
          hawking newspapers. Hands him her slip of paper. He points
          her in a direction.
                         
                         MONTAGE
                         
          Cat walks across the neighborhoods of Chicago.
                         
          Sees the signs in Polish change into signs in Italian, in
          Spanish, Chinese, Ethiopian.
                         
          She hands her paper to an Ethiopian cabbie. He points her
          onward.
                         
          She walks past bars where black gangbangers watch her pass.
          She hands one her paper, he points her on.
                         
          She walks past massive churches, synagogues, mosques.
                         
          She walks past the stately houses of the Gold Coast, along
          the deserted stretches of the glam shops on Michigan Avenue,
          over the bridges...
                         
          Until she comes to...
                         
          EXT. ROUGH NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT
                         
          The denizens of this world look every bit as dangerous as
          they are. Gangbangers, con artists, trouble waiting to
          happen at every turn.
                         
          ANGLE ON CAT
                         
          Cat, walking down the block as the eyes of everyone she
          passes follow her. She stops on a street corner. Seems
          lost. Opposite her a group of men, hanging outside a bar
          see her. The leader of the group calls her over.
                         
                          MAN
           Hey kid. You know what time it
           is?
                         
          Cat shakes her head.
           28.
                         
                          MAN
           It's late, and this is not the
           kind of place a kid should be
           hanging out. What are you doing
           here?
                         
          Cat hands him her paper. He looks at her, suspicious.
                         
                          MAN
           Who are you?
                         
                          CAT
           Cataleya.
                         
          The man takes a moment...
                         
                          MAN
           Wait here.
                         
          He disappears up a small alley into the darkness beyond.
          Cat, not knowing what to do, sits down on the curb, watches
          street life. She sees...
                         
          Hookers soliciting men in passing cars.
                         
          Cops sitting in a patrol car, bored, blase.
                         
          Men playing craps against a wall.
                         
          Some very discreet dope deals, more sleight of hand than
          anything else.
                         
          CLOSE ON A FIST COLLIDING WITH A FACE
                         
          A very bloodied face. Once, twice, three times.

          INT. ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          EMILIO RESTREPO, 35, a hard case, fuck with me at your own
          risk written all over his face, is about to deliver another
          crushing blow to a poor soul strapped to a chair when...
                         
                          MAN
           Emilio.
                         
          The beating stops, Emilio turns.
                         
                          MAN
           There's a girl looking for you.
                         
                          EMILIO
           I'm not interested in a girl right
           now.
                         
          He turns back to the task at hand. Cocks his fist.
           29.
                         
                          MAN
           It's not that sort of thing. She's
           eight.
                         
          Again, Emilio stops. The man hands her Cat's paper.
                         
                          MAN
           Says her name's Cataleya.
                         
          This focuses Emilio's attention.
                         
          EXT. STREET - NIGHT
                         
          Cat is sitting watching the street, when a pair of legs
          appear in front of her. Cat looks up to the man who
          disappeared.
                         
                          MAN
           Come with me.
                         
          He turns abruptly, heads back up the alley.
                         
          EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT
                         
          Cat follows the man through a darkened alley. At intervals,
          on either side, dangerous looking men, armed to the teeth,
          stand in the shadows. The man opens a door, beckons Cat
          to enter.
                         
          INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Cat follows the man as he moves down a long hallway. Cat
          looks into the rooms on either side of the hall as she
          walks along.
                         
          In one room, opening out to a trucking bay, TV sets are
          being unloaded into a big warehouse full of stolen
          merchandise.
                         
          In another room, guns are being serviced. Lots of guns,
          hand guns, assault rifles. Big artillery.
                         
                          MAN
           Hey!
                         
          Cat's attention is drawn away from the room with the guns,
          to the Man holding a door open for her at the very end of
          the hall.
                         
          INT. OFFICE - NIGHT
                         
          Cat enters an office with three women working on computers.
          Looks like any other business office. At the sight of
          Cat, the women get up and exit, closing the door behind
          them. Cat is left alone.
                         
          She looks around the office, when the sound of a door
          opening behind her. She turns to Emilio. Who approaches
          her cautiously, scrutinizing her.
           30.
                         
                          EMILIO
           Cataleya?
                         
          Now it is Cat who hesitates.
                         
                          CAT
           Uncle Emilio?
                         
          Emilio covers his mouth, seems rocked.
                         
                          EMILIO
           Madonna! I thought you were dead!
                         
          He crosses himself.
                         
                          EMILIO
           I thought you were all...
                         
          Cat stands stock still. Emilio takes her up in his arms,
          lifts her, crushes her to his chest. Cat remains suspended,
          emotionless for a moment. And then, for the first time
          emotion, real emotion, washes across her face. Her lower
          lip begins to tremble. Tears well up in her eyes. She
          bursts into tears.
                         
                          EMILIO
           You're safe now.
                         
          All the emotion, the fear, the anger that she has kept
          locked away deep inside, rushes to the surface in one
          massive wave.
                         
                          EMILIO
           You're safe.
                         
          EXT. CHICAGO - MORNING
                         
          The sun peeks over the horizon, spreading the fog infused
          light coming off Lake Michigan across the sleeping city as
          it ascends in the sky.
                         
                         CLOSE ON
                         
          One beam of sunlight slips through the narrow crack between
          a window and the shade covering it.
                         
                         CLOSE ON
                         
          The ray of sunlight washes across Cat's sleeping face.
          She wakes slowly. Her eyes open after a long sleep. For
          a moment she does not remember where she is.
                         
          PULL BACK TO
                         
          INT. BEDROOM - MORNING
                         
          Cat looks around the clean, orderly bedroom as she gathers
          her thoughts. Her eyes move around the room. It is a
          boy's room.
           31.
                         
          With models of soldiers, futuristic warriors, a big poster
          of Al Pacino as Tony Montana in SCARFACE. A poster with
          every imaginable type of assault rifle.
                         
          INT. KITCHEN - MORNING
                         
          Emilio sits reading the financial section of the morning
          paper over what seems to be the remains of a very hearty
          breakfast. An elderly woman, grandmotherly, fills his
          coffee cup.
                         
                          EMILIO
           Gracias mama.
                         
          A noise turns both of them to the doorway and Cat.
                         
                          EMILIO
           Good morning.
                         
                          MAMA
           Buenos diaz Cara. Come. Sit.
           I'll make you some eggs.
                         
          Mama caresses her face, her eyes glisten with a
          grandmother's love. Kisses her on the forehead, lovingly,
          whispers into her ear.
                         
                          MAMA
           You have your mother's beautiful
           eyes. Don't be scared. This is
           your home.
                         
          Slowly, hesitantly, Cat makes her way across the kitchen
          to the table, where she sits opposite Emilio, tentative.
                         
                          EMILIO
           When was the last time you slept?
                         
                          CAT
           I don't know. A long time ago.
                         
                          EMILIO
           Well good. A growing body needs
           sleep. When I was your age I would
           sleep half the day. I don't know
           if it helped with the growing, but
           I was well rested for whatever
           came after.
                         
                          CAT
           Whose room is that?
                         
                          EMILIO
           My son. Your cousin.
                         
                          CAT
           Where is he?
           32.
                         
                          EMILIO
           He's dead.

          She keeps shoveling food in her mouth. Emilio looks up at
          his mother, who crosses herself. Cat finishes the last
          mouthful, looks up.

           do it myself.
                         
          She walks off. Emilio grabs her.

           Chica. Any idiot can be a killer.
           Look!
                         
          Emilio draws a .357 magnum pistol from his shoulder holster,
          and empties the entire clip into the front of a car coming
          down the street. The car careens off the road, smashes a
          fire hydrant, crashes through a plate glass window of a
          shop across the street. The water from the hydrant shoot
          twenty feet in the air. Emilio holsters his gun.

           If you want to be a killer, and
           survive, you have to be a smart
           one. You have to know things
           besides how to pull a trigger.
           You have to know how the world
           works. How people think. You got
           to learn to be psychological.
           That I cannot teach you, unless
           you learn the basics at school.
           Got it?
                         
          Cat glares at him.
                         
                          EMILIO
           Now what's it going to be?
                         
          He holds out the gun in one hand, and the schoolbag in the
          other. Cat hesitates for a moment. Takes the schoolbag
          from Emilio. Then takes his hand, and they walk off
          together as police sirens announce the arrival of cruisers,
          and people pour out of the school and the surrounding
          stores. As they put distance between the chaos and
          themselves.

          falls out, clinks to the sidewalk. And a moment later,
          two legs emerge from the car. Two very long, very shapely
          legs. Legs that never end. In very high heels, and a
          very short mini skirt. And the face on top of it, framed
          by a mane of wild hair, is drop dead think-you-have-died-
          and-gone-to-heaven gorgeous. The whole package reads
          SUPERMODEL. And by the way she is weaving when she stands,
          and the bottle at her feet, the read is; very drunk
          supermodel. Who looks at the crumpled police cruiser,
          looks into the windshield of the cruiser at the stunned
          cops, and says in the most sweetly drunk voice...

          look at each other, perplexed. And she keeps laughing.

          And even when they slam her to the hood of the car, jam
          her hands behind her back, and slap the cuffs on, she keeps
          laughing, and laughing.

          A quiet night in the small station. Cat stands in front
          of the booking desk, so drunk the two cops have to hold
          her up. A surveillance camera over the desk innocuously
          records everything. Cat keeps her head down, her face,
          obscured by her mane of hair.

          whose eyes go to her very short skirt.
                         
                          SERGEANT
           That's not a crime.
                         
                          CAT
           Thank goodness.
                         
          And she teeters over, passes out cold right on the
          Sergeant's desk.
                         
                          SERGEANT
           Take her in the back, lock her up,
           put a cup of coffee in with her.
           Let her sleep it off, we'll book
           her tomorrow.
                         
          The two cops who booked her drag her out. As they do, the
          Sergeant and the two other cops on duty lean over to try
          and get a look up her very long legs and her very short
          skirt.
                         
          EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT
                         
          Three black SUV's, with blacked out windows, come rolling
          up to the station. The doors open and a dozen U.S. MARSHALS
          jump out. Vigilant, forming a cordon around one of the
          vehicles, out of which comes a hand cuffed, kevlar wearing
          hard as nails MAFIA type. GENNARO RIZZO.
                         
          The Marshal's surround him, guns bristling, on the look
          out for any danger, and hustle him towards the doors of
          the police station.
                         
          INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT
                         
          The station doors slam open. Marshal's barge in. The
          HEAD MARSHAL approaches the surprised Sergeant on the desk,
          flashes his credentials.
                         
                          MARSHAL
           US Marshal Warren. We have Gennaro
           Rizzo here on an overnight.
                         
                          SERGEANT
           Who?
                         
                          MARSHAL
           Rizzo. The Mafia guy? On the way
           to testify up in San Francisco
           tomorrow? They didn't notify you?
                         
                          SERGEANT
           Hold on a second.
                         
          He rifles through some papers. Finds one.
           39.
                         
                          SERGEANT
           Here we go. Says here you're not
           expected until tomorrow.
                         
                          MARSHAL
           Never expect the expected Sergeant.
           (to his men)
           Secure this place.
                         
          INT. CELL BLOCK - NIGHT
                         
          The Marshals come down the cell block, checking everything
          out. They pass Cat in her cell, passed out cold, her long
          legs and short skirt slows their progress a bit. After a
          long look, they move on.
                         
          INT. SECURE CELL - NIGHT
                         
          Rizzo is pushed into a cell. The door is slammed and
          locked.
                         
                          MARSHAL
           One man here. Two more outside the
           front door. Everyone else on the
           perimeter, in teams of two.
                         
          He hands out thermos bottles.
                         
                          MARSHAL
           It's a caffeine kinda night fellas.
           Eyes open.
                         
          INT. CELL BLOCK - NIGHT
                         
          A lone cop passes Cat's cell, doing the nightly rounds.
          As soon as he is gone...
                         
                         ON CAT
                         
          Cat's eyes snap open. She sits up, moves with the
          efficiency and determination of someone who has not has a
          drop of alcohol. She takes a spoon from the coffee cup
          left for her, reaches into her mane of hair and extracts a
          small pin. She inserts the pin into the keyhole of the
          door, jiggles it. The door pops open.
                         
          Cat exits the cell, takes a broom leaning in the corner,
          and keeping her eye on the camera above the door, she slides
          along the wall, until she is just under the camera. She
          uses the broom handle to tilt the camera up just a bit.
                         
          INT. SECURITY MONITORING ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          One lone cop sits in front of the various monitors. He
          does not notice that one tilts slightly up, points toward
          a blank wall.
           40.
                         
          INT. CELL BLOCK - NIGHT
                         
          Cat, under the camera, unlocks the second door, slips out.
                         
          INT. HALL - NIGHT
                         
          Cat comes into the hall where several vending machines
          lean against the wall. On the far side is a door marked:
          ELECTRICAL. She is about to head for it, when she hears a
          door open at the far end of the hall.
                         
          ANGLE ON THE DOOR
                         
          At the far end of the hall. A cop comes in, looks down
          the hall. Where Cat was standing he sees only the vending
          machines. He heads right for the machines. Puts coins in
          the machine, waits for his food.
                         
          ANGLE ON THE SIDE OF THE MACHINE
                         
          Where Cat is pressed hard against the flat surface, inches
          from the cop.
                         
          The sandwich falls, the cop retrieves it, moves off, exits
          down the hall. Cat waits until she hears the door shut on
          the far end of the wall. She crosses quickly to the door
          across the way, enters.
                         
          CLOSE ON A UTILITY BOX PULLED OPEN

          INT. ELECTRICAL ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Cat stands on a narrow shelf, undoes the last screws on a
          vent in the ceiling with a screwdriver from the tool board
          on one wall.
                         
          Cat drops down, opens the electrical control panel on the
          wall, studies it for a moment, finds the switch she is
          looking for, then turns to the wall of tools, plucks some
          wire, a cutter, a spring.
                         
          Cat sets to work on a jury rigged mechanism with the items
          at hand. When she is finished, she tugs at the waist band
          of her mini skirt, and little by little she stretches a
          thin dun colored leotard suit over her whole body. She
          takes a small plastic vial, fills it with some water from
          the tap, and sets it, just so, above the device she has
          constructed.
                         
          The device is hooked to the switch she selected, a small
          weight hangs from the bottom of it by a wire. She sets
          the water container just so over the spoon from her cell.
          The water begins to drip a drop at a time. She closes the
          panel door, sets her digital watch. Hoists herself up to
          the vent in the ceiling, and is gone.

          INT. AIR DUCTS - NIGHT
                         
          Once inside the grate, Cat takes one of the buttons off
          her blouse and presses the top of it. The button becomes
          a pin light, which she clasps between her teeth, starts to
          crawl on her stomach, pulling herself along by her elbows
          and her wriggling hips and knees, the light still between
          her teeth.
                         
          TRACK WITH CAT
                         
          As she moves through the maze of ducts. On the way, she
          peers through the grates in each ceiling, down into one
          cell after another, catching various views of inmates asleep
          as she passes over them. Until she comes to a ventilation
          fan blocking the way. The fan blades go round and round.
          Cat looks at her watch, looks at the fan.
                         
          CLOSE ON THE ELECTRICAL PANEL
                         
          And Cat's jury rigged device. The water has almost filled
          the spoon, one more drop, one more drop.
                         
          CLOSE ON CAT LOOKING AT HER WATCH

          The last drop of water drips into the spoon, the spoon
          tips, tugging on the wire, the wire trips the switch it is
          connected to, the whole device comes apart, the separate
          pieces fall to the floor.

          The fan stops. The blades slow.
                         
          INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT
                         
          The sergeant at the desk hears the ventilation system go
          off.
                         
                          SERGEANT
           Hey Doyle!
                         
          He calls to one of the other cops on duty.
                         
                          SERGEANT
           Go take a look at the breaker on
           the ventilation system, will ya?
                         
          Doyle moves off.

          INT. AIR DUCTS - NIGHT
                         
          Cat watches the blades of the vent fan slow. When they
          have completely stopped she starts to move herself through
          the very narrow space between the now stilled blades, feet
          first.
                         
          INT. ELECTRICAL ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Doyle enters the room, opens the electrical panel. The
          spoon, the weight, the spring, and the wire, fall to the
          floor. Doyle looks at them curiously for a moment.
                         
          INT. AIR DUCTS - NIGHT

          INT. ELECTRICAL ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Doyle looks at the switches, going down the printed list
          on the door, trying to locate the right one.
                         
          INT. AIR DUCTS - NIGHT

          Cat is just through, when the blades start moving, brush
          against her forehead, as she makes it to the other side
          with no time, and no room to spare.

          his coffee. Looks at Rizzo.
           43.
                         
          Then walks over to the door at the end of the wall. He
          hits a buzzer on the wall.

          Right into a devastating reverse wheel kick.
                         
          INT. SECURITY MONITORING ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          The cop on duty hears a buzz, looks up to the bank of
          monitors, and sees the Marshal standing at the door.
          Thinking nothing of it, he hits the buzzer.

          Cat, propping the unconscious Marshal up, hides behind
          him. As the door buzzes, she maneuvers the body around,
          pushes through. On the other side, she drops the body,
          and takes his gun.

          Rizzo is half asleep, when the barrel of a gun taps him on
          the head. He opens his eyes slowly to...
                         
                          CAT
           Unbutton your shirt.

          Rizzo looks over to where the Marshal is passed out cold
          on the floor. He does as he is told.

          Cat hears the door begin to open. She bangs her high heels
          together. And two blades come out of the front. She sees
          the door knob turning. She runs for the roof's edge.

          When one hand has a firm grasp on the roof ledge, she lets
          go with the other hand and grasps the ledge, extracts the
          blades from the brick seams, and swings herself up on the
          roof. As her shoes dislodge, some mortar comes loose and
          falls below.

          Cat's. As they reach Cat's, the same cop who did the rounds
          at the beginning of the night looks into her cell. Cat is
          laying on her side, away from them, dead asleep, in the
          same position she was when the cop first checked on her.

          Keeping her back to the security camera overhead, Cat
          collects her things and exits. As the door closes...
           50.
                         
          A DOOR TO AN SUV OPENS...
                         
          EXT. POLICE STATION - MORNING
                         
          Ross exits the SUV to the crowd of reporters.
                         
                          REPORTERS
           Is it Rizzo? Was it an
           assassination? Are there any clues?
           Is it true a Marshal did it?
                         
                          ROSS
           No comment.
                         
          Ross sees cops coming and going from the station. He turns
          to the Marshal with him.
                         
                          ROSS
           You didn't lock it down?
                         
                          MARSHAL
           It was after the fact. I didn't
           think...
                         
          Ross cannot believe what he is hearing.
                         
                          ROSS
           Do it. Now. No one in or out.
                         
          ANGLE ON CAT
                         
          Exiting the station. Ross and his team sweep past her.
                         
                          MARSHAL
           OK! That's it. No one in or out!
           Lock down!
                         
          Cat just keeps walking, right past Ross, who heads into
          the station as the cops try to keep the reporters at bay.
                         
          ANGLE ON CAT
                         
          Walking away from the pandemonium she is leaving behind.
          As it recedes over her shoulder, she picks at her fingers
          where the fingerprinting ink has stained them. Her prints
          come off! She drops the fake prints down a sewer and keeps
          walking.
                         
          INT. PROTECTIVE CUSTODY - MORNING
                         
          Ross scrutinizes Rizzo's cell as his team takes prints,
          photos, sweeps the cell for evidence.
                         
                          ROSS
           I want to see paper on everyone in
           and out of the station in the last
           twenty four hours.
                         
          He looks up to the end of the hall.
           51.
                         
                          ROSS
           And I want the tapes from the

          woman's bathroom.
                         
          INT. BATHROOM STALL - DAY
                         
          Cat tugs at her hair. The wild mane comes off to reveal
          her straight hair, which she pulls back in a pony tail.
          She begins to strip out of her mini skirt.
                         
          INT. BUS STATION - DAY
                         
          Cat dressed in jeans, a scuffed leather jacket, a baseball
          cap, with the brim pulled low over her eyes, with her pony
          tail sticking out of the back, the knap sack on her
          shoulder, waits on line to board the bus. She keeps her
          back to the security camera, has her phone to her ear. A
          number is ringing.
                         
          INT. EMILIO'S HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Emilio, fifteen years older, is watching a soccer game,
          picks up the phone. In the kitchen, Mama is cooking.
                         
                          EMILIO

                          CAT
           We're good.

           Say hello to Mama.
                         
          He looks over to Mama at the stove, who waves over her
          shoulder.
                         
                          EMILIO
           Mama says hello back.
                         
          He hangs up, goes back to his game.

          Cat boards the bus. The doors close behind her.
                         
          As the camera ZOOMS up, and the bus pulls out onto the
          road...
                         
           ROSS V.O.
           See?
                         
          INT. POLICE STATION - DAY
                         
          Ross is pointing up at the camera Cat tilted.
                         
                          ROSS
           He tilted the camera just enough
           so the angle would catch the guard,
           not who was holding him.
                         
          He turns to his team.
                         
                          ROSS
           Twenty two murders in four years
           all with the same M.O. The word,
           the flower. He's sending a message,
           for sure. And I'm beginning to
           think it's not to us.

                          ROSS
           And we're not getting anywhere
           with it, are we?
                         
          No one on the team can dispute this. It occurs to Ross...
                         
                          ROSS
           If the message is not for us, let's
           make sure the one it's intended
           for gets it. I want you to put it
           out to the press. Splash it across
           every newspaper, every magazine.

          EXT. UPSCALE RESIDENTIAL NEW ORLEANS NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY
                         
          A Lincoln town car comes down the leafy, quiet street of
          well kept homes. Stops at a gate guarded by two men, who
          wave him through.
                         
          EXT. DON LUIS'S MANSION - DAY
                         
          The car ends up in front of a very impressive house, which
          sits at the end of a long driveway. Toward the era of the
          walled property, a garage, and a guest house. MR. RICHARD,
          in a suit and tie, looking like a proper mid level
          government official, or a lawyer, exits, newspaper in hand.
          As he approaches the front door, Richard looks over to see
          two more guards, off to the side. He nods to them, knows
          them. They nod back.
                         
          Richard approaches the front door, knocks. While he is
          waiting, he looks down at the paper.
                         
          The door opens.
                         
                          MARCO
           Mr. Richard...
                         
          Richard looks up to a fifteen year older Marco.
                         
                          MARCO
           Been a long time.
                         
                          RICHARD
           Yes it has Marco. How's the hand?
                         
          Marco holds up his scarred hand.
                         
                          MARCO
           Only hurts when it's humid.
                         
                          RICHARD
           Should've let us relocate you to
           Arizona instead of New Orleans.
                         
                          MARCO
           The Boss likes it humid.
                         
                          RICHARD
           There it is then.
                         
                          MARCO
           He's waiting for you.
                         
          Richard enters. The door closes.

          Don Luis turns.

           Hello Mr. Richard.
                         
                          RICHARD
           I brought you the morning paper.
                         
          He holds the paper up.

           I've seen it.
                         
                          RICHARD
           And...?
                         
                          DON LUIS
           Coincidence.
                         
                          RICHARD
           Coincidence? Twenty two times? A
           flower that only grows in one place
           on earth? That used to be the
           calling card of...what was his
           name? Your former partner? The
           one who did your wet work?
                         
                          DON LUIS
           Fabio. Fabio Maria Restrepo. But
           I don't understand? Why come here
           with this?
                         
                          RICHARD
           Because when we find the end of a
           string we like to know where it
           begins.
                         
                          DON LUIS
           String? Now we are talking about
           string? I'm not a tailor.
                         
                          RICHARD
           Don Luis. Let's cut to the chase
           here, OK? When the Agency extracted
           your ass from Colombia fifteen
           years ago, and set you up here, we
           let you resume your business when
           what we should have done was lock
           you up for life. In exchange, you
           were supposed to keep the
           information flowing.
                         
                          DON LUIS
           And I have.

                          RICHARD
           Not much, and not for a very long
           time.
                         
                          DON LUIS
           And this is what you traveled all
           the way down here to tell me?
                         
                          RICHARD
           No. What I traveled all the way
           down here to tell you, is there's
           a limit to our patience. The CIA
           is not an amusement park. There
           are no free rides. Everyone pays
           their way. And you, my friend,
           have not.
                         
                          DON LUIS
           OK OK. What would you want?
                         
          He slaps the newspaper down with the picture of Rizzo.
                         
                          DON LUIS
           I had nothing to do with this. I
           swear.
                         
                          RICHARD
           Then find out who does.
                         
          As he goes to leave.
                         
                          RICHARD
           And Don Luis, don't play the
           innocent with us. It won't sit
           well with my bosses if we find out
           you had anything to do with this.
           Have a good day.
                         
          Richard exits.

                          MARCO
           It could be anyone.

          Cat steps off the bus. Looks around to...
                         
          EXT. CHICAGO BUS STATION - DAY
                         
          The total full on crush of people that a major metropolitan
          bus terminal holds. She sees a surveillance camera tucked
          in a corner. She pulls the brim of her hat low over her
          eyes, takes off into the crowd.
                         
          EXT. CHICAGO STREET - DAY

          INT. CAT'S APARTMENT - DAY
                         
          Cat enters a completely bare bones dwelling, there is
          nothing that identifies the person who lives here. White
          bare walls, a table with one chair, a single bed. Along
          one wall, a cabinet. On the window sill a single Cataleya
          orchid. Cat waters the orchid.
                         
          Cat opens the cabinet to three computer screens. Two of
          them are divided into quarters and show various views of
          the building entrance, the lobby, the stairway, the
          elevator, the hallway.
                         
          The third screen is dark, until Cat hits a button and music
          fills the apartment. Music with a heavy sensual back beat.
          French Rap. Ooh la la. And the screen pulses and glows
          in time to the beat. Cat's body responds to the music,
          moving sexy, her shoulders rolling, her hips swaying.
                         
                         IN CUTS
                         
          Cat sashays across the open space, a stripper strutting
          her stuff; shedding, first her blouse, then her jeans, her
          lingerie, until, by the time she reaches a free standing
          opaque cylinder of a shower with an opaque shower curtain,
          she is completely nude. She enters the shower. Turns on
          the water.
                         
          Like a snake shedding a skin, she lets the water divest
          her of everything that came before.

          The cover features WILLIAM WOOGARD, 45, the most unassuming,
          baldheaded, pudgy faced man, a nerd. Under the headline:

           He disappeared fifty billion
           dollars. The money was never
           recovered. Skipped out and bought
           himself citizenship on some shit
           hole of a Caribbean island that
           calls itself a country with no

          Cat smiles. A smile that could melt ice in winter. But a
          knowing smile. A 'Don't bullshit a bullshitter' smile.

          The truth of her words deprive him of his. She kisses him
          him on the forehead.

          A ramshackle warehouse, it's windows streaked opaque with
          years of dust and grime, surrounded by a fence, and a weedy
          garden which is home to dozens of the most unique wind
          chimes of all sizes and shapes, made from scrap metal.
          And two of the biggest, most ferocious dogs on Earth, laying
          on their sides, asleep.
                         
          The dog's ears perk up; hearing something we don't, a low
          growl begins to rumble deep in their throats. The gate to
          the garden begins to open, and like a shot the dogs are
          up, hurling themselves toward the opening gate, eyes
          flashing, barking loud enough to scare the dead back to
          life, fangs bared, ready to kill.
                         
          And then they stop cold when they see who it is coming
          into their domain.

          She picks up the shopping bags, and heads for the ramshackle
          warehouse. The dogs moan, but do not move, their eyes
          going from the meat to Cat.
                         
          Cat reaches the door. Turns. Sees the dogs looking at
          her.

          the meat with ferocious, pent up glee. Cat smiles at the
          sight, enters the warehouse.

          EXT. CARIBBEAN ISLAND - DAY
                         
          From the air, surrounded by the bluest of waters. Bestowed
          with the greenest of verdant foliage. Surrounded by
          exquisite beaches.
                         
          A spray of water fills the screen. Comes from...
                         
          THREE OF THE HOTTEST NYMPHETTES IN THE SMALLEST BIKINIS
          SPLASHING AROUND A SWIMMING POOL HAVING THE BEST TIME

           GRRRAAAHHHH!!!!
                         
          PULL BACK TO
                         
          EXT. COMPOUND - DAY
                         
          An exquisite villa surrounded by a high wall. As the girls
          clamber out of the pool, ignoring the four armed body guards
          patrolling poolside, they are met by three maids holding
          robes for them to slip into.
                         
                          WILLIAM
                          (SMILING)
           Hey! I pay to see more, not less.
                         
          The robes disappear.
                         
                          WILLIAM
           That's better.
                         
                          GIRL
           Willie you are such a perv.
                         
                          WILLIAM
           I know. Anyone hungry?
                         
                          GIRL
           Always!
                         
          As William slips into a robe held open for him, he grabs
          the asses of two of the girls...
                         
                          WILLIAM
           Lunch is served.
                         
          Giggling, the girls scamper toward the villa, where a
          sumptuous table is set on the veranda, attended by more
          servants. William is handed a drink, as he sips it, watches
          their perfect, barely covered butts, his eyes pools of
          desire, the servant holds out an envelope.
                         
                          SERVANT
           For you sir.
           69.
                         
          Perplexed, William takes his eyes off the girls and regards
          the envelope. No return address, no stamps. He opens it,
          and his perplexed look goes to one of concern.
                         
          CLOSE ON THE NOTE
                         
          It says. SOMEONE IS LOOKING FOR YOU. BE CAREFUL. A
          FRIEND.
                         
                          WILLIAM
           Where did this come from?
                         
                          SERVANT
           It was in the post box this morning.
                         
          William cannot fathom what this is all about. But he does
          not like it.
                         
          EXT. CARIBBEAN ISLAND - SUNSET
                         
          Over hot dance hall music, the sun sets magnificently into
          the shimmering sea...
                         
          INT. VILLA - EVENING
                         
          The music blasts throughout the villa. Sexy, hot. There
          are several bodyguards stationed all around.
                         
          INT. SALON - EVENING
                         
          Two of the girls dance erotically for William, who reclines
          on an oversized couch, smoking from a hookah.
                         
                         ANGLE ON
                         
          The third girl is out in the foyer, laying on the glass
          floor, which is the top of a large aquarium, where dozens
          of sharks swim back and forth.
                         
                          GIRL
           Here fishy fishy!
                         
          She taps on the floor, the sharks ignore her.
                         
                          GIRL
                          (POUTY)
           Willie! They're ignoring me!
                         
          William comes over.
                         
                          WILLIAM
           Put a drop of blood in there and
           they'll be your biggest admirers.
           All the way down to your stripped
           clean bones. And speaking of
           stripped...
                         
          He lifts her up like a piece of luggage. As she squeals
          with delight...
           70.
                         
                          WILLIAM
           Bedtime!
                         
          The other girls come running. The party moves up the
          winding staircase. The bodyguards look at each other,
          roll their eyes.
                         
          INT. VILLA - NIGHT
                         
          William is at the double doors to his massive bedroom suite,
          the girls are on the bed in the BG jumping around, in the
          skimpiest bra and panty sets, having a pillow fight.
                         
                          WILLIAM
           (to head of security)
           Bring extra security in for the
           night.
                         
                          HEAD SECURITY
           Yes sir.
                         
                          WILLIAM
           And make sure we're shut down tight.
                         
                          HEAD SECURITY
           Yes sir. Have a good night, sir.
                         
                          WILLIAM
           I intend to.
                         
          The doors close, and lock. Wild shrieks come from inside.
                         
          EXT. VILLA - EVENING
                         
          A van rolls up to the main gate, half a dozen security men
          exit.
                         
                          HEAD SECURITY
           There are already guys in the garden
           and guys out back. I want you
           three upstairs, two on the roof.
           You three downstairs. Follow me.
                         
          As they all enter the villa, the CAMERA lingers on the
          van. A figure dressed in black rolls out from under the
          carriage as it pulls away and disappears into the bushes.
                         
          QUICK TIME CUTS
                         
          Two guards stand outside the bedroom door. Two guards are
          on the stairs. Three guards in the salon. Three more in
          the garden outside.
                         
          INT. VILLA - NIGHT
                         
          The Head of Security goes around the villa checking that
          all the doors and windows are secure. His men are posted
          outside the door to the bedroom, on the stairs, in the
          salon. He closes lights as he goes.
           71.
                         
          He walks across the aquarium floor in the foyer to the
          front door, closes the lights, so that only the glow from
          the aquarium lights illuminate the dark. And he exits,
          closing the door behind him, turning the lock.
                         
          CLOSE ON THE AQUARIUM
                         
          The sharks gliding back and forth. And then, a figure in
          a black wet suit, fins and a mask, with a small back back,
          comes gliding into through the sharks. Who just go about
          their business. The figure stops at the edge of the glass
          floor, takes something out of the back pack and very
          skillfully cuts a small hole in one of the glass panels
          that makes up the floor.
                         
          The diver lifts out of the aquarium, pulls back the wet
          suit. It is Cat.
                         
          Cat opens the backpack, removes a silencer fitted pistol.
                         
          CLOSE ON THE BEDROOM DOORS OPENING
                         
          Cat enters, silent, closes the door, approaches the bed
          where William is asleep sandwiched between the three passed
          out girls. Empty champagne bottles and glasses are strewn
          about.
                         
          Cat stares down at the scene, points her gun at William.
          One of the girls rolls over onto William, ruining her shot.
          She hesitates.
                         
          CLOSE ON WILLIAM'S FACE
                         
          As sits up suddenly, startled from sleep. No one is in
          the room. He looks around, and notices the bedroom door
          ajar. He is more awake now, sees the Nymphettes sleeping
          soundly. He rises, dressed in a silk sleeping robe. He
          feels something on his chest, goes over to the mirror,
          opens his gown and sees, painted on his chest: In red
          lipstick, the word THIEF, and a drawing of a Cataleya
          orchid. Panic starts to set in.
                         
                          WILLIAM
           Hello?
                         
          No answer.
                         
          William tip toes to the ajar door. He peeks out and sees
          two guards with bullets through their foreheads, blood
          leaked out across the white marble floor. Really panicked,
          he flattens himself against the inside of the door, his
          breath coming in gasps.
                         
          INT. VILLA - NIGHT
                         
          William, holding the two guns of the dead guards in front
          of him, makes his way down stairs, past two more dead
          guards. Growing more and more nervous by the moment, he
          tries a light switch on the wall, nothing.
           72.
                         
          The only light comes from the ambient glow of the aquarium
          below. He reaches the bottom of the stairs.
                         
                          WILLIAM
           Anybody?
                         
          No answer. He crosses the aquarium floor, and when he is
          right in the middle...
                         
                          CAT
           Stop right there.
                         
          Cat comes out of the dark. In her hand, a silencer fitted
          pistol.
                         
                          WILLIAM
           Who are you?
                         
                          CAT
           Doesn't matter who I am.
                         
          He pulls the trigger on his gun. Click, click, click. He
          tries the other one. Again click click click.
                         
                          WILLIAM
           What do you want?
                         
                          CAT
           I want you exactly where you are.
                         
          And then, without warning, she puts a bullet in both his
          knees.
                         
                          WILLIAM
           ARRRGGGHHHH!
                         
          He falls to the floor. The blood starts to seep out onto
          the glass. The sharks swim back and forth.
                         
                          WILLIAM
           Whatever they paid you, I'll double
           it!
                         
                          CAT
           You know the thing about sharks.
           You can swim with them all day and
           they will just ignore you, but put
           one drop of blood in the water and
           they become your biggest admirers.
                         
                          WILLIAM
           Please. I'll give you anything
           you want. Don't kill me!
                         
                          CAT
           I'm not going to kill you.
                          (BEAT)
           They are.
           73.
                         
          She fires three shots into the glass square he is kneeling
          on. The glass shatters. William falls into the water.
          Grabs onto the squares on either side and props himself
          up. His blood runs down into the clear water. Cat turns
          and walks toward the door.
                         
                          WILLIAM
           Please! Please!
                         
          He struggles frantically to pull himself out. Cat exits.
          And then the sharks hit. WHAM! And hit. And hit. And
          hit.
                         
                          WILLIAM
           Please! Help! Help!
                         
          He is violently dragged under.

           I get stuck with a CIA Access denied

           Listen, Agent Ross, we don't give
           out any type of information over
           the phone. So what I suggest is
           you file a formal request with the
           agency for any information you
           might want. And I'll be more than
           happy to get back to you as soon
           as I can.

          People disembark. We think Cat is getting off the plane.
          It is Marco and two of his thugs. As he is crossing the
          terminal, he passes a newspaper machine. The headline of
          the paper in the window catches his eye: SHARKS EAT SHARK.
          As he stares at the picture of the dead William, his phone
          rings.

           Seems she was too drunk to get a

          The two agents look at each other, even more chagrined.
          One of them pushes a button on the computer. And the three
          angles come up. One has a shot of Cat's face covered by
          her hair, one has a shot of her face covered by her hand,
          and the third one has an angle of her nose.

          INT. SOCIAL CLUB - DAY
                         
          A dimly lit place, where strangers are few and suspicious
          looks from the rough men playing pool at the back to able
          and lining the bar are par for the course.
                         
          EDUARDO, a small time hood, lines up a shot with a pool
          cue, when a hand comes down on the ball he is about to
          shoot. He looks up to...
                         
                          MARCO
           Hello Eduardo, que pasa?

          He opens his arms. They hug. Eduardo is friendly, but
          there is a hesitation, a tension in the air. As they break
          marco takes a roll of cash out.
                         
                          MARCO
           Here. For you.
                         
          He goes to hand it to Eduardo.
                         
                          EDUARDO
           For what?
                         
                          MARCO
           First for fucking up your shot.
           Second, for an address. You
           remember Fabio? The Cataleya
           Killer?
                         
                          EDUARDO
           It's a long time. My memory...
                         
                          MARCO
           You went to school with his brother
           in law. What was his name? Emilio?
                         
                          EDUARDO
           Like I said...my memory...
                         
          Now the men at the bar are starting to take notice.
                         
                          MARCO
           I have a problem. And we think
           Fabio's kid is behind it.
                         
          Eduardo takes the roll of bills and puts it in Marco's
          shirt pocket.
                         
                          EDUARDO
           Look Marco. I gotta be honest
           with you. Everyone knows you guys
           were playing a double game, and
           when the shit went down, you were
           the only ones who got out of it
           clean.
                         
          The men at the bar are now edging closer. One of them has
          a shot gun resting along his leg, inconspicuous, and
          conspicuous at the same time.
                         
                          MARCO
           So you do have a memory.
                         
                          EDUARDO
           Yeah. For rats. Now get the fuck
           out, and let me take my shot.
                         
                          MARCO
           OK...
           78.
                         
          Marco looks at Eduardo, who glares at him. Eduardo goes
          to line up his shot. The tension in the room is thicker
          by the moment. As Eduardo is about to hit the ball, Marco
          grabs his hair and slams his forehead into the cue ball.
          At the same moment, Marco's two thugs whip out their guns
          and blast away. The shotgun wielding man, raises his gun,
          and as he is killed by Marco, his blast takes out one of
          Marco's thugs.
                         
          In an instant it is over. Everyone is dead, except Marco,
          one of his thugs, and the dazed Eduardo. Marco notices
          his ear is bleeding, touches it, it pisses him off that
          blood has soiled his white shirt.
                         
                          MARCO
           Fuck...
                         
          Pissed, Marco yanks Eduardo up from the floor and slams
          him onto the pool table. Sticks his gun in his face.
                         
                          MARCO

          She starts to peel off the lingerie.
                         
                          DANNY

           Nothing much.
                         
          She stops. Waiting.

           Where have you been?
                         
                          CAT
           On vacation.
                         
                          DANNY
           Really? Where?
                         
                          CAT
           Down south.

           Where there are alligators?

          He wiggles the toy.
                         
                          CAT
           There was that one.
                         
                          DANNY
           Was it nice?
                         
                          CAT
           It was OK.
                         
                          DANNY
           What did you do?
                         
                          CAT
           Nothing much. A little swimming,
           fed the fish.
                         
                          DANNY
           OK. Now you.

           Now me what?
                         
                          DANNY
           Conversation. It goes two ways.
                         
                          CAT
           OK. Want to fuck?
                         
          Danny starts to laugh. Cat, caught in the moment, begins
          to laugh as well.
                         
                          DANNY
           OK. OK. I get it. You want to
           protect yourself. I understand.
           But I'm...I don't just want to be
           here for the sex. I know a lot of
           guys would think this is perfect.
           She comes over, we fuck like mad.
           She leaves. But I need a little
           more.
                         
          She keeps staring, waiting.
                         
                          CAT
           Like what?
                         
                          DANNY
           Like...uh...some trust maybe.
                         
                          CAT
           That's a hard one for me.
                         
                          DANNY
           I got that. I'm not in a hurry.
           And just so you know. The past?
           If it's too painful right now?

           If you can't talk about? That's
           OK. But, you know, if someone
           hurt you before...like a broken
           heart or something. I'm not
           responsible for that. I just want
           want to be here for you. To know
           a little about what's inside.
           What you feel. Just a little.
                         
          Cat hesitates, standing there half dressed, feelings that
          she never wants to deal with coming to the surface.
                         
                          CAT
           I'm lonely sometimes.
                         
          She stops.
                         
                          DANNY
           ...And?
                         
                          CAT
           Isn't that enough?
                         
                          DANNY
           It's a good start.
                         
          He smiles, puts the stuffed animal aside.
                         
                          DANNY
           Now we can have sex.
                         
          Cat smiles, caught a bit off guard by his sweetness. He
          approaches her, she goes to touch him. He puts her hands
          down, gently.
                         
                          DANNY
           Let me this time.
                         
          And for the first time, she lets him touch her first.
          Let's him kiss her lips, her neck, and as he goes south,
          kissing as he goes, the CAMERA holds on her face, and for
          the first time she allows herself to receive, to give
          herself over to being the seduced rather than the seducer.
          And she likes it.

          Surprise this time. Because there is someone there,
          sleeping peacefully, her face, half covered by her hair,
          bathed in the soft light of dawn...

          Cat.
                         
          Danny smiles, so pleased.
                         
          INT. KITCHEN - MORNING
                         
          Danny puts the finishing touches on a breakfast tray. He
          looks at the stuffed animal she brought him. It warms his
          heart.
                         
          INT. BEDROOM - MORNING
                         
          Danny stands with the breakfast tray, looking at Cat
          sleeping. He cannot quite believe it. He puts the tray
          down, takes his iPhone, points it at her, goes to take a
          picture.
                         
          REVERSE ON CAT

          Cat is disoriented.

           I didn't know if you like your

           made...
                         
          Cat jumps out of bed, starts to dress quickly.
                         
                          DANNY

          Outside Danny's door, Cat crosses to the elevator, waits
          for it to come. As she does, she fixes her clothes a bit,
          her eyes on Danny's door.
                         
                          CAT

          The door doesn't open. The elevator arrives. She takes a
          deep breath, enters. The door closes.

          Cat hurries down the aisle, keeping an eye on the security
          camera. Making sure she stays on the far side, out of
          it's range. She stops in the middle of the aisle, starts
          to examine paint brushes.
                         
                          CAT

          has the newspaper with Woogard's picture. He throws the
          paper in her face. Cat is taken aback by a display of
          anger she has never seen in this man before.

          He hands her an envelope.
                         
                          EMILIO
           Maybe this will help you understand
           what I am telling you.
                         
          Emilio leaves first this time. Cat just stands there, her
          world rocked. She opens the envelope, takes out a
          photograph, looks at it.

           Ryan, I'm twenty eight. I met
           someone who I want to be with.
           All the time. I have nothing. A
           stuffed animal.
                          (BEAT)

           Up to you Danny. I do it all the
           time. Photo goes in here. Bangs
           around the National Data base
           looking for a match. Bingo.
           Address, phone number, shoe size,
           dress size, rap sheet, anything
           you want to know. It's really no

          smiles back. Mama takes Cat's hand, kisses it. They all
          sit and listen to the Mass, like all the other families

          of the drink. As she looks out on the night sky, she lights
          a cigarette. Feeling so alone. She takes one drag on the
          cigarette, stubs it out. She takes the picture of herself
          and her parents, looks at it, sighs deeply. A tear forms.
          Her loneliness, her sense of isolation grows. For the
          first time, she seems a bit lost.

                          (TIGHT)
           What picture Danny???
                         
                          DANNY
           I took a picture of you while you
           were sleeping. With my phone.
                         
          Cat leaps out of her chair, on full alert now. She opens
          her cabinet to the four screens.
                         
                          DANNY
           Jen. I'm sorry. Really. I didn't
           mean to offend you.
                         
          Cat attaches a device to her computer. Does not respond.
                         
                          DANNY
           ...it's just you looked so cute.
           I can erase it if you want. It's
           not even a good picture...Jen?
                         
          Cat is not listening, she is looking at a message flashing
          across the screen. THIRD PARTY ON LINE.
                         
                          CAT
                          (NERVES KEENING)
           Who else saw the picture?
                         
          Cat flips the switch on her surveillance screens.
                         
                          DANNY

                          DANNY
           His sister. I didn't want to..it's
           just...I wanted to contact you. I
           wanted to...
                         
                          CAT
                          (HARD)
           What does the sister of Ryan have
           to do with this?
                         
                          DANNY
           Shari, that's Ryan's sister...she
           works at Police headquarters...
                         
          And now Cat knows everything.
                         
                          DANNY
           I just wanted to be...
                         
          On her surveillance screens, Cat sees FBI SWAT pulling up
          to the building.
                         
                          CAT
           Closer. I know. Goodbye Danny.
                         
          Cat hangs up, rushes into the bathroom, turns the shower
          on full blast. Hurrying out, on her screens, she sees the
          SWAT swarming into the building. Cat opens a cabinet. On
          the back of the door are a dozen keys. She chooses one.
          She checks the screens one more time, sees the SWAT rushing
          the stairs, the elevators. She turns off her screens.
                         
          And runs out of the apartment in her t-shirt and panties.
          Barefoot.

          INT. HALL - DAY
                         
          Cat reaches the stairs just as the elevator is reaching
          her floor. She ducks down the stairs as the elevator door
          opens, and Ross and his team step out, guns raised,
          exercising extreme caution, keeping very quiet.
                         
          INT. STAIRCASES - DAY

          QUICK CUTS BETWEEN CAT AND THE SWAT. SHE GOING DOWN, THEY
          ARE COMING UP. AND JUST WHEN THEY ARE ONE FLOOR APART,
          WHEN IT SEEMS THAT THEY ARE GOING TO COLLIDE, RUN INTO
          EACH OTHER...
                         
          CAT EXITS THE STAIRS ON THE SIXTH FLOOR.
                         
          A MOMENT LATER THE SWAT COME RUNNING BY WHERE SHE EXITED.
                         
          INT. HALL - DAY
                         
          Swat 1 listens at Cat's door. Ross is at the end of the
          corridor.

          Ross signals for a scope. SWAT 2 takes a flex cam, and
          begins to slide it under the door.

          INT. APARTMENT - DAY
                         
          ...a guy eating his lunch in front of the TV.
                         
                          GUY
           Hey!
                         
          He reaches out to grab her. Cat grabs his hand and slams
          his face into his tray of food, knocking him cold.
                         
          INT. HALL - DAY

          Cat pulls down a camouflaged hinged door in the ceiling.
          On it, is a harness, with several things attached, guns,
          charges, thick metal clips. She slips into the harness.
                         
          INT. HALL - DAY
                         
          Ross's team goes from apartment to apartment. Knocking.

          On the video cam, Ross is seeing nothing in Cat's apartment.
          He points to one of the SWAT, signals for him to set charges
          against the door. The man begins to do so.

          INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - DAY
                         
          Cat walks along in coveralls, boots and a hard hat, passing
          several crews of workers welding, hammering, doing repairs.
          She disappears into the gloaming.
                         
          FADE TO BLACK
                         
          EXT. EMILIO'S STREET - EARLY MORNING
                         
          A normal day. Kids playing ball. Trashmen picking up
          trash.
                         
          ANGLE ON THE REAR OF EMILIO'S HOUSE
                         
          Cat enters the house.
                         
          INT. EMILIO'S HOUSE - MORNING
                         
          Cat walks through the house like it could be a trap, a
          silencer in her hand. Her senses are keening, she is that
          alert. And then she finds the first body.
                         
          Mama. Dead. A bullet in her head.
                         
          Cat has all she can do to keep it together. Then she finds
          Pepe, a bullet in his head. It is almost too much for her
          to bear.
                         
          And then she finds Emilio, tied to a chair, tortured. To
          death. This IS too much for her to bear.
                         
          Cat cuts Emilio's beaten and bloodied body loose, and gently
          takes HIM in her arms. And begins to cry.
                         
                          CAT
           I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I'm sorry

          Ross is pinning up the pictures of Cat on his board. His
          phone rings.
                         
                          ROSS

          EXT. FBI BUILDING - EVENING
                         
          The building is emptying out. In the lobby, Ross passes a
          floor cleaner and a lone security guard.
                         
          INT. MARKET - EVENING
                         
          Ross picks up a prepackaged meal.
                         
          EXT. ROSS'S APARTMENT - EVENING
                         
          Ross enters his building.
                         
          INT. ROSS'S APARTMENT - EVENING
                         
          Ross enters, turns on the lights, revealing an apartment
          as austere as Cat's. Heads for the small kitchen, where
          he is about to put his precooked meal in the microwave.
          When he feels a gun in the back of his neck.
                         
                          CAT
           This won't take long. Hands up.
                         
          Ross raises his hands. Cat reaches around, removes his
          gun.
                         
                          CAT
           Turn around.
                         
          Ross faces her.
           99.
                         
                          CAT
           Sit.
                         
          She motions him into the chair behind him.
                         
                          ROSS
           Just so you know, all this? Being
           so smart? Covering all your bases?
           It's not going to matter. It's
           already over. The whole place is
           wired with web cams.
                         
          His moment of triumph is short lived. Cat reaches on the
          side of the counter. Holds up six web cams, wires ripped
          out.
                         
                          CAT
           You mean these?
                         
          Tosses the ripped out cams onto the table.
                         
                          CAT
           Talking about covering all your
           bases. Your chair is pressure
           wired. You move your ass one inch
           you don't have one anymore.
                         
          Ross looks under the chair. Sure enough, there are several
          wires leading out of the bottom of the chair. He looks
          further to the where the wires attach to a small charge.
          She puts her gun down on the table.
                         
                          CAT
           I know what you're thinking. Maybe
           yes a bluff, maybe no. But you
           have to figure yes, given what you
           know about me.
                         
          Ross does not move.
                         
                          CAT
           This wasn't what I had in mind for
           myself when I was a kid. I wanted
           to be on the other side of things.
           Like you.
                         
                          ROSS

                          CAT
           He did.
                         
          She takes out an old picture of Don Luis, lifted from the
          internet. She takes out the picture of her parents and
          her as an eight year old.
                         
                          CAT

          She places the photo album in his lap. Puts his food in
          the microwave, starts it. Goes to exit.

          And she is gone. Ross watches the timer on the microwave.
          When it beeps, he sits a moment longer. Hesitates to get
          up. Little by little, he moves himself off the chair,
          tentative. Afraid that any moment, BOOM! Until he makes
          the final move, stands just enough to clear the seat,
          waiting for the worst to happen. And when it doesn't, he
          breathes a sigh of relief.

          All of the sudden, a bullet shatters the window; destroying
          a picture of Richard standing with the President hanging
          on the wall just behind his head. The red dot is back on
          Richard in a heartbeat.

           She says she's using seven point
           six two steel jacketed armor
           piercing shells. And you have ten
           seconds to give her the address.
                         
          Richard starts to come unglued.
                         
                          RICHARD
           How can I be sure once she has the
           address she won't kill me anyway?
                         
                          ROSS
           You can't. But I can assure you
           that if you don't give her the
           address you will be number twenty
           four on her hit parade. Trust me
           on this one.

          A moment later, the red dot disappears from Richard's chest.
          Richard breathes out. Ross reaches out, shakes richard's
          limp hand.
                         
                          ROSS
           Thank you. Because honestly I
           didn't know how I was going to
           explain you splattered all over
           your walls.
                         
          Ross exits. Richard looks at the shattered picture. The
          President's head is intact. The bullet has ripped Richard's
          face clean off.

          approaching in the distance up the road. As he watches,

          for one of the men to move down the hall.

          signals he is riddled from below with dozens of bullets.
          The man dances like a puppet on a string, before falling
          to the floor, dead. Marco takes a grenade out, flings it.

          Hesitant, the thugs approach the hole. Pointing their
          weapons, they unload a barrage of bullets. Then stop.
          Nothing moves. One of them peers over the side.
                         
          BANG!

          The thugs and Marco run...
                         
          EXT. DON LUIS'S MANSION - DAY
                         
          The thugs set up two big ass 50 caliber machine guns at
          the two openings in the foundation.
                         
                          MARCO
           Kill her!
                         
          The thugs manning the guns let loose, blasting away. Smoke
          and flashes from the muzzles mingle with the fog.
                         
          INT. CLOSET - DAY
                         
          Don Luis hears the firing, which thunders through his
          closet.
                         
          EXT. DON LUIS'S MANSION - DAY
                         
          The thugs fire until their ammo is spent. As the sound
          dies away, silence reigns.
                         
          INT. CLOSET - DAY
                         
          Don Luis hears the silence. He speed dials on his phone.
                         
          EXT. DON LUIS'S MANSION - DAY
                         
          Marco's phone rings.

           Checking.
                         
          He motions for one of his men to look into the dark hope.
          Hesitant the man peeks around the side. Nothing happens.
                         
                          MARCO

          INT. CLOSET - DAY
                         
          Don Luis lets out a sigh of relief.
                         
                          DON LUIS
           Did you see the body?
                         
          EXT. DON LUIS'S MANSION - DAY
                         
          Marco urges his man to look deeper, expose himself more,
          to look in the hole. Marco watches as the man does so,
          very cautiously. Still no movement. He moves full body
          into the opening to peer in.
                         
          BANG! BANG! BANG!
                         
          Is blown back by three fast shots.

          And then he starts screaming into the hole, careful to
          stand just off to the side.
                         
                          MARCO
           You know what bitch? I loved
           killing your father. He was a
           coward! And you know what else?
           I screwed your mother behind your
           father's back! We all did! She
           couldn't get enough of it! The

          Silence. And then, a whistle from above. Marco looks up
          to see Cat, standing on a second floor balcony with two
          pistols.
                         
                          MARCO

          Marco starts to fire, his men raise their guns. Too late.
          In the blink of an eye, with bullets flying wildly all
          around her, Cat blows five of the seven thugs surrounding
          Marco away. Marco and the remaining two thugs run toward
          the guest house. Out of the range of her guns.
           111.
                         
          INT. CLOSET - DAY
                         
          Don Luis is panicking. Yelling into the phone.
                         
                          DON LUIS

          Marco and the two thugs run into the small house.
                         
                          MARCO
           You two here! That door opens...
                         
          He points to the door they just came through.
                         
                          MARCO
           ...kill anything that comes through.
                         
          Marco runs into the bedroom.
                         
          INT. BEDROOM - DAY
                         
          Marco runs to the curtained windows, rips the curtains
          back, hoping to escape. And finds that the windows have
          metal hurricane shutters on them. With locks. Marco pulls
          out a set of keys, frantically tries fitting the keys to
          the locks. None of them work.
                         
                          MARCO
           Shit!
                         
          He runs for the door again. Just as he has his hand on
          the knob, two shots ring out.
                         
                          MARCO

          No answer. He checks his gun, realizes he is out of ammo.
          He knows his time has come. He drops is gun, backs away
          from the door. Backs right up to the bed, and sits down.
          His phone rings.

          Marco just stares at the door.
                         
                          MARCO

          There is a small sound outside the door.
                         
                          MARCO
           I will hold here! Run! Run!
                         
          The door shatters as Cat kicks her way in. Marco pulls
          his trigger. Click! Click! Click! Marco is frozen.
          Just stares at Cat. Waiting for what is going to come.
                         
                          MARCO

          Gripped by fear, Don Luis runs for all he is worth across
          the fog shrouded garden until he reaches the garage. He
          yanks open the door, runs inside.
                         
          INT. GARAGE - DAY
                         
          Don Luis runs around Pepe's red truck and the crumbled
          Mercedes, jumps in the armored van.
                         
          INT. ARMORED VAN - DAY
                         
          Don Luis fumbles with the keys, grinds the ignition in his
          desperation. The engine turns over. Don Luis slams the
          transmission into gear, but bangs into the crumbled Mercedes
          blocking his way. He slams the gearshift into reverse,
          bashes into the wall behind him, and then jerks the gear
          shift into drive, ramming the Mercedes with a little more
          room. Back and forth back and forth, Don Luis rams at the
          Mercedes until he has made enough room to turn the van,
          bang past the Mercedes, and smash his way out of the garage.
                         
          EXT. DON LUIS'S MANSION - DAY
                         
          The van comes roaring out of the garage, tearing up the
          gardens, jumping on the driveway and speeding off to the
          main road.
                         
          Cat comes running from the opposite direction, two guns
          blazing.

          As bullets ping off the van, Don Luis regains some of his
          confidence. A small smile breaks across his face as he
          looks in his rear view mirror and sees Cat running and
          firing, losing ground.

          runs out of bullets. Stands watching the van head off
          down the road.

          Humming a tune. When the van phone rings. Surprised, he

           You got lucky. You escaped. You

           I cannot be killed. I do the
           killing. Not the other way around.
           And now it is your turn to be
           hunted. You will never find me.
           But as day follows night, believe
           me, I will find you. And I will
           kill you. And you know why?
           Because I will never be where you
           can kill me. I will never be where
           you want me to be.

          Don Luis doesn't get it. And then he hears a low growling
          behind him. He turns a little, sees sitting there in the
          dark recesses of the van, two enormous dogs. Pepe's dogs.
          His eyes register confusion, then apprehension...

                          ROSS
           Sure.
                         
          Ross gets up and leaves the room. Danny is feeling really
          shitty. He takes his phone out of his pocket, looks at
          Cat's picture. And then it rings.
                         
                          DANNY

          tag. Smiles.
