EXT. SPACE	

THE CAMERA PULLS BACK. . . 

INT. ARGO CITY

AND REVEALS THE inside of a domed city honeycombed with fantastic arches. The city is inhabited by young beautiful people in luxurious but simple costumes.

THE CAMERA ROAMS through the City, observing some people seated at a kind of cafe sipping drinks and relaxing; other people are in some kind of exercise class doing beautiful graceful movement; and finally a class of five year old children listen intently to a teacher who is demonstrating a molecular model.

					TEACHER
				And now, who can give me the electron 
				wave functions for Kryptonian covalent 
				bonding?

The five year olds eagerly raise their hands. The teacher points to one.

CHILD
				The cube root of the wavelength over the 
natural log of the integral of the speed of 
light squared.

The teacher smiles.

TEACHER
				Well, maybe that was a bit too easy...

THE CAMERA ROAMS ON through the city, following the sound of a strange, ethereally beautiful singing. The CAMERA discovers the source of the sound: an ARTIST sculpting a beautiful crystalline object with a MATTERWAND. The wand makes the singing noise as it creates matter out of energy. The Artist, whose name is ZALTAR, sometimes whistles along in counterpoint. .

A small girl is watching him with fascination. Her name is Kara, and she is seven.

Behind her, the dome, which encloses the City, marks the edge of the limbo outside.

KARA
What are you making:

	ZALTAR
It's going to be a tree, I think.




KARA 
What's a tree?

	ZALTAR
It's something they have on Earth. You know,
 where your cousin went.

	KARA 
Where is Earth?

	ZALTAR
Didn't you study six-dimensional geometry in 
school?

	KARA
Yes, I know the equations---I just can't see it in 
my head.

Zaltar laughs.

					ZALTAR
				Even I have trouble with that sometimes. Earth is in 
outer space. And we're in inner space. 

	KARA
I don't understand.

	ZALTAR
Wait till you're older. Here -- watch this. 

Zaltar takes a small OMEGAHEDRON out of his pocket and holds it in his hand.

					ZALTAR.
				This is one of the four Power Sources of the City. 
I borrowed it from the Guardians. Look what I 
can do with it. 

Zaltar touches his MATTER.WAND to the OMEGAHEDRON and the wand instantly becomes charged with flickering light. He touches his wand to the tree sculpture---and the 
sculpture comes alive with dancing lights and shadows. Kara claps her hands with delight 
at the spectacle. Zaltar steps back and admires his handiwork. He carefully puts down the
OMEGAHEDRON at his feet, takes a small flask from his belt, and drinks.

				ZALTAR
			You see, a tree is a living thing.

				KARA
			Can you create life?

	
ZALTAR
				No, no, just the illusion of life. A kind of 
half-life, maybe. A pale shadow of the real 
thing. But it is lovely, the way the light plays 
over the surface. . . 

A woman's voice can be heard calling in the distance.

WOMAN'S VOICE 
Kara. Kara.

Kara calls out in reply.

					KARA 
I'm here, mother.

Kara's mother ALURA appears through the lacey architecture of the city.

ALURA
				Kara, you shouldn't be so near the Edge 
without a grown-up.

	KARA
I'm sorry, Mother.

	ZALTAR
I was keeping an eye on her.


Alura puts her arm around her daughter affectionately, showing she's not really angry. Together they watch Zaltar's latest sculpture, flickering with the play of inner light and shadow.

ALURA
				Thank you, Zaltar, but she has to obey the rules.

Zaltar takes another swig from his flask. and lowers his voice confidentially.

ZALTAR
				You and your husband have been kind to me, 
Alura. I have something to tell you: I'm going 
away. Soon.

	ALURA 
But where?


Zaltar bends down to Kara and hands her his matterwand.

ZALTAR
				Put your fingers there, Kara. And press hard.

She does, and the wand makes a horrible squawk. Kara laughs with delight.

ZALTAR
				Good. Now, go make something pretty.

Kara scampers away, hardly able to believe her good fortune, and starts to make all kinds of 
surprising sounds with the wand on the plaza nearby. Zaltar speaks to Alura in a low, confidential voice.

ZALTAR
I've discovered a new way into the Phantom 
Zone.

	ALURA
But the phantom Zone is for criminals.

	ZALTAR
It's big. And empty. I'm tired of limiting myself 
to  Argo City. I want to do something new. I'm 
starting to repeat myself here with this airy, 
glittery stuff....

Zaltar waves a hand deprecatingly at the city around him.

ALURA
				But Zaltar---you founded the city! It's yours. We 
were all just refugees from Krypton when you gathered 
us together and brought us here, to the inner dimension. 
You can't abandon us now. You have a responsibility to us!

In the background, Kara has been modeling a spiky insect-like CREATURE. Now she suddenly finds the OMEGAHEDRON on the ground beside her. She doesn't stop to wonder how it got there from beside Zaltar's feet. She simply picks up the OMEGAHEDRON and touches it to the spiky creature. The creature suddenly flicks its wings and COMES TO LIFE, unnoticed by the adults. Kara drops the wand and laughs out loud with delight as the magical creature takes off from the ground and starts flying in circles around her head, glittering as if it were made of diamonds.

ZALTAR
I'm an artist, Alura. My work comes first. Other 
people come second.

	ALURA
How can you create beauty...with a selfish heart?
The spiky insect-creature flies closer and closer around the little girl's head, buzzing angrily. Her look of delight turns to fear. She tries to shoo the creature away. It flies off toward the thin membrane that encloses the city.

The spiky creature flies into the membrane and tears a ragged hole in it. With a giant WHOOSH all the air in the city starts to rush out the hole. Kara is swept along toward the hole by the wind. She cries out and stretches pleading hands toward her mother. THE OMEGAHEDRON is swept toward the hole as well. Kara grabs onto the ragged edge of the membrane.

ZALTAR 
Kara---the Power Source!

Kara reaches for it, but it is too far from her, and the OMEGAHEDRON is sucked out into infinity by the wind. Zaltar picks up the matterwand from where Kara dropped it and touches her with the wand. She is instantly held fast. Zaltar pulls her back inside. He gives her to her mother Alura. Then Zaltar touches his wand to the membrane and seals the hole with masterful chords like a brass choir. 

The wind dies down and all is silent, except for the quiet sobbing of Kara in her mother's arms. Zaltar kneels down beside her and strokes her golden hair  tenderly.

KARA
				I'm sorry... I didn't know.

					ZALTAR
				It was my fault. You aren't old enough to use 
the wand. I shouldn't have given it to you.

	ALURA
But the Power Source, Zaltar.

	ZALTAR
It couldn't be helped. The city will have to make do 
with three.

	ALURA
But what will happen?

	ZALTAR 
The Guardians will be angry. They may even 
send me to the Phantom Zone. You see, I didn't 
really have permission to borrow it. I must go 
explain to them...

Zaltar hurries off nervously. THE CAMERA HOLDS ON KARA'S FACE as she senses this may be her last sight of Zaltar.

DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. A SPRINGTIME MEADOW - U.S.A. - DAY. UNDER TITLES

A beautiful blonde in jeans and a frilly blouse is walking across a field of wildflowers. Butterflies flitter and dart from flower to flower. The blonde's name is SELENA. She is our ideal image of the girl next door, who grew up into a dynamite lady.

Her current boyfriend follows along behind her, lugging a big wicker hamper from their pickup truck parked at the edge of the road. Selena finds a grassy spot under an old oak. and spreads out a red and white checked gingham cloth..

SELENA 
Over here George. It's the perfect spot. Nice view.

George sets down the wicker basket and Selena starts to unpack a scrumptious picnic of home cooked food. She unpacks fried chicken, hard-boiled eggs, potato salad, cold beer and a big rich creamy-frosted devils food cake.

					GEORGE
				You sure are a good cook, Selena. Man, that looks 
too pretty to eat.

	SELENA
Better eat it quick. It won't look too pretty when it's 
all covered with ants.

She hands him a chicken drumstick and a hard-boiled egg.

					GEORGE
				Selena, I've been thinking. It's time I settled 
down---and I don't know a nicer lady to settle
down with than you.

SELENA
				Why George, are you proposing?

					GEORGE
Marry me, Selena. The hardware store doesn't bring 
in much now, but...

SELENA
				George---I thought you'd never ask.

A shrill whistling sound from above makes them look up. With a loud plop and a spatter of icing the OMEGAHEDRON falls into the middle of the chocolate cake.

GEORGE
				What the heck is that?

They look up in the boughs of the tree overhead, and then down at the chocolate cake splashed all over the checked cloth.

SELENA
A squirrel Frisbee?

Selena reaches out and picks up the OMEGAHEDRON. It comes away from the cake without a trace of the chocolate icing sticking to its surface, as if made of some substance, which repels other kinds of matter.

Selena holds the shining Omegahedron in her hand and examines it, turning it around and around as if hypnotized. Her face takes on a new expression. Almost as if the simple, wholesome innocence of her nature had been blasted away by some profound new knowledge of the universe.

SELENA
				That's funny. I'd swear I know just what this is, 
but I've never seen it before.

She stands up and walks across the checkered cloth, in a beeline for the pickup truck.

GEORGE
				Hey, where you going?

					SELENA
				     (calling over her shoulder) 
I've got things to do.

	GEORGE 
What about my proposal?

	SELENA 
         (dismissively) 
Call me next week. Maybe we can have lunch.

She gets in the pickup and. drives away.

GEORGE 
Hey! My truck!

DISSOLVE TO:








 KARA' S FACE

She is ten years older now, a young lady. Almost ready to assume the long flowing gown of an adult, but still in the tunic worn by those under eighteen.

ALURA
				      (voice over)
				But Kara, you are too young to go.

ANOTHER ANGLE. ARGO CITY. DIMMED

They are in the assembly amphitheater of the city, where the kindergarten nuclear physics class was seen. Kara is in the centre of the ring, with adults seated in scattered rows around her. Her parents Zor-El and Alura are standing in front of her.

KARA
				I am almost an adult. This is what I want.

ZOR-EL
				But Kara, no one has ever gone from here to 
Earth. The journey is dangerous.

	KARA
It was my fault we lost the Power Source.

	ZOR-EL
Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it.

	KARA
I allowed it to escape the City.

	ALURA
Ever since we told you how your cousin Superman 
was sent there as an infant, all you have wanted to do 
was visit this place.

	KARA
Yes, I do want to go. But someone must go. Our 
scanning shows the Power Source has finally 
reached the Earth. It could destroy everything unless 
someone brings it back.

	ZOR-EL 
Superman will return it.

	KARA
Why haven't you been able to contact him? He should 
have returned from the neutron galaxy ages ago. He 
may be dead.
ZOR-EL
But what can you, a mere girl-

	KARA
I'll have super powers there. Like him. We can't wait. 
Our lights are fading. Look around you. When I was a 
child the City was bright and shining. Look at it now.

Zor-El and Alura sigh. There is no denying that the brilliance of Argo City has been much dimmed since Kara was a little girl.

					ALURA
				What do your teachers think?

Zor-El looks around the circle. A beautiful woman speaks.

					TEACHER
				It would be sad to lose one of our finest young ones 
to the dimension barrier-- but the City cannot last much 
longer without the Power Source. It is her future she's 
fighting for, Zor-El.

	ZOR-EL
Very well, let it be done.

Alura embraces Kara emotionally, fighting back the tears. Kara too is struggling to control her own emotions.

KARA
				Don't worry, Mother, I'll be all right. I've studied 
the transmissions from Earth. I know their customs.

Kara walks out of the amphitheater with her parents.

ALURA
				But they are such strange, unstable people.

					KARA
				Then I will learn to act strange like them.

Kara holds up a small handbag. Inside we glimpse red and blue material.

					KARA
				I have made clothing and copies of their money, I 
will be fine.




Her father puts his hand on her shoulder .

					ZOR-EL
				Be brave, my .daughter. Be wise.

					KARA
				As brave as my father. As wise.

They embrace, briefly. Kara then steps onto a circular platform set into the pavement of the city.

 Instantly transparent bubble forms around her.

Her parents watch as she floats away.

She passes into an air lock through the membrane that surrounds the City, and off into an infinity of space.

MONTAGE: THE JOURNEY OF KARA INSIDE "HER SPHERE FROM THE INNER DIMENSION TO OUR WORLD.

Her sphere moves from blackness, to a dark green limbo. The atmosphere thickens around her. Soon it is unmistakably water, and she is heading toward the light above. A fish darts past with a flash of silver. The sphere rushes upward faster and faster. It breaks the surface of the , water. Kara springs free of the bubble, which disappears. She is now wearing a blue and red costume like her cousin Superman.

She lands on a nearby beach.
 
EXT. EARTH.  BEACH BESIDE THE SEA. SUNRISE

She looks around her, feasting with her eyes on the details of this new exciting world.

Kara bends down and picks up a stone from the ground at her feet. To her astonishment, she 
crushes it to powder in her hand, and blows the fine dust away with a blast of superbreath.

She looks down at her feet, so firmly planted on the ground. She rises a few inches into the air, and reacts with amazement. Then she looks up into the blue sky overhead and her expression of astonishment is replaced by a look of joyous longing. With a sudden impulse she shoots straight upward.

EXT. HIGH ABOVE THE EARTH.  DAY

Kara loops and rolls, swoops and circles, laughing with sheer delight.





EXT. HIGH ABOVE MOUNTAIN MEADOWS.  HORSES.  DAY

Kara swoops down at a herd of horses. The herd parts and gallops off in all directions as she pulls out of her dive and flies away.

CUT TO:
 EXT. MOUNTAINTOP.  DAY

Kara lands on a mountaintop and admires the view. The she bends down and scoops up a handful of snow. She stares at it with awe.

INSERT. MICROSCOPIC SHOT OF SNOW CRYSTALS IN ALL THEIR INFINITE VARIETY AND BEAUTY.

BACK TO SCENE.  DAY

Kara stands up, smiling. She flies into the air again.

EXT. FOREST.  DAY

She lands and walks among the huge trunks of a primeval forest. Shafts of sunlight pierce the gloom. These trees are much more impressive than Zaltar's imitation back in Argo City. She hears a mournful sound and pulls back a spray of brambles. She sees a BABY DEER hopelessly tangled in the long canes. She shoots RAYS OF HEAT VISION from her eyes and slices through the tough stems. The fawn scrambles free, and scampers off into the forest. Kara watches it with a benevolent smile. She removes a brunette wig and some street clothing from a secret pocket in her cape.

EXT. MANSION --- GARDEN PARTY

A big impressive house somewhere in the Middle West. People mill about on the neatly manicured lawn sipping drinks and snagging hors d'oeuvres off silver trays from. passing waiters. All the quests have a name tag on, like at some kind of conference.

SELENA, the blonde who discovered the Power Source, is circulating among the quests. She has changed since we saw her last. No longer the girl next door, she now wears a fabulous designer dress dripping with jewels. She walks with the regal air of someone used to being obeyed, and graciously accepts the homage of the quests. A smile, a nod, a kind word from her leaves them all basking in the warm afterglow of her attention. But we notice odd details of the party: the decorations are all based on mystic occult symbols. At the refreshment table, there is a big ten-foot WICKER SCULPTURE OF A FEMALE GOAT covered with paper flowers. And the quests all have an indefinable air of strangeness about them. BIANCA, a tall cold-eyed brunette in black silk dress, whispers in Selena's ear .

BIANCA
				Be careful. Nigel is going to try something.



					SELENA
				Don't worry about old Nigel, I can take care of him. 
He's just a sore loser.

An ELDERLY MAN in a three-piece pin-stripe suit grabs her elbow.

ELDERLY MAN
				I don't want much, Selena. I have simple tastes.

SELENA 
What do you want?

	ELDERLY MAN 
Western Europe.

	SELENA
I'm sorry, but I already promised Bianca she could 
have Switzerland. You know how she loves to ski.

	ELDERLY MAN
No problem. She can have it. I hate mountains.

Selena leaves him negotiating boundary lines with Bianca and strolls over to a sour-faced man in suede who has been scowling at her over his cigarette.

SELENA 
Cheer up, Nigel. It's not the end of the world.

NIGEL
				It may well be. I know how you won that election 
Selena. You can't fool me.

	SELENA
I have plans Nigel. You could come with me...
I'm going places.

					NIGEL
				You're not going anywhere. Except back to nowheresville.
You're too impatient, Selena. Look around you--all 
these people have served years and years of apprenticeship.
Some of their families have been in the Craft for generations. 
You can't join and take over our whole organization in a few months.

Selena smirks at him, self-confidently.

SELENA
				I just did. Because I have the Power.

					NIGEL
				You're going to pay a terrible price. The power of Shadow 
is tricky. Use it too much and it takes over. 

Nigel drops his cigarette, stubs it out on the lawn, and takes out his platinum cigarette case.

SELENA
Bianca's taught me all! need to know. I'll be safe, as 
long as I don't go too far. 

	NIGEL
Cigarette?

He holds the shiny mirror-like cigarette case in front of her so she can see her reflection.

INSERT. SURFACE OF THE CIGARETTE CASE. Selena's reflection. She is still the glamorous beauty, but looming behind her...invisible to ordinary eyes...is a DARK EERIE SHAPE OF SOMETHING HIDEOUS.

BACK TO SCENE.

Quick as a cat, Selena bats the cigarette case out of his hand and sends it spinning into the shrubbery. All traces of the Shadow behind her have disappeared.

					NIGEL
				Sorry. Forgot you were trying to quit.


Nigel snags a glass of champagne off the tray of a nearby waiter and sips it insolently.

SELENA
				Nigel, get out of here. And don't come slithering 
back.
Nigel shakes his head.

NIGEL
				You need me, Selena. I'm the only one who can save 
you from a terrible fate.

	SELENA
I need you like an Eskimo needs a lawnmower. Now 
burn rubber.

Nigel locks eyes with her.

NIGEL
				Make me.

He takes another insolent sip of champagne...arid discovers a scorpion perched on the rim of his glass.

Nigel spits out the champagne and, drops the glass. Everyone laughs at him.


NIGEL
				Balefire on you, Selena!

					SELENA
				    (grinning)
				You Scorpios can never take a joke.

All quests have fallen silent, staring at the altercation between the two of them. 

					NIGEL
				You think you are on top now. Well there is someone 
coming to challenge you. I saw it in the cards this morning.

	SELENA 
Throw him out.

Two burly waiters seize Nigel and drag him off toward the valet parking.

NIGEL
				You won't last a year, Selena. The cards don't lie!

The crowd breaks into a buzz of conversation. 

Bianca stands up on a chair. The crowd falls silent.
	
					BIANCA
				Let's not let one rotten apple spoil the party. I give you 
the first woman in eight hundred years to head 
the Circle: Selena!

Applause. Selena steps up onto a raised dais. And holds up her hands in an invocational gesture.

SELENA
				Thank you, sisters and brothers of the Craft. It is a 
great honor you have given me, and I will try to be
worthy. And when my secret plans are revealed --
you will learn that we are on the threshold of 
power and influence undreamed of when Nigel was 
our leader.

More applause. One of the cooks applauding at the refreshment table knocks over a fuel-pot under a chafing dish. The fuel-pot falls on the ground at the base of the wicker goat statue.  

					SELENA
				And now, ,I call upon the Great Mother--the spirit 
of Nature --- to bless all our endeavors in the 
coming year...

A woman in the .audience screams. Everyone looks where, she is pointing. The huge ten-foot tall wicker statue ,bursts into flames.

Panic and pandemonium. Some of the quests run for safety. Others try to throw water onto the blazing, torch-like statue, but in vain. Selena frowns at the spectacle, and, without a word, turns and stalks into her house.

INT. SELENA'S HOUSE.  LIVING ROOM

THE CAMERA FOLLOWS Selena through the French doors and into her large living room. On one wall is a huge, ornate gold-framed MIRROR, covered with a thick veil.

Selena sits down in front of a large hearth, and opens a secret compartment in the floor. She reaches inside and removes a finely wrought METAL BOX IN THE SHAPE OF A GARGOYLE and a pack of cards. She puts the gargoyle box on her lap, and begins to cast tarot cards onto the floor in mystic patterns.

The Elderly Man in the pinstripe suit enters from the garden. Outside the excited shouts and sounds of firefighting can still be heard. Someone runs by in the b.g. with a coil of garden hose. The Elderly Man walks over to Selena, timidly.

ELDERLY MAN 
Is this Nigel's doing?

SELENA
				It's a warning, that's for sure.

					ELDERLY MAN
				Maybe it was just an accident.

					SELENA
				     (mysteriously)
				There's no such thing as an accident. Everything has 
meaning, if you can read the signs.

The elderly man looks down at the pattern of tarot cards Selena has cast on the floor.

ELDERLY MAN
				Then what does it mean???




Selena shrugs and puts aside her cards.

SELENA
				Don't ask me. I can't read the signs worth spit.

EXT. MIDVALE SCHOOL. DAY

 A bus stops in front of the school. Kara, disguised in a brunette wig and unfashionable clothing gets out of the bus. (From now on we shall refer to her in human guise by the name of her secret identity LINDA LEE.) Linda walks up the driveway toward the main building. Around her the campus is full of girls all in the school uniform of skirt, blazer, and white knee socks. Many of them stare frankly at the new girl in the slightly dowdy dress, carrying a battered old suitcase.

In front of the school, LUCY LANE, one of the older girls, is batting in a softball game. She swings and hits one over the fence for a homer. Linda watches the excited, deliriously happy girls---wondering if she will ever be able to share such strong group emotions. Linda walks up the steps to the main building.

INT. MAIN BUILDING. MIDVALE SCHOOL. STAIRWAY

Linda walks up the long stairway in the entrance hall.

MYRA, the school bully, passes with her spy and toady the loathsome MUFFY. As they pass MYRA speaks in a loud voice.

MYRA
				Geeze, another barfy new student. They're really 
scraping the bottom of the barrel these days.

Linda walks on up to the next f1oor.

INT. MAIN BUILDING . MIDVALE SCHOOL. HALL

Linda walks along the deserted hall and stops at the office of the registrar, MR. Danvers. She enters.

INT. REGISTRAR'S OFFICE

MR. Danvers turns from his desk and glares at her.

 MR. DANVERS
				Don't you believe in knocking?

LINDA
Oh, yes. Knocking. The pre-entry signal. I forgot.

She knocks on the open door. Her manner is so open and guileless that MR. Danvers, though
he gives her a strange look, does not put it down to smart-aleckyness, as he normally would.

MR. DANVERS 
What can I do for you?

	LINDA 
I'm Linda Lee.

My cousin wrote you.

MR. Danvers stares at her blankly. He's a bit absent-minded.


MR . DANVERS 
Cousin? Wrote me?

Linda looks at the metal filing cabinet behind his desk.

Two beams of X-RAY VISION are faintly visible for an instant from her eyes.

LINDA
				The letter's in your files. Under K, for Kent.

MR. Danvers opens his file and searches through it.

					LINDA
				I mean, it would probably be there, if you received it.

					MR. DANVERS
				Here it is. Oh...of course. You're the orphan. I'm so sorry 
about your parents. We'll try to make you happy here.

He rises and walks around the desk toward her. He puts his hand on her shoulder in a fatherly fashion.

CUT TO:

EXT. CAMPUS. DORM

MR. Danvers is carrying her suitcase as he shows her around the campus.

MR DANVERS
				...since your school records were lost in the fire, we'11 
start you out easy first. You'll have English, Latin, 
French, History, Art, Chemistry, Math, Biology 
and Computing. Later on, you can add some electives. 
I think we'll put you in "G" dorm.

He opens the door and ushers her into the dorm.

INT. DORM. CORRIDOR

MR. Danvers leads Linda down the corridor. 

A girl dorm monitor sees him and yells out the traditional signal.

STUDENT MONITOR
				Man on the floor!

Immediately, several of the room doors along the corridor slam shut. MR. Danvers smiles indulgently and leads Linda along to one of the rooms with an open door.

INT. DORM ROOM

LUCY LANE, still in her softball flannels, is digging mud out of her cleats with a Swiss Army Knife held over a wastebasket. MR. Danvers knocks on the open door, in the pre-entry signal of Earth. Lucy looks up.

LUCY
				Oh, MR. Danvers, come in and park it.

					MR. DANVERS
				Lucy, your roommate still home with anorexia?

LUCY
				It wasn't anorexia. It was the food.

					MR DANVERS
				Linda, this is Lucy Lane. You can room with her. 
Show her around, Lucy; I believe you know her 
cousin, MR., uh, Kent. Lucy turns into a bundle of 
enthusiasm. She grabs Linda's suitcase and leads 
her into the room chattering away excitedly.

LUCY
				Wow, you're Clark's cousin?? Fabuloso! Clark's a 
hunk. My sister Lois was a real nerd to let that one 
get away. You'll love it here, we have a great dorm, 
some really insane characters, I mean radical craziness...
 
MR. Danvers slips away, leaving the two new roommates to get acquainted.








Lucy puts Linda's suitcase on the bare mattress of the empty bed and opens the dresser drawers to help her unpack.

LINDA 
I can do that.

	LUCY
No sweat. When's the rest of your stuff arriving?

She looks down at the nearly empty suitcase.
	
LINDA 
There isn't any.

LUCY
This is all your clothes?

Lucy involuntarily glances over her shoulder at the bulging closet beside. her own bed. Lucy's bed is smothered with teddy bears, and the walls around it are covered with photos and posters of male rock singers, movie stars, and tennis players. Also a large painted poster of SUPERMAN.

LINDA
				I have money to buy more, but I haven't had a 
chance since...

	LUCY
Since what?? Did you have a fire at your house or 
something?

	LINDA
I'd rather not talk about it.

	LUCY
You're not...an orphan are you?

	LINDA
My cousin Clark is my only relative on Earth.

	LUCY
Oh wow, I should've known. Me and my big mouth. Listen, 
you can borrow any of my clothes you want. Any time.

LINDA
				Thank you. You're very kind.




LUCY
				I'm real sorry, Linda, I should've known it was 
something tragic if you show up without a 
wardrobe. Here, try on this. And this.

Lucy starts pulling clothes out of her closet and tossing to Linda.

											CUT TO:

EXT. SCHOOL PLAYING FIELDS. DAY

Girls in their adorable school gym outfits run around playing field hockey. Linda hangs back on the outskirts of the mob. She sees Myra put her stick between Lucy's legs and trip her. Linda stops to help Lucy up.

LINDA
She did that deliberately.

	LUCY
She's a beast.

The pack turns and heads back toward them, the lead. Myra slaps the puck directly at. steps in front of it to protect Lucy. The and shatters. .Play stops. The girls mill confusion, picking up the little pieces of with Myra in Lucy. Linda puck hits Linda around in puck.

					LUCY 
How'd you do that?

LINDA
				Must've been a defective puck.

INT. LOCKER ROOM. DAY

Girls pile in and start to take off their uniforms. Showers are running in the background. Linda unlaces her shoes. Lucy is unlacing beside her.

					LUCY
				Keep an eye peeled for Myra. She's out to get you.
				
LINDA 
But what for?

LUCY
				She just hates anybody who isn't afraid of her.





INT. SHOWER. LATER. DAY

Linda and Lucy (seen from the shoulders up) are enjoying a nice warm shower.

Linda looks through the tile wall (with her x-ray vision) and sees Myra next door, fooling with the plumbing.

INT. PLUMBING ROOM

MYRA
				      (whispering)
Are they in?

Muffy (Myra's spy) nods yes from her look-out position.

MYRA
				Listen to the screams when I shut off the cold water.

She takes a huge wrench and starts to shut off a valve. Her spy looks worriedly at the valve.

MUFFY
				But, Myra, why don't you shut off the hot water and 
give them an ice bath? If you shut off the cold it, 
could scald them.

MYRA
				So they lose a little skin. Serve 'em right.

Myra pulls on the wrench.

INT. SHOWER

Linda shoots a beam of her heat vision through the wall.

INT. PLUMBING ROOM

Myra pulls on the valve, but the wrench glows red hot in her hand. She lets go with a cry of pain. A pipe springs a leak, drenching her in her school uniform. Myra heads for the door, to get out. More pipes spring leaks. Myra is soaked, her hair all bedraggled, her uniform a mess.

CUT TO:

INT. COMPUTING CLASS

MR. Danvers is putting a fairly complicated equation on the blackboard. All the students sit at the consoles of little personal computers staring at their blank monitor screens. Except for Linda, who is staring intently at the wall on one side of the classroom.


MR DANVERS
				Now, this is the kind of problem that used to take 
weeks before the computer. It still takes a long 
time without certain algorithms.

Linda stares out through the solid wall with her X-RAY vision.

EXT. CAMPUS

A cat is stalking along a branch of a tree toward a nest of little baby birds. The nest is wedged on top of a window cornice on one of the buildings, but the tree branch passes just close enough by it for the cat to grab the baby birds when he gets there.

Slowly the cat inches along the branch. Suddenly a beam of light hits the branch. It bursts into flame, and falls down to the ground, saving the birds from any future danger. The cat turns around like a felon caught in the act, runs down the tree trunk, and scampers away.

INT. CLASS

Linda smiles to herself.

MR. DANVERS (O.S.) 
Linda? Are you with us?

She turns to look at MR. Danvers and finds everyone in class staring at her.

LINDA
				Uh, yes, MR. Danvers.

She looks at the board.

LINDA
				The answer is 5,271,009,010.

Linda smiles, proud that she got the right answer. The other girls in the class laugh at her. Even her friend Lucy snickers. Linda realizes she has made a mistake, but is not sure how serious it is. The class bell rings and the girls dash for the exit. Linda stays in her seat staring at Mr. Danvers as he goes around the room switching off the computers.

MR. DANVERS
				You may go, Linda. But try not to clown around in 
the future.

She meekly heads for the door. He turns to erase the blackboard. Something stays his hand, and he looks at the problem. Then he puts down the eraser and starts to copy the problem on a piece of paper.



EXT. ROAD OUTSIDE SCHOOL. DAY

Selena's Cadillac drives past the school. softball in front. Girls are playing softball in front.

INT. CADILLAC

Bianca is driving. Selena sits in the back brooding. Her tarot cards and the metal gargoyle box are beside her on the open counter of a  built-in bar. She suddenly calls out to Bianca.

SELENA 
Stop the car!

Bianca jams on the brakes and the car screeches to a halt.

EXT. ROAD OUTSIDE SCHOOL

The girls stop their softball game and turn to stare at the Cadillac.

INT. CADILLAC

Selena is gathering up her scattered things from the floor of the car.

SELENA
				I said stop, I didn't say run into a brick wall.

					BIANCA 
What is it?

		SELENA
The Coffer of Shadow. Look at it.

The metal gargoyle box is glowing with an inner radiance.

					SELENA 
What does it mean?

BIANCA
				The danger. The one Nigel spoke of. It must be near .

They stare out the car window at the girls' softball game, which was resumed.

SELENA
Oh, fiddlesticks. What could be dangerous about a 
baseball game?

	BIANCA
Softball.

	
SELENA
				It must be the girls. One of the girls.

					BIANCA 
But which one?

SELENA
				Drive on. We have already attracted enough 
attention.

Bianca starts up the car again and drives smoothly away.

SELENA
				We'll bide our time and keep watch. Young girls 
just can't keep a secret. If one of them's up to 
something--we'll find out.

	BIANCA
And then, like great cats---we pounce! And destroy!

The car swerves slightly.

SELENA
				Bianca, try not to be so bloodthirsty when you're at 
the wheel. OK?

	BIANCA 
Sorry, mistress.

CUT TO:

EXT. DORM. DAY

Linda is standing at the bathroom' window of her dorm room, looking outside with a melancholy expression. She slides the curtain across the window, so no one can see in.

INT. LINDA AND LUCY'S ROOM. DAY

Lucy runs in, fresh from her softball game, and sits down on the bed as usual to dig the mud out of her cleats. Lucy's bed is still a riot of stuffed animals and frilly lace pillows. Linda's bed' across the room is austere and almost monastic, with no family photos, posters, or toys.

LUCY
				Hey, Linda, you in there?

LINDA (o.s.)
				Uh-huh.

Linda answers from inside the shut bathroom door.
LUCY
				How much longer you gonna be?

LINDA (o.s.)
				Not long. I'm cutting my hair.

Lucy crosses to the bathroom door. 

LUCY
				You're a maniac! Let me do it for you. You'll look awful.

INT. BATHROOM OFF DORM ROOM. DAY

Linda is in her Supergirl costume and her blonde hair. Her brunette wig is hanging on a hook beside the mirror.

SUPERGIRL
				I can manage, thanks.

Supergirl holds out a lock of her blonde hair. She looks into the mirror and SHOOTS A BEAM OF ENERGY FROM HER EYE, which reflects off the mirror and strikes her hair, cutting off one inch of the blonde strand.

INT. DORM

LUCY
				I cut my own hair once. I looked so awful the only 
thing was to go totally punk!

Linda opens the door and steps out of the bathroom. She is wearing her brunette wig and her Linda clothing. Lucy is puzzled.

LUCY
				Your hair looks the same.

LINDA
				It was just a trim.

The student hall monitor sticks her head in the door and yells excitedly.

JODY
				Hey guys, Gloria just got a package from home.

					LUCY 
What's in it?

JODY
				A hair dryer that makes popcorn!

					LUCY 
Wow! Pig-out time. Come on Linda.

Lucy hurries to the door. Linda holds back.

LINDA
No thanks. You go on.

	LUCY
You sure?

Linda nods bravely, and Lucy dashes off down the hall toward the lounge. Linda stands alone in the room.

A beam of light from the setting sun shines through the room, and casts a pool of light on the opposite wall. Linda looks at the beam of light with nostalgia.

 INT. DORM LOUNGE

Lucy and the other girls are stuffing themselves with popcorn turned out in bowlfulls by Gloria's new hair dryer. The package it came from lies torn open on the table beside the hair-dryer. Some of the girls start a playful popcorn-throwing fight in the b.g. One of the girls is strumming her guitar, and starts to sing "There's No Place Like Home". One by one the other girls join in. It's a scene of high spirits and camaraderie, in contrast to Linda's loneliness.

INT. LINDA'S DORM ROOM

Linda, still staring at the sunbeam shining through her room, and at the tiny dust motes dancing in the beam. From down the hall comes the sound of the girls singing, in improvised six-part harmony.

GIRLS .o.s.)
"Be it ever so humble, There's no place like 
home..."

A tear of self-pity and homesickness wells up in Linda's eyes and runs down her cheek. She steps into the beam of sunlight and it shines full on her face. She suddenly hears Alura's voice in her mind.

ALURA (o.s.) 
Kara, my darling...

	LINDA
Mother! Is it you? Where are you???

	ALURA (o.s.)
In Argo City. Have you found the Power Source?


	LINDA
Mother, this world is so big. I don't know where 
to begin to look.

ALURA (o.s.)
				Kara, be careful. There is some terrible evil force coming 
near you. I can feel it. Keep to your disguise. Let no one
know who you are.

LINDA
				But why? I have super powers. Nothing can hurt me.

ALURA (o.s.)
				There are more powers in the universe than we know. 
And more than we can imagine. Be careful, Kara. And
come home safely.

The sun sets and the beam of light disappears as if a switch had been snapped off, leaving Linda alone in the warm afterglow of twilight.

The soft strains of girls harmonizing float down the hall.

GIRLS (o.s.) 
"...mid pleasures and palaces Where'ere I roam, Be 
it ever so humble, There's no place like home."

CUT TO:

EXT. SCHOOL GROUNDS. BENCH. DAY

Linda sits by herself reading on a stone bench: She is wearing the school uniform now. All around her girls are running out of the dorm with overnight cases and climbing into cars driven by middle-aged couples. There is a frantic bustle of activity. 

CUT TO:

INT. OFFICE IN THE MATH DEPARTMENT

Mr. Danvers sits at his computer, which is spewing out page after page of a complicated printout. Finally the printer stops. He reads out the bottom line.

MR . DANVERS
				Five billion, two hundred and seventy-one million, 
nine thousand, and ten.

He sits back in his chair and puffs thoughtfully on his pipe.



EXT. SCHOOL GROUNDS. BENCH. DAY. LATER

The campus is deserted. Linda still pretends to read, but her sense of loneliness is palpable. Suddenly Mr. Danvers is beside her, looking down.

MR. DANVERS
				No plans for the weekend, Linda?

LINDA 
No, MR. Danvers.

MR. DANVERS
				Can't have you moping around the campus. Why don't 
you come home with us for dinner?

LINDA 
I'd love to.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. BACKYARD OF DANVERS'S HOUSE. DAY

Mr. & Mrs. Danvers and Linda sit outside under the trees at a table piled high with delicious home cooked food. ,The dog begs for scraps. As the scene progresses (MOS) the Danvers bring Linda out of her shyness until they all laugh together sharing food, jokes and happiness. A. dreamlike moment of nostalgia from everyone's childhood.

INT. SELENA'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. DAY

Selena, at her most glamorous, in silk hostess pajamas and scads of pearls, stands looking out the French, doors of her mansion. She is staring shamelessly at ETHAN, a handsome young landscape gardener. Bianca is standing beside Selena.

BIANCA
				Is he your entertainment for tonight?

					SELENA
				He will be. In about five minutes.

					BIANCA
				Have fun.

Bianca exits, and Selena waves to Ethan from the French doors.

EXT. SELENA'S HOUSE. GARDEN. DAY.

Ethan is sketching the house, adding new trees and shrubs in his drawing. He sees Selena waving, and walks over to her. 

INT. SELENA'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. DAY

SELENA 
Finished your estimate?

	ETHAN
Well, there's several ways to go .

SELENA
				Come in, have a drink, we'll talk.

She ushers him inside and sits him down in front of the vast hearth.

SELENA
				You must be very popular in the neighborhood. I always 
see your truck parked around.

	ETHAN
I have a lot of repeat business. People seem to like my 
service.

	SELENA
I bet they do.

	ETHAN
What's that big black scar on the ground? Like a fire.

	SELENA
Oh, you know how parties are. Always some damage.

Ethan spreads his drawings out on his knees.

					ETHAN
				Now we could put in rhododendrons or lilacs...depending 
on how alkaline your soil is. 

Selena gives a cursory glance at the sketch, and then turns to a silver tray beside her. She picks up a frosty pitcher and pours an iced fruit drink into two tall glasses.

					SELENA 
				I just love plants and growing things. It must be 
wonderful to have green thumbs. Cheers!

Ethan looks at the drink with misgiving.

ETHAN
				Uh, no thanks, I don't drink during the day.


Selena gestures outside.
	
SELENA
				But look, it's almost sundown!

Ethan glances outside. Selena pours some poisonous looking red liquid into his glass from a tiny bottle hidden in her hand while his attention is distracted.

ETHAN
				Really, I'm not thirsty. Now I could put in some 
honeysuckle there and there...

Selena pouts exaggeratedly.

SELENA
Just take a sip or .I'll be hurt. It's an old family 
recipe, I'm famous for them.

Ethan pauses. He doesn't want to offend his rich new customer over such a trifle.

ETHAN 
What is it?

	SELENA
A passionfruit smoothee.

		ETHAN
Well, just one.

He takes his glass (with the extra ingredient) and clinks it against hers in a toast.

SELENA
				To us. And to the seeds we'll plant together.

ETHAN 
I'll drink to that.

He takes a careful sip of his drink, tastes, and smiles.


ETHAN 
Hmmm. Delicious!

He tosses off the rest of it in one gulp. Selena watches him triumphantly.

ETHAN
Now, about my fee...

He suddenly clutches his throat with a gasp and collapses unconscious on the couch. She leans over him and strokes his cheek delicately with her long red-nailed fingers.

SELENA
				Sleep well. And when you wake, drown in my eyes 
and be all mine.

The DOORBELL RINGS.  Selena looks up with annoyance.

SELENA
				If that's the Jehovah's Witnesses again...

She angrily walks toward the hall, casting a fond look back at Ethan.

SELENA
				Don't go away, gorgeous. I'll be right back.

EXT. FRONT DOOR OF MANSION

Nigel in a skin-tight vinyl jumpsuit with multidirectional chrome zippers is leaning on the bell. Behind him his Porsche is parked in the driveway, and beyond at the curb is a truck with ETHAN'S NURSERY AND LANDSCAPING painted on it. Selena opens the door, sees Nigel, and tries to close it. But Nigel puts his foot in and keeps it open.

SELENA 
Nigel, get lost.

NIGEL
				I have to talk to you.

					SELENA
				You're wasting your breath.

					NIGEL
				You used to listen to me. When you asked me to 
teach you something of the Craft.

	SELENA
I could teach you a thing or two now.

INT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM

Ethan opens his eyes. He rises from the couch and stands there swaying deliriously.

INSERT. P.O.V. OF ETHAN

The room swirls and distorts around him in garish nightmare colours.


BACK TO SCENE

Ethan clutches his head as though it were splitting apart, and lurches out of the French doors into the terrace.

EXT. FRONT DOOR OF MANSION

Selena is listening impatiently to Nigel, and staring oddly at him.

NIGEL
				...trust the wisdom of the ancients, trust the Great 
Mother to protect us... Why. are you staring at me 
like that?

SELENA
				I was just thinking, if I had your skin problems, I'd use a 
good tannisroot ointment. Every night.

Nigel is rather vain about his smooth olive complexion, so he is completely thrown off his stride.

NIGEL
				Nothing's wrong with my skin.

					SELENA
				Such a shame. You ought to take better care of 
yourself.

Selena closes the door while he's off his guard. Nigel takes a pocket mirror out of his shoulder bag and stares with horror at his reflection. His face is erupting all over in ugly red blotches.

NIGEL 
Nasty bitch!

EXT. GROUNDS OF SELENA'S MANSION. SUNSET

Ethan staggers across the lawn, still clutching his head, obviously very ill. As he disappears through the shrubbery on the far side of the lawn, he mutters drunkenly to himself.

ETHAN 
Rhododendron.. . .honeysuckle. . .

INT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM

Selena enters and finds Ethan gone. She is furious. She walks to the French doors.

					SELENA 
Ethan. Come back. You'll spoil everything!
INT. THE DANVERS' LIVING ROOM. NIGHT

Linda is playing chess with MR. Danvers, while his wife knits on the sofa.

MRS. DANVERS
				I think you'd better be getting back to the dorm, Linda. 
The housemother'll expect you to sign in by eight.

Linda stands up from the chessboard.

LINDA
				Thank you both so much. It was a lovely lunch, Mrs. 
Danvers. I had a wonderful time. And you're a 
terrific chess player MR. Danvers.

	MR. DANVERS 
What? Me?

LINDA
				Sure. Mate in five moves.

She moves the pieces chonk, chonk, chonk, chonk, chonk...

LINDA
				...and there goes my king. Got to hand it to you, I didn't 
see it coming. Well, bye.

She walks out the door into the night.

MRS . DANVERS
				What a lovely child. Such nice manners. We must 
have her back, don't you think?

MR. Danvers 'grunts absent-mindedly, bemused at his loss.

INT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM. NIGHT

Selena paces agitatedly in her living room. Finally she stops in front of the ornate mirror hanging on the wall. She puts her hand on the heavy veil covering it.

SELENA
				Show me Ethan.

She rips aside the veil. The IMAGE IN THE MIRROR SHOWS ETHAN STAGGERING DRUNKENLY THROUGH THE NIGHT COWN THE CENTRE WHITE LINE OF A HIGHWAY. CARS WHIZZ PAST HIM IN BOTH DIRECTIONS.

SELENA 
The silly fool! 
EXT. HAMBURGER HEAVEN. NIGHT

Lucy is in front of the local hamburger drive-in in her Thunderbird convertible, talking to the foxiest dude at Rindge Tech. Other teens are hanging out and listening to rock music outside the drive-in. Lucy catches sight of Linda walking along the side of the road.

LUCY 
Hey, Linda!
     (to the boy) 
It's my roommate. You'll love her. She's really off 
the wall!

Lucy jumps out of her car, runs over to Linda, and whispers urgently in her ear.

LUCY
				Linda babes! There's this all-night party at Eddie's...
his folks are away...

LINDA 
Oh, I don't know. I'm not signed out
for an overnight.

	LUCY
Go back, sign in, and climb out the bathroom 
window. McCloskey's always zonked out: 
she'll never hear you.

	LINDA
It doesn't seem right.

	LUCY
Please, as a favour to me? So I won't  be the only girl?

Linda catches sight of a figure teetering down the centre, white line of the highway. Cars honk and zoom past him.

LINDA 
Look at that guy!

Lucy whirls around and looks. 

					LUCY
				What a space cadet. 
      (yelling and waving) 
Hey, you dingleberry! Get outta the street!

Ethan ignores them, and continues to teeter deliriously.


INSERT.  ETHAN'S P.O.V.

He sees the night as a fairyland of dancing, blurred lights: the neon of the hamburger stand; the garish pumps of the gas station across the street, the streaking head and taillights of the cars on either side. All sound is similarly distorted and far away.

BACK TO SCENE

LINDA	
				Why is he acting so strangely?

					LUCY
				I dunno, but he's gonna get creamed.

INT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM. NIGHT

Selena holds the metal box shaped like a gargoyle. She looks at the IMAGE OF ETHAN in 
her mirror.

SELENA
				Power of Shadows...bring him to me. 


The box in her hand glows with an inner light.

EXT. STREET OPPOSITE H]1..MBUP.GER RESTAURANT. NIGHT

There is a construction site next to the Hamburger Place.  A giant BULLDOZER suddenly ROARS TO LIFE and bursts through the chain link fence surrounding the construction site. With no one at the controls, the bulldozer drives out onto the street. Ethan sees its GAPING JAWS and runs clumsily away. They snap at him with the clash of steel. He stumbles and the bulldozer scoops him up. It wheels around and starts to carry him away, with one of his legs protruding through the teeth of its giant mouth. The onlookers are stunned and horrified.

LUCY
				Omigod, it's a runaway!

Lucy sprints out into the street, running after the driverless bulldozer.

LINDA 
Lucy; come back!

	LUCY
Somebody's gotta do something!!

Lucy dodges through the cars and alongside the bulldozer. She climbs bravely up into the driver's seat and tries to tug at the controls. They are frozen. In desperation Lucy yanks on the steering wheel. The bulldozer turns ninety degrees into the gas station.

EXT. GAS STATION. NIGHT

A TOURIST is filling his station wagon at one of the self-service pumps. His WIFE is bringing their TODDLER back from the rest rooms. The bulldozer suddenly smashes into the gas pumps and through the gas station. The tourist dives out of its path. The bulldozer circles behind the gas station toward a small motel next door, leaving in its wake a totaled station wagon, and gasoline leaking on the ground from the smashed pumps.

EXT. HAMBURGER RESTAURANT. NIGHT

Linda watches with mounting horror. And yet she remembers the warning from Alura, and stands frozen, unable to intervene.

EXT. MOTEL/GAS STATION. NIGHT

Lucy fights the wheel in vain. The bulldozer circles through the motel, smashing the individual cabins into matchsticks. The bulldozer drives under the MOTEL SIGN which HITS LUCY ON THE HEAD, KNOCKING HER UNCONSCIOUS. Finally, the bulldozer comes full circle and halts against a utility pole next to the gas station. The utility pole leans at a crazy angle. Its ELECTRIC WIRES break and dangle down, flashing blue arcs of electricity where they touch the pavement. The RIVER OF GASOLINE from the broken pump flows inexorably toward the arcing power lines. The mother kneels beside her dazed husband and looks over at her toddler running toward the arcing wires, his arms held out eagerly.

MOTHER
My baby!!!!!

Instead of helping, the onlookers turn and flee the inevitable fire.

EXT. HAMBURGER RESTAURANT. NIGHT

Linda can't take it any longer. She ducks into the deserted hamburger restaurant. An instant later, she emerges through a skylight in the roof in red and blue costume as SUPERGIRL! She stands on-the roof in front of a big illuminated advertising sign, which hides her from the fleeing crowd. Supergirl takes a deep breath and blows with her super lungs:. The toddler is blown safely 1nto his mother's arms.

MOTHER
				My baby.

She grasps the child in her arms and helps her husband hobble to safety just as the river of gasoline reaches the sparking wires and BURSTS INTO FLAMES .

The bulldozer, with Lucy Lane unconscious at the controls and Ethan imprisoned in the scoop, is surrounded by an IMPENETRABLE RING OF FIRE . 



Supergirl dashes through the ring of fire so fast that if there were any spectators who weren't running for their lives she would only be visible as a red and blue streak.

EXT. ACCIDENT SCENE/GAS STATION. NIGHT INSIDE THE RING OF FIRE.

Supergirl takes the unconscious Lucy from the driver's seat and carries her in her arms to the front of the bulldozer.

Supergirl pulls open the massive metal jaws with one hand like they were sheet rubber.

INT. SCOOP OF BULLDOZER

Ethan looks up as Supergirl slides Lucy Lane in beside him. He sees Supergirl's face backlit by the raging inferno outside.

SUPERGIRL
				Everything's going to be all right. She's just 
unconscious. No broken bones.

INSERT ETHAN'S P.O.V. LOOKING AT SUPERGIRL FROM INSIDE THE SCOOP

Ethan's swirling distorted vision suddenly focuses with , absolute clarity. A moment outside of time. The most romantic glamorous image imaginable: the blonde, backlit, looking at him with concern, her lips slightly parted.

BACK TO SCENE

There is something about Ethan's ecstasy, which holds Supergirl for a moment.

ETHAN 
God...you're beautiful.

INT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM

Selena watches the image of Ethan and Supergirl in her mirror. Her face is a study in jealousy and dismay.


ETHAN (in the mirror) 
God...you're beautiful.

	SELENA
That was meant for me!

EXT. ACCIDENT SCENE/GAS STATION. BULLDOZER. RING OF FIRE

SUPERGIRL
Thank you. I'm going to close this up again.

ETHAN
Wait...don't leave me in here...

SUPERGIRL
				It's for your own protection.

She pulls the massive steel jaws shut and tears the scoop off the bulldozer with a sound of rending metal. Immediately afterwards, the flames reach the underground storage tank and the bulldozer is enveloped in a FIERY EXPLOSION.

EXT. ACCIDENT SCENE. OUTSIDE RING OF FIRE. NIGHT

The entire gas station is a column of flame and black smoke reaching up into the night sky. A fire truck and a police car arrive on the scene, sirens screaming. The tourist family watch from a safe distance, their toddler clapping his hands excitedly at the spectacle.

EXT. IN THE SKY. HIGH ABOVE THE ACCIDENT. NIGHT

Supergirl flies out of the column of black smoke, carrying the sealed bulldozer scoop with Ethan and Lucy safely inside.

ETHAN 
       (calling from inside) 
What's happening?

	SUPERGIRL
        (shouting over the wind) 
I'm taking you to the hospital.

	ETHAN
           (within)
Let me out. I have to talk to you.

SUPERGIRL
				Later.

EXT. ACCIDENT SCENE. POST FIRE. NIGHT

The firemen have smothered the fire with a blanket of foam. The blackened bulldozer minus its front scoop stands next to the smashed station wagon. A bewildered policeman is searching for victims.

POLICEMAN
				Where's the casualties? You can't tell me there's 
no casualties.

INT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM. NIGHT

Bianca enters and sees Selena staring raptly at the mirror.
BIANCA
				I came as quickly as I could. What is the danger?

SELENA
				It's what we were warned about.

Selena points to the mirror, which shows the IMAGE OF SUPERGIRL FLYING THROUGH THE AIR CARRYING THE BULLDOZER SCOOP. Bianca can't quite make out what it is at first.

BIANCA 
A Storm Dragon?

	SELENA 
No, a super girl.

EXT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE. NIGHT

Supergirl lands with the bulldozer scoop in front of the emergency entrance. There is no one around. Supergirl rips open the sealed scoop with a loud noise of rending metal.

INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM. NIGHT

TWO INTERNS are chatting in the corridor near the doors. They jump at the sound of bending steel outside.

FIRST INTERN 
What was that?

	SECOND INTERN 
Maybe we better take a look.

EXT . HOSPITAL ENTRANCE. NIGHT

Supergirl has strapped Ethan and the semi-conscious Lucy onto wheeled gurneys.

					ETHAN 
Don't leave me.

	SUPERGIRL 
I have to.

	ETHAN
When can I see, you again ?

	SUPERGIRL
Relax. Tomorrow this will all seem like a bad dream. 
Goodbye.


She gives the gurneys a shove.

INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM. NIGHT

The automatic doors open and Ethan and Lucy roll inside on the gurneys.

FIRST INTERN
				Did we use the laughing gas tonight?

					SECOND INTERN 
That was last night.

 					FIRST INTERN
				Then this is really happening.

The two interns catch the gurneys, and start examining Ethan and Lucy.

SECOND INTERN
Hey fella, can you talk???

Ethan begins to babble deliriously.

ETHAN
				The girl. Where is she? It never hit me like this 
before. I love her. My angel.

He sits up, tears brimming in his eyes, and grasps the , intern by the lapels.

ETHAN
				Where is she? I love her, don't you understand? I'll die 
if I can't have her.

The intern pulls away and points to Lucy, who is beginning to come to.

FIRST INTERN 
She's right here fella.

	ETHAN
No, not her. The blonde, the one who carried us 
through the air:. She can fly. She's an angel.

The two interns exchange a glance. One of them steps to a wall intercom.

SECOND INTERN
				This is Stenzl in Emergency. We got
				a 412. Send down the boys from psycho.


ETHAN
				No! She's real ! I saw her !

CUT TO:

 INT. SELENA' S MANSION.  NIGHT

Selena, is brooding in front of her mirror, which shows ETHAN IN THE HOSPITAL STRUGGLING WITH THE TWO INTERNS . Selena covers the mirror with its heavy veil. She speaks to Bianca standing beside her.

SELENA
				Why did she have to show up now?

BIANCA 
Eliminate her.

	SELENA
That's easy for you to say, Bianca.

	BIANCA
You can do it. You're the most powerful woman 
on Earth.

SELENA 
Am I? Still?

There is a pause as the implications reverberate.

BIANCA
				Yes! You own the Coffer of Shadow. Nothing can 
withstand its power.

SELENA 
I've been saving it. For the right moment.

BIANCA
				That moment is now! What good is a sword unless 
it be unsheathed? Use it, and no one will dare 
oppose you again. No one.

Selena toys with the idea in her mind, turning over the various arguments. A smile creeps across her face.

SELENA 
Not even Nigel.

Selena goes to the secret compartment, opens it and takes out the metal gargoyle box. She looks at it with a dreamy, far-away expression on her face.
SELENA
				What do I do?  I don't know her name.

					BIANCA
				The Naming of Names is not necessary. Just concentrate 
on her face. Your Shadow will do the rest.

Selena holds the gargoyle box out in front of her and opens the lid. Inside is the OMEGAHEDRON power source from Argo City, spinning around a strange dark region in its centre. Selena closes her eyes and whispers to the spinning ring.

SELENA
				Power of Shadow hear me. Find her wherever she be. 
Find her and destroy her.

A BLACK CLOUD OF SHADOW bursts out of the centre of the OMEGAHEDRON, filling the room. Selena drops the gargoyle box and shrinks back with sudden misgivings at what she has unleashed. Even Bianca's face has gone white. The two women huddle together as a HUGE INVISIBLE PRESENCE fills the room with darkness. Then the unseen presence suddenly SMASHES ITS WAY OUTSIDE THROUGH THE SOLID WALL OF SELENA'S LIVING ROOM, leaving a big hole and a trail of crushed furniture behind it. Light returns to the room as the shadow departs. And from outside the sound of crackling shrubbery dies away. Selena regains her composure and looks around at the mess of her once splendid living room.

SELENA
				Next time, remind me to do this out in the yard.

BIANCA
				Yes, of course, it was foolish of me.

Bianca reaches down to the floor for the gargoyle box with the OMEGAHEDRON, which is still lying right where Selena dropped it. But Selena quickly picks it up herself before Bianca can touch it.

SELENA
				I think I'd better keep it.

					BIANCA
Whatever you say.

SELENA 
Yes. Whatever I say.  From now on.

She shuts the lid of the gargoyle box, sealing the spinning OMEGAHEDRON safely inside.

INT. DANVERS ' LIVING ROOM. NIGHT

Mrs. Danvers is on the phone.

MRS. DANVERS
				The housemother still doesn't answer.

Mrs. Danvers hangs up the phone with a worried expression.

MR. DANVERS
				Probably drunk again. I'm sure Linda got back all right.
 
MRS. DANVERS
				We should have driven her.

Mr. Danvers stands up and puts on his jacket.

MR. DANVERS
				I'll just drop by the school and. make sure she's all right.

EXT. MIDVALE SCHOOL. DESERTED CAMPUS. OUTSIDE THE DORM. NIGHT

Linda drives up in Lucy's car, the one left behind at the scene of the accident outside the hamburger place. She drives past the paddle tennis court and parks in front of the dorm. Linda gets out of the car, and lets herself into the dorm with a key. Inside, she signs her name in the book. ,

INT. DORM CORRIDOR. NIGHT

Linda walks down the long dormitory corridor past room after empty room. The place is kind of spooky.

INT. LINDA'S ROOM. NIGHT

Linda enters the room she shares with Lucy. She puts Lucy's car keys on her bedside table next to the snapshots of  Lucy's family and of her half-dozen current boyfriends. Linda turns and crosses the room to her own monastic bed in its drab, undecorated corner. She lies down on her bed with a sigh, staring at the ceiling in a melancholy mood.

Suddenly, she senses that something is not right. She gets up from the bed, walks to the window, and gazes out a-t the deserted campus.

EXT. OUTSIDE DORM. TENNIS COURT. NIGHT.

The dorm is set apart from other school buildings and surrounded by tall trees. The tennis court is visible from Linda's window, and a city park adjoining the school property. The UNSEEN MONSTER is heard approaching through the park with a thud of heavy footfalls and the crack of snapping tree trunks and branches. A bolt of lightning flashes, followed by a crash of thunder. The wind howls. A storm is brewing.

Far away across the campus something huge and powerful forces itself between the two big oaks, snapping them like matchsticks. The unseen monster hauls its enormous bulk toward the dormitory, crushing everything in its path, its footsteps making the ground tremble like an earthquake.

 INT. LINDA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT

Linda watches with uncomprehending eyes the approaching swath of destruction heading straight for her. Nothing she has learned about this strange alien world has prepared" her for this. For the first time since she left Argo City, her eyes show fear. And yet there's a deeper streak of defiance in her that impels her to stand her ground and face the horrible juggernaut.

EXT. FORM. TENNIS COURT. CAMPUS. NIGHT

HUGE FOOTPRINTS sink into the damp grass of the campus. A bicycle rack full of Schwinns is flattened into the dirt with a metallic screech. The monster proceeds inexorably toward the wooden rain shelter on one side of the tennis court. The shelter is crushed to kindling wood. The monster drags its enormous unseen bulk across the smooth clay surface of the tennis court, crunching , deep cracked depressions in the clay. The net stretches and groans toward Linda as the' invisible enormity comes closer, and finally snaps with a loud twanging sound as the steel cables part. The tall cyclone fence bulges outward toward Linda and momentarily outlines the form of" the monster before it crumples and falls with the screech of twisted steel. The only thing between Linda and the monster is Lucy.' s parked car. The monster stomps the car flat with a noise like colliding express trains and heads for Linda.

INT. LINDA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT

LINDA
				Hey, that's my roommate's car!

Determination floods her face. She whips off her brunette wig and her civilian clothing to reveal the blonde hair and red blue tunic of SUPERGIRL!

EXT. OUTSIDE THE DORM. NIGHT

Supergirl flies out the dorm window and lands in front of the unseen monster. She raises her hand in challenge and calls out in a commanding voice.

SUPERGIRL
				Leave this place and do no harm.

Something picks Supergirl up and flings her against the wall of the dorm, crushing the soft drink dispenser under her and squirting cola in every direction. Lightning flashes and thunder booms overhead. Supergirl picks herself up, shaken.




She launches herself directly at the space in mid-air ten feet above the monster's footprints. She crashes into something hard and invisible with the sound of a tremendous impact. Supergirl falls to the ground, staggered by the concussion. The irresistible force has met the immovable object. Supergirl looks up, and---altering the wavelength of her X-Ray vision to a transcendental frequency---paints this beam over the monster and just for an instant makes it visible: a HUGE NIGHTMARE SHAPE LOOMING OVER HER, AND REACHING OUT TO CRUSH HER WITH MASSIVE TALONS. Then the image fades.

Supergirl is seized again and flung against the school flagpole, breaking it off at the base. Supergirl stands up and seizes the flagpole. She looks up at the flickering lightning in the sky. She flies straight upward into the storm with the bare flagpole held in front of her.

EXT. THUNDER STORM. LIGHTNING

Again and again huge bolts of lightning strike the flagpole. Supergirl's face is contorted with agony as her body absorbs enough electricity to run Las Vegas for a year. She looks down and sees through a break in the clouds the campus far below.

EXT. CAMPUS

Suddenly Supergirl dives down from the sky, glowing with accumulated electricity. She embraces the monster with a tremendous crackle of energy. The two of them are bathed in brilliant arc light. The monster is briefly made visible again by the energy. But this time it is shrinking, shriveling up into a shapeless lump. The light fades as the energy is discharged. A dark, shapeless lump detaches itself from Supergirl's grasp and flies shrieking away into the night. Supergirl stands alone and exhausted, her muscles trembling with fatigue. 

She turns and walks unsteadily back toward the dorm.

CUT TO:


EXT. CAMPUS. NIGHT

MR. Danvers drives up the long driveway toward Linda's dorm. He parks his car behind the flattened remains of Lucy's car, and gets out, staring with amazement at the destruction wrought by the titanic struggle.

He walks toward the dorm, fear and confusion on his face.

INT. DORM. ENTRY. NIGHT

Mr. Danvers pushes through the unlocked front door. He glances in the sign-out book for Linda's name. Then he knocks on the door labeled HOUSEMOTHER MRS. MCCLOSKEY. No reply. He opens that door and peeks in.




INT. HOUSEMOTHER'S ROOM. NIGHT

A slovenly, overweight woman in a housecoat is curled up on her sofa, a bottle of whiskey clutched to her breast. She snores heroically.

INT. DORM. HALLWAY.  NIGHT

Mr. Danvers walks quickly down the long line of empty rooms to Linda and Lucy's room.

INT. LINDA'S ROOM. NIGHT

Mr. Danvers pauses at the door and looks in. Supergirl, in her blonde hair and red and blue 
tunic, is lying asleep on Linda's bed.

MR. DANVERS
				A Supergirl...
				         (to her)
				Linda...is it Linda?

Supergirl looks up at him and smiles, weakly.

SUPERGIRL
				I didn't want anyone to know... but I was so 
tired...forgot...

M. Danvers sits on the side of her bed.

MR. DANVERS
				Are you all right?

SUPERGIRL
				Just need rest, that's all. Sorry about all the damage 
outside. I had to fight some terrible thing...


					MR. DANVERS
				But why?

SUPERGIRL
				An evil force. Trying to destroy me.

She sits up and looks anxiously at him.

INT. SELENA'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM 

Selena watches their image in her mirror.



SUPERGIRL 
         (image)
				You won't tell anybody, will you?

MR. DANVERS 
       (image)
Not even my wife. And, if there's anything I can do to 
help---I'd be honoured.

INT. DORM. LINDA'S ROOM

Supergirl sinks back down and closes her eyes.

SUPERGIRL
				Thank you, Mr. Danvers.

She lapses into a deep sleep. Mr. Danvers stands up, and pulls the covers up over her in a fatherly gesture. He stands beside the bed for a long time looking down at her, and then walks out of the room, closing the door shut behind him.

CUT T0:

EXT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE. DAY

Linda gets off a bus and enters the hospital. 

INT. HOSPITAL. DAY

Lucy Lane is sitting up in bed with a white bandage around her head. Superman's pal JIMMY OLSEN is standing awkwardly beside the bed holding a small bunch of daffodils. Lucy is talking animatedly on her bedside telephone, when Linda enters.

LUCY
				...come see me. And smuggle in a pint, they won't 
let me have anything, but make sure it's Jamocha 
Almond Fudge . . Listen, I got to run, my 
roommate just walked in. Bye.

Lucy hangs up and turns to Linda.

LUCY
				Hey, Linda-babes! I've got so much to tell you, I 
don't know where to begin! Oh -- this is Jimmy 
Olsen, he works with Clark and my sister at the 
newspaper.




					JIMMY
				Nice to meet you. Lucy's told me all about you. Your 
cousin Clark taught me everything I know about
the newspaper business.

	LINDA 
Nice to meet you.

She shakes hands shyly with Jimmy, then turns to Lucy.

LINDA
				I'm afraid I have some bad news about your car.

					LUCY
				Mr. Danvers called. I'll get a new one with the 
insurance money. B.F.D. 

Jimmy keeps looking at Linda.

JIMMY
				Do you have any theories about last night?

					LINDA
				Theories?

					JIMMY
				How Lucy and that guy got to the hospital. And all 
that damage at the school. The police are calling it 
a freak tornado. I'd like to interview you for the Daily- -

LUCY 
      (overlapping) 
Oh, Jimmy, can't you forget about your career for one 
second?

JIMMY
				-- Planet. I mean, you were there. Do you think it was natural,
				 or like some people are claiming, supernatural?

					LINDA
				I believe there's a rational explanation for everything. But 
I don't know what it is.

	JIMMY
Can I quote you?




Lucy hands Jimmy a stainless steel urinal.

LUCY
				Jimmy, would you please put those poor flowers 
in water before they die?

JIMMY
				Oh, sure.

He steps into Lucy's bathroom with the urinal and fills it with water from her shower. Lucy grabs Linda's arm and whispers urgently in her ear.

LUCY
				Listen, I know I've been saying you ought party 
more, but keep your hands off this one, will yak? 
He's private property. I've been waiting years 
for him to develop.

	LINDA 
He's nice.

LUCY
				Nice? He's cute enough to melt lead!

Jimmy emerges from the bathroom with his daffodils neatly arranged in the stainless steel jug.

JIMMY
				Where is your cousin Clark, by the way?

					LINDA
				He's off doing a top secret uh, investigation.

					JIMMY
				I knew it ! He's working on a  hot scoop !

 EXT. HOSPITAL. ENTRANCE. LATE AFTERNOON

Bianca drives Selena's Cadillac up to the emergency entrance and parks in the ambulance zone. Selena get out of the back seat in a dramatic opera cape of raw silk with opal trim.

SELENA 
				      (to Bianca)
				This won't take long. Keep the motor running.



INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR. LATE AFTERNOON

Selena strides down the hospital corridor almost as if she is floating an inch above the floor. Her huge silk cape billows around her, making her seem larger-than-life. Nurses, orderlies, patients scatter to get out of her way. Her presence is so formidable and she moves so fast and inexorably that no one has a chance to stop her and inquire what she's doing there. She knows exactly where she's going to. She turns a corner, and steps inside an open door and closes it behind her.

INT. ETHAN'S ROOM. DAY

He is sitting in bed, an ice bag on his head, drawing a picture of Supergirl on a piece of cardboard. He is in pajamas and robe.

Selena steps beside the bed. He looks up.

					ETHAN
				Oh no, not you again.

					SELENA
				What an adorable hat.

					ETHAN 
				They think I have a concussion.

					SELENA
				And you think you're in love.

					ETHAN 
I know it.

	SELENA
This "love" of yours will soon wear off. I gave you 
a temporary love potion.

ETHAN
				Why should I believe you?

					SELENA 
				It's the truth. In twenty-four hours you'll forget all 
about that girl.

Ethan. reaches out and grabs her cloak with a grip of such urgency that she is pulled slightly off balance.

					ETHAN
				Then I'm not the only one who saw her. You did too!

Selena pulls his hand away from her cloak.
SELENA
				Yes, yes I saw the whole thing. How could you be 
interested in that puny little girl?

	ETHAN
But she is real, it wasn't just a concussion.

	SELENA
Forget her, you're mine. I saw you first.

Selena sits on the side of the bed. She removes a vial of liquid from her bodice.
I saw you

SELENA 
                (continuing)
	Here. Drink this. It's an antidote to the love drug I 
gave you.

Ethan sweeps it on the floor, where it shatters. He starts frantically ringing the buzzer pinned to his bed.

ETHAN 
Nurse! Nurse!

SELENA
You can't escape from me that easily. I'm afraid 
you don't know who I am.

	ETHAN
Nurse!

	SELENA
Don't think I'm weak, just because I'm a woman. I have 
Power. Give in, stop fighting me, Ethan. I always get 
what I want.

ETHAN 
Nurse! Help !

The door opens and a NURSE walks in.

					NURSE
				Would you stop screaming. There are sick people trying 
to sleep.

ETHAN
				Get her away from me.  She's crazy.


					NURSE 
                   (to Selena) 
Are you family? Visiting hours are over.

SELENA
				They're over for you sweetheart.

Selena removes the gargoyle-shaped box from her sleeve and opens the lid. The OMEGAHEDRON inside spins and sends out a powerful force, which slides the nurse backwards out the door and pins her to the wall of the corridor outside. The door slams shut. Selena closes the lid of the Coffer and turns to Ethan.

SELENA
				Now you see who you're dealing with.

Ethan scrambles out of the bed and away from her, backing toward the window.

ETHAN 
Leave me alone.

Selena, at the bed, discovers his sketch of Supergirl on the piece of cardboard.

					SELENA
				This is your problem, right here. This girl's driving 
you insane, Ethan. Let me help you.

	ETHAN
I don't want your help.

	SELENA
Come back to my house. My car's outside.

Selena reaches out a hand to Ethan.

					ETHAN
				No!

					SELENA
				I never met a man I couldn't have--and you're no 
different from the rest!

The door opens behind her and TWO SECURITY OFFICERS push  inside, with guns drawn.


SECURITY OFFICER
				Okay, what's going on in h--



Selena gestures with the gargoyle box at the men and their guns fly out of their hands and up to the ceiling. The men stare at the ce1ling, astonished. Ethan takes advantage of the distraction to dash out through the open door. Selena turns to look at Ethan escaping and the
guns fall to the floor and discharge. The security men run into Ethan's bathroom, slamming the door behind them.

Selena ducks out into the corridor.

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR

Ethan is running away down the corridor. Frightened patients peek out of their rooms. The nurse who was ejected from the room cringes in fear as Selena emerges into the corridor.

Ethan dodges past two orderlies who are pushing a HEART-LUNG MACHINE down from the surgery. Selena raises the gargoyle box and points it at the HEART-LUNG MACHINE.

SELENA
				Power of Shadow---seize him.

The HEART-LUNG MACHINE comes to life---its lights flash, its array of tubes tipped with needle probes writhe like Medusa's hair, its wheels turn around, and it chases  Ethan down the corridor. Selena laughs her deep throaty chuckle of triumph. Ethan looks behind, sees the machine chasing him and cries out with alarm. A CART OF SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS rolls out of a closet in front of him, its scalpels standing up and pointing at him, quivering eagerly, blocking his path.

Ethan dives through a swinging door to his left.

INT. OPERATING THEATRE

A team of surgeons and nurses are bent over a patient on the table. Ethan runs through in the background. The surgeons continue with their work. The heart-lung machine wheels through after him, followed by the scalpels flying through the air like a swarm of hornets.

The surgical team doesn't look up from their work.

Several cylinders of anesthetic gas tear themselves loose from the wall and trundle away out of the room after Ethan and the other apparatus. One of the nurses finally looks up.

NURSE
				Doctor, I think you' re going to have a gas 
problem.

	DOCTOR
I shouldn't have had the cabbage at lunch.




INT. X-RAY ROOM

Ethan bursts into an empty surgical X-Ray room---the pursuing apparatus visible a few yards behind. He slams the heavy lead-lined door and bolts it shut.

He hears the thud of the apparatus beating impotently against the door. He leans against the door panting, his cotton hospital gown and robe soaked with cold sweat. Suddenly, with a whir of motors, the giant multi-armed C.A.T. SCANNER behind him comes to life, its lights glowing, and reaches out its chrome steel arms toward him.

Ethan yells, runs across the room, climbs on a gurney, rips a metal grill off the wall, and dives into the air conditioning duct.

INT. DUCT

Ethan scrambles noisily along inside the metal duct as if all the fiends of hell were after him.

CUT TO:


INT. LUCY'S HOSPITAL ROOM

Lucy is showing off the controls of her bed. The door opens. Lucy, Jimmy and Linda look with amazement at what's outside in the corridor.

LUCY
				Omigod.

A DELIVERY BOY enters with A SPECTACULAR FLORAL ARRANGEMENT.

DELIVERY BOY 
Where you want this?

	LUCY
Over by the window. It must be from my sister. Give him 
a tip, Jimmy.

Jimmy is acutely aware how pathetic his daffodils look as he fumbles in his pocket for a dollar for the delivery boy. Suddenly overhead there is a loud banging and clattering from the air-conditioning duct. Everyone looks up at the ceiling with alarm. But Linda's X-RAY VISION lets her alone recognize Ethan.

					JIMMY
				Gosh, what do you suppose .that is?

					LINDA
				Well, Lucy, it's nice to see you're feeling better. Nice to 
meet you, Jimmy.

	LUCY
You're not gonna stay for the ice cream?

	LINDA
I have to get back. I'm having dinner with the Danvers.

	LUCY
Again? You're getting real tight with them. You're gonna 
be a straight-A student---just kidding, thanks for coming.

Her phone rings and she picks it up.

LUCY
				Phillip! When are you gonna come see me?

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR

Linda walks out of Lucy's room and quickly down the corridor. Jimmy hurries to catch up with her.

JIMMY
				Can I give you a lift?

LINDA 
Oh, no thanks.

	JIMMY
It's no trouble. I'd like to ask you some more questions.

Linda's heart sinks as she realises she doesn't know how to get rid of him politely.

CUT TO:

EXT. ROOF OF HOSPITAL SUNSET

Ethan batters the top off a ventilator and crawls out onto the roof. He turns and quickly replaces the aluminum top, bashing it firmly closed with his fist. He straightens up, sweat-soaked, bedraggled, haggard and exhausted, looking like an escaped lunatic with his disheveled hair and his torn hospital robe. He heaves a sigh of relief, and turns to see Selena standing behind him, her silk cape billowing in the breeze.

SELENA
				Give up?

Ethan  takes a beat to make sure he's not hallucinating, then he summons new reserves of strength and runs over to the TALL BRICK SMOKESTACK from the hospital's incinerator.

ETHAN
				Never! 

He starts to climb up the steel ladder on the side of the chimney.

					SELENA
				What goes up must come down.

EXT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE. SUNSET

Jimmy opens the door of his car for Linda. It's parked in the ambulance zone, right behind 
Selena's Cadillac.

JIMMY
I probably would've got a ticket without this press pass 
on the windshield. Does Clark get many tickets?

Linda pauses, looking up at the sky.

LINDA 
      (distractedly)
I wouldn't know. Look. Up in the sky.

Jimmy follows the direction of her gaze.

INSERT. THEIR P. O . V. OF THE ROOF

Ethan clings to the iron ladder on the side of the chimney, his robe fluttering in the wind.

BACK TO SCENE

JIMMY 
An escaped wacko! What a picture!

Jimmy opens the trunk of his car, takes out his camera bag, removes his Nikon, and starts fumbling around trying to change his 50mm lens for a telephoto. Linda watches Ethan with an expression of growing concern on her face.

EXT. ROOF OF HOSPITAL 

SELENA
				Come down from there, you foo1...

EXT. LADDER ON.THE SIDE OF THE CHIMNEY

Although she is forty feet below him, Ethan hears her voice as though it were inches away from his ear.

SELENA
      (continuing)
...before you get blown off and kill yourself.

Ethan is so surprised at hearing her voice so close that he looks around with a start, misses his footing, and nearly falls off the ladder.

EXT. HOSPITAL ENTRY.  JIMMY'S CAR

Jimmy gasps with anguish, as he struggles to mount his telephoto lens, dropping lens caps, film boxes, and filters all over the place.

LINDA 
Someone's chasing him.

	JIMMY
Say---you think that's the same guy who was in the 
accident with Lucy?

LINDA
				Yes.

					JIMMY
				The scoop of the year!

He starts shooting film. His motor drive whirrs.

EXT. HOSPITAL ROOF

SELENA
				It'll be dark soon. And cold. Come down while you've 
got the chance.

EXT. TOP OF CHIMNEY

Ethan reaches the top of the chimney. He climbs over the lip of the brickwork and stands up, half hidden in the thick white smoke belching from the chimney.

ETHAN
				No. She'll come for me. Like she did the last time. 
My angel. 

He starts to cough from the smoke and nearly loses his balance.

EXT. ROOF OF HOSPITAL

SELENA
				She's not coming for you. I killed her. She's dead.

EXT. TOP OF CHIMNEY

Ethan is staggered by this news. He reacts as though he had been punched in the gut.

ETHAN
				No. I don't believe you. It's not true. She's alive 
somewhere. My angel. My love--


He falls off the chimney, and catches himself on the lip of the brickwork. He hangs there by 
one hand.

SELENA'S VOICE 
You idiot!

EXT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE. JIMMY'S CAR

Jimmy runs out of film. He frantically rips off the magazine and tries to load a fresh one, while Ethan dangles.

					JIMMY
				There goes my Pulitzer Prize.

Linda steps around to the other side of his car. Bianca is staring up at the chimney from the driver's seat of the Cadillac. She doesn't see Linda lift up a sewer grating with her toe and drop noiselessly and suddenly out of sight into the storm drain below.

EXT. ALLEY BEHIND HOSPITAL

A red and blue streak bursts upwards out of another storm drain. The iron cover flips off and lands with a clang as Supergirl flies skyward toward the roof.

EXT. TOP OF CHIMNEY

Ethan's grip fails and he falls.

EXT. CHIMNEY. SKY

Supergirl appears, snatches Ethan in mid-air, and flies off with him into the clouds above.

EXT. ROOF OF HOSPITAL

Selena reacts with relief---then, realizing who has saved him, her face clouds with resentment.

EXT. HOSPITAL ENTRY

Jimmy Olsen's magazine pops open and film unspools out of his camera as his motor drive whirrs.

JIMMY
Darn!

He turns to Bianca, who is looking up in the sky from beside the Cadillac.

JIMMY
				Hey lady, did you see that?

Bianca gives him a glance of contempt.

BIANCA
				See what?

					JIMMY
				The girl---dressed like Superman--caught that guy in 
mid-air.

	BIANCA
Really? Maybe you should check into the hospital and 
have your head examined.

EXT. HIGH IN THE AIR ABOVE THE HOSPITAL. SUNSET

Supergirl carries Ethan beside her, her arm tight around his upper chest, his arm over her shoulders. They are above the clouds bathed in the rich warm glow of sunset. He looks at her ecstatically, his eyes drunk with love.

ETHAN
				You're alive! She didn't kill you! 

					SUPERGIRL 
Who didn't?

	ETHAN
That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because 
she knows I love you.

	SUPERGIRL 
You love me?

	ETHAN
My angel. My goddess. I feel I've always loved you all my 
life. I'll die if I can't spend the rest of my life just looking 
at you, holding you in my arms... 

	SUPERGIRL
We have to have a long talk about all this.

	ETHAN
I know just the place. Hang a left at the Amalgamated Tower.

 EXT. HOSPITAL ENTRY. TWILIGHT

Selena comes striding out 'of the hospital, scowling. Jimmy Olsen notices her, and senses her 
aura of power. He drops his useless Nikon into his camera bag and starts rummaging for another camera.

BIANCA
				Home?

					SELENA
				No way. I'm not going to let that little hussy make a 
				monkey out of me.

					BIANCA
				      (shrewdly)
				Is it her that's bothering you--or your gardener?

Selena looks at Bianca with wounded dignity.

					SELENA
				I use men, but I'm not addicted to them. I can quit 
whenever I want.

She gets in the back seat of the car, just as Jimmy Olsen snaps a photo of her with a Polaroid. Selena slams the car door and Bianca drives off. Jimmy examines the instant photo he just took. His eyes widen with wonder and the hair prickles on the back of his neck as he sees the image.

INSERT: THE POLAROID IN JIMMY'S HAND. THE PICTURE OF SELENA ENTERING HER CAR, BUT BEHIND HER THERE IS A HIDEOUS LOOMING SHADOW---MUCH LARGER THAN WHEN NIGEL SHOWED IT TO HER.

CUT TO:

EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK. NIGHT

The park is deserted, in darkness. One by one the lights come on, outlining a1l the structures in jewel-like, fairyland colours. It looks strangely familiar. On some deep level there is a resemblance to Argo City.

THE CAMERA PANS over to reveal Ethan standing beside the huge fairground switch boxes, turning on the lights. Supergirl stands beside him.

ETHAN
				This is my favourite place in the city.

					SUPERGIRL
				Are you sure it's all right for us to be here?

					ETHAN
				They don't care, they're tearing it down for a 
shopping centre.

He flips the last switch, which starts the Ferris wheel revolving slowly, like a great spiral galaxy in space. Soft music plays.

ETHAN
				Like it?

					SUPERGIRL
				Yes. It reminds me of home.

					ETHAN
Where Superman's from? Krypton?

	SUPERGIRL
No. Argo City. It was on a chunk of rock that was part of 
Krypton once---but we moved it to inner space.

	ETHAN
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

	SUPERGIRL
It's not important. The important thing is I'm here to 
find something and I think you can he1p me.

	ETHAN
Come on, let's ride.

They walk to the slowly revolving Ferris wheel and hop aboard one of the gondola cars.

ETHAN
				I used to work here summers when I was a kid.
				
SUPERGIRL
				Ethan, tell me more about this woman who's after you.

					ETHAN
				Let's talk about us, not her.

					SUPERGIRL
				Tell me where I can find her.

					ETHAN
				I don't want you to go near her. She's bad news.
			


Ethan puts his arm around her shoulders, casually, no big deal.

SUPERGIRL
				But be reasonable. If I don't do something to stop her 
she'll try again. And maybe hurt you.

	ETHAN
I'll be safe with you. We can stay together the rest of 
our lives.

	SUPERGIRL
We can't do that.

	ETHAN
Why not ?

	SUPERGIRL
We're from different worlds.

	ETHAN
Just give me a chance to show how much I love 
you. Love changes everything. Love makes 
everything possib1e.

EXT. ENTRANCE TO AMUSEMENT PARK. NIGHT

Selena gets out of her Cadillac and walks to the chained and locked gate. A big sign says KEEP OUT. CONDEMMED PROPERTY. FUTURE SITE OF FUNFAIR MALL SHOPPING PLAZA. She mutters something under her breath and the chains fall away, the locks click open, and the gate glides noiselessly ajar. Se1ena strides in imperiously.

EXT. TOP OF FERRIS WHEEL

SUPERGIRL
				All this talk about love, it's silly.

					ETHAN
				You don't like me? You hate me?

There is such a look of tragedy on Ethan's face, that Supergirl is afraid he might instantly fling himself to his death if she said yes. 

SUPERGIRL
				Of Course I don't hate you. I  don't hate anyone.

ETHAN
				What do you feel about me?


					SUPERGIRL
				I...I don't know. This is all so sudden.

THE CAMERA RACKS FOCUS FOR A MOMENT TO DISCOVER :

Selena, lurking.be1ow them in the shadows of the Spine Snapper Ride.

ETHAN 
				There's one sure way to find out how you feel.

SUPERGIRL 
What's that?

	ETHAN 
Let me kiss you.

SUPERGIRL
				No.

					ETHAN
				You're not afraid are you?

					SUPERGIRL
				Of course not, but...there are things we don't understand.

ETHAN
				If we wait until we understand everything we'll be dead.
Come on. You can learn more from one kiss than from 
years in school.

	SUPERGIRL
Well...I guess one is all right.

She closes her eyes, parts her lips, and leans forward.

SUPERGIRL 
Is this how?

	ETHAN
Terrific.

Their lips meet. Zowie.

					SELENA
				What a touching scene!

Her voice is like having a bucket of ice water dashed over you. Ethan and Supergirl pull apart. The Ferris wheel has carried them all the way around and back down again. Selena is standing beside them. Supergirl stands up and steps boldly out of the gondola to confront her.

SUPERGIRL
				Who are you ?

					SELENA
				I am Selena. Give him to me. Now. Or you'll both 
be sorry.

					SUPERGIRL
				I don't scare that easily.

Selena rummages down deep in her handbag and pulls out the gargoyle box.

SELENA
				All right, Miss Know-it-all. If I can't have him, 
nobody can.

She holds the gargoyle box out toward the Ferris wheel.

SELENA
				Coffer of Shadow, show your Power!

INSERT C.U. OF THE BOLTS HOLDING ETHAN'S GONDOLA TO THE FERRIS WHEEL: THE BOLTS UNSCREW AND FALL OUT.

BACK TO SCENE

Ethan yells as his gondola falls off the Ferris wheel and down onto the tent, which covers the DODGEM CARS.

INT. DODGEM CARS TENT

He falls through the tent and onto the electrified floor below. The wooden gondola shatters on impact. Ethan sits up, dazed by the fall, and sees a dodgem car painted like the face of a vicious football player heading toward him. Ethan scrambles away on his hands and knees. Another hideously painted car attacks him, and another, and another. He dodges and scuttles around desperately. Finally he manages to climb aboard one of the cars.

EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK

Supergirl reaches out to seize Selena. But Selena holds up the gargoyle box and is surrounded by an impenetrable, glowing shield of force. Supergirl tries to push through, the shield in vain.

Supergirl flies to the little fence made out of steel spikes surrounding the Haunted House. At super speed she rips up the entire line of fence posts and hurls them like javelins at Selena.



Selena dissolves her force field and tries to run away, ducking and dodging the rain of javelins. She turns too quickly and the GARGOYLE BOX slips out of her hand and rolls underneath the deck of the carousel. Selena moans with despair, and pauses, reluctant to leave without the box. This is the opportunity Supergirl needs. The fence posts bury themselves in the ground in a perfect circle around Selena---effectively imprisoning her.

SUPERGIRL
				That ought to keep you out of my hair for a while.

SELENA 
A cheap trick.

	SUPERGIRL 
Cheap but effective.

INT. DODGEM CAR TENT

Ethan is holding on to his car desperately as all the other cars viciously ram into it. Suddenly his car is lifted up, carried through a hole in the tent roof, and off into the night sky.

ETHAN
Supergirl'?

He looks under the car. There she is, carrying him to safety. She smiles reassuringly.

EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK

Selena is trapped inside the ring of posts, fumbling in her bag. One by one she takes out dried herbs, feathers, dusts, and flings them at the bars while she shouts magic word. Nothing works.

SELENA
				Yookoohoo! No, that's not it. Sis-o-reb! Nope. 
Ka-ma-hoochie!

Bianca appears out of the shadows. Selena looks up, embarrassed.

					BIANCA
				Sure glad you didn't let make a monkey of you.

					SELENA
				Shut up, and get me a hacksaw.

Bianca pauses uncertainly.

BIANCA
				Why don't you use the Coffer of Shadow?


					SELENA
                  (evasively)
I don't feel like it right now.

					BIANCA
				She didn't take it from you, did she?

					SELENA
				That little girl? Ha.  Now go on, get me some tools.

BIANCA
				There's no need. I learned the Craft from my 						grandmother.

Bianca takes out a bundle of twigs from her pocket and strokes the bars of the fence with it.

BIANCA 
Sycoraka f'kah s'koo...

The bars fall down like boiled spaghetti. Selena steps out of the circle of confinement with queenly dignity.

SELENA
				Good. Now bring the car. We must call a meeting of 
the seven.

Bianca bows.

BIANCA 
Yes, mistress.

Bianca hurries off toward the parking lot. Selena watches her until she turns the corner of the Haunted House. Then Selena kneels down and carefully reaches under the deck of the carousel for the GARGOYLE BOX.

					SELENA
				There you are. Come to mama.

She takes out the box, s1ips it inside her cloak, and stands up. She casts a last glance around the scene of her defeat, and strides off after Bianca.

EXT. TROPICAL BEACH. DAY

Supergirl lands Ethan in his battered dodgem car on a beautiful, deserted tropical beach. Palm trees wave over a white sand beach. The blue ca1m of a lagoon mirrors huge white clouds that hang motipn1ess on the horizon like colossal snowy mountains. Gaily-coloured parrots screech in the branches of blooming hibiscus and jacaranda. Ethan gets out of his carnival ride and gazes around w1th awe at the beautiful scene.

SUPERGIRL
				I thought I'd show you one of my favourite places.

					ETHAN 
It's paradise . We could be very happy here.

SUPERGIRL
				But I have to go back. I brought you here so 
you'd be safe. From her.

	ETHAN
You can't just abandon me.  Alone.

His words strike a sensitive nerve in her. She relents.

SUPERGIRL 
I'll stay for a while.

Ethan is filled with enthusiasm.

ETHAN
				Great! I'II build a house-- right over there, with 
a veranda looking out to sea. And I'll plant a 
garden! Papayas, pineapples, bananas, mangoes---
anything'll grow here. And I'II fish in the lagoon, 
and we can go sailing in a dugout canoe, and---

	SUPERGIRL 
Ethan---when I said 'a while' I meant a couple of hours.

Ethan's face falls. He looks at her beseechingly.

SUPERGIRL
				Well, maybe a little longer than that.

She smiles and takes his hand. Together they walk along the beach.

CUT TO:



EXT. SELENA'S MANSION. NIGHT 

Rolls Royces, limos, and Maserattis parked in the driveway. It looks like a meeting of the ostentatious car club. A helicopter lands on the front lawn. The ELDERLY MAN from the garden party gets out and walks across the lawn toward the house with the aid of a cane. Behind him the helicopter takes off again. Selena opens her front door and confronts him angrily.

SELENA 
You're late.

	ELD ERL Y MAN
The President was giving a speech. I couldn't just 
walk out.

	SELENA
You're more afraid of the President than me???

	ELDERLY MAN 
No, of course not.

INT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM. CANDLELIT. NIGHT

Waiting for her are an extraordinary group of people, all of whom we met or glimpsed briefly at the garden party. Bianca is talking to ERICA, a red-haired female dwarf. A proud, barefoot AMERICAN INDIAN WOMAN in fringed doeskin is talking to a muscular, young BLACK MAN in a cashmere suit with lots of gold and diamond jewelry. NIGEL is sulking in the bar, his face covered with tannisroot ointment.

Selena enters with the Elderly Man in the banker pinstripe. They all form a circle in the centre of the room.

					SELENA
				Let us begin. I invoke the rule of seven.

OTHERS IN UNISON 
The Circle is complete.

	NIGEL
You better have a pretty good explanation for 
this, Selena.

	SELENA
We are in great danger. A being has come to Earth 
with powers far beyond those of anyone member of 
the Craft.

	INDIAN WOMAN
But Superman has been away.

	SELENA
It is not Superman I speak of, but his cousin Kara. She 
knows we exist..

	ELDERLY MAN
Then she must be destroyed.

	NIGEL 
How did she find out about us?

	ELDERLY MAN
That is unimportant. Now that she knows, she will 
become curious and learn more. When she learns 
we plan to restore the ancient religion of this planet 
and avenge the centuries of persecution---she will 
try to stop us.

	BIANCA
We must destroy her first.

	ERICA
But how can we destroy her?

SELENA
				By the Rite of Ultimate Power. One person must 
volunteer  to take on the combined power of us all.

Nigel stands up and points an accusing finger at Selena.

NIGEL
You! You want to take our power for yourself!

Selena reacts calmly, speaking in low, modulated tones, as if to an overstimulated child.

					SELENA
				Nige1, you know the one who takes on Ultimate 
Power must sacrifice the last sparks of her own spirit.

Selena takes hold of a golden chain hanging around her neck and draws out a little glass vial attached to it. Inside the glass vial a tiny spark glows brightly.

					SELENA
	 			      (continuing)
				Which of you is willing to make that sacrifice?

					NIGEL
				You would! You revealed our existence so you could 
have all of our power.

	SELENA
Maybe you'd like to get rid of this Supergirl yourself, 
Nigel?

	NIGEL
Why get rid of her at al1? You've used the Coffer 
of Shadow too much.  It is beginning to rule your heart.

	SELENA
Nonsense.

Nigel pulls aside the heavy veil covering her mirror.

FOR AN INSTANT SELENA SEES HER REFLECTION IN THE MIRROR. BEHIND HER LOOMS THE DARK, EVIL PRESENCE, INVISIBLE TO THE OTHERS IN THE ROOM, AND MUCH LARGER THAN WHEN SHE GLIMPSED IT AT HER GARDEN PARTY.

Then Bianca leaps to the mirror and pulls the veil back across it. Bianca stands challenging Nigel, daring him to try again. Selena looks at the gargoyle-shaped Coffer of Shadow, sitting beside her hearth. It too seems much larger than when we last saw it at the hospital. Selena wonders for a beat if maybe Nigel is right. Can the Shadow be ruling her?

BIANCA 
Enough quibbling. Let us vote.

They all draw their sacred white-handled knives out of concealment in their clothing. Nigel defiantly places his on the floor with its blade pointing inward. Then one by one, the others put down their knives with the blades pointing outward. They all look at Nigel. His shoulders sag with dejection.

 					SELENA
				I invoke the rule of seven. Do you agree?

Nigel speaks with the voice of someone pronouncing his own death sentence. 

NIGEL
I have no choice.

His knife turns by itself on the floor until its blade points outward. Everyone joins hands in the circle. A fire springs to life on the hearth. Someone starts to chant in a strange ancient tongue. Slowly the heavy, opulent living room begins to change: the carpet becomes the floor of an ancient stone temple with dark brown stains splattered across its massive granite blocks, the walls start to melt away. Outside the windows the dark night is replaced by hot, brutal sunlight pounding down on an endless desert stretching away to the horizon.



The house completely dissolves and is replaced by monumental stone ruins. The smoky fire crackles and sends its dark plumes boiling skyward. The only thing remaining of Selena's house is the hearth and the Coffer of Shadow. Selena stands up And walks out of the centre of the circle toward the Coffer. She opens the lid. She pulls the glass vial off the golden chain 
around her neck and drops it into the Coffer.

CUT TO:

EXT. TROPICAL BEACH. DAY

Ethan wanders along the beach with Supergirl, holding hands. She stops to pick up a seashell. Ethan clutches his head as if he has a sudden violent headache, moans, and collapses on the sand. Supergirl kneels beside him.

					SUPERGIRL
				Ethan, what IS wrong?

Ethan opens his eyes and looks at her. He speaks in a voice of bleak despair.

					ETHAN
				She said it wouldn't last.

SUPERGIRL
				What wouldn't last? What's the matter with you?

Ethan sits up, wincing like someone with a bad hangover.

					ETHAN
				I don't love you any more.

SUPERGIRL 
Just like that?

	ETHAN
Like turning off a light.

He struggles to his feet and stands there unsteadily.
					
					ETHAN
				I feel awful. All that romantic garbage. All that 
mushy talk.

He lurches off into the undergrowth, toward the interior of the island. She plunges into the vegetation keeping pace with him.

SUPERGIRL 
Where are you going?


ETHAN 
Away. From you. 

	SUPERGIRL
But why?

ETHAN
				Because you remind me of all the dumb things I said.

					SUPERGIRL
				I sort of like what you said.

					ETHAN
				That makes it worse.

					SUPERGIRL
				But I don't understand.

He stops and stares at her for a moment.

					ETHAN
				Of course you don't. We're from two different 
worlds, remember?

He stalks off into the jungle, leaving her behind, hurt and bewildered.

CUT TO:

INT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM/PAGAN TEMPLE. NIGHT

A barbaric ritual. Selena's companions sway and gyrate to the sound of gongs and drums. The floor is covered with a red mist. In the middle of a column of fire a figure like Selena seems to float. The ritual reaches its climax and everything pauses for a moment of sti11ness.

Selena steps forth from the column of fire. She is clothed in a shimmering garment---white with flashing highlights of rainbow iridescence. The six other members of her group fall to their knees in awe. Selena seems to glow with an inner radiance. She laughs, and the pagan temple around her changes back to the living room of her house in Midvale. In her shining gossamer gown and her new aura of majesty, she seems too large, too powerful to be contained in the familiar surroundings of her house.

SELENA
				At last. Ultimate Power.

					BIANCA
				And the first thing we do is get rid of Supergirl!

					SELENA
				What do you mean we?

She turns on the kneeling six. They cringe from her. Selena raises her hands and the kneeling six cry out in fear.

CUT TO:

EXT. BESIDE A STREAM. TROPICAL PARADISE. DAY

Ethan is sitting beside a stream on a gravelly bank idly tossing pebbles into the water. Supergirl steps out of the jungle and watches for a moment. Then she comes and sits down beside him.

ETHAN
				Hi.

					SUPERGIRL
				Hello. Are you still mad at me?

					ETHAN
				I'm not mad at you.

					SUPERGIRL
				It seemed that way to me.

					ETHAN
				I know I was acting funny---I'm sorry. It's just...I miss it.

					SUPERGIRL 
Miss what?

ETHAN
				What I had before. What's not there now. It's like I 
woke up and found part of me wasn't there any more:
something that made me feel really alive and aware of 
things. It was like, for the first time in my life, everything 
fitted together perfectly---you and me and the world 
around us--like we were a wonderful song...

He falls silent, and tosses a few pebbles into the stream.

SUPERGIRL
				And now?

					ETHAN
				And now...the guitars are out of tune, and the words 
don't make sense, and somebody unplugged the mike...



	SUPERGIRL
Well...I don It know much about these things, but maybe 
if you had that feeling once...it can, come back. 

He turns to her hopefully.

					ETHAN 
You think so?

	SUPERGIRL 
I don't see why not.

	ETHAN
But what if---it wasn't real? 

SUPERGIRL
				Feelings are real. Once you've had them, they're yours 
forever.

Ethan's face lights up. The future begins to exist for him again.

					ETHAN
				Hey, listen, when all this blows over, maybe we 
could get together every now and then and see each 
other. And maybe something might. happen again. 
What do you think?

	SUPERGIRL
Are you asking me for a "date"?

ETHAN
				Why not? You're a good-looking girl. And I'm---
available.

	SUPERGIRL
Aren't you forgetting about Selena?

	ETHAN
She'll forget about us eventually.

							CUT TO:

INT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM

In the polished surface of her mirror, Selena makes a scene appear: Ethan and Supergirl on the tropical island.



SUPERGIRL
      (image)
There's something very dangerous about her. Something evil...

	ETHAN
        (image)
I know what it is. She has this lead container shaped 
like a gargoyle. Inside there's a silvery ring...

CUT TO:

EXT. TROPIAL ISLAND

Supergirl becomes very excited.

					SUPERGIRL
				That's the Power Source that was lost from Argo 
City! That's what I came: to find! Where does she live? 

	ETHAN
In this big old house on Orchard Avenue---but you better 
stay away from there.

	SUPERGIRL
I can see through walls. I could surprise her. The only 
thing I can't see through is lead, that's why I didn't 
see the Power Source at the amusement park.

She stands up.

					ETHAN
				Wait. Don't leave me.

SUPERGIRL
				You'll be safe here. I'll come back as soon as I have 
the Power Source.

He stands up and takes her hand.

ETHAN 
Before you go...

	SUPERGIRL
What?

	ETHAN 
Just one kiss. For old times' sake.


	SUPERGIRL
And you can see how you feel about me, right?

	ETHAN
Yes.

She closes her eyes and parts her lips. Slowly their lips come together and touch. Then a sudden rush of sheer desire flows through them and the simple experimental kiss become an ecstatic prelude to the heights of lovemaking. But before either one of them can go one step further, ETHAN DISAPPEARS WITH A FLASH OF BLINDING WHITE LIGHT. A cloud darkens the sun, and the trees are lashed into a frenzy by gale-force winds. Selena's laughter can be heard from somewhere far away.

					SUPERGIRL
				Ethan!

Supergirl flies into the air.

EXT. TROPICAL ISLAND. SUNSET. SKY ABOVE ISLAND. DAY

Supergirl flies around the island very fast at high speed, searching for Ethan and Selena. She hovers like an eagle for a moment, then speeds straight upwards.

EXT. ABOVE THE OCEAN. DAY

Supergirl flies back to North America, faster than she has ever flown before.

EXT. ABOVE MIDVALE. DAY

Supergirl zeros in on Selena's house like an exocet.

EXT. SELENA'S FRONT LAWN

Supergirl lands and walks cautiously up to the front door, ready for anything but what she finds: the front door is ajar. She pushes it open with a creak of its massive hinges. She walks slowly inside.

INT. SELENA'S MANSION. FRONT HALL/LIVING ROOM

Supergirl looks around. The house seems deserted and drastically neglected. Cobwebs hang over everything. The dust has the thickness of a hundred years. Moths have eaten away all the splendid tapestries. Rats cavort along the baseboards. Bats sleep in the chandeliers. In the living room Supergirl finds Bianca crouched in A Corner, gibbering mindlessly. Bianca too has changed: she is dressed in rags, and her wild staring eyes are rimmed with dark circles. When she sees Supergirl she cries with fright.

SUPERGIRL
				Hey take it easy. I won't hurt you.

BIANCA
				I thought .it was her, coming back. Spared me. 
But I thought. . . maybe changed her mind. 
Nigel warned us. Wouldn't listen to him.

	SUPERGIRL
What are you talking about? Where's Selena?

BIANCA
				No. Don't want to know. She's bad. Don't go near her.
				Hurt you.

SUPERGIRL 
I have to find her. Tell me.

Supergirl looks into Bianca's eyes with her calm, heroic gaze, and Bianca comes somewhat to her senses. Bianca points to the adjoining bar. Supergirl walks over warily and sees FIVE GOLDEN CAGES suspended among the bottles. Nigel and the four remaining members of the Circle are imprisoned in them, shrunken but alive. Nige1 is in a perpetually turning squirrel wheel. He sees her and calls out.

NIGEL
				Supergirl! She's waiting for you. On Taliesen Mountain. 
Stop her before it's too late!

Supergirl gets a look of determination on her face. She turns and flies out through the French doors and heads straight up into the air.

INT. SELENA'S NEW HOUSE (A MOUNTAIN-TOP PALACE) 

Ethan is in a dark, shadowy place, bound to a stake with stout cords. Sticks of wood are piled all around his feet. Selena stands beside him in her shining gown of power. She looks even more gorgeous and cruel than before. She offers him a glass of water to drink, but he turns his head away violently.

					ETHAN
				I'm wise to your tricks, lady.

					SELENA
				I could force you.

					ETHAN
				If that worked, you would've done it already. No, 
you want me to drink it of my own free will. Well 
let me tell you, sweetheart, it'll be a cold day in hell 
before I fall for that one again.

	SELENA
Go on,  talk big! I'll soon have you purring like a kitten.


She puts the glass of water in a, basket at the end of an iron chain hanging down from above. There is a straw in the glass at such an angle that Ethan can just reach it with his lips if he stretches as far as possible.

SELENA
				You've been without water for a whole day. Let's 
see how thirsty you get in a week.

	ETHAN 
You vicious--

	SELENA
Careful, don't make me angry. I start fires when I'm angry.


She glances meaningfully at the faggots piled around his feet and walks away.

THE CAMERA FOLLOWS HER revealing that she has been talking to Ethan inside the mammoth fireplace of her living room. Her new house is enormous. Where before she lived in a mansion, now she dwells in a palace. The fireplace is seven feet high, the living room floor is wide as a football field, and. the French windows into the garden now tower like the windows in the North transept of Chartres Cathedral. Selena disappears out the imposing portals which lead to the wet bar and butler's pantry--each now the size of a basketball court.

Back in the fireplace, Ethan cranes his neck to make sure she has gone, then reaches out toward the glass hanging nearby. He pokes the straw with his forehead. The glass swings slightly. The glass swings close enough for him to bump it with his forehead and set up a rhythm. He gauges the swing of the glass and, at the precise moment, grabs for it with his mouth. He catches hold of the rim of the glass with his teeth and holds it there for a moment as he summons his courage to do what must be done. He bites hard on the rim of the glass with his teeth.

The glass shatters and falls to the floor with a crash, leaving Ethan with a small fragment of the rim in his mouth and a trickle of blood down his chin. He leans his head over until it is directly above his left hand tied to the stake two and a half feet below his shoulders. A droplet of blood falls into his hand. He drops the glass fragment down to his hand and catches it. He grins, and sighs with relief. Then spits to clear his mouth. Slowly he saws. at the ropes that hold him with the sliver of glass in his left hand. One by one the strands part.

Ethan strains against his bonds and the weakened rope snaps. He quickly disentangles himself from the coils and steps out of the fireplace. He looks around the mammoth room. The coast is clear. He spits a few bits of glass out of his mouth, and dashes out of the doors
to the garden.




EXT. SELENA'S HOUSE. GARDEN.  CONSERVATORY

Ethan sees a green plastic garden hose, which the gardener has left running in a trickle to irrigate the hydrangeas. Ethan remembers that he is very thirsty. He picks up the hose, rinses out his mouth hurriedly, and then takes long, desperate gulps of the water. Behind him he hears Selena's laughter. He drops the hose as if stung by an electric eel and turns to see her emerge from behind a large strangler fig.

INSERT ETHAN'S P.O.V.

The same effect as when he drank the love potion the first time. The plants of the conservatory swirl and distort in garish nightmare colours. At the centre of his vision is an area of crystal clarity surrounding Selena. She approaches him seductively, fully confident of her power. As she comes nearer, the clear area expands and drives out the visual chaos. Selena speaks, and her voice is a close-miked throaty purr.

SELENA
				I told you I'd win.

BACK TO SCENE

Ethan is held by the spell of her magic. And yet there is part of him that still resists. You can see him try to turn his head away from the vision of ideal beauty before him, and then give in as she comes closer and I touches him with her hand. A zap of energy passes between them at her touch.

SELENA
				Kiss me.
	
He embraces her roughly and crushes her lips with a kiss. He is filled with a tigerish lust that thrills her deeply. She rakes her long red fingernails across his back and moans with pleasure.

EXT. ABOVE THE MOUNTAINS. DAY

Supergirl flies over the Rockies toward Selena's house.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. TALIESEN MOUNTAIN. SELENA'S NEW HOUSE. DAY

Supergirl flies over Selena's new house. For the first time we can see the enormousness of it: 
a grotesque, towering monstrosity, that seems to brood threateningly over the landscape.

EXT. GARDEN BEHIND SELENA'S NEW HOUSE. DAY

Supergirl lands and walks toward the towering French doors of the living room. But something distracts her. She turns and enters the gigantic conservatory to her right.


INT. CONSERVATORY

Supergirl looks around and sees in the middle of the conservatory a reflecting pool surrounded by exotic plants. She walks closer and looks down into the reflecting pool. In the bottom of the shallow pool she sees Ethan securely bound. His eyes stare wildly. Dead or drowning.

SUPERGIRL
				Ethan!

She leaps into the shallow pool, and sinks over her head. A polygonal section of the surface of the reflecting pool detaches itself from the water and rises up perpendicularly. It is a door to the Phantom Zone. Supergirl is trapped behind an impenetrable force field, looking out in despair. Ethan is not there with her. His image has disappeared. 

The real flesh and blood Ethan appears with Selena from behind the strangler fig. They look in at Supergirl trapped behind the shimmering polygon that la ads to the Phantom Zone. Selena laughs at her, but Ethan stares as if at a long forgotten acquaintance whose name he is trying to recall.

Selena notices Ethan's wandering attention and she puts her arms possessively around him.

SELENA
				Enjoy your prison, Supergirl. It's forever.

Supergirl calls out to Ethan, her hands and face pressed against the transparent wall of her prison, but no sound can escape the impenetrable force field.

INT. PHANTOM ZONE DOOR

Supergirl is seen in reverse, beating on the hard crystalline surface of the prison.

SUPERGIRL
				Ethan! Don't let her do this!

Beyond the threshold of the zone, Selena in her conservatory kisses Ethan with fierce lust. He returns her , emotion, forgetting all about Supergirl.

SUPERGIRL
No. No. It isn't true.

The image of Selena and Ethan begins to recede, getting smaller and smaller, until it vanishes entirely in infinite blackness.

EXT. SPACE

The flat two-dimensional polygon that is Supergirl's prison whirls away through space. Behind the transparent surface we can see Supergirl's face stained with tears.

EXT. PHANTOM ZONE 

Another kind of reality. Unlike anything we have ever seen. The crystal prison lands on the ground of the Phantom Zone and shatters. Supergirl picks herself up from among the fragments of her prison and looks around. The landscape is utterly strange and alien, with a feel of stark, oppressive sterility. As far as the eye can see there is no sign of life. Supergirl stands up and raises her arms to fly. She hops into the air about eight inches and lands flat-footedly on the sand. With a shock she realises SHE CAN'T FLY.

She hops a few more times, with no more success.

She picks up a small rock from the ground. She tries to crush it in her hand. She can't. Angrily she hurls it from her as far as she can. Instead of disappearing into infinity it drops at her feet a few yards away. She scoops up some sand from the ground and holds it cupped in her hand. She takes a deep breath and tries to blow it away. She is barely able to disturb a few grains. She drops the sand and sits down on a rock, forlorn and dejected.

Suddenly she hears Alura's voice, very faint and coming from a long distance away.

 ALURA'S VOICE 
Kara, where are you?

	KARA
Mother? I can hardly hear you.

	ALURA. S VOICE
Kara! You're alive. We were so worried. You disappeared 
from the scanners...

KARA
				I'm lost, Mother. In some awful place. I can't fly anymore. 
And I'm weak.

	ALURA'S VOICE
Kara, you must not give up. We must retrieve the 
Power Source. The City is dying.

					KARA
				Then send someone else. I failed.

					ALURA'S VOICE
				We can't. The' dimension barrier is stronger. We no 
longer have the power to push through.

KARA
				But Mother, I'm lost. 

					ALURA' S VOICE 
You must try. . . it's cold. And dark. . .

The rest of her sentence fades out, and is lost. 

KARA 
Mother---I tried. I really tried.

Kara puts her face in her hands and starts to sob hopelessly.

EXT. UNITED NATIONS, NEW YORK. DAY

Establishing shot. 

INT. GENERAL ASSEMBLY

The DELEGATE FROM URITANIA is going on (in Esperanto) denouncing the latest outrage against his peace-loving country. A few bored DELEGATES of various nationalities
are sprawled in their seats listening to the simultaneous translation over earphones. The dign1fied PRESIDENT of the General Assembly is sitting on the dais behind the ranting delegate. With a FLASH OF LIGHT and a chok1ng cloud of sulfur fumes, Selena appears beside the podium. She is in her shimmering white robe. The dozing delegates wake up with amazement. The URITANIAN delegate stares at her with his mouth open as she slides him away from the microphone. 

INT.  TRANSLATOR"S BOOTH . GENERAL ASSEMBLY

Inside the translator's booth, the entire panorama of the enormous hall is visible through the glass window. The eight TRANSLATORS stop translating and stare at the scene below.

BACK TO GENERAL ASSEMBLY

Selena is about to speak in the microphone, when two SECURITY GQUARDS attempt to step onto the podium. Selena reaches out toward them. A field of force from her hands stops them in their tracks, knocking them backwards off the steps to land on their butts. The delegates gasp at this act of magical violence.

SELENA
				Nations of the world! I bring you tidings of a new age!

The President of the General Assembly starts to shout at her and bang on the podium with his gavel. Selena looks over her shoulder with mild annoyance. Instantly the President's gavel turns into a live eel. The President drops it with horror. Selena continues her speech.

SELENA
				I bring you a return to the ancient true worship of 
Nature, our Sovereign Queen and Mother. And 
I bring you myself as her representative here 
on Earth.

The URITANIAN suddenly recovers his wits and tries to place a hand on Selena's shoulder. A whirlwind hurls him off the podium into the desks of the front row delegates. The delegates babble in consternation but keep to their seats. Selena raises her voice to be heard over the uproar.

SELENA
				From this moment forth, all science, religion and other
				unnatural beliefs are forbidden. And in their place I 
will teach the One True Way of our ancient 
grandmothers.

The President of the General Assembly has recovered enough from the surprise of the eel to 
interrupt Selena.

					PRESIDENT
				You are talking about the end of Civilisation as we 
know it.

	SELENA
And it's about time too.

	PRESIDENT
I do not know who you are, or what evil force 
you represent, but it will take more than a
few threats from you to make mankind turn back 
the clock and abandon thousands of years of progress.

Selena has listened with a mocking smile as he speaks. He finishes to a smattering of applause from some of the delegates.

SELENA
				Threats? I don't need threats to destroy civilisation. 
I have something better.

She snaps her fingers in the air. Immediately a RAIN OF MONEY BEGINS TO FALL ALL OVER THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY. PAPER MONEY AND COINS OF ALL NATIONS. Selena looks at her work with pleasure. Then she disappears in a FLASH OF LIGHT.

The delegates blink with astonishment. The only trace of her presence is the tang of sulfur in the air---and the money. One delegate forgets his dignity and starts scooping up money from his desk and stuffing it into his pockets. Suddenly all the delegates are doing the same thing. The only exception is the delegate from the United Kingdom who thinks it might be beneath his dignity, and looks about with mild disapproval.

CUT TO:



EXT. THE PHANTOM ZONE

Supergirl walks across the rolling monotony of the Phantom Zone. We have never seen her like this before: sweating, her hair unkempt, streaks of dirt and grit on her face, exhausted and full of despair. She stumbles at the crest of a low ridge and falls down to the bottom of the slope, banging her head on a rock. She sits there, a big rip in her ,uniform, rubbing her bruised forehead. It is hard to imagine her any worse off.

She hears a sound, vaguely familiar. She looks around for its source. She follows the sound, crawling slowly along the base of the ridge. The sound gets louder and as she, approaches. It is a sound of celestial, spiritual beauty: the music of the spheres.

Suddenly she comes out into a tiny valley in the Phantom Zone and sees before her the most beautiful sight she could imagine. The harsh monochromatic sterility of the Phantom Zone gives way to a riot of bright colours. A dome-like building protrudes from the ground. All around it are gorgeous singing sculptures in the style of Argo City. A sculptor. in the clothing of Argo City is modeling a glassy statue with a matterwand. He turns and catches sight of Supergirl. It is Zaltar.

SUPERGIRL
				Zaltar.

Zaltar drops his wand and comes running over to Supergirl. He kneels beside her on the sandy ground.

ZALTAR
				Kara? Is it you?

Supergirl nods. She is obviously exhausted. Zaltar takes the bulb full of liquid off his belt and offers her a drink. She drinks thirstily of the refreshing green liquid, and feels strength returning to her body.

SUPERGIRL 
What is this place?

	ZALTAR
This is the Phantom Zone. But why did you 
come here from Argo City?

	SUPERGIRL 
I was on Earth...

	ZALTAR
Earth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself?

	SUPERGIRL
Yes. I went there to find the lost Power Source...


	ZALTAR 
Shouldnt've done that.

	SUPERGIRL
...but the person who has it. tricked me, and sent me 
to the Phantom Zone.

	ZALTAR
It's dangerous to use a Power Source on Earth. It can 
unleash all sorts of terrible forces---

	SUPERGIRL
I know.

	ZALTAR
Well, nothing we can do about it. Come into my house. 
You can stay with me, until I build you your own 
place. I expect you won't want to mix with the others--
not our type of people.

He helps her to her feet and over to his house, a sort of Argonian gothic cathedral half-buried in the sand. The curves of the arches and the materials are strongly reminiscent of Zaltar's work on Argo City.

					SUPERGIRL
				Others?

					ZALTAR
				Criminals.

Zaltar gestures vaguely to the horizon on his right.

					ZALTAR
				A few hundred parasangs that way. I avoid 
them. And you should too.

Zaltar leads Supergirl past the singing sculptures. She smiles as she passes them, and remembers his "tree" in Argo City.

SUPERGIRL 
...mid pleasures and palaces though I may roam..."

	ZALTAR 
What? Palace? Hardly.

	SUPERGIRL
Just feels, a little, like a tiny bit of Argo City...


ZALTAR
				Yes. Can't seem to get away from that style. 
Must try something new.

INT. ZALTAR'S HOUSE

He helps her down a long spiraling staircase to the floor of a high domed room. In the centre of the room is a huge round table cluttered with tools, models and unfinished projects.

SUPERGIRL 
It's lovely. . .

	ZALTAR
No, no. Not lovely. 'Perfect'. Did everything 
just right. Nobody telling you to change this, 
move that around. Please yourself. That's 
the secret of happiness.

	SUPERGIRL
Are you happy, Zaltar?

ZALTAR
				What kind of a question is that? Of course: I am. I do 
whatever I want. All the time.

	SUPERGIRL
But what about other people? Don't you miss them?

They have reached the ground floor. Zaltar plucks one of the liquid filled bulbs from the stem of a large plant growing in a niche in the wall. He squirts some of the green liquid in his mouth with great satisfaction.

					ZALTAR
				I look at them all the time. Every planet in the galaxy. 
It's quite boring. Here, rub some of this onto that bruise.

He carefully applies some of the green liquid to the wound on her scalp.

SUPERGIRL
				You look at them? How?

					ZALTAR
				The Phantom Zone overlooks everywhere.. If you 
have the right tools.

Zaltar sweeps the clutter off the table and onto the floor.



He passes his hand over the table and instantly the table turns into a WINDOW INTO ANOTHER WORLD, showing an image of a herdboy riding on the back of a water buffalo in a rice paddy.

ZALTAR
				There you see? What could be more boring than that?

He waves his hand, and the image disappears.

SUPERGIRL
				Wait. Could...could I see the place I just came from?

Zaltar sighs with great martyrdom, and starts to fiddle with his controls.

					ZALTAR
				It'll only make you sad. 

He shows her the proper hand gestures to control the image.

					ZALTAR
				This goes closer. This moves it around. And 
this begins.

He gestures with his hand and the WINDOW OPENS again. Supergirl ZOOMS THE IMAGE IN as fast as she can, trembling with desperate urgency. The IMAGE ON THE TABLE DISSOLVES FROM HIGH ABOVE A CITY DOWN TO :

EXT. WALL STREET.  DAY

The financial district. Bank clerks are shoveling money out the windows of several large, imposing banks. Passersby ignore the bonanza, and trudge dejectedly on.

INT. STOCK EXCHANGE. DAY

Chaos and pandemonium on the floor. Not the everyday chaos and pandemonium you always see. Brokers are trying to strangle one another. Fist fights. Bloody noses. The crunch of breaking knuckles.

EXT. SUPERMARKET.  DAY

People are waiting in line with wheelbarrows full of money. The store manager shakes his head and sends them away. The only people he lets in the store are a man with a live turkey under his arm, a little old lady carrying a Rembrandt in a nice gold frame, a woman who gives him her fur coat and a man with an antique clock.





EXT. HIGH ABOVE SELENA'S NEW HOUSE. TALIESEN MOUNTAIN.  DAY

The CAMERA ZOOMS DOWN and DISSOLVES THROUGH THE ROOF TO:

INT. ANTE ROOM IN SELENA'S NEW HOUSE

A mob of dignitaries and petitioners is waiting anxiously outside the large imposing doors to Selena's reception room. Generals in uniform, diplomats wearing their medals pinned ,on their formal suits, bankers in pin stripes, and the robed ecclesiastics and holy men of various faiths. A secretary opens the door to the reception room, and the dignitaries all surge forward.

					SECRETARY
				No more audiences today. Go home. All 
of you.

Through the open door Selena can be glimpsed sitting .on her throne-like chair, with Ethan kneeling at her feet, resting his head in her lap like  a pet animal.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. SELENA'S SITTING ROOM

The secretary closes the doors leaving Ethan and Selena alone. She strokes his head. Outside crowds can be heard chanting her name: "Selena! Selena!"

SELENA
				They want me. Doesn't it make you proud?

					ETHAN
				Yeah.

Selena gets up and walks over to the door leading out to her balcony.

SELENA
				Coming?

Ethan follows her sullenly.

EXT. BALCONY

They walk out onto the balcony. The crowds scream her name. She waves smiling. Ethan stands a step behind her with a moody expression on his face.

					SELENA
				Smile, lunk-head. You're not a gardener any more, 
you're Prince Ethan now.

Ethan lifts his hand and waves half-heartedly.

EXT. GROUNDS OF SELENA'S NEW HOUSE.  BENEATH THE BALCONY

The crowd is enormous, held back behind police barricades. Guards in the special livery of Selena's service hold back the surging tide of humanity: people .praying, chanting, walking on their knees, cripples on crutches, the ailing on stretchers carried by relatives. And in front a disciplined youth group in a distinctive costume perform chants and fanatic cheers. Huge banners display Selena's portrait. Images of her are everywhere.

INT. ZALTAR'S HOUSE. PHANTOM ZONE

Supergirl reels with shock at the scene 

SUPERGIRL 
That horrible woman!

	ZALTAR
Told you. Wouldn't listen to me. Knew it would 
make you sad.

He starts to gesture the image away, but she puts her hand on his arm, stopping him.

SUPERGIRL
				No. I have to see this.

Zaltar shrugs.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. HAMBURGER HEAVEN. MIDVALE. DAY

The roadside complex where Lucy's traffic accident occurred. The Hamburger Place is boarded up. The area is almost deserted and no cars pass on the street. All of the huge advertising billboards along the way are now covered with pictures of Selena. The only writing is in mystic symbols. A lone figure walks furtively along the street. It is LUCY LANE, her face disguised with dark glasses. She goes to the rear of the abandoned Hamburger Place and knocks four times. The door opens quickly and she ducks inside.

INT. HAMBURGER HEAVEN. DAY

The restaurant has been converted into a clandestine print shop. A few serious teenagers are working the press and turning out seditious handbills. Freshly printed pages are hung on clothes-lines so the ink can dry. "THE TRUTH ABOUT SELENA" is the headline over JIMMY'S PHOTO of her getting into the Cadillac with her huge shadow looming behind. Lucy crosses to Jimmy Olsen, who is tying up bundles of handbills.

LUCY
				I had to dump the papers in a trashcan. The Danvers 
have been arrested!

					JIMMY
				How do you know?

					LUCY
				I saw them dragged out of the Administration Building.

					JIMMY 
Did anybody notice you?

	LUCY
I can't help it if men notice me.

	JIMMY
Lucy! Be serious. We could be executed for  treason!

She kisses him on the nose.

LUCY 
Just kidding. Nobody saw me.

Jimmy gives her another bundle of handbills. HELMETED GUARDS in the livery of Selena's service kick down the door. and rush in, weapons drawn. They smash up the print shop and arrest everybody. Jimmy and Lucy are handcuffed and dragged away.

INT. PRISON

The Danvers and all the teenagers from the print shop are crowded into tiers of barred cells set into the walls of a dark, enormous cavern. Jimmy and Lucy huddle together for warmth in one of the tiny cells.

JIMMY
				I sure wish Superman was around. He wouldn't 
let any of this go on. Not for one minute.

	LUCY
I wish they'd tell us what they're going to do with us.

JIMMY
				I heard stories.  I don't think you wanna know.

There is the clank of an iron door, and Ethan enters the prison with several of the guards in Selena's livery. He walks past the cells, glancing now and then with compassion at the poor wretches inside. Lucy calls out as he passes.

LUCY 
Hey! Ethan!

	ETHAN
Hmmm?

LUCY
				Remember me? We were in a disaster together.

					ETHAN .
				Oh yeah, the girl in the hospital, on the other stretcher.

					LUCY
				Right! Say, do you swing any weight around here?

					ETHAN
				A little.

					LUCY
				Can you get us out? It's all a misunderstanding. We 
thought they were selling hamburgers in that place.

	ETHAN
I'll mention it upstairs.

He turns to go, but Jimmy reaches out and grabs his sleeve.

					JIMMY
				The blonde girl who saved your life---where 
is she now?

Ethan pauses. Buried memories rise to the surface of his mind, bringing pain.

ETHAN
				She's gone. No one will ever see her again.

CUT TO:

INT. ZALTAR'S HOUSE IN THE ZONE

Supergirl waves her hand over the table angrily, decisively. The WINDOW of the Zone closes, and the image of Ethan disappears. She crosses to Zaltar, who is reclining on a couch in an adjoining room, getting drunk on the green liquid from the plant bladders.

SUPERGIRL 
Zaltar, please help me.

	ZALTAR
Of course, my dear. What can I do?

	SUPERGIRL
Help me to get back to Earth. Where my friends are. 
They need me.

Zaltar looks pained, and takes several deep drinks of green plant sap before he answers.

					ZALTAR
				There's no way out of the Zone. No one's ever escaped. 
That's why they send the criminals here.

SUPERGIRL
				If there's a way in, there must be a way out.

					ZALTAR
				No, that's not true---there's well...no--

He suddenly has an idea, vaguely forming at the back of his drink-sodden brain. He toys with it, while Supergirl leans forward eagerly, waiting. He changes his mind several times about whether it's possible or not, each time changing his facial expression. Supergirl has the feeling she's watching a debate conducted by squints and grimaces.

ZALTAR 
There is a way.

	SUPERGIRL 
I knew it!

	ZALTAR
But it's impossible.

	SUPERGIRL
Why?

	ZALTAR
No, it wouldn't work, you couldn't, it's too---
if it didn't work you'd be swept into a singularity---
no, you'd never make it. Forget I mentioned it.

Supergirl's heart sinks. She rocks back, clutching her knees, trying not to show her sadness.

					ZALTAR
				I could do it.

She is suddenly all excitement and hopefulness again.

SUPERGIRL 
Then teach me how.

	ZALTAR
No, it's no good---you can't practice--- you only get 
one go. A thing like that. No. Sure you don't want a 
sip of this? It's delicious, I think.


He takes another sip of his drink.

SUPERGIRL 
Tell me how. to do it. If you could do it, I can.

He looks at her shrewdly, appraising her abilities with a suddenly lucid glance.

ZALTAR
				Takes a long time, you know, learning the wand. 
Just begun to understand it myse1f. Give things a 
kind of life--can also take away life; works backwards 
too. Besides I can't let you take my wand. Only have 
the one, what would I do? I'd be helpless. It's 
out of the question.

	SUPERGIRL
Then come with me.

					ZALTAR
				Leave the zone? What would I do on Earth?

					SUPERGIRL
				You could do anything. You could sculpt 
mountain ranges...draw with rainbows! 
You'd have superpowers.

	ZALTAR
 Superpowers. Got you in a lot of trouble, didn't they?

	SUPERGIRL
Please. I have to get back to Earth. My friends are 
in trouble. And unless I bring back the Power 
Source, Argo City will die.

He looks at her kneeling beside his couch, tears streaming down her cheeks, pleading with him.

ZALTAR
Oh, all right. Stop crying. Let's go.

He stands up, takes his matterwand, and heads for the stairs up to the surface. Supergirl can hardly believe her plea has been granted. She runs after him, up the stairs.

SUPERGIRL
				You're going to take me back?

					ZALTAR
				Going to try. Didn't say I could.

EXT. ZALTAR' S HOUSE. PHANTOM ZONE

They emerge from the circular doorway out onto the flat monotonous terrain of the zone. Zaltar pauses for a moment to get his bearings, then strikes out with long energetic strides. Supergirl hurries to keep up with him.

SUPERGIRL
				I heard my mother ask you once "how could a 
man with such a selfish heart create beauty?" 
She was wrong, Zaltar, you have a generous 
heart.

	ZALTAR
Not doing this for you. Just sick of this place, 
that's all. Wretched singing sculptures, always yowling 
at you. Boring!

Supergirl scampers along beside him, smiling. Zaltar never looks back at his abandoned house, but keeps his gaze fixed on the horizon straight ahead.

INT. SELENA'S NEW HOUSE. HALLWAY

Ethan is walking down the hall and sees guards dragging Lucy Lane and Jimmy Olsen in chains. Lucy calls out to him.

LUCY
				Hey, I thought you were gonna mention us upstairs.

ETHAN
				I did.

					LUCY
				     (bitterly)
				Well thanks a pile, fella.

Ethan watches them dragged away. He has a puzzled expression on his face.

INT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM. DAY

Ethan enters. Selena is staring into her magic mirror. Her face is white with fear.

ETHAN 
What's going on?

Selena snaps irritably at him.

SELENA 
Guess! Go on.

ETHAN
				I don't know. You seem afraid.

					SELENA
				You're a regular Einstein, aren't you?

					ETHAN
				     (the truth dawns on him)
				Supergirl?

Selena doesn't answer, but looks back at the mirror. Ethan moves to her side and watches with her the IMAGE OF THE PHANTOM ZONE.

INT. PHANTOM ZONE/QUANTUM VORTEX

Zaltar leads the way, firming their path with the matterwand, and then hauling himself and Supergirl forward over an upward sloping, undulating surface. Behind them luminescent waves of energy can be seen, like the ocean at the base of a steep cliff, constantly sweeping backwards and downwards, away from their goal.

INT. SELENA'S NEW LIVING ROOM

Selena looks up and realises Ethan is behind her, looking intently at the image.

SELENA
				Quit staring so hard. You'll strain your eyes.

She puts her hand on his cheek. He turns away from the image of Supergirl and looks deep in 
Selena's eyes.

					ETHAN
				You're not going to hurt her, are you?

Selena is furious. Her eyes get that dangerous look.

SELENA
				You can't put her out of your mind, is that it?

					ETHAN
				Well...I guess I can't.

					SELENA
				I'm ready for her. I'll show you.

Selena walks out the French doors followed by the dazed Ethan.



EXT. CONSERVATORY. DAY

MR. & Mrs. Danvers, Lucy Lane, and Jimmy Olsen are imprisoned in four metal cages hanging over the reflecting pool in the conservatory. The ropes that keep the cages from falling into the pool are GIGANTIC GOLDEN SERPENTS, their tails around an overhead beam, and the jaws tightly locked on the tops of the cages. A fifth cage hangs there empty. The water in the reflecting pool has changed colour to an opaque yellow. Selena shows the arrangements to Ethan.

SELENA
				Unless Supergirl agrees to go away forever, the 
serpents will drop them one by one. 

Selena puts a small silver whistle to her lips and blows a high, melodious note. The fifth serpent opens his jaws and releases the empty cage into the pool.

INSERT: REFLECTING POOL

The empty cage lands in the water and is instantly eaten up by the most powerful acid imaginable, leaving nothing but froth and acrid fumes. Ethan looks down into the cool at his reflection distorted by the spreading ripples. 

BACK TO SCENE

ETHAN
				Why the empty cage?

SELENA
That one was for you. But I thought I'd wait and 
see how you behave when Supergirl gets here. I'd 
hate to lose you, Ethan.

Selena steps beside him and puts her hand on his shoulder. Ethan cries out with terror. Selena looks down at what he sees.

INSERT: REFLECTING POOL

Behind Selena, distorted almost beyond recognition by the ripples on the surface, is a GIANT MONSTROUS SHADOW-BEING, ITS ARMS OUTSTRETCHED, ALMOST ENVELOPING HER, but invisible except in reflections.

BACK TO SCENE

Selena steps away from the pool, shaken by the sight.

ETHAN
				What...?


					SELENA
				You don't get this far without paying...a 
certain price.

She turns and walks quickly out of the conservatory, followed by Ethan.

MR. DANVERS
				If only I hadn't made that speech denouncing her.

MRS . DANVERS
I'm not afraid to die. I'm proud of you.

She stretches out her hand through the bars and clasps his bravely. Lucy turns her face away to give them some privacy in their. final moments. Jimmy is looking at her.

					JIMMY 
       (shyly)
I've been in love with you for years. Remember 
how you used to visit your sister in the newsroom? 
And put your fingerprints on my lens.

LUCY
				Remember? I was trying desperately to get you're 
attention.

	JIMMY
You were? You mean we could've been... you-know-what...
all this time?

	LUCY 
You bet your ass.

	JIMMY
Why didn't you tell me?

	LUCY
You're supposed to guess.

She reaches out her hand through the bars and clasps his bravely, like the Danvers.

INT. THE PHANTOM ZONE/QUANTUM VORTEX

Zaltar is continuing his climb, but the way is getting steeper, and he is tired and short of breath. He pauses.

					SUPERGIRL
				Why are you stopping?


					ZALTAR
				Stopping? Was I? Silly. One thing you 
musn't do.

He continues forward, and upward, firming their path with the matterwand. The wand creates a warm circle of white light around them in contrast to the monochromatic energy field of the Phantom Zone. Because of the inherent curvature of the Phantom Zone vortex, they seem to be scrambling up a sheer vertical wall now. Supergirl is close beside Zaltar helping him along, not merely following as she had before. The throbbing sound of energy waves surging down the vortex is growing louder as they proceed. Zaltar stumbles, and drops the matterwand.

ZALTAR
				Oh dear!

The vortex starts to sweep the wand backwards, down to where they have just climbed from.  Supergirl makes a desperate lunge and retrieves the wand as it sweeps past. But now she is being swept backwards.

ZALTAR 
The wand. Use it.

Supergirl somehow finds the right grip on the controls and points the wand at the undulating surface beneath her. She stills the moving surface and stops her backwards motion.

					ZALTAR
				Good girl! That's the way!

But now Zaltar is being swept backwards toward her. She points the wand at his feet and halts his downhill slide.

					ZALTAR
				You can use the wand.

					SUPERGIRL
				Better than when I was a child.

She hands it back to him and they resume their slow upward progress.

ZALTAR
				I remember you then. Cute thing you were. Like 
your mother.

CUT TO:





INT. SELENA'S NEW LIVING ROOM

Selena stands watching the image of Zaltar and Supergirl in her mirror. Beside her on the floor is the Coffer of Shadow, now swollen to the size of a large pumpkin. It pulses and glows with inner light. The lid of the Coffer of Shadow starts to rattle as if something inside is attempting to get out.

INT. THE PHANTOM ZONE/QUANTUM VORTEX

Flaming spheres of BALL LIGHTNING begin to whizz past Zaltar and Supergirl. Zaltar is startled, and he stops his forward progress.

ZALTAR
				What's that? Never saw anything like that.

					SUPERGIRL
				Don't stop. Keep moving.

					ZALTAR 
Yes, mustn't stop.

	SUPERGIRL
       (grimly) 
 It's Selena. I'm getting so I can recognise her work.

Another flaming sphere whizzes toward them. It hits Zaltar on the shoulder and knocks him off the safe path. He starts to roll backwards down the vortex.


SUPERGIRL 
Zaltar. Use the wand!

ZALTAR
				Too late. Too late. Save yourself.

He is being swept faster and .faster away from her, receding like the image of Ethan when she was trapped in the zone. Zaltar throws the wand to her, and then is swept away, out of sight, downward to his death. He calls out after he disappears.

ZALTAR 
  				       (voice over) 
Goodbye...

	SUPERGIRL
Zaltar!

She begins to be swept backwards, but she uses the wand, and stops her slide. Gripping the wand fiercely, she starts to forge ahead. All the while she has to dodge the flaming spheres that Selena sends down the vortex.

SUPERGIRL
				You're not going to win, Selena. I won't let you.

Suddenly Supergirl enters another area of the vortex. She begins to move forward, upward, without clawing her way. She accelerates, moving faster and faster.

EXT. GRASSY MEADOW BESIDE A POND

Supergirl lands, in a deserted sunny meadow. She collapses sobbing on the grass. The matterwand lies beside her.

SUPERGIRL
				Zaltar, Zaltar. You never had a selfish heart.

She looks up at the sun shining down serenely, bathing the Earth in its life-giving rays---and returning her superpowers to her.

SUPERGIRL
				Wherever you are, Zaltar, thank 'you.  

She stands up and flexes her muscles. She no longer looks tired or disheveled. Her red and blue costume shines in the bright sunlight. She picks up the matterwand and leaps into the air, flying faster than a speeding bullet.

EXT. ABOVE SELENA'S NEW HOUSE. TALIESEN MOUNTAIN

Supergirl swoops down from the sky and dives through the roof.

INT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM

Supergirl smashes through the ceiling and lands next to the French doors. Ethan and Selena are standing against the opposite wall, next to the veiled mirror.

SUPERGIRL
				You've had your fun, Selena, the game is over.

					ETHAN 
She has hostages.

	SELENA
The Danvers. And two of your little friends.

	SUPERGIRL
It's just one more crime you'll have to pay for.

Ethan points to the conservatory and mimes the words 'out there'. Selena blows on the silver whistle on the chain around her neck.

INSERT: THE SERPENT HOLDING JIMMY OLSEN'S CAGE OPENS ITS MOUTH AND THE CAGE DROPS AWAY.

BACK TO SCENE

Supergirl blows an enormous blast of superbreath out the French doors.

INT. CONSERVATORY

Jimmy Olsen's cage is blown away from the acid bath and he lands in a bank of ferns.

JIMMY
				Hey, what gives?

The blast of superbreath blows the cages of Lucy and the Danvers away from the pool as well. The serpents loose their grip, arid the Danvers and Lucy land beside Jimmy in the fern bank.

INT. LIVING ROOM. DAY

Selena witnesses the destruction of her hostage scheme.

SELENA
				All right, Supergirl. The game's not over till 
the last card's dealt.

Selena opens the lid of the grotesquely swollen Coffer of Shadow sitting beside her on the floor. The OMEGAHEDRON inside spins.

All the FURNITURE in the room suddenly launches itself at Supergirl. Huge oak refectory tables, alabaster thrones, marble urns, iron firegrates, shie1ds and armour, bronze statuary, and razor sharp panes of glass from the windows all shatter themselves against her invulnerable body. Ethan stands in the corner, ducking the stray fragments that come his way.

SUPERGIRL
				You've run out of things to throw, Selena.
	
					SELENA
				Not yet.

Selena points her hand at Supergirl with a gesture of attack. The COFFER OF SHADOW emits a dense black mist that darkens the room. A giant invisible hand seizes Supergirl and hurls her into the alchemical bar with a crash of bottles. Supergirl stands up with the wand held in front of her to ward off another attack.

ETHAN
				It's her shadow-self! Her dark side!

SUPERGIRL
				How do I fight it?

					ETHAN
				Turn it against her.

Supergirl raises the wand and APPLIES IT TO HER OWN BODY. THERE IS A FLASH OF BLINDING LIGHT, and Supergirl is transformed into a perfect image of Selena---as she was at the fairgrounds.

There are now two Selenas in the room---the real one beside the Coffer of shadow, and the one holding the matterwand in the alchemical bar. The Real Selena is first astonished, and then furious.

REAL SELENA
				Power of Shadow, kill her!!

The Second Selena calls out to the SHADOW-SELF in Selena's own unmistakable voice.

SECOND SELENA 
No. I am your mistress. Do not harm me.

REAL SELENA 
Don't listen to her! Kill her! She's lying.

	SECOND SELENA
You are my shadow, you must obey me.

The Real Selena is distracted by the duel of willpower with her double and doesn't notice Ethan creeping along the wall toward the Coffer of Shadow.

Ethan lunges for the shining OMEGAHEDRON inside, and snatches it out just as the heavy lid slams shut with a clang of metal. Ethan rolls over and over on the floor, away from Selena, clutching the, shining ring to him like a football in the end zone after a quarterback sneak on a fourth down trailing seven to six with three seconds on the clock.

ETHAN
				I've got it! The Power Source!

The Real Se1ena cries out with despair.

And then the SHADOW attacks her. The Real Selena cries out as she is surrounded by a black mist that starts slowly choking the life out of her.

REAL SELENA
        (terrified)
No! Stop! Please!


Ethan hands the Power Source to the Second Selena in the bar. 

					SECOND SELENA
				Thank you. I'll take this back to Argo City.

					ETHAN
				It is you, then, really?

Without a word, the Second Selena kisses him on the lips.

SECOND SELENA
				Well?

ETHAN
				It's you all right.

					SECOND SELENA
				I'll make it easy for you.

She again APPLIES THE WAND TO HER OWN BODY. There is a flash of light, and once more Supergirl stands before him, clutching both the Power Source and the wand.

					ETHAN
				I couldn't help what I did, before. She drugged me.


					SUPERGIRL
				I never doubted you for a moment.

					REAL SELENA
				Supergirl. Please! Help! I'm dying...

Supergirl steps toward the corner of the room beside the mirror where the Real Selena is imprisoned in the cloud of blackness. Supergirl touches the SHADOW with her wand. There is a cosmic musical chord, and the SHADOW is destroyed; it falls to the floor in a rain of hard, dark cinders.

The Real Selena rises from the corner of the room where she was released from the grip of the shadow. She looks at herself in the mirror. She is changed into the softer, more innocent person she was at the picnic before she found the Omegahedron. THERE IS NO MORE EVIL SHADOW LOOMING BEHIND HER IN THE MIRROR REFLECTION. She turns to Supergirl and Ethan.

SELENA
				I'm free. I can never thank you enough.

SUPERGIRL
				For what?

				
Selena points to the glittering OMEGAHEDRON Supergirl holds.

SELENA
				Ever since I found that thing I've been like 
a prisoner in a terrible nightmare. You have 
no idea how awful it is to be mean all the time.

SUPERGIRL
				Your nightmares are over. I'm taking this back to 
Argo City where it won't be misused.
         (to Ethan)
You could come too. It might be safer for you.

ETHAN
				No thanks. I have friends in the resistance. They'll 
vouch for me. I figure I might get a million bucks 
for my memoirs.

					SUPERGIRL
				I'll come back as soon as I can.

					SELENA
				What about me? They'll make, hash out of me around 
here.

Supergirl and Ethan exchange a glance. Selena's innocence is the one problem they have not foreseen.

ETHAN
				She's right. They'll string her up.

SUPERGIRL
				Do you want to come to Argo City?

SELENA 
				What's it like?

SUPERGIRL
				It's the most beautiful place in the universe.

SELENA 
				Sounds O.K. to me. Let's go.

Supergirl holds out the matterwand to Selena.

SUPERGIRL
				Grab hold of this. It forms a force field for the 
journey through inner space.

Selena grasps the matterwand and the two of them fly together out the French doors.

CUT TO:

INT. PRISON. DAY

Supergirl and Selena fly through the prison. Supergirl melts open the locks with BEAMS OF HEAT VISION.

The prisoners climb out of their cells cheering and rejoicing.

EXT . HAMBURGER HEAVEN. GAS STATION. DAY

All the people of Midvale are enthusiastically chopping up the billboard portraits of Selena and throwing them into a bonfire in the middle of the street. Statues, banners, mystic symbols, giant tarot cards, old uniforms of her palace guards and youth group --every last remnant of her regime joins the blaze. People are smiling, dancing, holding hands, drinking: the atmosphere is like a block party on the first week in spring.

CUT TO:

EXT. HIGH ABOVE THE SEA.

SUNSET

Selena and Supergirl fly over the ocean toward the setting sun.

SELENA 
Where is inner space?

SUPERGIRL
				It's everywhere. But water is always 
the door.

They plunge down into the sun's reflection on the sea surface.

EXT. INNER SPACE

Supergirl and Selena fly together through the dark reaches of inner space. Supergirl is tired but triumphant. The OMEGAHEDRON glows brightly in her hand. Selena looks around her with awe and wonder.

SELENA
				Will they be angry with me for 
stealing the Power Source?



	SUPERGIRL
They'll be grateful. If you hadn't found 
it, it would still be lost. Look, up ahead.

SELENA
				Yes, I see it. Shining like a jewel.

					SUPERGIRL 
				That's home.

P.O.V. OF SUPERGIRL AND SELENA

Argo City floats ahead, seeming to welcome them, its lights, growing brighter and brighter as they return with the lost Source

          FADE IN ON:

          EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT -- MOVING

          A DISTORTED IMAGE of downtown city streets at night.
          This is not a FISHEYE LENS, but the REFLECTION in the
          mirrored surface of a helmet visor.

          EXT. LUXURY BUILDING - NIGHT

          A near-future MOTORCYCLE stops near a dramatic HIGH-RISE
          RESIDENTIAL BUILDING. The rider, clad in black leather,
          climbs off his machine. We'll call him the ASSASSIN.
          He flips up his VISOR. His face is scarred, stubbly. He
          conceals himself in an alcove, eyes never leaving the
          building's entrance.
          A uniformed DOORMAN opens the high-rise's lobby door for
          a HANDSOME YOUNG MAN in a TUXEDO and TRENCHCOAT.
          THE ASSASSIN has been waiting for this. He removes what
          looks like a rifle scope from his jacket, aims it at

          TUXEDO.
          SCOPE POV - focusing on TUXEDO'S FACE, magnified. A
          digital readout: "SCANNING..." Then a long SERIAL
          NUMBER reads out and the name, "LIONEL ALEXANDER CANTER,"
          along with other personal information below.
          THE ASSASSIN puts away the scanner scope, satisfied. He
          reaches a hand into a pocket, withdraws a mysterious
          DEVICE. The size of a first generation cellphone, it has
          a military look, with a clear sliding panel over safety
          switches and buttons.
          The ASSASSIN hurries toward TUXEDO, but before he can

                         REACH HIM--
          A sleek, futuristic LIMOUSINE pulls up and TUXEDO gets in
          the back. They're gone in an instant.
          The ASSASSIN, frustrated, dashes for his MOTORCYCLE. He
          starts it and pursues the limousine.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2.

          EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT

          THE MOTORCYCLE pursues the LIMOUSINE along the Potomac,
          D. C. LANDMARKS visible in the distance.

          EXT. KENNEDY CENTER - NIGHT

          FORMAL CROWDS, a RED CARPET, signs for an OPERA. The
          LIMOUSINE approaches.

          INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT

          TUXEDO leans forward to the DRIVER, a muscular, handsome
          man in a suit named ARMANDO.

                         TUXEDO
          I'm not really in the mood for
          opera, Armando.
          ARMANDO nods knowingly pulls back into traffic.

                         ARMANDO
          F Street?

                         TUXEDO

                         (UNDOING BOWTIE)
          You read my mind. Let's not
          mention this to my Dad...
          As he speaks, he passes a few BILLS over the seat.

          EXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - NIGHT

          THE LIMO moves through this seemingly deserted area,
          pulls up near a STEEL DOOR with a spray-painted X.
          TUXEDO emerges sans jacket and tie, his dress-shirt open.

                         TUXEDO
          I can find my way back.
          ARMANDO nods and pulls away. TUXEDO moves toward the
          entrance, says a word into an INTERCOM with a
          SURVEILLANCE CAMERA. The door opens within moments, he
          disappears inside.
          THE ASSASSIN parks his bike, a few steps behind. Tuxedo
          has vanished through the STEEL DOOR before he can catch
          up with him.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.

                         CONTINUED:
          The ASSASSIN takes off his helmet, tries the door. It
          won't move. He buzzes the intercom. The DOOR slides
          open a crack--
          THE BOUNCER is a huge, bald man with JET BLACK skin, RED
          EYES and TEETH that glow fluorescently. The THROBBING
          BEAT of MUSIC within. The BOUNCER narrows his eyes.

                         BOUNCER
          This is a private club.

                         ASSASSIN
          I just need to talk to--
          THE STEEL DOOR has already shut in his face.

          INT. THE PIT - NIGHT

          POUNDING MUSIC. BODIES SLAM together in a brutal mosh
          pit, MEN and WOMEN. All are young, some beautiful,
          others extremely decorated and pierced. They tear at
          each other brutally, trying to do real damage. On the
          edges of the pit, individual FISTFIGHTS go on. An
          incongruous CHANDELIER overhead, gilt-edged MIRRORS on
          the walls-- the FIGHTERS SLAM INTO and SHATTER them.
          A HARD-CORE BAND plays on an elevated stage. The
          MUSICIANS are heavily punked out, in outlandish clothes,
          with pierced faces, tattoos and body make-up.
          IN A VIP AREA, a balcony elevated above the stage,
          numerous BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE at tables. Many are making
          out, gay, straight, threesomes-- orgies happen up here.
          TUXEDO sits by himself. He raises a GLASS TUBE attached
          to a CORD, one of a few leading into an ELECTRONIC DEVICE
          on the table. As he brings the tube close to his own
          neck, an ARC of electricity jumps to his skin. His
          features go slack, a shudder goes through him. Then he
          lowers the tube with a smile. He's using a JACKER-- a
          sort of electro-shock hookah. A SHOUT over the MUSIC:

                         BLONDE
          Mind if I join you?
          A stunningly beautiful BLONDE in edgy, dramatic clothes
          stands nearby. Tuxedo, recovering from the hit, gestures
          graciously for her to sit. She picks up one of the
          cords, gives him a sly smile. She opens her mouth,
          SPARKS fly to her tongue and--

                         CUT TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          4.

          EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

          RAIN pours down as TUXEDO and the BLONDE burst out the
          door, laughing. He pushes her against a brick wall, they
          grope each other hungrily, hands inside clothes, getting
          drenched in the warm downpour.
          WITH THE ASSASSIN, wearing his HELMET with the VISOR UP,
          as he approaches the entwined couple. TUXEDO hears him,

                         TURNS--

                         TUXEDO
          Get lost, meatbag.

          EXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - NIGHT

          ANGLE ON the alley's mouth as we hear the BLONDE'S
          SCREAM. Seconds later she staggers out, clutching her
          head, and collapses to the pavement. We hear an ENGINE
          START from the alleyway.
          THE ASSASSIN emerges on his bike, rides directly over her
          body unconcerned-- and ROARS into the night.
          CAMERA PULLS UP to--

          EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT

          --an AERIAL VIEW of the rain-swept CITY, some futuristic
          HIGH-RISES amongst the recognizeable landmarks. Also, a
          great number of SUPER-CELL TOWERS and DISHES,
          considerably larger than the ones we see today.
          CAMERA PICKS UP SPEED, moves quickly to a run-down part
          of the city, tenements and vacant lots. MOVE DOWN and
          through a third-story window of--

          INT. ABANDONED PROJECT BUILDING - NIGHT

          A dark, decaying hallway. A MAN and a WOMAN move
          stealthily up the stairs, LASER-SIGHT GUNS in hand.
          The man is THOMAS GREER, the woman JENNIFER PETERS. Both
          are about 30, handsome, athletic. Greer's spent his life
          in law enforcement. He's smart and able, wants things to
          make sense-- but as the world changes around him, he
          feels he's losing the thread. PETERS is junior to Greer,
          her attitude's professional but rigid, by the book.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          5.

                         CONTINUED:
          GREER, in the lead, waves PETERS up. They approach a
          door at the end of the hall. We see now that their
          windbreakers read "FBI."
          GREER kicks open the door--

          INT. PSYCHO'S LAIR - NIGHT

          Lit by CANDLES and KEROSENE LANTERNS, SMOKE HANGS in the
          room. We glimpse BODIES hanging from the ceiling in
          CHAINS. GREER and PETERS train their LASERS around the
          place, disturbed by the scene. A flash of MOVEMENT in a
          bedroom and a CRASH--
          THE PSYCHO who lives here has kicked over a LANTERN, FIRE
          spills across the floor. We glimpse a surprisingly good-
          looking guy, grinning maniacally. He dashes across the

                         ROOM--
          GREER squeezes off a couple of SHOTS. The PSYCHO's too
          fast, he LEAPS through a cracked WINDOW.

          EXT. ABANDONED PROJECTS - NIGHT

          RAIN has let up. The PSYCHO FALLS thirty feet into a
          pile of soft DIRT and TRASH. He rolls to the bottom,
          gets to his feet and runs.
          GREER looks down from the broken window.

          INT. PSYCHO'S LAIR - NIGHT

          PETERS is beating at the FLAMES with a towel, sees Greer
          is preparing to jump.

                         PETERS
          Let's call for back-up.

                         GREER
          Where'.s the sport in that?

                         PETERS

                         IT'S PROTOCOL--
          GREER SNORTS and--

          EXT. ABANDONED PROJECTS - NIGHT

          --LEAPS, GREER hits the dirt hard and rolls. He reaches
          the ground and sets off after the PSYCHO at top speed.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          6.

                         CONTINUED:
          PLAY A FRANTIC FOOT CHASE, both men scramble over chain-
          link fences, leap over trashed cars.
          GREER pursues the PSYCHO around a corner, into a
          passageway between buildings--
          --wherethePSYCHO gets the jump on him, SWINGS a length
          of pipeathis head. Greer ducks fast, the blow catches
          him inthearm, he drops his gun. The PSYCHO moves to
          pick uptheweapon, but Greer tackles him against a
          dumpster.
          Greer SLAMS the dumpster lid on the man repeatedly.

                         GREER
          You have the right to remain silent--
          But the PSYCHO has grabbed something from the trash,
          manages to SQUIRT BUG SPRAY in Greer's eyes.
          Greer's blinded temporarily, the PSYCHO squirms away,
          running from between buildings across a street--
          WHAM! He's hit full-on by a SEMI, his body FLIES through
          the air. He LANDS HARD on cement, but amazingly is still
          alive. He tries to get up, but--
          GREER plants a foot on his chest and holds him fast
          against the ground. Greer, still wiping at this eyes,
          points his weapon at the PSYCHO's head.

                         GREER (CONT'D)
          Stay with me asshole--

                         PSYCHO
          Why would I do that?
          The PSYCHO grins-- then his head lolls back, eyes empty.

          INT. PSYCHO'S LAIR - NIGHT

          PETERS is by a WOMAN'S BODY on the floor, holding a
          pocket SCANNER close to her head. This small device
          resembles an iPhone. There's tape over the woman's eyes
          and mouth, which Peters peels away as she speaks into a
          tiny cellphone earpiece.

                         PETERS
          Is this Kathy Welles...? My name
          is Jennifer Peters, with the FBI's
          surrogate crime division...

                         CONTINUED:
          ON SCANNER-- the name "KATHY WELLES," "REPORTED STOLEN,"
          contact information below.

          EXT. ABANDONED PROJECTS - NIGHT

          ON GREER'S SCANNER - "NEW-U RENTAL AGENCY," with an ID
          NUMBER, but no name.
          GREER kneels beside the PSYCHO's body, pockets his
          scanner. He's angry but resigned, he was half expecting
          this.
          THE SEMI DRIVER is still behind the wheel of his rig. He
          calls out to Greer:

                         SEMI DRIVER
          Am I in trouble?

                         GREER
          (waves him off)
          Nah, go back to work.
          GREER rises as his PHONE CHIMES, he touches his earpiece.
          IN BG, the DRIVER pulls away.

                         GREER (CONT'D)

                         PETERS (FILTER)

                         GREER
          He's a rental.
          He disconnects, reaches to turn the PSYCHO's head to one
          side. The back of his skull is smashed. Instead of gore
          and brains, we see torn GRAY PLASTIC and dense CIRCUITRY,
          oozing pinkish hydraulic fluid at his neck.
          We're in a world of SURROGATES, remotely operated
          synthetic humans (also known as SYNTHs). These are not
          artificially-intelligent robots-- each is linked directly
          to a human being, miles or hundreds of miles away.
          Surrogates are distinguishable from flesh-and-blood
          humans primarily by their physical perfection-- ugly
          surrogates are rare. On closer look, their eyes may have
          an inhuman quality. Without a human mind sending and
          receiving impulses, they are completely inert.
          Suddenly the PSYCHO comes to life, spins his head around
          at an impossible angle and BITES GREER'S HAND.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          8.

                         CONTINUED:
          He won't let go. Greer stomps on the-PSYCHO's head,
          reaches with his other hand into the back of the skull to
          wrench out a CIRCUIT BOARD. The PSYCHO finally stops
          writhing, disconnected.

          INT. PSYCHO'S LAIR - NIGHT

          PETERS talks on the phone while scanning a SEVERED HEAD.

          I don't recommend reconnecting,
          Ms. Welles... hello?
          The WOMAN on the floor TWITCHES, her eyes open. She sits
          up on her elbows, looks down to see--
          --her legs are gone. The bottom half of her is missing,
          her tattered T-shirt covers the damage, soaked with dark
          green and pink liquids-- coolant and hydraulic fluids.

                         VICTIM
          Aw crap, I'm totalled!

                         PETERS
          Your insurance ought to cover it.

          EXT. ABANDONED PROJECTS - NIGHT

          GREER trudges toward the building, on his cell, leaving
          the body behind. He turns the CIRCUIT BOARD over in his
          fingers.

                         GREER

          Abandoned.

                         GREER
          Or something happened to the operator.
          GREER and PETERS stand over the corpse, a UNIFORM stands
          nearby. Greer holds his SCANNER near her head.

                         GREER (CONT'D)

          Left a message.
          GREER is leaning closer to the dead Blonde's face.
          X-CLOSE-- CRACKS in the GLASS of her eye. We see GREER'S
          FRAGMENTED REFLECTION as he peers at this.

                         GREER
          Optics are damaged.

                         PETERS
          Musta cracked when she fell.

                         (TO UNIFORM)
          There's a second?
          The UNIFORM leads GREER and PETERS past the blonde, into
          the alley.

          INT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

          TUXEDO lies on his side, eyes closed. We can hear MUSIC
          THROBBING from within.

                         UNIFORM
          Couldn't get an ID from this one.
          GREER kneels by Tuxedo, looks at his fancy CUFFLINKS.

                         GREER
          A tux? Kind of over-dressed for a
          jacker joint.
          GREER pulls out his scanner.
          BY TUXEDO's FACE, the SCANNER reads "NO SIGNAL."
          GREER seems surprised. PETERS looks over his shoulder.

                         PETERS
          Maybe he's real.

                         GREER
          Little too pretty for that.
          GREER lifts one of Tuxedo's eyelids-- CLOSE, shattered
          GLASS, ELECTRONICS visible within.

                         GREER (CONT'D)
          He's synth all right.

                         PETERS
          Looks like the optics exploded...
          Greer reaches behind Tuxedo's head, pulls out a small
          specially-shaped TOOL and pries up the PANEL at the back
          of Tuxedo's skull. He pulls out--
          THE CIRCUIT BOARD, melted and scorched.

                         GREER
          So much for the identity chip.

                         PETERS
          I'll call for a pick-up. Maybe
          diagnostics can make sense of it.
          Greer stands up, looks toward the Blonde's body.

                         GREER
          Clarksburg's just up the 270,

          EXT. 1-270 - NIGHT

          A slightly futuristic sedan speeds through light late-
          night traffic. We hear the VOICE of the PROPHET:

                         PROPHET (RADIO)
          You feel you are free. You can be
          what you want, do what you want,
          nothing can hurt you. But you have
          ceased to live.

          INT. FBI CAR - NIGHT

          GREER drives. PETERS has her eyes closed in the
          passenger seat. THE VOICE on the RADIO continues IN BG
          through scene.

                         PROPHET (RADIO)
          You think you control your
          surrogates, but it is they who have
          taken over your lives. You lie in
          your cells, pale and fat prisoners,
          while the puppets walk and dance
          and make love...
          Peters BLINKS and comes to.

                         GREER
          Welcome back.

                         PETERS

          Are we actually listening to the
          Prophet? We oughta lock this guy
          up and throw away the key.
          (off Greer's shrug)

          EXT. MODERN APARTMENTS - NIGHT

          MOVE ACROSS the facade of a suburban apartment complex.
          A RED GLOW suffuses most of the windows, all of which are
          BARRED. In this warm light, we glimpse OPERATORS in
          reclining chairs, motionless. They could be watching TV,
          but no sets are in sight.
          MOVE TO FIND GREER and PETERS as they exit the sedan and
          pass a sign: "SURROGATE-READY UNITS AVAILABLE."

          INT. MODERN APARTMENTS/CORRIDOR- NIGHT

          GREER and PETERS walk along an almost prison-like
          corridor, SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS, heavy doors. They follow
          an empty-faced walking MANNEQUIN in an ugly pantsuit.
          This is the LANDLADY. Her mouth moves like a
          ventriloquist's dummy as she speaks self-consciously:

                         LANDLADY
          I been having problems with my
          surrie, this is just a loaner. Is
          there some kind of trouble?

                         GREER
          Nothing to worry about.

                         LANDLADY
          Cam's a good tenant, y'know. Pays
          the rent on time, never leaves the
          apartment...

                         GREER
          Who does?

                         LANDLADY
          (POUNDS on a door)
          Cam? Wake up, the police are here
          to talk to you...

          INT. CAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          The LANDLADY undoes the MULTIPLE LOCKS on the door of a
          small one-room apartment. She opens it and lets GREER
          and PETERS inside. A RED GLOW from the far end of the
          room-- GREER flicks on overheads. The Landlady hovers by
          the door as they move into the place.
          It's minimalist, nothing on the walls. Empty pizza
          boxes. Skirts, stockings, high-heels strewn around
          haphazardly. We also glimpse a large CHARGING CRADLE,
          contact points embedded in the foam inside, shaped to
          accomodate a curvaceous female body.

                         GREER
          Hello?
          A fat, hairy arm hangs over the side of a high-tech
          CHAIR. The two feds move quickly to see--
          --CAMERON MICHAELS, a 40-ish, overweight, bald male in
          his underwear. BLOOD runs from his nose, his face
          twitches slightly; he lies in a STIM CHAIR.

          STIM CHAIRS resemble-oversized massage chairs, contoured
          to the body, with padded head supports. They vibrate and
          electronically stimulate the user to prevent atrophy.
          A SENSORY PROJECTOR sits beside the chair. This device
          looks like a COMPUTER TOWER. It's linked to an elaborate
          HEADSET, with contact points around the skull. There's
          also a MONITOR SCREEN which displays the operator's
          remote POV.

                         LANDLADY
          Oh my God, Cameron--
          GREER quickly detaches the headset, rips a small
          ELECTRONIC SLEEVE off of Cameron's fingertip. He checks
          the man's pupil response and pulse.

                         GREER
          Call the paramedics.
          While Peters calls in BG, GREER moves to the PROJECTOR'S
          MONITOR SCREEN and taps a touchpad.
          ON SCREEN - STATIC. GREER REWINDS to POVs at the hard-
          core CLUB. FAST FORWARD to the ALLEY, making out with
          TUXEDO. This is a recording of recent experience, as
          seen through the eyes of the BLONDE.
          GREER switches to real-time. Tuxedo breaks the kiss and
          turns to look OS.

          TUXEDO (ON SCREEN)
          Get lost, meatbag.
          As Tuxedo turns back TO CAMERA, we hear a hideous
          ELECTRONIC SCREECH, Tuxedo's face contorts in pain... and
          his EYES BURST, fragments of GLASS and ELECTRONICS fly.
          The POV reels, we hear the Blonde's SCREAM-- and STATIC
          again fills the screen.
          GREER is disturbed by this, looks again at the
          unconscious, quivering face of the man in the chair.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. D.C. SUBWAY - NIGHT

          A mostly empty car, scattered SURRIE PASSENGERS ride
          stiffly, zoned out, empty expressions... except for a
          long-haired DREAD, one of the anti-surrogate fanatics.
          He's disheveled, hippyish, SHOUTS into the empty faces of
          the surrogates.

          He moves to a YOUNG COUPLE, both slack-faced, on standby.

                         DREAD (CONT'D)
          Wake up and smell the piss!
          He starts to UNZIP in front of them.

                         GREER
          Not cool.
          The DREAD turns-- GREER is holding up a BADGE. The Dread
          scowls, zips up and moves away from Greer, plunks down at
          the end of the car. Greer pockets his badge calmly.

          EXT. GREER'S BUILDING - DAWN

          GREER approaches an urban APARTMENT COMPLEX on foot,
          carrying a bag of TAKE-OUT FOOD. HIGH FENCES, SECURITY
          CAMERAS and SCANNERS, all commonplace in this world. We
          see the RED GLOW from a few windows.

          INT. GREER'S BUILDING/HALLWAY - DAWN

          GREER moves tiredly down a long hallway to his apartment.
          He punches in a CODE at the door.

          INT. GREER'S APARTMENT/LIVING ROOM - DAWN

          GREER enters, crosses a living room that's been decorated
          in a spare, modern style.

          INT. GREER'S APARTMENT/KITCHEN - DAWN

          GREER sets the bag down on a table, fills a glass with
          WATER and moves down a hallway to a BEDROOM.

          INT. GREER'S APARTMENT/BEDROOM -- DAWN

          GREER enters the bedroom, places the water glass on a
          bedside table beside--
          --the REAL GREER. He looks five years older, twenty
          pounds heavier than his surrogate. He's in a STIM
          RECLINER, attached to a SENSORY PROJECTOR like the one we
          saw on Cameron Michaels. RED LIGHT suffuses the room.

          filled CHARGING CRADLE. Down to his underwear, he backs
          into this, seems to relax. We hear a low HUM and--
          --the REAL GREER's eyes open. He disconnects the HEADSET
          and FINGERSLEEVE, the RED GLOW is replaced by WHITE
          LIGHT. He sits up, yawns and sips the water. He rises
          wearily, stretches, runs a hand through his thinning
          hair. He moves to shut the closet door on his synth
          unit. As it CLOSES--

          --MAGGIE enters. She's Greer's wife, a stylish young
          woman, looking ridiculously good for someone who's just
          gotten up. Maggie starts at the sight of Greer, begins
          to retreat. It's as if she's stumbled upon him in the
          bathroom.

                         MAGGIE
          Oh, sorry--

                         GREER
          Put him up. I was about to get
          some sleep.
          Maggie enters the kitchen, not looking directly at Greer.
          She puts some bread in a toaster, prepares coffee.

                         MAGGIE

          Canter pauses, then moves to a DOOR and opens it.- LIGHTS
          INSIDE FLICKER ON, revealing--
          --a WALK-IN CLOSET with a half-dozen CHARGING BAYS. Four
          surrogates here, all versions of the man we've just seen--
          Canter at different stages of life, from youth to almost
          elderly. Two of the charging bays are empty.

                         CANTER
          I allowed Tony to borrow one of my
          surrogates when he wanted to spend
          time in D.C. I encouraged him to
          take advantage of the cultural

                         OFFERINGS--

                         PETERS
          Wait, how is that possible?
          Aren't your surries locked to your
          neural signature?

                         CANTER
          (closing the door)
          I wrote the code that remains at
          the core of all surrogates. It
          wasn't difficult for me to make my
          synth units accessible to my son.

          The coroner says that Tony was

          We're still analyzing the damage--

                         CANTER
          It was attacked?

          of an ongoing investigation--

          Dr. Canter-- we don't know of any
          way to kill an operator remotely.
          Do you?

                         CANTER
          No, but-- at the beginning, all of
          us at VSI were worried about it.
          It's why every surrogate has a
          built-in fail-safe, they disconnect
          before they can transmit a
          potentially dangerous signal.

                         PETERS

          want to harm your son?

          I... the sad fact is, Tony and I
          were just getting to know each
          other... he grew up with his
          mother in California.
          Canter's voice drifts off, he's starting to look far
          away, pained. He sits slowly behind his desk.

          Lot of that going around.
          He starts to place the card on the desk before the
          immobile Canter. Armando steps forward warily-- Greer
          shows him the card before putting it down.

          fancy, elaborate SENSORY PROJECTOR. REAL CANTER is much
          older than his surrogate, his face stubbly. His body is
          twisted and nearly useless, his head held up by a brace.
          A victim of some horrible degenerative disease, Canter
          only has the use of one arm, via an elaborate electronic
          armature. He's just disconnected his HEADSET. There are
          TEARS streaming down his cheeks.
          His projector SCREEN faces him, with his working arm he

          Someone targeted Canter's surrie,
          got the wrong operator.
          They get to their car, parked in a RED ZONE. GREER curls
          his lip at a METER MAID-- a DRONE SURROGATE ON WHEELS, NO
          EARS, as it rolls calmly away from his car.

                         GREER (CONT'D)
          I'm sure the guy's got enemies he
          never even heard of.

          Excuse me, the "humans."
          Greer rips the TICKET from the windshield, tears it in
          half and throws it in the back of the car, as they both
          get in.

          seated at a worktable with ELECTRONIC GEAR, beside a
          SUBJECT lying on a table, hundreds of WIRES affixed to
          his head. These lead to a crude MANNEQUIN, which turns
          its head, rolls its eyes, moves its mouth. We hear a
          VIDEO NARRATOR, volume low.

          speaking to one of our technicians.
          WELCH smiles pleasantly.

          Not much. He's dead.

          happened while he was online.

          I'm sorry to hear that. But I can
          assure you it has nothing to do with
          VSI products. If a man suffers a
          heart attack while driving, he
          doesn't have a case against the

          Surries have jumped from bridges,
          been shot or blown to bits without
          the least harm to the operators-
          the fail-safes always kick in.
          Every case that's been brought

          of your company's founders.

          Suddenly, WATERS snaps out of it, looks down at the two
          agents. Despite his appearance, his manner is nerdy.

                         WATERS
          Hello, sorry. I was in the can.

                         PETERS
          We were told you could help us
          with some technical issues.

                         WATERS
          To whom am I addressing myself?

                         GREER
          We're with the FBI.
          He studies the BADGES they hold out.

                         WATERS
          Really? Cool.

          INT. VSI LAB - DAY

          X-CLOSE on the dense, blackened and partially melted
          CIRCUIT BOARD, a labyrinth of LINES and PATTERNS.
          WATERS peers into a huge ELECTRONIC MICROSCOPE in this
          laboratory. COMPUTER MONITORS, mysterious EQUIPMENT.

          Heat build-up like this? Every
          circuit musta fired at once.
          Kablooie.
          GREER and PETERS hover nearby. Waters turns his
          attention to the shattered eyes, picks one up.

                         PETERS
          Ever seen anything like it before?

                         WATERS
          Not exactly... but last week we
          got a truckload of GI Joes back
          for reconditioning. Couple a the
          surries were missing optics.

                         GREER
          May we take a look?

          INT. VSI WAREHOUSE - DAY

          WATERS opens the doors and flips on FLUORESCENT LIGHTS...
          they blink on to reveal--
          ROW UPON ROW of SURRIE TEMPLATES, naked, hairless and
          robotic, not yet personalized with faces and skin. They
          stand packed like sardines, ready for shipment.
          WATERS leads GREER and PETERS to a CAGED-IN CORNER of the
          warehouse, unlocks the gate.
          Inside are STACKED BODIES in the uniforms of different
          SERVICES. Many are battered and scarred from battle,
          even in pieces. All are wrapped in CLEAR PLASTIC.

                         WATERS
          Old soldiers never die...
          He consults a HAND-HELD COMPUTER, checks CODE NUMBERS on
          the bags. The SOLDIER'S FACES are all eerily similar...
          even identical. No reason to customize cannon fodder.

                         WATERS (CONT'D)
          Here we go.
          He peels back the plastic on another identical SOLDIER
          whose EYES are missing. The body is otherwise undamaged.

                         PETERS
          No bullet holes, no blast damage--?

                         WATERS
          Not a scratch.
          GREER moves Waters aside, looks the body over.

                         GREER
          Brand new camos, no mud, no dirt...
          this thing's never seen combat.
          Name and unit insignia removed...
          let me check out the motherboard.

                         WATERS
          Didn't come back with one. I
          thought it was a little weird.
          GREER stares into the empty eyesockets of the soldier.
          He hooks a finger in, comes out with--
           A glistening SHARD OF GLASS on his fingertip.

          A FIREFIGHT in a bombed-out DESERT TOWN, somewhere in the
          Middle East. A GRUNT'S POV as a small group of SURROGATE
          SOLDIERS, the generic "GI JOE" types we saw at VSI, clean
          up an insurgent outpost.
          PULASKI, a gung-ho SURRIE SOLDIER, charges into MACHINE
          GUN FIRE and is BLOWN TO PIECES.

          INT. BATTLEFIELD HEADQUARTERS - DAY

          A WIDER SHOT reveals that this POV is one of many being
          displayed on BATTLEFIELD MONITORS in a warehouse-sized
          space. Each hangs above a flesh and blood SOLDIER in
          loose MARINE UNIFORM, in stim chairs, hooked into sensory
          projectors. The room is bathed in RED LIGHT.
          REAL PULASKI bolts upright in his stim chair, a WHITE
          LIGHT goes on as his screen turns to STATIC.

                         PULASKI

          A CONTROLLER works quickly at a board.
          COLONEL BRANDON,_a flesh and blood career military man,
          in uniform, moves past Pulaski's stim chair, gives him a
          warning look.

          PULASKI lies back in his stim chair, RED LIGHT UP. The
          POV ON his SCREEN switches to the BACK OF A VAN, the
          doors open and his new unit charges out, past other
          REPLACEMENT SOLDIERS still in charging bays.
          COLONEL BRANDON, moving on, touches his earphone.

                         BRANDON
          Yeah, I'll be right over.
          He CLAPS a CAPTAIN on the shoulder as he moves out.

                         BRANDON (CONT'D)
          Keep an eye on Bravo company.

          EXT. MARINE BASE - DAY

          HANGARS, boxy buildings, HUMVEES, SOLDIERS marching in
          formation. BRANDON walks with GREER and PETERS.

                         BRANDON
          The United States has the largest
          surrogate army in.the world. Why
          on earth would the defense
          department want to develop a
          weapon that could wipe out our own
          troops?

                         GREER
          So no such thing exists?

                         BRANDON

          middle of a peacekeeping operation.
          They've reached their car. Brandon turns on his heel and
          heads back for a hangar. Greer and Peters look after him
          for a moment.

                         PETERS
          Think he's telling the truth?

                         GREER
          Not when his lips are moving.
          Greer shakes his head as they both get in the car.
          WITH BRANDON - Out of earshot of the feds, he speaks into
          a small earpiece.

                         BRANDON
          Bill, we may have a problem. Is it

          GREER bites back his anger, rises and moves away from the
          screen before he says something he'll regret. He sits at
          ANOTHER TERMINAL, returns to work. Peters takes his
          place, attempting to sound reassuring.

                         PETERS
          We're exploring every avenue, Dr.
          Canter, I promise you that, we're
          doing everything we can.
          CLOSE ON GREER'S TERMINAL - An INSET of the image of the
          ASSASSIN'S FACE, no helmet on-- it's much clearer than
          the one we saw before, this being the bouncer's
          perspective at the door of the club. We hear CANTER and
          PETERS continue in BG.

                         CANTER
          What. What are you doing?

                         PETERS
          I understand you're grieving--

                         CANTER
          I'm a target for assassination! I
          assume you're at least aware of
          that.
          WITH PETERS, she looks briefly over her shoulder at Greer
          with a "help, get me out of this" expression. He remains
          focussed on the image of the assassin, she turns back to
          Canter on the screen, maintaining her placating tone.

                         PETERS
          I appreciate your concern and
          frustration, obviously we all want
          immediate results, but--

                         CANTER
          I've heard enough of your
          condescending pap. The people who
          did this are going to be punished.
          CANTER DISCONNECTS, his angry face VANISHES. PETERS
          rises and moves quickly toward Greer.

          INT. FBI BUILDING/SURVEILLANCE CENTER - DAY -

          GREER and PETERS go down metal stairs into-a sprawling,
          high-tech surveillance center. COMPUTER WORKSTATIONS are
          arranged radially, at the hub is a central COMMAND
          STATION with large SCREENS facing in all directions.
          GREER and PETERS move toward the center. At first we see
          just the head and shoulders of scattered FIGURES, staring
          at the monitor screens.
          ON SCREENS - these are POV SHOTS from thousands of
          SURROGATES, the Feds can have a direct surveillance feed
          from any surrogate's eyes.
          We glimpse POV SHOTS of-- driving-- drinking in a bar--
          intimate conversations-- watching an old movie-- a sex
          partner's face.
          The FIGURES before the screens are WATCHER DRONES,
          specialized surrogates-- a head and shoulders mounted on
          a wheeled contraption attached to tracks. This enables
          them to move and stop at any monitor quickly, surveilling
          dozens of surrogates. Males and females, but all have
          the same faces.
          PETERS stares in wonder at this voyeur's paradise. GREER
          grabs her arm to keep her from getting hit as a WATCHER
          tracks past. The Watcher ignores them, intent on work.
          They mount stairs into the RAISED HUB that overlooks the
          work floor. An extremely corpulent human being-- BOBBY
          SANDERS-- sits on a reinforced rolling chair, which he
          keeps in almost constant motion, eying the DOZEN SCREENS
          up here at once.
          ON SCREENS - POVs of actual criminal activity-- frantic
          running across a park-- a burglary in a darkened jewelry
          store-- packets of drugs changing hands.
          BOBBY eats candy, guzzles soda, waves them off for a
          moment, speaking rapid-fire into his HEADSET.

                         BOBBY
          Burglary in progress, Charlie4639-

          BOBBY gets a message from his headset, kicks his rolling
          chair across the room to a special TERMINAL.

          This terminal displays SURRIE SERIAL NUMBERS. As BOBBY

          Anybody, anywhere. Ssh, don't
          tell anyone. It's a gray area
          legally.
          PETERS isn't comfortable with this.

          Relax, we're the good guys.

          ON TERMINAL SCREEN - "OPERATOR DISCONNECT."
          ON THE BURGLARY SCREEN, the POV IMAGE tumbles to the
          ground, FREEZES there and turns to STATIC.
          GREER nods, impressed. BOBBY eats an entire candy bar in
          one bite.

                         PETERS
          You're not a surrogate, are you?
          BOBBY wheels closer. With his mouth full:

          No ma'am, you're looking at the
          genuine article. Bobby Sanders.

          moving pedestrian's POV. Strickland's leaning on his
          bike, helmet off, talking on a CELLPHONE, free hand
          shoved in his pocket. The image FREEZES. The bike's

                         BOBBY
          Baltimore, corner of Eastern and
          Decker. Got a feeling he's headed
          for the reservation.

                         GREER

                         (TO PETERS)
          Stay here, keep tabs on him.

                         PETERS
          What are you doing?

                         GREER
          (on the move)
          Getting a chopper.
          Peters takes this in, calls after him:

                         PETERS
          You need to get approval!
          GREER makes a jerking off motion and is gone. BOBBY lets
          out a BELCH and winks at PETERS.

          WITH STRICKLAND, finishing his cell call.

                         STRICKLAND
          .maybe I'm not done with the
          O.D. Maybe you're not gonna get
          it back at all. Guy could have a
          lot of fun with your little toy...
          oh you can do better than that.
          I'll be in touch...
          He tosses the cellphone in a trashcan, pulls on his
          helmet, STARTS the bike and peels out.

          INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

          GREER is beside a PILOT, a handsome Hispanic surrie named
          LOPEZ. Greer shouts over the BLADE ROAR:

                         GREER
          We're close! Noise suppression!
          LOPEZ nods, hits a couple of switches. THE LOUD THROB
          becomes a barely audible WHIRR. We hear PETERS' VOICE
          over the radio:

                         PETERS (FILTER)

          Greer clicks off the radio, turns to Lopez.

                         GREER
          Ignore her, Lopez. Get us as
          close as you can.
          LOPEZ grins--and pushes the stick hard--

          THE CHOPPER banks and swoops almost silently.

          BOBBY glances over at PETERS as she monitors a GPS SCREEN
          and various INSET VIDEO FEEDS. He continues to work as
          he flirts with her.

                         BOBBY

          PETERS throws him a glare, turns back to her work.

          Don't be so touchy. I'm engaged
          to B-47 down there.
          He points to one of the many identical female DRONES
          buzzing along the tracks. PETERS smiles.

          EXT. BALTIMORE SLUMS - DUSK

          STRICKLAND moves briskly on his BIKE. He glances in his
          MIRROR and sees--
          --a couple of SQUAD CARS catching up with him.
          He hits the THROTTLE. ANOTHER COP CAR roars around the
          corner ahead of him, SQUAWKS the SIREN. STRICKLAND
          changes direction, veers into a narrow alley.

          INT. HELICOPTER - DUSK

          LOPEZ and GREER are directly overhead, watching
          STRICKLAND maneuver his bike quickly into the alley.

          EXT. SLUM ALLEY - DUSK

          The alley is a DEAD END, a FENCE blocking the exit.
          STRICKLAND skids the bike into a CRASHING STOP, knocking
          over piles of GARBAGE.
          A SQUAD CAR barely clears the walls on either side,
          pursuing. It stops at a narrowing space, cops squeeze
          out either door, aiming GUNS.

                         COP
          Freeze!
          STRICKLAND stumbles away from his bike, into an alcove.
          The cops approach, guns ready.
          STRICKLAND yanks off his helmet, pulls his ominous DEVICE
          from his pocket. Without poking his head out, he aims it
          in the cops direction.
          He PRESSES A BUTTON. A row of RED DIODES GLOW on the
          device as he sweeps it across the alley, but it emits no
          projectiles and makes no sound.
          COP #1 is closer-- his GLASS EYES SHATTER.

                         CONTINUED:
          COP #2 drops his weapon, staggers backward and falls,
          clutching his head.

          INT. HELICOPTER - DUSK

          GREER has seen this, horrified.

                         GREER
          Jesus, what is that?
          STRICKLAND is on the run again, scaling the fence. He
          hasn't spotted the chopper.
          GREER looks in the direction he's heading--
          A HUGE CHAIN-LINK FENCE, topped with barbed wire,
          stretching across the whole city, just a hundred yards
          away. PORTRAITS of the PROPHET (the man we heard on the
          radio), long-haired and bearded, adorn the fence.
          There's a GATE, with two GUARDS checking those entering,
          one or two people are waiting.

                         GREER (CONT'D)
          He gets through the gate, we can't
          touch him.
          GREER readies a RIFLE with a SCOPE, loads a TRANQUILIZER
          DART into the chamber. LOPEZ maneuvers to give Greer an
          angle out the chopper's side.

          EXT. SLUM ALLEY - DUSK

          STRICKLAND looks up to see GREER taking aim from the
          silent chopper. He leaps for cover behind a dumpster as--
          GREER FIRES a DART, which RICOCHETS off the DUMPSTER.
          STRICKLAND scrambles around a corner.

          INT. HELICOPTER - DUSK

          LOPEZ turns the bird forward to pursue, as GREER reloads.
          They round the corner. No sign of Strickland on the
          pavement. GREER looks to his left, beyond the PILOT--
          STRICKLAND has scaled a fire escape, aiming the DEVICE
          right at Lopez. Greer sees what's about to happen--

                         GREER
          Pull up, Lopez, pull up!

                         (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED:
          LOPEZ shoots the bird upwards, but--

          EXT. FIRE ESCAPE - DUSK

          STRICKLAND raises the device to track Lopez and hits the
          button-- we see the RED DIODES GLOW and--

          INT. HELICOPTER - DUSK

          --LOPEZ is hit, his EYES FRAGMENT, shards of GLASS fly.
          GREER is close enough to get a partial hit, crouches in
          agony. SFX, an awful SCREAMING NOISE inside his head--

          INT. GREER'S APARTMENT/BEDROOM - DUSK

          SCREAMING NOISE CONTINUES as REAL GREER spasms in pain in
          his stim-chair, in the sensory projector's RED LIGHT.

          EXT. RESERVATION NO MAN'S LAND - DUSK

          THE CHOPPER, pilotless and out of control, heads over the
          chain link fence. Beyond are vacant lots, with tents and
          makeshift hovels, small buildings.

          INT. HELICOPTER - DUSK

          GREER regains his senses, just in time to see--
          THE CHOPPER careening down toward the Dread encampment.

          EXT. RESERVATION NO MAN'S LAND - NIGHT

          THE CHOPPER CRASHES on its skids, at an angle, amidst
          LEAN-TOs and TENTS-- GREER is thrown out his side with
          the impact.

          THE CHOPPER'S ENGINE EXPLODES. THE WHIRRING TAIL ROTOR
          comes right at him and CHOPS OFF his left arm at the
          elbow, BURNING FUEL spreads and IGNITES his back. Lucky
          thing he's a surrogate. Less fortunate DREADS run
          screaming, we hear the CRIES OF WOUNDED.
          GREER lies in the dirt, in flames, motionless. Then his
          eyes BLINK and move, taking in the sight of--
          STRICKLAND, illuminated by the FIRE, horrified at the
          carnage. He's starting to move away from the wreck.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          46.

                         CONTINUED:
          With supreme effort, GREER gets to his feet, still partly
          IN FLAMES. His stump of an arm SPARKS and leaks
          HYDRAULIC FLUID. He reacts at the sight of--
          A CORPSE on the ground, an older man crushed by a hunk of
          DEBRIS from the chopper. But it's not the corpse that
          interests him-- his DART RIFLE lies nearby, thrown from
          the chopper during the crash.
          GREER grabs it in his right hand. He pushes past DREADS
          who move to help their injured fellows, PANIC in the fire-
          lit no man's land. He spots--
          STRICKLAND, running into the distance. Greer supports
          the rifle with the stump of his missing arm and FIRES--
          STRICKLAND is hit in the back, the force of the shot
          knocks him off his feet.
          GREER strides over to STRICKLAND, seemingly oblivious to
          the CROWD of Dreads collecting around him, pointing at
          him angrily.
          STRICKLAND twitches and moans, partly paralyzed. GREER
          stands over him, lets the rifle dangle. Strickland has
          some trouble speaking.

                         STRICKLAND
          Oh my G-god-- why? What do you
          people want from me?!

                         GREER
          You're a killer--

                         STRICKLAND
          They were just surries! Goddamn
          machines!

                         GREER

                         (A BEAT)
          You really don't know?
          BLAM! A DOUBLE-BARRELED SHOTGUN BLAST throws GREER
          backward, away from STRICKLAND. The DART RIFLE flies
          from his grasp.
          A heavyset FEMALE DREAD wields the sawed-off shotgun.
          She gets between Greer and Strickland, who manages to
          crawl away, vanishing behind other DREADS who are
          gathering around Greer.

                         GREER (CONT'D)
          Strickland! Wait!

          Greer tries to get up, a HOLE has been blown in his
          chest, exposing SPARKING WIRES and ELECTRONICS, spraying
          GREEN COOLANT. He's lost control of his legs, which
          crumple beneath him, he falls to his knees.
          He's surrounded now by angry, disenfranchised DREADS, all
          of whom regard him with hatred.
          THE FEMALE DREAD ejects the used cartridges and reloads
          the shotgun. GREER stares at her coldly.

                         GREER (CONT'D)
          I'm a federal agent--

                         FEMALE DREAD
          You're an abomination.
          THE WOMAN pumps the shotgun again points it a Greer's
          head. Just as it GOES OFF--

          INT. GREER'S APARTMENT/BEDROOM - NIGHT

          GREER lurches out of his chair, yanking the SENSORY
          PROJECTOR off his head-- the RED LIGHT switches to WHITE.
          He stumbles out of the room into the hall.

          INT. GREER'S APARTMENT/HALLWAY - NIGHT

          GREER bangs on the door to Maggie's bedroom, rattles the
          knob. A RED GLOW from beneath her door.

                         GREER
          Maggie! Wake up!
          He's clearly in pain, clutches his temples. BLOOD begins
          to gush from his nose. Greer slides down against the
          door, unable to stand.

          INT. GREER'S APARTMENT/MAGGIE'S ROOM - NIGHT

          THE DOOR rattles, we hear GREER calling:

          Please, I need your help... open
          the door!
          CAMERA MOVES through the RED-LIT room, to show the WIRES
          of a SENSORY PROJECTOR, a partial view of MAGGIE'S HEAD.

                         BRIDGET
          --we're talking turquoise! I
          wouldn't carry a purse that color,
          much less a whole new skin.

                         MAGGIE
          BRB, I just gotta change. Little
          black dress or red bustier?

          A pleasant, rustic home. JENNIFER PETERS, somewhat less
          perfect than her surrie, disconnects from her SENSORY

          from her stim chair and moves into a kitchen.

          very large and powerful-looking STALKER,

                         OF--
          --a MAN sitting at the foot of his bed. He's very tall,
          imposing, bearded, dressed in black-- this is the
          PROPHET. Strickland is cowed, this isn't a man you get a
          lot of face time with.

                         PROPHET
          You've been keeping secrets, Jack.
          TWO LARGE MEN now move into view, flanking the Prophet.
          Call them BUD and MILLER. They're scruffy, bearded, not
          surries.

                         STRICKLAND
          No, Prophet, I---

                         PROPHET
          This is unfair to your brother
          humans.
          STRICKLAND tries to get out of bed, Bud pushes him down.

                         STRICKLAND
          Please, I haven't done anything...

                         PROPHET
          I know what you've done. What I
          don't know is-- who hired you to
          betray us? I want a name.

                         STRICKLAND
          I-- I swear to God I don't know--

                         PROPHET
          Jack...

                         STRICKLAND
          He never said his name, we talked
          on disposable cellphones-- I've
          never even seen his face! I
          couldn't tell you who he was if my
          life depended it!

          INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

          CLOSE ON A MEDICAL MONITOR - high-tech imaging of a HUMAN

          BRAIN.
          MOVE DOWN to find GREER (the real one), asleep. An IV,
          BLEEPING monitors. Uneaten LUNCH on a tray.
          MAGGIE, her surrogate that is, sits in a chair beside the
          bed, her hand resting on GREER's. He stirs-- she pulls
          her hand back, returns to her fashion magazine.
          A TV plays above his bed, Greer blinks, squints at this.
          ON TV - a small BOY CLIMBS a very tall TREE above a
          suburban sidewalk, pleasant MUSIC. Suddenly, a BRANCH
          BREAKS, the boy tumbles with a CRY.
          GREER winces distastefully.
          ON TV - now we see the BOY again, perfectly fine,
          standing beside his mother. She strokes his head with a
          smile. They look down at his broken SURROGATE on the
          ground beside the fallen BRANCH.

          GREER, watching the screen, addresses Maggie.

                         GREER
          Would you do that?

                         MAGGIE
          (not looking up)
          Hm? Do what?

                         GREER
          Get a surrogate for our kid. Our
          hypothetical kid.

                         MAGGIE
          Sure. Why not? They're getting
          cheaper all the time.

          It just seems weird to me.

                         MAGGIE

                         (CHUCKLES)

          Do what you want. Be what you want.
          AT THE DOOR, PETERS hovers, making up her mind to enter.
          She steps into the room.

                         PETERS
          Knock knock.
          Greer blinks at her.

                         GREER

          It's me, Peters, don't you recognize me?

                         GREER
          (almost to himself)
          I thought you might've been
          telling another joke.
          Peters seems relieved. Maggie waits for an introduction,
          but Greer seems withdrawn, shy-- Peters has never seen
          his physical body.

                         MAGGIE
          Hi. I'm Maggie, Tom's wife.

                         PETERS
          A pleasure to meet you. Jennifer
          Peters.

          His new partner.

                         MAGGIE
          (to Greer, brightly)
          You should have mentioned her. I
          need to get going anyway, I'll let
          you two talk business.

                         (TO PETERS)
          I'm a beauty engineer. Drop by
          the shop sometime, I'll give you a
          free consultation.

                         PETERS
          Thanks...
          (as Maggie leaves)
          I think.

                         (STUDYING GREER)
          You look just like your unit.

                         GREER
          Except older and fatter. Sorry if
          I seem a little out of it.

                         PETERS
          You've been through a lot.

                         GREER
          They're calling it a concussion--
          felt like my head was going to
          explode.
          With a brisk RAP on the doorframe, STONE enters.

                         STONE
          How ya' feeling, Greer?

          GREER shrinks back in his bed.

                         GREER
          You tell me. How's Lopez?
          Stone sighs, looking him over. Quietly:

                         STONE
          The pilot? They found him dead in
          his stim chair. Same with one of
          the Baltimore cops, other's in a
          coma. Four Dreads were killed on
          the ground, half a dozen wounded.
          Greer closes his eyes in misery.

                         PETERS
          It's not your fault. You were doing
          your job.
          Stone pulls up Maggie's chair, sits as he speaks.

                         STONE
          I would have to disagree. You
          requisitioned that chopper without
          authorization. You violated our
          treaty with the Dreads-- we're
          expecting retaliation. Those poor
          cops had no idea what they were up

                         AGAINST--

                         GREER
          None of us did! We still don't
          know. I don't think Strickland
          even knew-- he thought he was just
          taking down "the abominations."

                         STONE
          I'm sorry, Greer,. but- - you're
          suspended, pending further action.
          Greer nods slowly, knew this was coming. PETERS takes a
          step back, looking on carefully. Greer takes his LAPTOP
          COMPUTER off the bedside table, opens it so that Stone
          can see it.

                         GREER
          I've been going through my memory
          files of the crash... ever seen
          anything like this before?

          It's the murder weapon?
          GREER nods, STONE studies the laptop, sets his jaw.

                         STONE
          It's more than that. It means
          nobody is safe. The Dreads want
          us all to be like them-- living in
          fear, no better than animals. And
          we've only just freed ourselves,
          begun to explore our true
          potential.

                         GREER
          We need to get this guy.

                         STONE
          We will. Our way of life will be
          protected, whatever it takes.
          An attractive SURRIE NURSE enters the room.

                         NURSE
          Good news, Mr. Greer. The doctors
          say you can go home today.

                         GREER

          She smiles, putting his clothing by the bed and
          disconnecting him from the IV and monitors.

                         STONE
          Just take some time to heal.

          What about my surrogate?

                         STONE
          Hasn't been-recovered. I'm afraid
          we can't supply you with a new one
          until this matter is resolved.
          Peters, make sure he gets home in
          one piece.
          PETERS nods, looking at Greer sympathetically. GREER

          PETERS strides from the doors, GREER follows, dressed in
          casual clothes... then slows his pace, breathing hard.
          GREER'S POV - CARS zipping past on the street, RUSHING
          PEDESTRIANS, PARAMEDICS pushing a body past on a gurney.
          From Greer's now human perspective, surrogates seem
          artificial, appearance too perfect, eyes empty of souls.
          This should be reeling, vertiginous.
          PETERS pauses, seeing Greer is having a panic attack. He
          has trouble speaking.

                         GREER
          I haven't been out without a
          surrogate in a long time...

                         PETERS
          It's OK. Nothing's gonna happen.

                         GREER
          They wanted to give me something
          for the anxiety... they call it
          corporeaphobia.

                         PETERS
          Just take my arm.
          He shakes his head, takes a deep breath and moves out
          onto the sidewalk. Peters stays close.
          GREER'S POV - SURRIE PEDESTRIANS, moving quickly, seeming
          to come right. at him. One bumps into him--
          GREER staggers, the surrie moves on as if he hasn't even
          noticed. Greer moves toward the curb to get away from
          them, stumbles-- PETERS has to pull him out of CAR
          TRAFFIC, a HORN HONKS. He's sweating, terrified.

          signs of withdrawal. He speaks with an incongruous ASIAN

          ACCENT.

                         SALESMAN
          Oh you poor guy-- out in just your
          skin can be scary. No worries, I

          of a CHARGING BAY. Its head is unfinished, a mechanical
          version of a skinless face. Around its neck is a sign
          that reads "40% OFF!"

                         SALESMAN (CONT'D)
          Looking gooood.

                         40% OFF
          I dunno...
          The VOICE is a tinny, far-away sounding version of
          Greer's. Suddenly 40% OFF twitches and stumbles, bumping
          into a DISPLAY.

                         SALESMAN
          Try touching your nose.
          40% OFF pokes himself in the eye.

                         'SALESMAN (CONT'D)
          Good, good. Takes some time to
          break in. Base model come with
          vision, hearing-- other senses
          optional.

                         40% OFF
          Screw this.
          The surrie FREEZES in its tracks... and slowly TOPPLES
          OVER as GREER pulls of the projector headpiece. The
          SALESMAN sets to righting it, GREER heads for the exit.

                         SALESMAN
          Wait wait wait! I throw in super-

          We can try a department store--
          if money's a problem, I can front

                         YOU TILL--

                         GREER
          No. I'm a grown man for
          Chrissake, I should be able to
          walk down the street without
          completely freaking out.

          INT. BAR - DAY

          A BARTENDER puts a SODA WATER and a GLASS OF SCOTCH on
          the bar in front of PETERS and the shaky GREER.

                         PETERS
          Well, you made it a block.

                         GREER
          (lifts his glass)
          Here's to self-medication.
          He takes a sip and spits it out. The BARTENDER turns.

                         BARTENDER
          Are you all right, sir?

                         GREER
          What is this?
          The BARTENDER gives him a once-over.

                         BARTENDER
          Oh, sorry. We don't get a lot of--
          that's synthohol. Just a CPU
          inhibition blocker in a non-
          corrosive solution...
          As the bartender speaks, Greer looks around the dark bar--
          --in the back, EVERY COUPLE is gazing into each other's
          eyes, clearly hooking up.
          GREER continues to watch the other patrons.

                         GREER
          You have any real booze?

                         BARTENDER
          No liquor license.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          59.

                         CONTINUED:
          The BARTENDER shrugs and moves off. Peters sips her soda
          water, amused.

                         PETERS
          Come here often, stranger?

                         GREER
          You know, they really don't look
          human. You can't tell when you're
          inside them, but...
          GREER turns to PETERS, studies her like the others.

                         PETERS
          I don't like the way you're
          looking at me.

                         GREER
          But I'm not really looking at you.

                         PETERS
          Yeah yeah, this is just a lump of
          aluminum and polystyrene. Tell
          you what, next time you're in
          Colorado, look me up for real. We
          can have a beer together.

                         GREER
          I'd like that.
          PETERS blinks, Greer has suddenly gotten sincere on her.
          He looks away.

                         GREER (CONT'D)
          You know, when we started working
          together, I thought you were kind
          of a stiff.

                         PETERS
          New job, I was defensive.

                         GREER
          It's more than that... you're
          different. Or maybe I am.
          Greer's embarrassed, shrugs it off. He puts down a bill
          and rises.

                         GREER (CONT'D)
          You probably oughta head back to
          the office.

                         PETERS
          I can get you home.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         GREER
          I'll be OK.
          He moves toward the door, she tags along.

                         GREER (CONT'D)
          I'm thinking you should double-
          check Strickland's records, go back
          to the hard copies. See if you can
          find out why they dropped charges.

                         PETERS
          You seem better already.

                         GREER
          It's like riding a bike.

          EXT. METRO ENTRANCE - DAY

          subway,
          GREER and PETERS walk, he spots a sign for the
          changes direction to head for the escalator.

                         PETERS
          Where you going?

                         GREER
          It's a lovely day. Thought I'd take
          a trip to East Baltimore.
          He pauses at the top, a hit of vertigo.

                         GREER (CONT'D)
          Was it always this steep?

                         PETERS
          Jesus, Tom, the rez?

                         GREER
          Since I'm stuck in my skin, I
          oughta take advantage of it. Hell,
          as long as Strickland has that
          device-- I'm safer this way.
          He clutches the handrail, starts moving down.

                         PETERS
          Be careful.
          He nods and waves as he disappears down the escalator.

                         CUT TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          61.

          INT. FBI BUILDING/LOBBY - DAY

          PETERS enters this large lobby, bustling with other
          AGENTS and OFFICIALS. She moves toward a DESK JOCKEY,
          security SCANNERS. She reacts to the sound of--
          --SCREAMS and SCREECHING TIRES from outside the building.
          PETERS looks toward a large WINDOW to the street-- and
          immediately dives for cover as--
          --a battered SUV, spray-painted with anti-surrogate
          GRAFFITI, SMASHES through the plate glass. SURRIE
          PEDESTRIANS are plastered across the grill and embedded
          in the windshield.
          THE SUV slams into a few SURRIES in the lobby, sends them
          flying or runs over them. It spins sideways into a WALL
          with the FBI SEAL overhead.
          The DRIVER leaps out, armed with a MACHINE GUN. He's
          clearly a DREAD, angry and deranged. He starts SHOOTING
          at anything that moves.
          PETERS crouches for cover as BULLETS shatter GLASS and
          smash MARBLE around her.
          An army of AGENTS burst from an elevator in Kevlar and
          riot helmets, armed with AUTOMATIC RIFLES. They
          instantly bring the DREAD down in a barrage of gunfire.
          The agents move to the DREAD'S BODY-- he's very dead,
          pouring BLOOD from dozens of bullet wounds. One speaks
          into his headset:

                         RIOT AGENT
          Secure.

                         (TO CROWD)
          Any biologicals here?

          INT. TAXICAB - DAY

          A SMALL FLAT-PANEL TV in the back of the CAB plays NEWS
          of the attack on the FBI building. PILES of surries
          removed on carts, one BODY on a stretcher.

          NEWS READER VOICE

          His motive is unclear at this point,
          but may be a response to the recent
          incident at the Baltimore human
          reservation...
          GREER, in the back seat, takes in this news grimly. The
          CABBIE has been glancing at his own monitor in front.

                         CABBIE
          Goddamn Dreads... sure you don't
          wanna change your mind?

                         GREER
          I'm sure.

          EXT. BALTIMORE SLUMS - DAY

          Late afternoon. GREER emerges from a TAXI near the same
          gate we saw earlier. Greer wobbles, steadies himself
          against the car as he pays the CABBIE-- a DRONE
          SURROGATE, built into the seat.

                         CABBIE
          You OK, man?

                         GREER
          Just a little carsick.
          The TAXI pulls away, Greer heads for the GATE.

          EXT. RESERVATION NO MAN'S LAND - DAY

          AT THE GATE: METAL SIGNS read "HUMANS ONLY - NO
          SURROGATES." GREER goes through a big,.old-fashioned
          (present-day) METAL DETECTOR, the light flashes GREEN. A
          DREAD GUARD waves him past. Greer gestures toward one of
          the many IMAGES OF THE PROPHET to be found in the rez.

                         GREER
          Where would I find the, the what do
          you call it, the Temple?

                         DREAD GUARD
          Ten blocks that way, left on
          Bloomfield.

                         GREER
          Thanks.
          (eyes the grim area)

                         DREAD GUARD
          Piss off.
          As Greer crosses the rubble-strewn no man's land, he
          pauses, sickened as he sees--
          --the burned-out HELICOPTER HULK, now sprayed with
          GRAFITTI. "PIGS DIE," etc. And just beyond this--
          --what's left of GREER'S SURRIE, half the head blown off
          with fried electronics hanging out. It's been lashed to
          a makeshift crucifix, made from the bent CHOPPER BLADES.
          The clothing is shredded, the remains spray-painted.
          GREER, wary of being recognized, continues on.

          EXT. RESERVATION STREET - DAY

          GREER walks through a poor but surprisingly pleasant
          neighborhood-- rowhouses, gardens. Very few cars.
          DREADS look like ordinary working-class folks.
          A BARBECUE, a group of RESIDENTS laughing and drinking.
          Greer inhales the SMOKE as he passes, smiles to himself.
          A couple of FRIENDLY DOGS trot curiously after him for a
          moment, then return to the barbecue. GREER, not paying
          attention, brushes past an ELDERLY MALE PEDESTRIAN.

                         GREER
          Excuse me.

                         PEDESTRIAN
          (smiles and nods)
          No problem.
          A PLAYGROUND a short distance on,.LOTS OF KIDS shrieking
          and running. Greer pauses here, taking this in. These
          are the first children we've seen, outside of a TV ad.
          A CLOUD OF DIESEL SMOKE from a decrepit BUS. Greer
          CHOKES on this, but doesn't seem displeased. His body
          language has become more relaxed as he gets further into
          the rez, getting his land legs back.

          INT. RESERVATION TEMPLE - DAY

          A cavernous convention center, thousands of folding
          chairs face a raised PULPIT at one end. Behind this is a
          SUPERGRAPHIC of the PROPHET, hands raised in benediction.

          GREER enters, takes this in. He spots a CLEANING LADY,
          an older woman sweeping up amidst the rows nearby.

                         GREER
          Excuse me. You wouldn't happen to
          know a Jack Strickland? I'm told
          he worked here off and on.

                         CLEANING LADY

                         (NODS)
          You're here for the service? It's
          in the park.

          EXT. RESERVATION PARK - DUSK

          GREER moves down a path in this expanse of greenery. He
          comes to an open lawn with a fairly large CROWD gathered,
          illuminated by a FLAMING TORCH.
          THE PROPHET is speaking. He stands before a platform
          atop wooden scaffolding, firewood piled below. A
          formidable ring of BODYGUARDS stands between him and the
          gathered throng of DREADS.

                         PROPHET
          --serving faithfully beside us in
          the cause of humanity. _I had the
          privilege of hearing his confession
          shortly before his death.
          GREER has pushed his way gently toward the front to get a
          look at the BODY atop the funeral BIER.
          The corpse atop the bier is that of JACK STRICKLAND, eyes
          closed, hands folded.

                         PROPHET (CONT'D)
          And I know he would have rejoiced
          in the day of resurrection, the
          day for which we are all
          preparing, the day I promise you
          is close at hand...
          So saying, the PROPHET lifts the torch and touches it to
          the base of the PYRE, which ERUPTS IN FLAME.
          CLOSE ON STRICKLAND as the FLAMES lick up around him.
          LATER, the BIER consumed in FIRE, the MOURNERS
          dispersing. THE PROPHET is moving away, HANDLERS
          surrounding him. GREER tags along-- but one of the
          Prophet's goons, BUD, gets in his face.

          What happened to Jack Strickland?

                         BUD
          He slipped and fell. Friend of yours?
          Greer starts to move around him, Bud gets in his way.

                         GREER
          I'd like a word with the Prophet.

                         BUD
          You and everyone else.
          MILLER and ADAMS, another goon, now join them.

                         GREER
          Strickland was carrying a weapon.
          If it isn't recovered, there could
          be serious consequences-- for all
          of you.
          IN BG, the PROPHET and HANDLERS head toward a large RV.

                         MILLER
          You some kinda cop? Where's your
          puppet?

                         GREER
          Needs repairs.

                         MILLER
          You armed?
          GREER shakes his head, raises his hands.

                         GREER
          Frisk me if you want.

                         MILLER
          No, that's OK.
          With that, he throws a SUCKER PUNCH to the gut. GREER
          doubles over. He seems amazed at the sensation, the
          pain. But he recovers, throws a wild punch at Miller an d
          misses by a foot. [Violence for Greer in human form
          should have a very different, painfully visceral feel,
          unlike when he was a surrogate.]

          66.

                         CONTINUED: (2)
          ADAMS cracks Greer across the back of his head. GREER
          falls to the ground. BUD kicks him once. GREER chokes
          and groans in pain.

                         MILLER (CONT'D)
          Hurts, doesn't it.

                         BUD
          It's a bitch being real.
          GREER lets out a primal CRY and lunges at MILLER, driving
          his head into the man's torso, knocking the wind out of
          him before the other two can pull Greer back.

                         ADAMS
          I think he likes it.

                         MILLER
          (catching his breath)
          So give him some more.
          Outnumbered three to one, Greer takes a beating,
          continues to throw mostly ineffective punches that just
          cause the men to redouble their efforts. Finally, he's
          limp in their arms.
          Miller plucks Greer's WALLET and BADGE from his pockets,
          examines them. As he does so, GREER spits BLOOD on the
          man's face. Miller seems about to whomp him again, but
          stops himself.

                         MILLER (CONT'D)
          Not gonna give you the
          satisfaction.
          (to Bud and Adams)
          Get him out of here.
          Miller tosses Greer's ID at him, then moves toward the
          RV, leaving GREER gasping in the clutches of Bud and
          Adams, lit by the FLAMES from the funeral pyre.

          INT. PROPHET'S RV - NIGHT

          A spartan interior. MILLER enters. THE PROPHET stands
          with a couple of HANDLERS.

                         HANDLER
          Trouble?

                         MILLER
          Some fed named Greer, he wanted to
          talk to the Prophet.

          About that turkey shoot in DC?

                         MILLER
          Didn't come up. Said they wanted
          Strickland's weapon.

                         PROPHET
          Well, maybe I'll just have to
          bring it to their doorstep...
          In the Prophet's hand, we now see--
          --the mysterious DEVICE with which Strickland killed his
          targets.

          EXT. RESERVATION NO MAN'S LAND - NIGHT

          GREER is half-dragged, half-carried, back the way he
          came, flanked by BUD and ADAMS. Greer sucks on his
          BLEEDING lip, works his tongue around in his mouth. He
          touches parts of his bruised body carefully.

                         BUD
          Guy like you oughtn't be out in
          just your skin.

                         GREER
          I'm starting to see your point.
          AT THE GATE - GREER leaves, trying to muster as much
          dignity as he can. The DREAD GUARD calls sarcastically
          after him.

                         DREAD GUARD
          Come again real soon!

          EXT. BALTIMORE SLUMS - NIGHT

          GREER trudges along the seedy streets. He looks a mess--
          torn clothing, bloodstains, bruises. Suddenly he's
          SHOVED from behind, falls to the pavement.

                         WHEELS
          Oops.
          The assailant is a FREAK SURRIE-- extra ARMS, WHEELS
          where his feet should be.
          A moment later, Greer is surrounded by three rich, FREAKY

          TEENS.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          68.

                         CONTINUED:
          They've customized their surries in completely bizarre
          ways, in addition to the usual tattoos and piercings.
          Besides WHEELS, there's a hairless teen with six EYES
          scattered around his head. A GIRL has SPIKES sticking
          out of her skull and flesh and REPTILE SKIN.

                         EYES
          Watch where you're going, meat.

                         SPIKES
          What are you doin' off the rez?
          She bumps against GREER as he picks himself up, he
          shrinks from the spikes. She shoots a small blast of
          FLAME from her nostrils, then GIGGLES.

                         GREER
          I'm not a Dread.

                         WHEELS
          Then you oughta return that
          surrie, looks like shit.
          WHEELS comes at Greer again, Greer moves and TRIPS him--
          but he just lands on an extra arm and rights himself.

                         EYES
          Hey, it wants to play.
          EYES lowers his head and moves to butt him. GREER
          dodges, it looks like a bullfight.

                         SPIKES
          Ole, toro!
          They turn, hearing a SCREECH OF TIRES.
          A LIMOUSINE has pulled up. A 10-year-old BOY climbs from
          the back and approaches.

                         BOY
          Agent Greer. Would you like a ride?
           The kid's voice sounds like a child's, but with mature
          cadences to his speech. -

                         WHEELS
          Check out Richie Rich.
          THE DRIVER of the Limo steps out-- it's ARMANDO from
          Canter's lobby. He lets his jacket fall open, revealing
          a HOLSTERED SIDEARM.

          The FREAKS retreat with dirty looks.

                         SPIKES
          Fascists.
          The BOY moves back toward the LIMO. Greer follows.

                         BOY
          (re: the freaks)
          So many unforeseen consequences to
          the surrogate revolution... I
          suppose I should apologize.

                         GREER
          Who are you?

          INT. LIMO -- NIGHT

          As GREER climbs in, the BOY hands him back his own
          BUSINESS CARD, the one Greer left with Canter.

                         BOY/CANTER
          You left this on my desk.
          ARMANDO has gotten behind the wheel, starts moving.
          Greer looks at the boy, amazed.

                         GREER
          Canter?

                         BOY/CANTER
          It's not safe for me to use my
          usual surrogates. This is one of
          VSI's.newer models. Not that the
          market will be that strong, the
          birthrate being what it is.

                         GREER
          You're having me followed.

                         BOY/CANTER
          You know how important this
          investigation is to me.

                         GREER

                         (A BEAT)
          The man who killed your son is dead.
          Boy/Canter absorbs this.

          I suppose you deserve that.

          EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT

          THE LIMO drives along the Potomac near the city.

          INT. LIMO - NIGHT

          GREER holds ICE to his swollen face.

                         BOY/CANTER
          This Strickland character. I
          don't believe he could have been
          acting on his own.

                         GREER
          Why not? You stand for everything
          the humanists hate--

                         BOY/CANTER
          Then why would his own people
          murder-him?

                         GREER
          He'd outlived his usefulness.
          With me all over his ass, he was
          becoming a security risk--

                         BOY/CANTER
          To kill someone remotely-- it
          would take a virus presumably, one
          that could get past every firewall
          protecting a surrie's circuitry--
          then once in the CPU, override all
          the fail-safes and cause
          catastrophic brain damage...

                         GREER
          Presumably.

                         BOY/CANTER
          We're talking about an

                         EXTRAORDINARILY SOPHISTICATED
          technology, don't you think? The
          Dreads didn't come up with it, -

          OK, fine. Maybe we've got our
          heads up our own ass--

                         BOY/CANTER
          Maybe that's exactly where you
          should be looking.
          Greer takes a second to absorb this.

                         GREER
          So now you're the victim of a
          government conspiracy?

                         BOY/CANTER
          I think this is your stop.

          EXT. GREER'S BUILDING - NIGHT

          THE LIMO stops, a light RAIN now falling. GREER gets out
          and closes the door, the rear window rolls down.

                         BOY/CANTER
          Somebody hired Strickland. You'll
          know who that is when you trace
          the weapon.

                         GREER
          You really don't need to do my job
          for me.
          Boy/Canter takes in Greer's disheveled state.

                         BOY/CANTER
          Yes, I can see you've got things
          under control.
          The limo pulls away. Greer pauses, looks up at the sky,
          letting the rain wash over his face.

          MAGGIE and BRIDGET are squeezed together on the couch in
          Greer's apartment with BRIAN and a French hunk named
          ANDRE, who speaks with a slight ACCENT. Everyone is
          pretty high. Andre closes one eye, then the other,
          pupils turned inward.

                         ANDRE

                         (SQUEEZING IT)
          I'm going to have it replaced.

          While you're at it-- I am so sick
          of twelve-inch dicks.
          MAGGIE chuckles. On the coffee table before them sits a
          small JACKER, like the one we saw in the underground
          club. The foursome pass a single ELECTRICAL TUBE around,
          attached by a cord to the device. Andre and Bridget have
          clearly coupled up, Brian touches Maggie's leg casually
          from time to time.

                         ANDRE
          What do you want, we're men.

                         BRIAN
          (coming out of it)
          Why is that? Why do we all have
          to be men and women? I'd rather
          be-- I dunno, a lion. Or an
          eagle.

                         MAGGIE
          Mm. A spaceship. Or a cloud.

          transported.
          A moment later, Andre notices that GREER has entered

          That's Maggie's husband. Hi Tom.
          She gives him a little wave. Greer moves past them,
          toward the kitchen, and disappears. Maggie comes out of
          her trance, blinks and sighs.

                         MAGGIE
          Excuse me.
          She hurries after him. Brian shrugs, grabs the tube and
          starts to unzip his pants--

          INT. GREER'S APARTMENT/KITCHEN - NIGHT

          GREER has removed an old, yellowed FIRST-AID KIT from
          under the sink, during the scene he cleans up cuts, opens
          his shirt to check his bruised ribs, etc.

                         MAGGIE
          What happened to you? I thought
          you were-spending another night in
          the hospital.

                         GREER
          Obviously. You know I don't like
          you jacking in the house.
          He finds an untouched, dusty bottle of SCOTCH, sniffs it
          and pours a drink. Maggie looks him over.

                         MAGGIE
          Somebody beat you up? How could
          you go out like that?
          As Maggie speaks, she moves to his side, touching his
          injuries gently, truly concerned. Greer flinches back.

                         MAGGIE (CONT'D)
          What were you thinking, Tom? You.
          could've been killed.

                         GREER
          Just finding out how the other
          half lives.

          74.

                         CONTINUED:
          Greer takes a long drink, gestures toward the living
          room.

                         GREER (CONT'D)
          So what's his name?

                         MAGGIE
          Oh please, grow up.

                         GREER

                         (NODS GLUMLY)
          I suppose it doesn't matter. Since,
          as you keep telling me, it doesn't
          mean anything. Nothing does.
          Greer pours another drink.

                         MAGGIE
          I don't expect you to understand
          this. But once in a while, I like
          to be around people who don't hate
          being alive.

                         GREER
          Alive. Is that what they are out
          there?
          She shakes her head and returns to the living room.

          INT. GREER'S APARTMENT/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          MAGGIE, BRIDGET, BRIAN and ANDRE are still partying-- in
          fact, Bridget and Andre are starting to make out-- when
          GREER re-enters, in a RAINCOAT, he's a little tipsy. The
          BOTTLE pokes out of a pocket.

                         BRIAN
          Hey. You really a G-man?
          Greer pauses, stares at the man.

                         BRIAN (CONT'D)
          Can I ask you something? Is it
          true you guys are tapping into our
          surries? Watching everything we
          do, twenty-four seven?

                         GREER

                         (A BEAT)
          Of course not.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          75.

                         CONTINUED:
          Greer starts to move across the room again, heading for
          the door. Brian smirks, speaks quietly, thinking only
          the others will hear. As he touches Maggie's leg:

                         BRIAN
          Wouldn't want him spying on us
          tonight...
          Greer spins near the door and, without breaking stride,
          returns to the couch.

                         GREER
          Excuse me.
          Brian turns, starts to rise. Greer grabs the man and
          HURLS him backwards onto the GLASS COFFEE TABLE which
          SHATTERS. The other three back away. After a stunned
          moment, Brian starts LAUGHING, very hard-- obviously, he
          hasn't felt a thing.

                         MAGGIE
          Tom, the table!
          Greer steps over the couch calmly and begins PUNCHING and
          KICKING the surrie on the floor, working off pent-up
          rage. BRIAN just keeps LAUGHING.
          Soon Greer's hands are cut and bleeding, he's panting,
          exhausted. MAGGIE finally succeeds in pulling him away.-
          BRIAN sits up, his FACE is DENTED, the plastic skin
          STRETCHED and TORN.

                         BRIAN
          Could we do it again?

                         ANDRE

                         (CHUCKLING)
          Oh man, your face.

                         BRIAN
          I was getting sick of it, anyway.
          As Brian picks bits of GLASS out of his plastic flesh,
          Andre suddenly realizes his JACKER is SMASHED, examines
          the pieces with a MOAN.

                         GREER
          Guess the party's over.
          MAGGIE follows GREER to the door. They speak in hushed

                         TONES:

                         MAGGIE
          What was the point of that?

                         GREER
          Does everything have to have a
          point?
          GREER takes a breath, bows his head.

                         GREER (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry. I just want us to-- to
          connect again. To have a family,
          to have a life.
          (grabs her arms)
          We can't do it through this wall
          of plastic.
          MAGGIE pulls away, his BLOODY HANDS have left marks on
          her blouse.

                         MAGGIE
          I'm sorry, too. But this is my
          life.
          She looks at him sadly and returns to her guests. After
          a beat, Greer heads out the door.

          EXT. FBI BUILDING - NIGHT

          GREER walks in the RAIN through nearly empty streets
          toward the modern headquarters in Washington. There are
          BOARDS over the shattered windows in front.

          INT. FBI LOBBY - NIGHT

          Quiet at this hour. A DESK JOCKEY looks up as GREER
          approaches, careful to conceal the bottle.

                         DESK JOCKEY
          Is that you, Greer?

                         GREER
          In the flesh.
          He takes in the damage to the lobby, the police tape, the
          attacker's chalk silhouette.

                         DESK JOCKEY
          You missed all the excitement.

                         GREER
          Saw it on TV.

          77.

                         CONTINUED:
          He passes the SURRIE SCANNER and holds his hand over a
          FINGERPRINT MACHINE, which confirms his identity. A
          plexiglas door unlocks automatically.

                         DESK JOCKEY
          Says here you're on suspension.

                         GREER
          Mm. Just cleaning out my desk.

                         DESK JOCKEY

                         (EYING HIM)
          Y'know, you're thinner on top.

                         GREER
          Nice of you to notice. You
          remember where the rest rooms are?

                         DESK JOCKEY
          They mostly use 'em for storage.
          Think the one on four still works.
          Greer nods and continues in.

          INT. FBI BUILDING/CHARGING ROOM - NIGHT

          DOZENS of SURROGATE AGENTS are lined up against the wall
          in here, in their foam CHARGING BAYS.
          CAMERA FINDS PETERS in their midst. Her bay HUMS and she
          blinks, becomes animated. She steps out of the bay.

          INT. FBI BUILDING/GREER'S OFFICE - NIGHT

          GREER has his feet up on his desk, the bottle beside him.
          There are cardboard BOXES of DOCUMENTS nearby. PETERS
          enters, Greer looks up at her.

                         PETERS
          Got your message.

                         GREER
          Hope I didn't wake you.

                         PETERS
          After what happened here today I
          couldn't sleep.

                         GREER
          You tell anyone I was going out to

          No. Of course not.
          Greer studies her a beat, decides she's sincere. A sigh.
          Peters sits on his desk, studies him.

                         PETERS (CONT'D)
          You look terrible.

                         GREER
          Not half as bad as I feel.
          Greer refills his coffee cup with Scotch, holds the
          bottle out to her questioningly.

                         PETERS
          No thanks.

                         GREER
          Come on. Just pretend to get
          drunk with me.
          Peters shakes her head with a smile. Greer shrugs, takes
          a long drink, sighs and rubs his sore neck.

                         GREER (CONT'D)
          Feel like I've been asleep for
          years-- now I wake up an old man.
          Rip Van Frigging Winkle...
          Peters moves behind him, begins rubbing his shoulders, a
          massage.

                         GREER (CONT'D)
          What are you doing?

                         PETERS
          You look like you need it.

                         GREER
          I'm not sure how kosher this is...

                         PETERS
          Relax. It's not me, it's not a
          woman touching you-- it's just a
          machine.

                         GREER
          Does feel good... better than a
          stim chair.
          He allows himself to enjoy it for a moment, bows his
          head.

          What.

                         GREER
          Us. People. The stuff that used
          to make the world make sense.
          That made us... human. I don't
          know, morality, love. Whatever.

                         (BEAT)
          Yeah, yeah, they were probably
          saying that back in ancient Rome.

                         PETERS
          We always think technology's going
          to improve our lives, but...

                         GREER
          What lives?
          A beat, GREER sits up and pulls away from her touch. He
          holds up a hand and lets it fall.

                         GREER (CONT'D)
          This has become obsolete. Someday
          soon, we'll all just be brains in
          jars.

                         PETERS
          Maybe not. I have a feeling
          people are going to come to their
          senses eventually.

                         GREER
          (shaking his head)
          You can't unring a bell.
          (turns toward her)
          Thought you were the one all into
          the brave new world.
          PETERS is staring at her own plastic hand. She looks up
          at Greer, changes the subject.

                         PETERS
          I found out about Strickland.
          She gestures to the boxes of documents.

                         PETERS (CONT'D)
          All the chaos, I was able to waltz

          The case files were removed, but
          there was a paper trail from
          payroll... Strickland was an
          informant.

                         GREER

                         (PERKING UP)
          For us? Who was running him?

                         PETERS
          Wasn't in the paperwork. But he
          must've been selling intel on the
          Prophet.
          Greer has risen, moving restlessly around the room.

                         GREER
          So the Prophet has him killed. And
          we have to assume he now has the
          power to kill anyone he wants...

          INT. MARINE BASE/COLONEL BRANDON'S OFFICE

          CLOSE on a PHOTO of the DEVICE in Strickland's hand. The
          image has been ENLARGED, giving a pretty clear view of
          the weapon.

                         BRANDON
          Where'd you get this photo?
          GREER sits opposite COLONEL BRANDON at the man's desk, a
          FLAG and other MILITARY MEMORABILIA on display. Greer
          eyes the colonel, knows something's up.

                         GREER
          It's from my memory. Damn thing
          put me in the hospital.

                         BRANDON
          Wish I could help.

                         GREER
          Killed a couple of cops as well.
          We believe this weapon-- the one
          that doesn't exist-- is in the
          hands of the Human Coalition.
          Brandon is finally losing his composure.

          If this is true... we're going to
          have to do everything in our-power
          to recover it. Do you have any
          idea how serious this is?

                         GREER
          I was hoping you'd tell me.
          BRANDON looks conflicted, finally opens up.

                         BRANDON
          This is absolutely off the record.
          (off Greer's nod)
          It's called an Overload Device, or
          O.D. They're brand new, only a
          handful exist. But I checked, ran
          every serial number-- all accounted
          for.

                         GREER
          Not this one. Maybe it never got
          to you guys in the first place.
          Who makes them?

                         BRANDON
          It's a DARPA design, subcontracted to
          Pierson Defense. The idea was to
          create a non-lethal weapon that could
          disable every surrie in the field.
          You beam a software virus straight to
          the CPU. The fail-safes kick in and
          the operators are cut off. Circuits
          all melt down in seconds, you're left
          with a field full of scrap.

          Just a few lines of code, the
          connection stays open. We tried it on
          soldier volunteers... once. The virus
          caused every neuron to fire at the
          same time. Melted their brains.

          INT. BEAUTY SHOP - DAY

          CLOSE on a WOMAN'S FACE being carefully peeled off the
          MECHANICAL UNDERPINNINGS. FUNKY MUSIC plays.
          WIDER, BRIDGET leans over the body, putting the old face
          aside. A row of EXOTIC NEW FACES on a rack nearby.
          Bridget begins manipulating the underlying musculature,
          changing cheekbones, etc, using delicate TOOLS.

                         BRIDGET
          She wanted blue eyes the size of
          golf balls, bee-sting lips and a
          tiny ski-jump nose...

                         MAGGIE
          Boop-oop-a-doop.

                         BRIDGET
          Exactly.
          Nearby, MAGGIE works on a brown-skinned HAND. She stares
          through a mounted MAGNIFYING LOUPE, embedding tiny JEWELS
          in the SKIN of the fingers. She uses TWEEZERS and a tiny
          BLOWTORCH. After a moment, we realize the HAND has been
          disconnected from the body, mounted on a brace.

                         MAGGIE
          You talked her down, I hope.

                         BRIDGET
          Yes, thank God, we're doing a
          modified Audrey Hepburn.
          MAGGIE glances over at Bridget's work admiringly.

                         MAGGIE
          I'd love you to raise my
          cheekbones a half-inch, but Tom
          would go ballistic.
          THE DOOR CHIMES, Bridget looks up.

                         BRIDGET
          Speaking of the ball and chain...
          As GREER approaches, a few of the BEAUTY ENGINEERS glance
          up, then return to their business.

          This place is a cross between a beautician's and an auto
          body repair shop. SURRIES in chairs that maneuver into
          all kinds of positions. Not only are they having nails
          and hair done, but legs lengthened, breasts enlarged,
          etc. (Operators check in their bodies and leave them
          there for modifications.)

                         BRIDGET (CONT'D)
          Hiya, Tom.

                         MAGGIE
          I didn't hear you come home last
          night.

                         GREER
          Worked late. I'd really like to sit
          down and talk with you.

                         MAGGIE
          I can take a break--

                         GREER
          No, Maggie, face to face. The two of
          us, for real.
          BRIDGET is getting uncomfortable.

                         BRIDGET
          These smile muscles need to set.
          She exits with a look at Maggie. Maggie stops working
          and turns to Greer, speaks passionately.

                         MAGGIE
          Tom, don't you get it? That body
          in our apartment-- the one you
          call real--- it isn't me. I'm
          right here.

                         GREER
          Honey, if you're worried about the
          way you look-- it doesn't matter,
          it never did--

                         MAGGIE
          Exactly! What matters is who I
          choose to be.
          As the conversation gets more heated, co-workers
          pointedly turn away, while eavesdropping.

                         GREER
          I married a person, you're
          choosing to be a thing.

          beautiful things.

                         MAGGIE
          Well that's your problem, isn't
          it. if you can be young and
          beautiful and feel good all the
          time-- why would anyone choose
          anything else?

                         GREER
          Because it's bullshit. Because
          we're human, like it or not.

                         MAGGIE
          Jesus, Tom. You sound like a
          Dread.
          Maggie turns back to what she was doing. Greer has
          trouble swallowing his anger.

                         GREER
          I may just have to kick down your
          bedroom door.

                         MAGGIE
          (not looking up)
          I'd never forgive you.

                         GREER
          Then maybe I should just move out.

                         MAGGIE

          On the top is a WEDDING PHOTO of Maggie and Greer, much
          younger.
          He places this on the bedside table, moves for the
          bathroom.

          INT. HOTEL BATHROOM - NIGHT

          GREER, in a TOWEL now, having finished a shower. He
          wipes STEAM off the MIRROR and takes a hard look at

          GREER takes this in. He's at his computer, first thing
          in the morning, with a cup of TAKE-OUT COFFEE. PETERS is
          going through the box of documents we saw earlier. When
          she glances toward him, he clears the screen.

          Against him? He's one of them.

                         (CONSIDERING IT)
          'Course, since he owns the patents
          on surrogate technology, they must
          have to pay him billions.

                         GREER
          (shakes his head)
          He dies, they still have to pay

          nod to NAKATA, who nods back as he answers his RINGING
          PHONE. Before he can even say a word:

                         STONE (FILTER)
          This is Stone!
          Nakata looks toward the office, starting to rise.

                         NAKATA
          What do you need, sir?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          90.

          INT. STONE'S STUDY - DAY

          Upscale. The REAL STONE, a good deal heavier than his
          surrogate, is sitting in boxer shorts at the edge of his
          STIM CHAIR, a phone in his hand.

                         STONE
          Sonofabitch Greer disabled my
          surrie, stop him!

          INT. FBI BUILDING/STAIRWELL - DAY

          GREER takes a couple steps at a time. He's on his phone.

                         GREER
          Just meet me in the garage-- leave
          the trunk open!
          As he rounds a corner, he comes face to face with--
          --a pair of AGENTS, each carrying a HANDGUN. They
          approach from below.

                         AGENT #1
          Tom, we don't want to hurt you.
          Greer nods and raises his hands, resigned-- he still
          clutches the papers. As Agent #1 nears, Greer suddenly--
          --PLANTS a FOOT in the man's chest, sending him crashing
          into AGENT #2. Both men topple down the stairs, FIRE
          their guns wildly.
          Greer has also lost his balance and dropped some papers,
          which he has to scoop up as he claws for the. doorway and
          dashes through.

          INT. FBI BUILDING/PARKING GARAGE - DAY

          PETERS waits near an IDLING SEDAN, the TRUNK OPEN. Greer
          dives inside, she SLAMS it and gets behind the wheel.
          She PEELS out, going up a few levels.
          AT AN EXIT GATE - an FBI GUARD looks inside.

                         FBI GUARD
          They're looking for Tom Greer.
          You seen him?
          She shakes her head, he presses a button to open the gate
          and waves her through.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          91.

          EXT. PARK - DAY

          THE FBI SEDAN drives down a curving, forested road.

          INT. FBI CAR - DAY

          PETERS drives, GREER in the passenger seat, poring over
          the papers.

                         GREER
          Ever hear of the Human Defense League?

                         PETERS
          Sure, the extremist wing of the
          anti-surrogate movement.

                         GREER
          According to this, their number one
          supporter is Lionel Canter.

                         PETERS
          What? The father of surrogacy?
          Impossible.

                         GREER
          Says he's funneled billions into
          their organization. Not to
          mention direct support for the man
          who calls himself the Prophet.
          Canter's bought him land,
          lawyers... and enough weapons to
          start a war.

          EXT. RESERVATION NO MAN'S LAND - DAY

          THE DREADS emerge from tents and shacks at the sound of a
          nearby RUMBLING.
          ANGLE THROUGH FENCE - BULLDOZERS, TANKS, uniformed
          NATIONAL GUARDSMEN (all surrogates with the SAME FACE)
          are assembling on the perimeter of the Dread reservation.
          They carry non-lethal TASER WANDS and RIFLES.
          An OFFICER moves to the front, carrying a WALKIE-TALKIE.
          In response to a command, he turns and signals to the
          troops behind him and--
          --the BULLDOZERS start PLOWING DOWN the fence. As
          Guardsmen move past him, the officer calls out:

          biologicals, do not fire unless
          absolutely necessary!

          INT. CHEAP HOTEL ROOM - DAY

          PAPERWORK spread on a table before PETERS.

                         PETERS
          Swiss accounts, anonymous wire
          transfers, unattributed testimony--
          this isn't proof.
          WIDER - GREER lies in his clothes on the bed, bone tired,
          a flat-screen TV plays silently.

                         GREER
          Not enough for a courtroom. But
          VSI knew that if Lionel Canter
          suffered a mysterious brain
          hemmorhage, the powers that be
          wouldn't be terribly upset.

                         PETERS
          He's not some kind of monster, you
          know. Canter's initial research
          was in prosthetics-- for amputees,
          quadriplegics... people with
          degenerative diseases. Maybe he
          feels his technology's been
          perverted. Maybe it has.
          GREER studies her with interest, her tone is strangely
          passionate.

                         GREER
          I had no idea you were such a
          humanist.
          PETERS looks away-- then reacts to something on TV, grabs
          a remote and turns UP THE VOLUME.
          ON TV SCREEN - HAND-HELD footage as NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS
          move across the Dread Reservation No Man's Land, using
          TASER WANDS to subdue resisting DREADS, frisking them and
          rifling through possessions as they upend dwellings.

          Guard moved into the East Baltimore
          Human Reservation this morning, in a
          search for contraband weapons...
          GREER knows what this is about.

                         GREER
          Colonel Brandon didn't waste any
          time.

                         PETERS
          They're looking for the 0. D.

                         GREER
          The what?

                         PETERS

                         (A BEAT)
          Isn't that what you called it?
          What does it stand for again?

                         GREER
          Overload Device.
          She nods and turns nonchalantly back to the paperwork.
          As she does so, GREER cocks his head and studies her.
          Protecting Brand's confidence, he never told her what the
          device was called.

                         PETERS
          So what do we do about Stone?

                         GREER
          I call and tell him I'll take
          early retirement with full pension
          benefits. In return for keeping
          his little secret.

                         PETERS
          That isn't funny.

                         GREER
          I'm not laughing.

                         PETERS

                         (RISES)
          I don't believe you-- they killed
          Canter's son, a college kid, his
          whole life ahead of him! Don't we
          owe him something?
          She's genuinely upset. Greer won't meet her eye.

                         (ENRAGED)
          They will come after Canter again--
          but you're just going to deposit
          your pension checks, look the
          other way and let him die.

                         GREER
          (looks at her)
          Maybe he's got it coming.

          I thought you were a cop. I
          thought you were a human being.
          PETERS marches out of there and slams the door on the way
          out. GREER waits a few moments, his mind racing-- then
          he moves for the door himself.

          INT. RENTAL AGENCY - DAY

          GREER moves from a desk with a pretty RENTAL AGENT,
          working at a small hand-held COMPUTER. LOGOS for GLOBAL

          SYNTH RENTALS.

                         RENTAL AGENT
          Our nearest rental office is just
          outside Denver, the car and phone
          will be extra--

                         GREER
          I'm only gonna be there a couple
          hours.
          She leads him toward a curtained BOOTH, one of many here.
          RED GLOWS emanate from a few.

                         RENTAL AGENT
          Do you want to customize--?

                         GREER
          Generic's fine.
          She pulls back a CURTAIN to reveal a STIM-CHAIR and a

          SENSORY PROJECTOR.

          INT. RESERVATION TEMPLE -- DAY

          THE PROPHET stands with a MIC before a LARGE CROWD packed
          into the place, sounds of CHAOS from outside. GUARDSMEN
          are moving into the temple, methodically searching those
          inside. -

                         PROPHET
          Have no fear, the day of
          resurrection is at hand!
          A team of GUARDSMEN move to surround the Prophet, his
          BODYGUARDS struggle with them.

                         PROPHET (CONT'D)
          No! Do not resist! The
          oppressors shall soon fall, never
          to rise again...
          Ignoring him, some bodyguards pull HANDGUNS and FIRE on
          the SURROGATE GUARDSMEN, who immediately RETURN FIRE with
          automatic weapons. BUD and MILLER, the Prophet's right
          hand men, both take bullets and go down.
          THE PROPHET manages to escape out a side exit during this
          gunfire-- but a stray BULLET catches him in the back as
          he flees.

          EXT. RESERVATION TEMPLE - DAY

          As he runs from the building, the PROPHET is TACKLED by a
          GUARDSMAN. He turns the man over, the Prophet's eyes are
          empty, his head lolls back.
          A BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAM from nearby as a YOUNG FEMALE
          DREAD takes this in.

                         YOUNG DREAD
          They've killed him! They've
          killed the Prophet!
          Other DREADS nearby react, the CRY spreading.
          WITH THE GUARDSMAN, examining the body. The Prophet is
          already rigid... and GREEN COOLANT is spreading from an
          exit wound in his chest. A guardsman rips open his
          shirt, pokes at the wound--
          ELECTRONICS and TORN PLASTIC.
          THE GUARDSMAN's amazed, gets on his WALKIE-TALKIE.

          Nearby Guardsmen react to the furious DREADS massing
          around them. A GRENADE LANDS nearby, GUARDSMAN #2 throws
          himself on it, his SURRIE BLOWS UP. GUNFIRE ERUPTS
          nearby, a MOLOTOV COCKTAIL sails through the air.

          THE COMPACT pulls to a stop.
          GENERIC/GREER climbs out of the car. He's blandly
          handsome, in a business suit, with perfect hair that
          looks glued in place. His movements are stilted, this is
          a cheap model and he's not used to it.
          GENERIC/GREER steps onto the porch, knocks on the door.
          No answer. He tries the knob-- locked.

          GENERIC/GREER flips a LIGHT SWITCH at the top of the

          stairs, in her stained, torn nightgown, motionless. A
          pool of BLOOD from her head... her neck is twisted at a
          strange angle.

          GREER winces with the shock of this.

          He can see her neck is broken, he can't move her. Her
          eyes are closed, lips parched, hair matted with blood
          from a gash in her scalp. Generic/Greer leans close,
          takes her pulse.
          Suddenly her eyes open. She speaks with difficulty.

          Mountainview, there's a woman, I
          think her neck is broken--

                         (TO PETERS)
          How long have you been down here?

                         REAL PETERS
          Three days I think...

          They're on the way. Somebody's been
          using your surrogate.

                         REAL PETERS
          What?

                         GENERIC/GREER
          You-- it's been showing up to work
          every day.

                         REAL PETERS
          No, I-- the night your chopper went
          down... I woke up and somebody was
          here... I fought with him, but he
          was so strong--

                         WIPES
          Peters is getting distraught. Generic/Greer gently
          her brow.

          Ssh, relax --

          going to do my job for me.
          A beat. Their eyes meet as the realization hits

          It has to be... oh God, I'm so cold...
          She clearly had been fighting to stay alive, just to tell
          someone what happened.

          REAL PETERS (CONT'D)
          Would've been nice to meet you in
          person...
          She now closes her eyes. Greer agonizes.

          Peters, hang on, please-- it won't
          be long...
          He rises, finds an old blanket to put around her.

          They'll be here in just a minute...
          No response. He brushes her hair back from her face--
          REAL PETERS' eyes are half-open, vacant. She's dead.
          GENERIC/GREER lets out an anguished CRY.

          A handful of DREADS are storming down the street,

          their way.
          A SCROLLING ELECTRONIC NEWS CRAWL on the side of a
          building: "PROPHET SHOT, REPORTED DEAD..."
          GREER is walking fast, on the phone, steering clear of

          Responding to a subtle BEEP in his ear,-he makes as if to

                         GREER (FILTER)
          Bobby, it's Greer, I need a remote
          shutdown. You'll have the
          surrie's digital address on file,
          Agent Jennifer Peters.
          CAMERA MOVES to reveal that PETERS (the surrie) is
          holding BOBBY at GUNPOINT, a grim expression on her face.
          She doesn't realize Bobby's on the phone.

          GREER (FILTER) (CONT'D)
          Hello? Bobby, are you there?
          Bobby looks toward the special TERMINAL that displays the
          surrie serial numbers. NUMBERS are cranking through
          fast, ALL HIGHLIGHTING. Bobby looks at Peters, but
          speaks for Greer's benefit.

                         BOBBY
          Peters, have you gone insane?
          Put the gun away, what the hell
          are you trying to prove?
          PETERS ignores him, watching the TERMINAL SCREEN.
          WIDER now, we see that all the SURRIE WATCHERS have
          disconnected, they're stationary on their tracks. THE
          GLOWING MONITORS remain on, showing random scenes,
          unwatched. MOVEMENT at the elevated entrance--
          --PETERS spins and FIRES HER HANDGUN in that direction.
          The intruder retreats. We now see a couple of SURRIES
          have already been dropped here, sprawled on the staircase
          leading down, bullets in their heads.
          PETERS spins on Bobby, who's WHISPERING frantically into

                         HIS HEADSET:

                         BOBBY (CONT'D)
          She's into the entire surrie
          database, I dunno what she's--
          Peters YANKS off Bobby's headset and throws it aside.

          EXT. WASHINGTON STREET - DAY

          GREER has stopped, stunned. Then, realizing what's
          happening, he takes off at a sprint in a different

          MAGGIE is hard at work, HOT-GLUING a new head of STREAKED
          HAIR around the motionless face of a BEAUTIFUL SURROGATE.
          She glances at a small CELLPHONE, sitting on a WORK TRAY
          nearby. It FLASHES--
          CLOSE - "THOMAS GREER" scrolls on the CELLPHONE READOUT.
          MAGGIE wants to pick up, but both hands are occupied.
          She sighs, returns to her work.

          INT. FBI BUILDING/CORRIDOR - DAY

          A group of AGENTS in RIOT GEAR are gathered here, WEAPONS
          ready. One turns to see--
          STONE approaching (his surrie is operational again),
          flanked by a couple of other AGENTS.

                         RIOT AGENT
          She'll only speak with you, sir.

                         STONE

          in and take her down?

          She's got a human hostage.
          Stone pauses, takes a breath.

                         STONE
          That fat ass Sanders.
          He self-consciously rubs the back of his head, where we
          now see ELECTRICAL TAPE holding shut the damaged latch.

          I wouldn't be. I'm here to arrest him.
          ARMANDO moves closer at this.

                         CLERK
          I see... do you have a warrant?

                         GREER
          Listen to me. Dr. Canter is
          committing a crime via surrogate--
          right now. If you don't cooperate
          and let me up there, you become an
          accomplice.

                         CLERK
          Without a warrant, I'm afraid I
          can't help you.
          ARMANDO takes Greer by the arm in a painful grip.

                         ARMANDO
          You're gonna have to leave, sir.
          Armando escorts Greer none too gently to the door.

                         GREER
          Ow! Easy, I'm only human.
          As Armando relaxes his grip a bit, GREER flexes his left
          arm-- then gasps and clutches his chest, as if having a
          coronary. He stumbles, falls to his knees. Armando
          bends over him--

                         ARMANDO
          Are you OK?
          Greer suddenly thrusts his hand beneath the man's jacket.
          Armando reacts, begins to struggle with Greer-- BANG BANG
          beneath his suitcoat.
          Armando's ARM SPASMS WILDLY. He takes a few steps back,
          SPARKS and HYDRAULIC FLUID coming from his chest. GREER
          is holding the man's GUN now, aimed at him.

                         ARMANDO (CONT'D)
          You asshole. I just made the last
          payment.
          GREER rises and hurries to the CLERK, points the gun at

          I'm calling the police.
          The CLERK goes stock still, he's checked out-- he's
          obviously making the call from home. Greer shoves the
          inert body aside, it falls flat. He reaches for the
          elevator key, snatches it up when--
          ARMANDO wraps his one good arm around Greer's throat from
          behind, choking him. They stagger backward, GREER aims
          the gun behind his head and FIRES, blowing a HOLE in
          Armando's forehead. GREEN COOLANT, FRIED ELECTRONICS fly
          from the exit wound.
          They topple to the ground together. GREER struggles from
          the frozen surrie's grip, clutching his ear, deafened by
          the gun's loud report.
          As Greer gets to his feet, the DOORMAN enters, takes in
          the tableau-- the gun-wielding man, the two surries on
          the ground-- and dashes outside again.
          GREER hurries for CANTER'S PRIVATE ELEVATOR. He turns
          the key-- no light, nothing. He makes a frustrated NOISE
          and dashes for a nearby door to the stairwell.

          gingerly over the fallen surrogates.
          PETERS finishes CUFFING BOBBY'S WRISTS to a chair with
          plastic cuffs. She moves to get a look at Stone, across
          the expanse of glowing monitors. She's holstered her
          gun.

                         PETERS
          Who was it, Stone? Who was it at
          VSI that hired you to kill me?

          agent, destroying federal
          property, creating a hostage

          I wouldn't add homicide to that
          list. As it is, you're going to

          He turns on his heel, begins walking back up the stairs
          for the door.
          PETERS lowers the gun, reaches into her pocket and pulls
          out the Q.D. WEAPON.

                         PETERS
          An eye for an eye...
          She points it at the back of Stone's head and--
          --STONE's eyes go wide in agony-- and EXPLODE. He goes
          TUMBLING back down the stairs, SMOKE pouring from his
          head, BODY twitching crazily.

                         AN ARC--
          --the RIOT AGENTS all FREEZE'IN PLACE for a second-- and
          then drop at once. Unlike with Stone, there's no
          twitching, smoke or exploding eyeballs. The sudden
          silence is eerie.
          PETERS rises and moves to STONE, the grotesque, empty-
          eyed surrogate. Her expression is grim, but she's
          accomplished an important part of her mission.
          BOBBY looks around at the many fallen bodies.

                         BOBBY
          Are they dead?

                         PETERS
          (re: the riot agents)
          They're fine.

          INT. STONE'S STUDY - DAY

          The PHONE IS RINGING. Move from it to--
          STONE, in his stim chair, projector on his head... eyes
          rolled back, dead. BLOOD begins to seep from his ears.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          107.

          EXT. CANTER'S BUILDING/ROOF/BALCONY - DAY

          GREER has come out on the roof. There's an enormous CELL
          TOWER and DISH up here. He moves to the edge, peers over
          warily.
          ANGLE DOWN - forty stories down to the street.
          GREER flinches back, reeling with vertigo. He moves
          along the edge, looking for something.
          ANGLE DOWN - the BALCONY outside Canter's study, just
          inside the roof overhang, a fifteen-foot drop.
          GREER squeezes his eyes shut, steeling himself for what
          he must do. He lowers himself to hang onto the edge,
          trying not to look down. He swings his body to get the
          momentum going the right way--
          --but his grip gives a moment too soon--
          GREER plunges from the roof to the BALCONY RAIL, hitting
          the railing hard, starting to fall off the wrong way.
          But he manages to grab onto the metal. He hauls himself
          up and collapses onto the balcony, lying on his back.
          HIS LEG has been injured in the fall, the pants torn,
          blood. GREER breathes audibly, in pain and exhaustion.

          INT. FBI BUILDING/SURVEILLANCE CENTER - DAY

          ON THE TERMINAL - numbers still HIGHLIGHTING, flying past
          at incredible speed.
          MOVE TO FIND PETERS, with an open TOOLBOX. She's
          expertly wiring the O.D. to the keyboard, cutting,
          splicing and reattaching wires.
          BOBBY wheels closer, tries to KICK the O.D.
          Without flinching, PETERS KNOCKS him back across the
          room, the chair FALLS OVER and Bobby moans.

          INT. CANTER'S PENTHOUSE/STUDY - DAY

          GREER SHOOTS THE GLASS, elbows out the shards and reaches
          in to unlock the balcony door. Keeping his gun ready, he
          limps painfully into the empty room.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          108.

                         - DAY

          INT. CANTER'S PENTHOUSE/VARIOUS ROOMS

          QUICK CUTS as GREER hunts for Canter, flinging open doors
          into BEDROOMS, a LIVING ROOM, BATHROOMS.

          INT. LUXURY BUILDING/LOBBY - DAY

          The CLERK, reactivated, leads a squad of UNIFORMED POLICE
          toward the stairwell.

          INT. CANTER'S PENTHOUSE/HALLWAY

          GREER has almost given up hope when he starts at a noise
          and spins, ready to shoot at--
          --the AUTOMATED VACUUM humming around a corner. As it
          moves past his feet, Greer registers--
          --a thin strip of RED LIGHT at floor level. After a
          moment, he begins rapping at the wall, realizing it's
          false.

          INT. LUXURY BUILDING/STAIRWELL - DAY

          THE CLERK taps a CODE into the KEYPAD of the bullet-
          dented door. We hear a HEAVY LATCH disengage.

          INT. CANTER'S PENTHOUSE/HALLWAY - DAY

          GREER hears FOOTSTEPS of the approaching cops as he tries
          desperately to find a way into the hidden space. He
          discovers a LATCH at waist level, the wall becomes a
          pocket door. He lets himself in and closes it behind him

                         JUST AS--
          THE POLICE and the CLERK round the corner.

          INT. CANTER'S PENTHOUSE/CONTROL AREA - DAY

          Eerie RED LIGHT, a narrow, snaking passageway. GREER
          listens as the FOOTSTEPS pass outside, turns to see--
          THE STALKER-- the hulking, silver-eyed surrogate who
          broke into Peters' place. He's inert in his CHARGING

          BAY.
          Beside him is the BOY who picked Greer up in the limo.

          109.

                         CONTINUED:
          WIDER, a dozen SURROGATES, different ages and sexes,
          lined up in their charging bays. Clearly, Canter can
          become anyone he wants to be.
          GREER is momentarily stunned to see--
          THE PROPHET, a spare surrogate, in a charging bay.
          GREER moves carefully onward. Around a corner, he sees--
          --a PROJECTOR DISPLAY SCREEN. It's PETERS' POV on the
          FBI SURVEILLANCE CENTER, a glance toward the motionless
          RIOT AGENTS, to BOBBY struggling on the ground. PETERS'
          POV SETTLES on the numbers HIGHLIGHTING on the terminal.
          THE 0. D. is connected to the keyboard, BLUE DIODES
          FLASH, the jerry-rigging complete.
          REAL CANTER is visible from behind in an elaborate
          prosthetic WHEELCHAIR, a SENSORY PROJECTOR on his head.
          GREER moves toward him and RIPS OFF the headgear.
          REAL CANTER opens his eyes, startled.

                         GREER
          You're insane.

          INT. FBI BUILDING/SURVEILLANCE CENTER -- DAY

          PETERS is frozen in place by the-terminal. BOBBY, on the
          ground, realizes something's happened. He strains to see
          the numbers screen.
          ON SCREEN -- THE NUMBERS have stopped scrolling. A
          dialogue box: "FULL DATABASE SELECTED - UPLOADING
          SOFTWARE TO NETWORK" with a bar moving up slowly.

          INT. CANTER'S PENTHOUSE/CONTROL AREA - DAY

          CANTER squints up at GREER from his wheelchair and brace.
          He speaks with an ELECTRONIC AID, his voice slightly
          artificial-sounding.

                         CANTER
          Jennifer Peters. Is she--

                         GREER
          She's dead.

                         CANTER
          I had no intention of hurting her.
          I'm truly sorry--

                         CONTINUED:

                         GREER
          You bastard, she was my partner, I
          cared about her--

                         CANTER
          Did you? You barely knew her. It
          was me you came to care about--

                         GREER
          Shut up!
          Greer clenches his fist, if the man wasn't in a
          wheelchair he would beat the hell out of him. Struggling
          to control himself, mind reeling:

                         GREER (CONT'D)
          How many people are you? You're
          really the Prophet?

                         CANTER
          I had to fight VSI any way I
          could.
          As canter speaks, his eyes flick toward the PROJECTOR'S

                         MONITOR--
          --the image of the O.D. DEVICE UPLOADING SOFTWARE from
          PETERS' POV. Canter tries to block Greer's view--

                         CANTER (CONT'D)
          There's nothing you can do--
          GREER PUSHES CANTER'S WHEELCHAIR out of the way
          violently. Greer sits on the floor, leaning against the
          wall. He takes a breath and puts on the PROJECTOR
          HEADSET. He slips on the FINGERSLEEVE, presses his
          fingers together and--

          INT. FBI BUILDING/SURVEILLANCE CENTER - DAY

          --PETERS is suddenly REANIMATED, stumbles a bit where she
          stands, as Greer gets his bearings in this new body. He
          moves to the KEYBOARD and RIPS THE O.D. from the jerry-
          rigged connection. -

          ON TERMINAL SCREEN -- "UPLOAD COMPLETE."
          PETERS turns to BOBBY.

                         PETERS
          How do I shut it down?

                         PETERS
          Bobby, this is Agent Greer!
          ON THE CATWALK - a HUMAN agent, he's a SNIPER in black,
          creeps into position, readying his rifle.
          PETERS/GREER helps BOBBY up, so that he can see the
          computer screen. Bobby remains cuffed.

          ON SCREEN - "PREPARING TO DISCONNECT OPERATORS - 30
          SECONDS." The number is counting down.

                         (THINKING)
          OK... the software from that
          thing's already in the system, you
          have to abort transmission.

                         (DESPERATE)
          How?1

                         BOBBY
          Hit control-escape, F12.
          As PETERS/GREER does so:

                         PETERS/GREER
          This can really send a virus to
          every surrie on the network?

                         BOBBY
          Sure, but it has to disconnect the
          operators first.

                         PETERS/GREER
          (pauses, surprised)
          So people aren't in any danger...

                         BOBBY
          Their surrogates are! Hurry up!

          ON TERMINAL SCREEN - "ABORT? YES. NO."

          INT. CANTER'S PENTHOUSE/CONTROL AREA - DAY

          THE PROJECTOR SCREEN shows the words "YES. NO."

          CANTER stares at GREER, seeing that Greer realizes what's
          at stake-- the fate of humanity.

          You understand...

          INT. FBI BUILDING/SURVEILLANCE CENTER - DAY

          PETERS/GREER reaches for the keyboard again, hesitates.
          A moment of internal conflict.
          BOBBY stares, confused.

                         BOBBY
          Do it!
          BANG! A CLEAN HEADSHOT drops PETERS/GREER in her tracks,
          ELECTRONIC GOO sprays the COMPUTER SCREEN.
          BOBBY spins in his chair.

                         BOBBY (CONT'D)

          INT. CANTER'S PENTHOUSE/CONTROL AREA - DAY

          GREER yanks off the headset, breathing hard, eyes wide
          with shock. CANTER regards him from his wheelchair.
          He's been watching the MONITOR, knows what just happened.

                         CANTER
          You could have stopped it. Thank
          you...

                         GREER
          Why...?

                         CANTER
          You know why. I won't be
          responsible for the death of
          humanity. I like the way you put
          it-- unringing a bell.
          GREER puts his head in his hands, realizing the enormity
          of what he's just done.

                         GREER
          You created them.

          me the chance to live normal lives.
          But my partners at VSI overrode me.
          They saw a much larger market--
          surrogates for everyone. Healthy
          people. Children. A world without
          risk, without pain. Without
          feelings. Nothing at stake.
          Nothing to live for.
          Greer rises shakily.

                         GREER
          What's going to happen?

                         CANTER
          The day of resurrection.
          As he speaks, he raises a small white capsule to his
          lips.

                         GREER
          No--!
          Before Greer can stop him, CANTER BITES INTO IT and
          swallows. Greer tries to get the capsule from Canter's
          mouth-- but the man is DEAD within moments.

          BOBBY KICKS at the COMPUTER frantically, CRYING OUT. THE

          LATE AFTERNOON, golden light. DREADS have been herded
          together here, NATIONAL GUARDSMEN surrounding them.
          Suddenly the GUARDSMEN all DROP at once.

          CROWDED, rush hour, lots of traffic and noise. Then--
          --PEDESTRIANS fall in a wave. CARS VEER out of control,
          SMASHING INTO EACH OTHER, careening onto the sidewalk,
          rolling over fallen surrie bodies and SMASHING into
          storefronts.

          THE FEDS are all collapsed over desks, or sprawled flat.

          INT. SUBWAY - DAY

          A CAR FULL OF COMMUTERS-- some slumped in their seats or
          hanging from straps, others lying on the floor. The car
          STOPS AUTOMATICALLY, the DOORS OPEN with a HISS--

          ANGLE DOWN on the suddenly quiet street. The surries
          have dropped throughout the city.
          PULL BACK to reveal GREER looking down on this. He limps
          quickly back inside--

          INT. CANTER'S PENTHOUSE/STUDY - DAY

          --stepping over the BODIES of the FALLEN COPS. He moves

          EXT. RESERVATION NO MAN'S LAND - DAY

          The moment the Dreads have been waiting for. With a mass
          CRY, they're charging over the fallen BODIES of the
          GUARDSMEN and over the flattened fences.
          WIDE as THOUSANDS OF DREADS run out of the reservation
          into the streets of the city.

          GREER hobbles through the dreadful aftermath-- SMOKING
          AUTO PILEUPS, BODIES everywhere, most fallen in their
          tracks, a few remain on their feet. CAR HORNS, ALARMS in
          the distance. -
          A few disheveled DREADS are here, taking it in with
          delight and amazement. They WHOOP as they TIP OVER a
          couple of the standing surries.
          GREER passes a CAR on the sidewalk, its DRIVER slumped
          against the wheel-- the RADIO BLARES:

          The massive surrogate shutdown
          appears to be nationwide...

          EXT. VSI HEADQUARTERS - DAY

          FALLEN SURRIES all over the grounds. ARMED DREADS are
          rushing into the place, past the MOTIONLESS SENTRIES.
          They're making for the factory.

                         RADIO VOICE
          Rioters presumed to be members of
          the Human Coalition seem to be
          making coordinated attacks on

                         SURROGATE-RELATED BUSINESSES
          across the country...

          INT. VSI FACTORY - DAY

          The ROBOTIC ASSEMBLY LINE, still running until--
          BOOM! A DREAD shoots an RPG into the machinery.
          SURROGATE PARTS are BLASTED in all directions.

          INT. VSI WAREHOUSE - DAY

          FIRE SPREADS across the rows of SURROGATE TEMPLATES,
          packed together tightly.
          CLOSE on a MELTING FACE, the deforming PLASTIC SKULL and
          ELECTRONICS within.

                         RADIO VOICE
          Citizens are asked to remain in
          their homes...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          116.

          EXT. GREER'S BUILDING - DAY

          GREER makes his way toward his place.

          INT. GREER'S APARTMENT/LIVING ROOM - DAY

          GREER enters, moves immediately for his wife's bedroom.

                         GREER
          Maggie--?
          He KNOCKS gently, then tries the door-- it isn't locked.

          INT. GREER'S APARTMENT/MAGGIE'S ROOM - DAY

          The room is DIM, there's a FORM huddled in the bed,
          SOBBING, covers pulled up. GREER moves slowly toward
          her, speaks in a soothing voice.

                         GREER
          Maggie, it's me.
          She pulls away from his touch at first, struggles.

                         MAGGIE
          No! Please no, don't look at me...
          Greer pulls away the covers to reveal the REAL MAGGIE.
          She's pale, emaciated and malnourished, tears running
          down her face. She shrinks away from him.

                         MAGGIE (CONT'D)
          No Tom, I don't want you to...
          It doesn't matter to Greer-- he takes her in his arms and
          holds her close.

                         GREER
          It's OK, it's OK...

                         MAGGIE
          No it's not...

                         GREER
          Ssh. It's just us now.
          Slowly, she puts her arms around him, weeping against his
          chest. PULL BACK and--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          117.

          EXT. GREER'S BUILDING/NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

          --OUT THE WINDOW. MOVE to show exterior DOORS OPENING
          and GREER'S NEIGHBORS EMERGING, blinking in the
          unfamiliar sunlight. Most wear robes, sweatclothes.
          They're all ages, some overweight, others homely-- it's
          almost a relief after all the young, perfect people.
          DOWN THE STREET, OTHERS EMERGE, regard each other warily,
          like people after an earthquake. Some begin speaking to
          each other for the first time, in whispers at first,
          others take in the SUNSET which bathes the neighborhood
          in orange light.

    We hear OVER...

                              GABRIEL (V.O.)
                You know the problem with
                Hollywood? They make shit.
                Unbelievable, unremarkable shit.
                I'm not some grungy filmmaker-
                wannabee searching for
                existentialism through a haze of
                bong-smoke. It's easy to pick
                apart bad acting, short-sighted
                directing, or the purely moronic
                stringing together of words many
                of the studios term as prose. No,
                I'm talking the lack of realism.
                Realism. Not a pervasive element
                in the modern American cinematic
                vision.


    FADE IN:

    INT. STARBUCKS COFFEE SHOP - MORNING

    Three men sit at a window booth drinking coffee and
    talking. Two of the men sit on one side of the table;
    STANLEY is in his early thirties, AGENT ROBERTS, early
    forties. Both wear suits, the younger's is fairly
    expensive and well cut, the other's is polyester, enough
    said. The MAN across, however, is quite different. He
    is what they used to call a "cool-cat."

                              GABRIEL (MAN)
                Take Dog Day Afternoon for
                example. Arguably Pacino's
                greatest performance, excepting
                The Godfather, Part I, and
                Scarface, of course. A
                masterpiece of directing, easily
                Lumet's best. The acting, the
                script, cinematography, all top
                notch. But, they didn't push the
                envelope. What if in Dog Day,
                Sonny really wanted to get away
                with it? What if, and here's
                where it gets tricky. What if
                they'd started killing hostages?
                No mercy, no quarter, meet our
                demands or the cute blonde in the
                bell bottoms gets one in the back
                of the head, bam, splatter. What?
                Still no bus?
                              (MORE)

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                              2.

1   CONTINUED:                                                      1

                               GABRIEL (CONT'D)
                 How many innocent victims would
                 they let get sprayed across the
                 windows before the city reversed
                 its policy on hostage situations?
                 And this was 1976. No C.N.N., no
                 C.N.B.C., no M.T.V. No Internet.
                 Fast forward to the present, same
                 situation. Can you imagine the
                 feeding frenzy of the modern
                 media? In hours it would be the
                 top story from Boston to Budapest.
                 All caught in 150 millimeter zoom,
                 computer enhanced, and color
                 corrected. You would practically
                 taste the brain matter. Six
                 hostages die. Ten. Twelve.
                 Twenty. Thirty. Relentless. One
                 after another. All over a bus, a
                 plane, and a couple of million
                 dollars that were federally
                 insured.

    He sits, letting the pictures sink in, then:

                               GABRIEL
                 Just a thought. I mean it's not
                 really within the realm of
                 conventional cinema, but what
                 if...?

                               ROBERTS
                 You know, this movie of yours, I
                 don't think it would have worked.

                                GABRIEL
                 Really?   How come?

                               ROBERTS
                        (shrugs)
                 Audiences love happy endings.

                               GABRIEL
                 Pacino escapes. With the money.
                 Boyfriend gets the sex change
                 operation. They live happily ever
                 after.

    Stanley shakes his head.

                                GABRIEL
                 No?

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                             3.

1   CONTINUED:    (2)                                              1

                               STANLEY
                 No.

                               GABRIEL
                 Homophobia?

    Stanley shakes his head.

                               STANLEY
                 Bad guy can't win. It's a
                 morality tale. One way or the
                 other, he's gotta go down.

                                GABRIEL
                 Oh, well. Life does tend to be
                 stranger than fiction.
                        (looking at watch)
                 Well, guys, gotta jet. This place
                 is kinda dead.

    CAMERA PANS AROUND the coffee shop. Not a soul in the
    place. We CONTINUE TO PAN AROUND 270 DEGREES TO the
    front door, which is open. Outside the open doorway are
    crouched a squad of heavily body-armored SWAT members,
    packed together, and aiming automatic weapons inside.


    ANGLE ON GABRIEL

                               GABRIEL
                 Thanks for the coffee.

    He gets up. In his left hand, which has been hidden by
    the table until now, he is holding a strange-looking
    spring-loaded grip. Gabriel is looking back at them.
    Smiles.

                               GABRIEL
                 Rene Descartes is sitting in some
                 bar in Paris. Bartender says,
                 'Hey, you want another drink?'
                 Descartes says, 'I think not.'
                 And disappears.

    He smiles at his own joke, then turns and walks over to
    the front door.

                               GABRIEL
                 Move.

    No one even twitches.

                               GABRIEL
                 I won't ask again.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                             4.

1   CONTINUED:    (3)                                             1

    He lifts up the device in his left hand.


    ANGLE ON ROBERTS

    who nods his head. The SWAT team moves back, letting
    Gabriel out of the coffee shop.

                               GABRIEL
                 Thank you.

    Gabriel looks back at Stan sitting in the booth.

                               GABRIEL
                 Stanley... you coming?

    Stan slides from the booth as Gabriel exits the coffee
    shop --


2   EXT. STARBUCKS COFFEE SHOP - DAY                              2

    SILENCE -- no sounds on the SOUNDTRACK.

    Gabriel and Stanley stop just outside the doorway.
    Gabriel dons a pair of hip little shades, then continues
    across the sidewalk and into the street.

    He nonchalantly looks up. Suddenly the THUMP of
    HELICOPTERS and the WAIL of SIRENS dominates the
    soundtrack.

    Pandemonium. HELICOPTERS RIP the sky, L.A. County PD and
    a bunch of news vultures. Squad cars block off both ends
    of the street while SWAT trucks, news vans, and looky-
    loos are packed together into the distance.

    Sharpshooters lean out of windows and snipers are
    positioned on every open rooftop. Hundreds of weapons
    are pointed at this man who saunters across the street as
    if he's on his way to Sunday service, without a care in
    the world.

    Slowly, Stanley follows Gabriel into the street.

    Gabriel steps up on the far sidewalk, a huge armored bus
    blocks most of the windows. He walks beside the bus,
    under a huge "WORLD BANC" sign, and through the glass
    front door, which shuts IN OUR FACE.


3   INT. BANK - CLOSEUP - GABRIEL - DAY                           3

    He turns away from the window and we FOLLOW him.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                                5.

3   CONTINUED:                                                        3

    The interior of the bank looks like New Orleans on Fat
    Tuesday. Three Hummers sit in the middle of the floor,
    surrounded by broken glass. Between them rests a bright
    red Ferrari F50 (Gabriel's).

    All but one of the front windows of the bank, the one
    with the door in it, has been welded over with 3/4 inch
    plate steel.

    Over two dozen hostages lie face down on the floor, arms
    cable-tied behind their backs. Something has been duct-
    taped around their chests and each is wearing what
    appears to be a dog collar.

    The other occupants of the room are nine men. All of
    whom would look as if they were attending the fashion
    event of the year were it not for the automatic weapons
    each one carries.

                                 GABRIEL
                 How we doin'?

    One of the ARMED MEN finishes putting a collar on a
    young, normally good-looking-but-now-covered-in-mascara,
    whimpering blonde girl.

                                 MARCO (ARMED MAN)
                 Done.

                                GABRIEL
                 Good.   Take her out.

    SUPERIMPOSE:    FRIDAY, OCTOBER 18     8:41:22...

    The front door opens and one of the suited men drags out
    the pretty blonde from earlier. She is sobbing and is in
    such grief she can't even walk.


4   EXT. BANK - DAY                                                   4

    On the sidewalk, the suited man, his automatic weapon
    slung, holds her up for everyone to see.


5   INT. BANK - DAY                                                   5

    Gabriel grabs his cell and dials.


6   INT. STARBUCKS COFFEE SHOP - DAY                                  6

    Roberts sits in the Starbucks which has been transformed
    into a high-tech command center reading a newspaper.

    We cannot see the headlines. Federal and state officers
    scramble around handling problems. The PHONE RINGS.
    Assistant Director Bill Joy (A.D. JOY), an older-looking
    guy who looks more like an accountant than an assistant
    director of the FBI, is handed the phone.

                               A.D. JOY
                 Is everyone in position?

                                SWAT LEADER
                 Almost, sir.

                                ROBERTS
                        (looks up from
                         paper)
                 What are you doing?

    We PAN AROUND.

                               A.D. JOY
                        (to SWAT LEADER)
                 Get her at your first opportunity.

                               SWAT LEADER
                        (into mike)
                 High ground one and two. You
                 have a green light.

                               ROBERTS
                 I've seen what this man is capable
                 of --

                                A.D. JOY
                 The F.B.I. does not negotiate with
                 terrorists. I assumed you'd be
                 aware of that.
                        (answering phone)
                 Joy.

    Roberts picks up an extension.

                 Don't talk, listen... When I made
                 my Dog Day Afternoon analogy, I
                 was not speaking metaphorically.
                 We have 22 hostages. Each has
                 been wrapped with 20 pounds of
                 C-four explosives.

     SWAT guys making their way to the roof of the bank.

                               GABRIEL (V.O.)
                 On top of that we have taped 15
                 pounds of stainless steel ball
                 bearings --

     The merc is holding up the weeping girl so everyone can

     red laser aiming dots appear on Gab's merc's chest.

     The merc turns toward them. The momentum swings his
     shouldered weapon upward in SLOW MOTION.

     The SWAT snipers take this weapon movement as an
     aggressive act and FIRE into the merc, the BULLETS
     RIPPING into him. He drops. A SWAT-armored vehicle
     rushes in -- one of the team jumps out, in an attempt to
     rescue the woman.

     Hysterical, the hostage runs back toward the bank,
     confusing the SWAT guy trying to rescue her. He reaches
     for her but she fights him. Finally, he grabs her around
     the waist and carries her on his shoulder into the street
     as she screams toward the bank for help.

     AXL TORVALDS enters customs. A thirty-something European
     who could easily pass for a season regular on
     "Sprockets."

     We PULL BACK. Torvalds is watching anxiously as his bags
     are torn into like Christmas day at the Griswalds. The
     two CUSTOMS AGENTS eye his three laptops suspiciously.

                                TORVALDS
                         (heavy Finnish
                          accent)
                  Please be careful --

     -- one of the Agents cuts off his plea with a glance.

                                TORVALDS
                         (to himself, almost
                          inaudibly)
                  -- that equipment is quite
                  expensive.

     Torvalds is wary of time. After several moments his bags
     are being repacked when another passport is found.

     The customs official holds up two passports. ANOTHER
     CUSTOMS OFFICIAL takes them and walks over to Torvalds.

                                ANOTHER CUSTOMS OFFICIAL
                  Mr. Torvalds. Could you step
                  over here, please.

     Torvalds glances at his watch.    1:45 PM.

                                TORVALDS
                  How long am I going to be delayed?

                                ANOTHER CUSTOMS OFFICIAL
                  It'll be just a moment.

     Torvalds stands to the side, while two customs officials
     compare his passports. They step over to a computer
     terminal and punch in some data. It's 1:50 PM.

     Torvalds notices a customs department employee wheeling a
     cart of confiscated items out of a nearby service
     elevator. He pushes the cart out of the oversized
     elevator.

     Torvalds shoots a glance back to the two officials
     discussing his situation.

     Torvalds casually picks up his computer case and coolly
     walks over to the elevator.

     Torvalds walks in just as the doors close.

     The customs officials conferring look around. Torvalds
     is gone. One of them looks up and sees the numbers
     changing above the elevator.

     The customs officials race up to the escalator to the --

     Torvalds exits the elevator -- and coolly makes his way
     to the pedestrian walkway. He's halfway across it, when
     -- multiple security teams appear and converge on him
     from both ends.

     He's finally wrestled to the ground.

25   INT. BOARDROOM (WASHINGTON, D.C.) - DAY                           25

     SENATOR JAMES REISMAN -- R. (Georgia) strides confidently
     into a small, windowless boardroom.

                                SENATOR REISMAN
                  This better be important, you
                  pulled me out of session.

     DARWIN KAPLAN, the President's aide and one of the four
     men in the room, definitely the most intense, smiles
     thinly.

                                KAPLAN
                  Senator, I wouldn't have asked you
                  to come here if it wasn't.

     The Senator starts to sit down.    Kaplan turns toward the
     Senator.

                                KAPLAN
                  Senator, we just received a
                  communication that Axl Torvalds
                  was intercepted entering the
                  continental U.S.

                  When?

                                KAPLAN
                  Within the last two hours.
                  According to our source inside the
                  F.B.I., he was nabbed coming
                  through customs at L.A.X.
                  Alone...

                                SENATOR REISMAN
                  Do they know who they are dealing
                  with?

                                KAPLAN
                  It is unlikely, sir. It was a
                  routine check and Torvalds freaked
                  out. They just got lucky.

                                 SENATOR REISMAN
                  This ain't good, boys. The Vortex
                  has used Torvalds before. What do
                  the feds know?

                                KAPLAN
                  Nothing as of yet. He's refusing
                  to speak English and the Finnish
                  consulate has already contacted
                  the State Department...

                                SENATOR REISMAN
                  So we haven't been compromised?

                                KAPLAN
                  We're not sure. We're working on
                  that right now.

                                 SENATOR REISMAN
                  You better get sure real quick,
                  son, 'cause someone's cock's
                  liable to end up on the block on
                  this one. And I promise you it
                  won't be mine.

                                KAPLAN
                  Senator, I think we'll be okay
                  here --

                                SENATOR REISMAN
                  I don't fucking pay you to think,
                  Kaplan. I pay you to keep me
                  informed. I know the Vortex.
                  That's why I voted against using
                  him on American soil.

     They look at each other.

     We are indeed in the middle of nowhere, no nothing as far
     as you can see. We CONTINUE TO CRANE UP, a $140,000
     Ferrari Modena flies down the road in a cloud of
     suspended gravel toward Stanley's dilapidated, piece-o'-
     crap trailer.


27   EXT. TRAILER - ROOF - DAY                                       27

     Stan stands on the roof of his trailer, which was a
     dilapidated shack in the 1950s and now is a lot worse.     A
     chained but scruffy-looking Rottweiler runs around in
     front of the trailer.

     Stan looks completely different than he did in the
     opening sequence. He hasn't taken very good care of
     himself. His hair is long, and right now standing on
     end. He is wearing nothing but a dirty towel, and is
     slicing golf balls off the roof. Whack.

     As the Ferrari drives up he begins hitting golf balls at
     it, but he just isn't very good. Nevertheless, after a
     dozen bad hits, a lucky shot ricochets off the aluminum
     hood.


     CLOSEUP - FERRARI HOOD

     Stan smiles as the car slides to a halt in the gravel
     driveway, and turns back to his "work."

     A few moments later, in SLOW MOTION, GINGER appears at
     the top of the ladder and steps onto the trailer's roof.
     Stan turns around.

     She is what the hack writers of the Thirties would call a
     vision. Thesauruses could be exhausted searching for
     adjectives that do her justice.

     In the low-rent light of Stanley's white trash haven, she

     She lights a cigarette, inhales deeply, then exhales.

     Begrudgingly he hands her the club. She tees up a ball,
     pulls up her skirt far enough to reveal thong, and whack,
     hits a ball that Tiger Woods would envy. CLANG.

     skirt.

     He does and the ball goes flying 200 yards, perfect,
     whacking a fridge with "200 YARDS" painted on it. CLANG!

     Stan looks at the club, then tosses it to the ground,
     climbing back down an aluminum extension ladder that
     leads up through a makeshift hatch on the roof.

                  Yeah.

                                 STANLEY
                  A lot.

     She pulls out a large manila envelope. Opens it and
     dumps the rubber-banded stacks of hundreds onto the
     ground.

                                GINGER
                  This should get you started.

     Stanley just stares at the money.     He looks up at Ginger.

                                GINGER
                  Whattaya have to lose? Just meet
                  him. One time. That's it. You
                  don't like the setup, walk away.

                                 STANLEY
                  That's it?

                                 GINGER
                  That's it.   And you keep the
                  money.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                               22.

     She smokes, letting it all sink in. She puts out her
     cigarette. They just stare at each other. She smiles.

                                                       FADE TO BLACK.

     FADE IN:

34   INT. FBI INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT                             34

     Torvalds sits at a table in a room with a two-way mirror.
     To his left, a three-piece suited Euroweasel (obviously
     his LAWYER) nurses a steaming cup of coffee while
     providing air cover from the two interrogating FBI
     Agents.

     The table is covered with empty coffee cups and cigarette
     carcasses. Roberts eases quietly into the room in mid-
     interrogation.

     Torvalds says something in Finnish to his Lawyer.

                                AGENT #1
                  What did he say?

     Torvalds again speaks to his Lawyer in Finnish.

                                AGENT #2
                  Your client is wanted on 24 counts
                  of electronic crimes in seven
                  different countries --

                                LAWYER
                  Finland does not recognize these
                  allegations as crimes. Your
                  laws --

                                AGENT #1
                  Do you see a Finnish flag hanging
                  on the wall, Ikea boy?

     Torvalds speaks to his Lawyer.

                                AGENT #1
                  What did he say?

                                LAWYER
                  He said Ikea is Swedish.

                                AGENT #1
                  He understands English?

     The FBI Agent's head is now close to imploding.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                               23.

34   CONTINUED:                                                      34

                                ROBERTS
                  Okay... Guys, why don't you give
                  me a few minutes here?

     They turn to see Roberts smiling.

                                 AGENT #2
                  Uh, sir...

                                 ROBERTS
                  It's okay.   Just a couple of
                  minutes.

                                 AGENT #1
                  Yessir.

                                AGENT #2
                  You've fucked up now, Hamlet.

                                ROBERTS
                         (never taking his
                          eyes off Torvalds)
                  And Michaels.

                                 AGENT #2
                  Yessir.

                                ROBERTS
                  Hamlet was a Dane.

                                 AGENT #2
                  Adane?

                                 ROBERTS
                  Forget it.

     Roberts sits down in a chair facing Torvalds.     He stares
     at him a moment, just smiling, then...

                                ROBERTS
                  Why would the number one cracker
                  in the world risk life
                  imprisonment to enter the
                  continental U.S.?

                                LAWYER
                  My client has repeatedly reserved
                  his right not answer any questions
                  at this time.

     Torvalds looks at Roberts' badge and says something in
     Finnish, the only recognizable word being "Roberts." The
     attorney and Torvalds both laugh. Roberts looks at the
     attorney.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                           24.

34   CONTINUED:    (2)                                           34

                                LAWYER
                  He told me to tell Mister Roberts
                  that he is quite fond of 'The
                  X-Files.'

     Again they smile. Roberts looks at the lawyer's cup of
     steaming coffee and with one finger pushes it over into
     the lawyer's lap.

                                ROBERTS
                  You need another cup of coffee --

                                LAWYER
                         (jumping up in
                          great pain)
                  Goddammit!

     Roberts grabs him by the collar and slams him into the
     wall, then pushes him out the door with a kick in the
     ass. He grabs the briefcase and tosses it out after him
     and locks the door.

     He turns on Torvalds, smacking him across the face. He
     pushes him into the wall and holds his badge in front of
     him.

                                ROBERTS
                  Until a year ago I was head of the
                  largest task force on cyber-
                  criminals in the entire world.
                  But, I burned out. It happens. I
                  snapped. I shot a suspect in the
                  fucking hand. Accident. Do you
                  know how hard it is to work a
                  keyboard with one hand?

                                 TORVALDS
                  Whatever you can do to me, he can
                  do worse. I'm already dead. The
                  only place I stand a chance is
                  back in my country. I have
                  friends there.

                                ROBERTS
                  I tell you what, you tell me what
                  I want to know and I guarantee
                  you'll be on the next flight to
                  Finland. First class. Courtesy
                  of the U.S. Government.

     Torvalds thinks quietly.

                                                                25.

35   INT. VIEWING ROOM - NIGHT                                        35

     Two FBI agents (BAD AGENTS #1 & 2) watch the
     interrogation through a two-way mirror. One of the
     agents looks surprisingly like Gabriel's merc that
     carried the young blonde girl killed outside the bank
     earlier.

                             TORVALDS (V.O.)
                      (over speaker)
               I'll tell you what I know.

     The Agents look at each other.    Bad Agent #1 dials his
     cell phone.

                             BAD AGENT #1
                      (into his cell)
               Yes, this is Assistant Director
               Joy, would you find Agent Roberts.
               It's important that I speak with
               him as soon as possible. Thank
               you.


     INT. FBI INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

                             ROBERTS
               Who is he?


36   EXT. PRAGUE NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT                                    36

     A yellow Lamborghini Diablo drives up. In SLOW MOTION
     Gabriel steps out of the car, wind whipping his full-
     length, black Gucci overcoat.

                             TORVALDS (V.O.)
               He exists in a world beyond your
               world. What we only fantasize, he
               does. He lives a life where
               nothing is beyond him.


37   INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT                                  37

                             TORVALDS
               But it is all an act.


38   EXT. PRAGUE NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT                                    38

     Gabriel walks through the crowd as if a celebrity --

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                                 26.

38   CONTINUED:                                                        38

                                TORVALDS (V.O.)
                  For all his charisma and charm.
                  For all his wealth and expensive
                  toys.

     -- exchanging kisses and the lingering of hands, as he
     slides through parting seas of beautiful people.

                                TORVALDS (V.O.)
                  Beneath it all he is a driven,
                  unflinching, calculating machine,
                  who takes what he wants, when he
                  wants, then disappears --

                                                       CUT TO:


39   INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - ANGLE ON TORVALDS - NIGHT               39

                                TORVALDS
                  -- It works like this.


40   EXT. EMPTY SKY - NIGHT                                            40

                                TORVALDS (V.O.)
                  I fly to where I am to meet him.
                  He sends one of his people to meet
                  me.

     A BOEING 777 SCREAMS overhead. We TILT DOWN. Stanley
     and Ginger walk out of LAX. A white LIMO IDLES directly
     in front of them.

     Stanley is wearing a black T-shirt which proclaims in
     large white letters across his chest, in true Scarlet
     Letter fashion, "LOSER!"

                                TORVALDS (V.O.)
                  He tells me what he needs. I do
                  my job, I'm paid.


41   INT. PRAGUE - NIGHT                                               41

     Upstairs on a lavish balcony Gabriel looks at the crowd.
     PUSH INTO --


     CLOSEUP - GABRIEL

     smiling.

                                 TORVALDS (V.O.)
                  And I leave.

                                                               27.

42   INT. FBI INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT                             42

                             ROBERTS
               That's a real nice story.    But you
               haven't given me shit.

     Torvalds knows this and smiles at Roberts arrogantly.

     The door opens, an FBI AGENT sticks his head in.

                             AGENT #1
               Excuse me, sir... you have a call.

                             ROBERTS
               So, take a message.

                             AGENT #1
               It's Assistant Director Joy, he
               said it's important.

                             ROBERTS
               At least it's not my wife.
                      (to Torvalds)
               You need to think about what else
               you know.
                      (then, to Agent #1)
               Watch him.

     Roberts walks out of the room.    The FBI Agent positions
     himself outside the door.


43   INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT                                            43

     Roberts walks out of the room.    Torvalds' attorney is
     there.

                             LAWYER
               You will be hearing from my
               gover --

                             ROBERTS
               Shut up.

     Roberts walks down the hall. The attorney, pissed, walks
     back into the interrogation room.


44   INT. VIEWING ROOM - NIGHT                                       44

     One of the two Agents watches the door, the other, Bad
     Agent #2 steps over to the two-way mirror.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                             28.

44   CONTINUED:                                                    44

     Torvalds talks to his attorney in Finnish. Apparently
     his attorney is trying to convince him of something.
     Torvalds, unfazed, walks over to the one-way mirror.

     PULL BACK FROM Torvalds to reveal Bad Agent #2 calmly
     screwing a silencer on to his .45. Torvalds leans closer
     to the glass.

     Bad Agent #2 sticks the silenced barrel of the gun up
     against the glass -- right between the eyes of Torvalds.
     Bad Agent #2 moves the barrel up and down between
     Torvalds face and neck.


45   INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - SAME TIME                           45

     Torvalds looks smugly into the glass.    He lifts his hand,
     holding up his middle finger.


46   INT. VIEWING ROOM - NIGHT                                     46

     Bad Agent #2 moves his aim to Torvalds' tonsils.   He
     depresses the trigger slightly.


47   INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - SAME TIME                           47

     Torvalds, middle finger in the air, smiles. Unbeknownst
     to him however, a tiny red aiming laser has zipped
     through the glass and is now positioned as a dot on
     Torvalds' throat.


48   INT. VIEWING ROOM - NIGHT                                     48

     Satisfied with the placement he PULLS the TRIGGER...
     THUMP! THUMP! THUMP! THUMP!


49   INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT                                          49

     Roberts walks down the hall and turns right into --


50   INT. COFFEE ROOM - NIGHT                                      50

     Roberts picks up the phone.

                                 ROBERTS
                  This is Roberts, I have a call
                  from A.D. Joy.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                                 29.

                  Hold, sir.

     Finally --

                                 A.D. JOY (V.O.)
                  Joy.

                                 ROBERTS
                  Roberts.   You needed me.

                                A.D. JOY (V.O.)
                  What do you mean?

                                ROBERTS
                  You didn't call me?

                                A.D. JOY (V.O.)
                  You just called me...

     Realization slowly hits him, he drops the phone and runs
     from the room.


51   INT. HALLWAY - SAME TIME                                          51

     Roberts runs down the hall and into:


52   INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT                                   52

     Roberts finds Torvalds and his attorney dead.     Roberts
     looks into the mirror.

     Six clean bullet holes perforate his reflection.

                                 ROBERTS
                  Shit!


53   INT. PRAGUE NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT                                     53

     Angeles. A 21st Century version of 54 on equal overdoses
     of steroids and acid.


54   INT. VIP SECTION - NIGHT                                          54

     Stanley and Ginger walk into a large area with individual
     private booths in small rooms around the perimeter. The
     rooms have the ability to be closed off by drawing huge,
     thick velvet drapes.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                GINGER
                  I wish you'd let me buy you a
                  suit.

                                STANLEY
                  I'm happy with what I'm wearing.

                                GINGER
                  You have no self-esteem, Stanley.

                                      STANLEY
                            (dryly)
                  I know.

     They walk into one of the booths in the back. Sitting
     around a large, oval table is our antihero, Gabriel
     Shear, surrounded by a handful of his crew and a gaggle
     of beautiful model-types.

     Ginger kisses Gabriel and with a healthy exchange of
     fluids, then...

                                      GINGER
                  Miss me?

     Gabriel smiles, then looks back at Stanley.

                                GINGER
                  Gabriel, Stanley. Stanley,
                  Gabriel.

     Gabriel just stares.

                                GABRIEL
                         (very familiar)
                  Big Stan. Nice suit.

                                      STANLEY
                  Thanks.

                                GABRIEL
                  You know, they say it's the
                  clothes that make the man...

                                      STANLEY
                  You buy it?

                                GABRIEL
                  Hope not.
                         (then)
                  Buy you a drink?

                                STANLEY
                  I flew fifteen hundred miles for
                  this meeting, how 'bout we get to
                  the point.

                                GABRIEL
                  Actually you flew 1500 miles for
                  100 grand. But that's not the
                  point.

     Stanley sits down.    Gabriel pours Stan a glass of Crown.

                                GABRIEL
                  I heard this story about this
                  young hacker who made a virus that
                  broke the F.B.I.'s Carnivore
                  program that was actively reading
                  every subscriber's E-mail and
                  scrambled the systems. He did
                  what the federal judges wouldn't
                  do and kept the government out of
                  our Privacy.

                                STANLEY
                  I think I heard that. Story is he
                  went to jail and the federal
                  Carnivore program is back in full
                  swing. It was a real tragedy.
                  What can I do for you?

     Changing the subject.

                                GABRIEL
                  Stanley, meet Helga.

     Gabriel smiles.

     The beautiful WOMAN to Stanley's right slides closer.

                                HELGA (WOMAN)
                         (heavily accented)
                  Hi, Stanley.

     Stanley looks at her, she's a knockout; artificially
     perfect. He looks back at Gabriel.

                                STANLEY
                  Look, I don't have a lot of
                  patience for this --

                                GABRIEL
                  Stanley, we have a problem, maybe
                  you can help us out.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                                 32.

     Stan looks around; everyone is smiling.       Helga moves
     closer to him.

                                GABRIEL
                  Take a look at this.

     He is handed an open laptop, it glows. He sets it on the
     table and spins it around in front of Stanley.

                                STANLEY
                         (like an alcoholic
                          faced with a fifth
                          of tequila)
                  You know I can't touch that.

     Helga pours a shot of tequila.

                                HELGA
                  You like tequila, Stanley?

     Helga shoots the tequila, then turns to Stanley, places
     her lips against his. The gold liquid drips from their
     lips as she spits it into Stanley's mouth.

     He pushes her away, breaking the liplock, and swallowing
     the tequila. She licks it from his face.

                                GABRIEL
                  No need for modesty, we're all
                  friends here, Stanley.

                                STANLEY
                  This is bullshit. I came --

                                GABRIEL
                  You want something from me, amigo,
                  I want something from you. D.O.D.
                  dBase, 128 bit R.S.A. encryption.
                  Whattaya think? Impossible?

     Stanley's having a little trouble concentrating on
     Gabriel.

                                STANLEY
                  Nothing's impossible.

     Helga begins sucking on Stanley's fingers.      He pulls them
     away.

                                GABRIEL
                  So it can be done? Maybe slide in
                  a Trojan horse hiding a worm?

                                STANLEY
                  Something like that. Is this an
                  interview?

                                GABRIEL
                  Sort of. Marco, let's give him
                  some incentive.

     The drapes close. Two of Gabriel's crew step out. Marco
     yanks out a .40 caliber Glock and quickly screws a well-
     used silencer onto the end. Marco walks around behind
     Stanley.

                                STANLEY
                         (now totally confused)
                  What are you doing?

     Helga smiles, then drops her head into Stanley's lap.    We
     hear his PANTS UNZIP.

                                GABRIEL
                  Relax, Stanley.

     He has to go with it.

                                 GABRIEL
                  I've been told the best crackers
                  in the world could do this in
                  sixty minutes. Unfortunately,
                  I need someone who can do it in
                  sixty seconds.

                                STANLEY
                  You're kidding...

                                GABRIEL
                  'Fraid not.

     Stan realizes now no one is smiling.    He grabs the blonde
     by the hair but can't pull her up.

                                GABRIEL
                  Forty-five seconds. Time is a
                  wasting, big guy.

     The silencer is pressed into the back of his head.
     Stanley tries to focus on the screen. Stanley sucks air
     through his teeth, trying to focus.

                                GABRIEL
                  You have thirty seconds, Stanley.

     Stanley gives up on trying to get her up and his hands
     start flying over the keyboard. We INTERCUT the ACTION
     WITH a CLOSEUP of Stanley's hands working the keyboard,
     and a CLOSEUP of Gabriel, and a CLOSEUP of the LCD screen
     which reads in flashing red letters --

     Tension builds as Stanley continues to work the keyboard.

     "ACCESS DENIED."

     Stanley is pissed. Helga, smiling, kisses him on the
     cheek. Stanley tries to calm down. He gets up, shoots
     someone's half-drank drink, zips his pants, then --

                                STANLEY
                  So was I.

     Stanley hits the enter key and spins the computer around.

     Stanley pushes into the bathroom.       He kicks the
     wastebasket across the room.

                  Shit!

     He pushes a club kid out of the way of the sink. He
     turns on the water and washes his face. Slowly he leans
     his forehead against the mirror. Ginger appears behind

                  believe how desperate I am.

     She exhales toward Stanley.

                                GINGER
                  I thought you were here saving
                  your daughter, Stanley.

     He turns around.

                                 STANLEY
                         (pissed)
                  Look... I'd do anything to get
                  Holly back. But, if I end up in a
                  box or back in jail, then I really
                  can't help her, can I? What I
                  should do, is take my money and go
                  back to court.

                                GINGER
                  Back to court? Back to Melissa's
                  gladiators? You throw a hundred
                  grand at her, she'll throw five
                  back at you. It's not about
                  Holly, it's about beating you.
                  You know that. Think, Stanley.

                                STANLEY
                  What I'm thinking about is that
                  you're willing to put a gun to my
                  head to see if I can hack --

     Suddenly three club kids come busting into the bathroom.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

     Ginger interrupts him by slamming Stan between the
     urinals and ramming her tongue into his mouth with the
     kind of wet, aggressive action that takes a movie from
     PG-13 to an R.

     When the kids realize that the urinals are occupied, they
     leave. Slowly Ginger takes her tongue out of Stan's
     mouth. They look at each other. She smiles at him.

                                   GINGER
                         (coyly)
                  Sorry...

     A beat, for a moment there exists something between them,
     then bam, she's all business again.

                                GINGER
                  So, let me sum it up for you,
                  Stanley. You live in a trailer.
                         (beat)
                  You're a felon, working a dead-
                  end job. You want to get Holly
                  back, Gabriel's your only shot.


     ANGLE ON STANLEY

     As he realizes she's right, he's got nothing to lose.
     Slam! He smacks the mirror with his fist, then walks out
     of the rest room. Ginger slowly lifts the cigarette.
     She exhales, then slowly smiles. She's got him.


56   EXT. PRAGUE VALET - NIGHT                                              56

     Next to the valet stand, Gabriel leans over the hood of
     an evil-looking, bright-yellow Lamborghini Diablo
     Roadster, a GAMEBOY CHIRPING in his hands.

     Stanley walks INTO the FRAME.          Without missing a beat,
     Gabriel looks up --

                                 GABRIEL
                  Big Stan.   I was afraid we lost
                  you.

     Gabriel stands up and walks toward Stan.

                                STANLEY
                  Tell me what the deal is.

                                GABRIEL
                  Let's go up to the house. I'm
                  having a little get-together. I'll
                  explain it to you there.

     Gabriel smiles.

57   INT. FBI LAB - NIGHT                                                  57

     Three GEEKY COMPUTER-TYPES sit in front of a huge array
     of CRTs. They look up when Roberts stalks into the room.
     He yanks off his jacket, crumbles it and throws it across
     the room. They just look at each other.

                                ROBERTS
                  Tell me you have some good news
                  for me.

                                FBI COMPUTER GEEK #1
                  Actually we have a small ray of
                  hope in the vast darkness that is
                  your life, sir. Check this out.

     On one of the 25-inch screens we see a terminal at LAX
     with hundreds of people streaming by at 20x speed.
     Torvalds is being apprehended. He freezes it.

                                FBI COMPUTER GEEK #1
                  See these two guys?

     He points at two men watching this action from the
     sideline. He pulls another monitor forward.

                                FBI COMPUTER GEEK #1
                  Now watch this...

     He fast-forwards through the crowd until the two guys
     show up again. He freezes it.

                                FBI COMPUTER GEEK #1
                  Recognize those two, same guys,
                  next day. Question is --

     He slowly moves the action forward --

                                   FBI COMPUTER GEEK #1
                  -- who's that?

     The footage stops and zooms in on one of two travelers
     who the two men are meeting.

     It is Stanley.

                                ROBERTS
                  Stanley Jobson...

     The computer guys look at each other.    One hands Roberts
     an open copy of Wired magazine.

                                FBI COMPUTER GEEK #1
                  Wired's man of the year, 1996.
                  Pretty much a burnout but he was
                  the hacker zeitgeist of his day --

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                                39.

57   CONTINUED:                                                       57

                                ROBERTS
                  I know who Jobson is. I busted
                  him.
                         (to Stan's image)
                  Why are you in L.A.?

     Roberts looks at it. Then at the screen.        A pop-up
     screen shows Stanley's history.

                                FBI COMPUTER GEEK #1
                  His ex-wife lives in Malibu.

                                FBI COMPUTER GEEK #2
                  The new husband owns Backdoor
                  Films, a shady porn production
                  house in Chatsworth. Decent
                  production value but they only
                  shoot on video. His wife actually
                  starred in a couple of his videos.
                  Apparently she's an 'actress.'

     Roberts moves the mouse to see Ginger.

                                ROBERTS
                  Who's the chick?

                                FBI COMPUTER GEEK #1
                  We don't know yet, sir.

                                FBI COMPUTER GEEK #2
                  Serious piece of talent.

                                FBI COMPUTER GEEK #3
                  Way outta his league. Something's
                  up.

                                FBI COMPUTER GEEK #2
                  You know he also has a ten-year-
                  old daughter, who he's not
                  supposed to see. Maybe that's why
                  he's here.

     Roberts looks at him like he's an idiot.

                                  FBI COMPUTER GEEK #2
                  Or maybe not.

                                ROBERTS
                  I want to know who that girl is.
                  Pronto.

     Roberts stands.

                                ROBERTS
                  And stake out his daughter.

                                                                40.

58   EXT. GABRIEL'S HOUSE - POOL - NIGHT                              58

     The house is at the very top of the hills and the pool
     hangs off the side of the cliff, way below the house.

     The outer edge appears nonexistent, like the water hangs
     frozen in air.

     A very hip but very nasty soiree is in progress.    More
     Ibiza than Hollywood Hills.

     Stanley sits in a chair beside a pool containing a half-
     dozen beautiful un-clad model-types.

     Gabriel is mingling through the crowd.


     CLOSEUP - STANLEY

     Stanley stares off into the glittering lights of L.A.
     WIDEN.

                             GABRIEL
                      (smiles)
               So Stan, tell me. How'd you do
               it?

                             STANLEY
               Do what?

                             GABRIEL
               Break the code. At the club.
               You broke the entire encryption, a
               silencer against your eye and your
               cock in someone's mouth, all in
               less than sixty seconds. How?

                             STANLEY
               I used a logic bomb, dropped it
               through the trap door --

                             GINGER
               No, you didn't. You didn't have
               time.

                             GABRIEL
               C'mon, you can do better than
               that. How'd you do it?

                             STANLEY
               I used a password sniffer.

     Gabriel glances at Ginger who shakes her head.

                             GINGER
               Uh uh.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

58   CONTINUED:                                                      58

                                  STANLEY
                  Yes, I did --

                                GABRIEL
                  C'mon, Stanley. How'd-you-do-it?

                                STANLEY
                  I don't know exactly. I see the
                  numbers. In my head. All my
                  life. I don't answer equations, I
                  just see the answers. Same with
                  code. I can't explain ---

     Ginger eases over to where Stan is sitting. She runs her
     hands across his shoulders as she moves around him,
     dancing to the MUSIC.

                                GINGER
                  Mozart always said he didn't write
                  music; he just wrote down what he
                  heard in his head. So did
                  Faulkner, just with words.

                                GABRIEL
                         (drinking wine)
                  You definitely have a gift, Stan.
                  The most powerful people on the
                  planet are like you. With a laptop
                  and a phone line you can make God
                  look like a thirteen-year-old
                  with a stack of Playboys and a
                  lack of imagination.
                         (beat)
                  C'mere, Stan, let me show you
                  something.


59   INT. GABRIEL'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                              59

     Stanley and Gabriel stand in Gabriel's primo designed
     pad, staring at an array of supercomputers.

     Stanley stands in front of the six huge flat panels,
     linked together, in complete awe.

                                GABRIEL
                  Pretty impressive, huh.
                         (beat)
                  So...

                                  STANLEY
                  So?

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                             42.

59   CONTINUED:                                                    59

                                GABRIEL
                  Here's the deal. I need a worm,
                  Stanley. A hydra, actually. A
                  multi-headed worm to break an
                  encryption and then sniff out
                  latent digital footprints
                  throughout an encrypted network.

                                STANLEY
                  What kind of cypher?

                                GABRIEL
                  Vernam encryption.

                                STANLEY
                  A Vernam's impossible. Its key
                  code is destroyed upon
                  implementation. Not to mention
                  being a true 128 bit encryption.

                                GABRIEL
                  Actually, we're talking 512 bit.

                                STANLEY
                  It's impossible.

                                GABRIEL
                  Tell ya what, I'll pay you ten
                  million dollars. That should be
                  enough to get your daughter back...
                         (beat)
                  ... unless of course it's impossible.

     Stan thinks about it.

                                STANLEY
                  Nothing's impossible.

     They shake hands and Gabriel heads toward the back of the
     house.


     LONG SHOT - GABRIEL

     walking up the stairs toward his room.

     Stan looks over to see Ginger staring at him.

                                STANLEY
                  What?

     Ginger pulls herself up on the desk, spreading her legs

                                 GINGER
                  C'mon, Stan.   Let's get to work.

     She turns on the computers.     He backs away.

                                GINGER
                  It won't bite you, I promise.

                                STANLEY
                  I don't know. It's gonna be
                  pretty hard without a gun to my
                  head.

     She reaches out and pulls him to her.

                                GINGER
                  Well, let's put a gun to your
                  head.

     She kisses him and slowly he responds.       She smiles.

                                GINGER
                  Tell me about your worm, Stanley.

     They kiss.

                                GINGER
                  You surprised that a girl with
                  real breasts and an I.Q. over 70
                  can give you a hard-on?

     Stan shakes his head.

                                STANLEY
                  I thought you were Gabriel's.

     She looks at him a moment. She smiles at him and slowly
     bends forward to whisper in his ear.


     CLOSEUP - GINGER'S MOUTH

     at Stanley's ear.

                                GINGER
                         (very slowly)
                  I am not what you think I am.


     ANGLE ON GINGER AND STANLEY

     As she leans back. She stares at him a moment then
     slides off the desk.

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                 GINGER
                  You're a smart guy, Stanley.    You
                  figure me out.

     She hands him the bottle of expensive wine she's been
     drinking, and then grabbing Stan by the belt-buckle,
     pulls him casually behind her toward the pool house.

                                                        FADE TO BLACK.


     FADE IN:

60   EXT. POOL - DAY                                                  60

     Lounging by the pool is none other than our heroine,
     Ginger, topless, wearing nothing more than tiny, oblong,
     green-tinted shades, a skimpy T-back, and a little silver
     ring through her left nipple. She's reading Steven
     Hawkings' A Brief History of Time. A shadow falls over
     her.

     The shadow moves.       Ginger glances nonchalantly up, then:

                                 GINGER
                         (sitting up,
                           grinning)
                  Don't you have that just-fucked-
                  the-neighbor's-cat look this
                  morning.

     She reaches over, lights a cigarette, and inhales deeply.
     He smiles, looking her up and down.

                                  GINGER
                  Problem?

                                STANLEY
                  Pretty impressive.

                                GINGER
                  I thought we went over all that
                  last night.

                                STANLEY
                         (beat, then like
                          "stupid")
                  The book, Ginger.

                                  GINGER
                  Ohhh.
                         (holding it out)
                  Look, no pictures. Get out of my
                  light.

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                              45.

60   CONTINUED:                                                     60

     They stare at each sharing a moment of God-only-knows-
     what, then both break into smiles like two giddy seventh-
     graders at the local skating rink.

     Stanley nervously clears his throat.    She's got him.

                                STANLEY
                  Can I borrow your car? There's
                  something I need to do.

     She reaches down beside the chair, grabs her keys and
     tosses them to him. Then:

                                GINGER
                  If you're going to see your
                  daughter, you might want to
                  reevaluate the way you look.
                         (goes back to
                          her book)
                  Just a thought.

     He looks at her with open mouth amazement. In just 24
     hours, she already knows what makes him tick.

     She looks up from her book and winks at him, then returns
     to her reading.


61   EXT. NEWTON MONTESSORI SCHOOL - DAY                            61

     A SCHOOL BELL RINGS and three hundred screaming kids of
     all ages come running from the doors.


     ANGLE ON HOLLY

     Not your average ten-year-old. Even decked out in bell-
     bottoms and sandals there is something about the way she
     carries herself that is older; wiser; sadder.

     She walks into a CLOSEUP and scans the driveway.
     Reflected in her tiny, round lavender shades we see the
     circular driveway of the school jam-packed with buses and
     parental types in their M-series Mercedes and their Lexus
     SUVs. She sighs. We CRANE UP, PANNING LEFT.

     Holly walks to the edge of the street oblivious to the
     mayhem. She looks up and down the street then slowly
     drops her backpack and sits down on the curb. She pulls
     a well-worn copy of William Gibson's Neuromancer from her
     backpack, and turns up the raging ELECTRONICA from her
     WALKMAN.

                                                     DISSOLVE TO:

                                                           46.

62   SAME SCENE - LATER                                          62

     Now there is much less pandemonium. No more buses. We
     CRANE DOWN TO a MEDIUM of Holly still in the exact same
     spot. Holly sighs, pulls back her headphones and grabs
     her StarTac from her backpack. She opens the phone and
     dials.


63   INT. MALIBU HOUSE - DAY                                     63

     The PHONE RINGS and we PAN AROUND the seemingly empty
     house, finally COMING TO REST ON the back of the couch.
     We JIB UP and TILT DOWN. Melissa is passed out in a pool
     of her own drool. The PHONE continues to RING.

                                                          47.

64   EXT. NEWTON MONTESSORI SCHOOL - DAY                        64

     Holly hits the phone and then presses speed dial. We see
     "Yellow Cab" scroll across the phone. She hits "SEND."

                             MAN (O.S.)
               Can I give you a lift?

                             HOLLY
               Look, creep, I don't think so --

     She stands up, ready for a fight. And there, next to her
     is her father; transformed. Under his arm is a three-
     foot-tall stuffed giraffe wrapped with a big red bow.

                               HOLLY
               Daddy?
                        (recognition)
               Daddy!

     She runs to him and wraps her arms around him.

                             STANLEY
               Hey, sweetheart.

                             HOLLY
               Daddy... What are you doing here?
               I missed you so much.

                               STANLEY
               Me too, baby.    I brought you
               something.

     He holds the stuffed giraffe to her.

                             HOLLY
               Oh, Daddy. If Mom finds out
               you're here she's gonna have you
               thrown back in jail.

                             STANLEY
               It's okay, baby. Let me give you
               a ride home.

     He grabs her stuff.

                               STANLEY
               C'mon.

     He walks toward Ginger's silver Mercedes CLK which he's
     borrowing. Holly runs and jumps on his back. They laugh
     as he carries her to the car.

                                                              48.

65   EXT. MALIBU HOUSE - DAY                                        65

     They sit in the CLK, parked down the street from Holly's
     house.

                             STANLEY
               You believe in me, right?

                             HOLLY
               Of course, but --

                             STANLEY
               I've found a way to get you back,
               sweetheart. It's my one shot and
               I'm taking it. Just give me a
               couple of days.

                             HOLLY
                      (crying)
               I don't want anything else to
               happen to you, Dad.

                             STANLEY
               Holly, everything's going to be
               okay. You just have to trust me.

                             HOLLY
                      (crying)
               I love you, Daddy.

     Holly quickly kisses him, jumps out and runs, crying,
     from the car at full speed, with the giraffe.

     Stanley, tears rolling down his face, slaps the steering
     wheel, trying to figure out how he screwed up his life so
     badly.

     Suddenly, the passenger door opens and a man in a DARK
     BLUE SUIT and fed-issued shades gets in.

                             STANLEY
               Who the fuck are you?

                             DARK SUIT #1
                      (flipping out
                       his badge)
               Friend of a friend. Let's take a
               ride.

     He motions toward a black Taurus, now parked across the
     street. In the back, he sees a face he recognizes.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                              49.

     CLOSEUP ON ROBERTS


     BACK TO STAN

                                STANLEY
                  Shit...

     The man kinda smiles at Stan.

                                DARK SUIT #1
                         (being a dick)
                  Gotta suck to be you.

                                STANLEY
                  Yep.

     Stanley whacks the fed with his elbow across the bridge
     of his nose and jumps out of the car.


     INT. TAURUS

     Stan runs across the hood of the Taurus and just jumps
     over the railing.


66   EXT. SHEER CLIFF - DAY                                         66

     We realize what Stan did probably wasn't the smartest
     move in the world. The cliff is just barely on this side
     of 90 degrees and drops off about five hundred yards
     straight down to the PCH.

     Stan falls in SLOW MOTION about thirty feet before the
     cliff face angles out enough to break his fall. He begins
     a combination of sliding and tumbling down the bluff.


67   EXT. MALIBU HOUSE (STREET) - DAY                               67

     Roberts runs to the railing and sees Stanley sliding/
     falling down the hill.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                              50.

67   CONTINUED:                                                     67

                                ROBERTS
                         (to his men)
                  Cut him off at the bottom.

     Roberts then hops the railing, as his men scramble for
     the car.


68   EXT. SHEER CLIFF - DAY                                         68

     Roberts hangs in mid-air a moment, then he too begins the
     rolling fall down the hill.


     ANGLE ON STANLEY

     as he tries to keep his balance, is being beaten and
     battered by the sharp, rocky ground.

     Finally, he shoots off an outcropping and free-falls for
     fifteen feet. Then it really gets bad.

     Clear plastic sheeting has been stretched across the hill
     to help control the erosion. To Stanley however, it is
     the world's largest Slip and Slide.

     He is no longer able to control, even badly, his descent.
     Now, he is flying down the cliff face, only the rocks and
     bushes that slam into his body, slows the descent.

     Roberts, above him, is doing little better.


     LONG SHOT ON CLIFF FACE

     As Stan and Roberts slide toward the eight lanes of
     blazing afternoon traffic on the PCH.

     Finally, Stan bounces onto the black-top road.   He runs
     headlong into the traffic.

     CARS SCREECH, HORNS BLARING, as they slide into each
     other. Stanley does not lose the single-minded focus of
     escaping.

     Roberts, now at   the bottom himself, watches as a CAR
     SLIDES sideways   into Stan, flipping him over it. Stan,
     not stopping to   feel the pain, runs across the hood of a
     freshly-stopped   car.

                                                           51.

69   EXT. BEACH - DAY                                            69

     On the other side, Stan runs down to the beach and runs
     down the sand at full-tilt, looking for any escape route.
     Roberts has made up some time due to the auto-pedestrian
     accident which slowed him down a little. Stan however is
     faster.

     Stan does his best Jerry Rice, as he runs down the beach
     at full speed.

     Suddenly, the Taurus comes tearing-ass across the beach
     at Stanley. Stan veers, now running through the surf.
     The Taurus veers as well, and Stan is forced to slide
     across the hood to keep from getting whacked. The Taurus
     breaks left, and slides further into the surf.

     The FBI driver hits the accelerator and bogs the Taurus
     down, tires spinning, throwing sand. Stan continues to
     run as Roberts makes it to the Taurus.

                             ROBERTS
               Fuck this.

     He pulls his .40 CAL. from his shoulder holster and FIRES
     it into the air. Roberts bends over trying to catch his
     breath.

     Stanley stops, putting his hands up.

                             DARK SUIT #2
               Why didn't you do that earlier,
               sir?

     Roberts looks at the agent.

                             DARK SUIT #2
               Sorry, sir.

                             ROBERTS
               Go get him.

     Three of the agents bring Stanley over.

     Stan slides down by the back wheel.

                             ROBERTS
               What are you doing in L.A., Stan?

                              STANLEY
                      (catching his
                       breath)
               Vacationing...

                  Why were you running? We just
                  wanted to talk.

                                STANLEY
                  Are you arresting me?

                                ROBERTS
                  For violating your parole by
                  leaving Texas without permission
                  or for evading a federal agent and
                  almost getting me killed in the
                  process?

     Stan just looks at him.

                                 ROBERTS
                  No, I'm not.

                                STANLEY
                  Then why are we talking?

                                ROBERTS
                  Didn't know the court lifted the
                  sanction preventing you from
                  seeing your daughter.

                                 STANLEY
                  Fuck you.

                  You just want to cut through the
                  pleasantries and get down to
                  business? Fine. I can help you
                  with your daughter, Stan. Help
                  me, I'll help you.

                                STANLEY
                  You'll have to forgive me, the
                  fact that you put me in jail for
                  18 months doesn't inspire a lot of
                  trust.

                                ROBERTS
                  Whether I agreed with what you did
                  or not, you broke the law,

                  I guess we were both doing what we
                  had to. This was a nice trip down
                  memory lane, but if you're not

                  So, why was it you are in L.A.
                  again?

                                  STANLEY
                  I told you --

                                 ROBERTS
                  -- vacationing. That's right. Ya
                  know it's funny. Axl Torvalds was
                  just here for a vacation, too.
                  Isn't it odd that the two best
                  hackers in the world are here at
                  the same time.

                                STANLEY
                  I'm a sucker for Disneyland.
                         (getting up)
                  Tell Torvalds I said hello.

                                ROBERTS
                  If you're not careful you can tell
                  him yourself. He's dead.

     Stanley looks at Roberts.

                         (to his men)

     They do.   Stan looks at it.

                  In case you think of anything else
                  you want to tell me.

     Stan turns to walk off.

     Stan turns.

     Stan lifts his middle finger behind him and begins the
     long journey back up the hill. Roberts collapses into
     the passenger seat.

     Ginger walks in and closes the door. She walks over to
     the dresser and takes off her earrings. Then she reaches
     under her dress and unVelcros the modified 10mm. Glock
     and its thigh holster, dropping it on the dresser. She
     then pulls off the hip, little designer dress she is
     wearing, revealing the fact that she is wearing a tiny
     transmitting receiver taped between her breasts.

     She stares at herself in the mirror for a moment, then
     slowly starts to untape the bug.

                                STANLEY (O.S.)
                  I have to hand it to you, Ginger.
                  You look good wearing anything.
                  Even a wire.

     Ginger grabs her Glock and spins around, the holster
     dropping away with the touch of a button.

     She levels it on the dark corner of the room where
     Stanley sits waiting, drinking a bottle of Gabriel's
     expensive wine.

                                STANLEY

                  I should probably ask you the same
                  question.

     ANGLE ON STAN

     who turns around, a cocky grin on his face, like a proud
     parent, she smiles at him.

     Gabriel walks in.

                                STANLEY
                  Now I just have to modify the
                  code.

                  He's fucking amazing.

     head and walks out.

                  I see you have a groupie.

                  You know, it'd be a lot simpler if
                  you would tell me exactly what the
                  hydra is going to be used for?

     PUSH IN ON Gabriel as he thinks about it.

                  Nope.

     The Lamborghini pulls up in front of a Starbucks.

                                GABRIEL
                  You'll appreciate the irony
                  here --

     Gabriel gets out of the car, still talking.       Stanley
     follows.

                                GABRIEL
                  -- In the early Eighties the
                  D.E.A. set up a network of dummy
                  corporations as a government front
                  to launder drug money and gather
                  evidence. Problem is, the front
                  companies started making money.
                  Lots of money. By 1986, when
                  Operation Swordfish was
                  terminated, there was close to 400
                  million dollars in the D.E.A.'s
                  accounts.

                  Money that just sorta disappeared.

                                GABRIEL
                  It didn't disappear. It just sat
                  in those accounts earning interest,
                  it's been 15 years. You have any
                  concept how much money we'd be
                  actually talking about today?
                  Billions, brother. That's nine
                  zeros.
                         (beat)
                  Look, this is a sweet deal. We
                  go in over phone lines. Pop the
                  firewall, drop in the hydra, and
                  just sit back and wait for the
                  money.

                                STANLEY
                  Before we can tap into the secure
                  cluster, you have to find one of
                  the banks on the backbone of this
                  network. Do you know how many
                  banks there are in the U.S.? It
                  could take years.

                                GABRIEL
                  No problem.
                         (beat)
                  Look behind you, Stan.

     Stanley turns and looks out the window.    They are sitting
     directly across from the World Banc.

                   There's definitely something going
                   on. There are two T-5 trunks
                   going into the house. That's
                   serious bandwidth. Thermal scopes
                   indicate a huge heat-load in the
                   main living area. Could be from
                   mainframes, although they must
                   have a genny 'cause power
                   consumption is right on par.

                   Some of these fellows might be
                   dressed in Armani, but they
                   definitely have the swagger of ex-
                   military. Maybe bodyguards but
                   they seem more like mercs to me.

                   From here we're having trouble
                   pinning any of them down. Sure
                   would be nice to task a satellite,

                                 ROBERTS
                   I'm working on it. Send what you
                   have up-lines, maybe we'll have
                   one by the end of the week.

      Roberts walks out of the trailer.

                                REISMAN
                  Goddamn right I did. You know
                  where I got that? From the deputy
                  director of the F.B.I. He thought
                  I might be interested.

                  Son, let's say you have a 200-

                  and it's his job to protect you.
                  But if he ever bites you, even
                  once, you gotta put him down. You
                  can't have an uncontrollable
                  weapon running unchecked in your
                  back yard. He becomes a
                  liability. You never know who he
                  might bite next.

     sighs. He closes the door and walks off toward the wine
     cellar.


90   INT. GABRIEL'S HOUSE - WINE CELLAR - NIGHT                     90

     In the wine cellar, Stan looks around. He opens one
     door, closes it. He opens another, same thing. The
     third, he pulls out a bottle. Keeps it. He pulls on
     another door and it is locked. He pulls again. Nothing.
     The glass doors of the temperature-controlled reach-in
     wine cooler is opaque with condensation. He bends close.
     Stanley swipes off the condensation inches from his nose.


     EXTREME CLOSEUP - ON FACE

     leaning against the glass from the other side.    It's
     Gabriel's.


     ANGLE ON STANLEY

                               STANLEY
               Fuck!!

     He drops the BOTTLE of wine.   CRASH, it SHATTERS.


     REVERSE ANGLE

     Gabriel's body is wedged into the 32-degree white wine
     cooler.

                               STANLEY
               Jesus Christ!

     Stanley looks at the body for a moment, realizes
     something really bad is going on and hauls ass upstairs.


91   INT. GABRIEL'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                     91

     Stanley runs around the corner.

     Gabriel is standing in the doorway, directly in front of
     Stanley. Stan damn near falls down.

                               GABRIEL
               Stan?

     Stan can't say a word.

                                GABRIEL
                  What's wrong, Stanley, you look
                  like you've seen a ghost?

     Gabriel looks in and sees the empty wine bottle at the
     computer station.

                                GABRIEL
                  C'mon, Stanley. Let's talk.

                                   STANLEY
                            (uneasy)
                  Okay...

                                   GABRIEL
                  Let's go.

                                STANLEY
                  Why can't we talk here?

                                GABRIEL
                  'Cause I don't want to talk to you
                  in the house, Stanley.

     Gabriel walks out.       Stanley slowly follows.

                                   GABRIEL
                  Let's go.

     Stan slowly follows.


92   INT. LAMBORGHINI - MOVING - NIGHT                                92

                                GABRIEL
                  How you doing, Stanley?

                                   STANLEY
                            (obviously not fine)
                  Fine.

                                GABRIEL
                  Something you need to say to me?

                                STANLEY
                         (freaked)
                  What the hell is going on here?

                                GABRIEL
                         (totally cool)
                  You know anything about Harry
                  Houdini?

     Stan definitely doesn't get the point.

                                GABRIEL
                  He used to make an elephant
                  disappear in a theater full of
                  people. You know how he did it?

     Gabriel unwraps a piece of gum --

                                  STANLEY
                  How?

     -- and sticks the piece in his mouth.

                                  GABRIEL
                  Misdirection.

     Gabriel whips right down a side street and drops the
     hammer. He blows through a stop sign, then another.
     CARS CRASH. He is calm, cool, but continues to glance in
     his rearview mirror.

                                STANLEY
                  What are you doing?

                                GABRIEL
                  We have a tail.
                         (beat)
                  Hope you had a light lunch, Stan.

     Gabriel slides left into an alley, gets it under control
     and SCREAMS toward the other side. A black Suburban
     pulls up, closing off the alley. He slides to a stop and
     slams it into reverse. Backwards at 60-plus miles per
     hour.

                                GABRIEL
                  Hold the wheel.

     Gabriel reaches in the passenger floorboard and pulls up
     a duffel bag. He unzips it, and withdraws what the
     Marines call a SAW -- a Belgian-designed machine gun,
     compact but with 1500 rounds of Swiss cheese action per
     minute, powerful enough for the U.S. to replace the M-60.

                                STANLEY
                  Shit, it's blocked.

     Gabriel looks behind them, another black Suburban has
     blocked them in. The one from the other side and a third
     comes toward them down the alley.

                                GABRIEL
                  Keep it straight.

     The speedometer needle is pegged at 0 as they SCREAM
     backwards.

     Gabriel unfolds the stock and then withdraws a 100-round
     box wrapped in white tape and printed with AP. He clips
     it and pulls back the bolt. He grabs the wheel from
     Stan.

                                GABRIEL
                  It's just rough when you grow up
                  lovin' James Bond movies. Don't
                  worry, Stanley, it'll be over soon.


     ANGLE ON LAMBO

     As the Diablo slams backwards into the Suburban at sixty
     mph. Bam.

     Gabriel unbuckles himself and stands up through the open
     roof and UNLOADS FULL-AUTO into the Suburban. The armor-
     piercing SHELLS PENETRATE the Armalite GLASS, RIPPING the
     occupants to shreds.

     Gabriel turns, FIRING at the other Suburban.

                                  GABRIEL
                  Drive, drive!

     Stanley slides under Gabriel as Gabriel steps into the
     passenger side. The wheels spin, the Lambo is wedged
     under the Suburban.

                                  GABRIEL
                  Go, go!

     Gabriel continues to BLAST FULL-AUTO, tearing the
     Suburban to shrapnel.

                                  STANLEY
                  I am!

     Finally the mortally wounded but still kicking
     Lamborghini tears free of the Suburban and rockets head- on
     toward the other. Stanley drives like a maniac.

     Gabriel RIPS it on FULL-AUTO, meatloafing the driver.
     The Suburban veers into the wall. Smack.

     Stanley whips beside it and Gabriel STRAFES down the
     side, opening it up. Stan whips right onto a main
     street.

                                                        (CONTINUED)

92   CONTINUED:    (3)                                                92

     More Suburbans head at them. Stan SCREAMS left into
     another alley. Through the cross streets whipping by at
     100 mph, we see Suburbans parallel to them.

     Stan cranks his wheel right.

                                 STANLEY
                  Shit!

                                GABRIEL
                         (changing out a clip)
                  Keep your cool, Stanley.

     The Lambo rolls to a stop and Gabriel hops out, running
     at the Suburbans.

     After a moment of all-out GI Joe-style blitzkrieg, it's
     over.

     Gabriel walks to a body lying in the street.    He turns
     over the body and looks at the face.

                                 GABRIEL
                  Goddamit.   I knew it.

     Gabriel walks back to one of the burning Suburbans where
     Stanley stands.

                                GABRIEL
                  Get in the fucking car, Stanley.

                                STANLEY
                  I'm not going anywhere until you
                  tell me what's going on.

     Gabriel pulls out his H&K, points it at Stanley.

                                GABRIEL
                  You're on my good side and you
                  want to stay there. Stanley, I
                  like you, but don't confuse
                  kindness with weakness. So, get
                  in the fuckin' car. I need my
                  hydra.

     Stanley is working at his terminal.

               Stanley?   You alright?

                             STANLEY
               What do you think? I just watched
               that maniac murder ten men in the
               street. I'm just fucking great.
               It doesn't matter if I get my
               daughter back if I'm dead. Even
               if I do survive this, who's gonna
               keep me out of jail? You?

     She walks over to him and kneels down, places her hand on
     his leg, looks up at him.

                             GINGER
               I won't let anything happen to
               you, Stanley. You have to trust
               me.

                             STANLEY
               Trust you? Two hours ago I
               found out you're D.E.A. The
               feds are crawling up my ass and
               there's a dead body in the
               basement that looks just like
               Gabriel.

     She doesn't move.

                             GINGER
               Stanley, if we don't find out who
               he's working for then we're just
               going to have to do this all over
               again.

               Your little slush fund is not my
               problem. I'm pulling the plug on
               this rodeo. Roberts may be an
               asshole, but he is definitely the
               lesser of the two evils.

                             GINGER
               I've been working on this thing
               for eight months, and I will not
               let some jarhead fed fuck up my

     as it quickly unwinds.


     EXT. RIVER - MORNING

     Reisman, dressed in your average, fly-fishing garb,
     stands in the shallow water of a wide river, thinking he
     has contained the situation, is doing what he enjoys
     most. He rewinds the reel and flicks it out again; the
     hook sails into the distance.

     A huge Cohiba cigar hangs from his satisfied grin.

     Faintly, we hear the WHINE OF MACHINERY. Jim hears it,
     too, odd since we are so far in the boonies. He looks
     around, then up and we PUSH IN TO a CLOSEUP.


     REISMAN'S POV

     An evil-looking, camouflaged gunship suddenly crests the
     hill directly above him, ROTORS THUMPING.


     BACK TO SCENE

     Reisman ducking, his cigar falling from his mouth, has to
     fight to hold on to his ridiculous fishing hat.

     ANGLE FROM ABOVE HELICOPTER

     Water sprays everywhere as it hovers.

     Slowly it drifts over to the bank and lowers where it
     touches down briefly, the side door slides open.


     ANGLE (SLOW MOTION)

     as Gabriel steps out and walks TOWARD us.     The copter
     lifts off behind him.


     BACK TO SCENE

     Reisman drops his rod and digs into the fishing box at
     his right. Gabriel saunters toward him as the helicopter
     disappears over the rise. Reisman is not happy.

                                GABRIEL
                         (sniffing in air)
                  Ahh, the great American outdoors.
                  I'll never understand the appeal
                  of fly-fishing, Jim. A little too
                  much like masturbation for me,
                  without the payoff.

     Gabriel looks around, suddenly realizing something.

                                GABRIEL
                  This's a catch-and-release stream,
                  isn't it?

                                  REISMAN
                  That's right.

     Gabriel starts to laugh.      Reisman doesn't catch the joke.

                                GABRIEL
                  Oh c'mon, Jim. You gotta see the
                  irony in the chairman of the
                  Joint Sub-Committee on Crime,
                  fishing in a catch-and-release
                  stream.

     WIDER

                                GABRIEL
                  How could you do it, Jim? After
                  all we have sacrificed. All the
                  blood, all the death... I've
                  changed my identity so many times,
                  I don't even know what I look like
                  anymore. How could you turn on
                  me when we are so close?

                                REISMAN
                  You did this to yourself.

                                GABRIEL
                  You brought me in to get the job
                  done and you didn't want to know
                  about the consequences.

                                REISMAN
                  The F.B.I. was watching you --

                                GABRIEL
                  I told you there was nothing that
                  I was unaware of --

                                REISMAN
                  That's why we're here. You are
                  too arrogant, too aggressive --

                                GABRIEL
                  You have misplaced your loyalties,
                  Senator. You have sold America out.
                  I am a patriot, and patriotism does
                  not have a four-year shelf life.
                  Unfortunately, politicians do.

     Gabriel pulls out his H&K, dangling it by his side.

                                REISMAN
                         (arrogantly)
                  And what are you going to do
                  with that?

                                GABRIEL
                  Thomas Jefferson once shot a man
                  on the White House lawn for
                  treason, Senator. You tried to
                  execute me in the name of politics,
                  now I execute you in the name of
                  the people.

     Gabriel shoots Reisman in the chest.     He falls into the
     water.

                                                                74.

       Stanley continues to work.   Marco walks in.

                               MARCO
                 You're up, mate.

                               STANLEY
                 Great.

                               MARCO
                 Get your shit, we're headin' out.

       His hands fly across the computer keys, he slides in a
       zip disk, transfers the file, and runs for the door.


99     EXT. GABRIEL'S HOUSE - MORNING                                 99

       Outside, Marco waits in his black Porsche Turbo ready to
       roll. Stanley walks out of the house.

       A snazzy, sweat-suited Kaplan walks out to his shiny new
       silver Porsche, racquet ball racquet flipping in hand.
       He's so downright happy in his confidence that he is on
       the fast track to political Valhalla, due to his handling
       of this Gabriel Shear debacle, he is whistling.

       He CLICKS the Porsche key, unlocking the driver's door,
       tosses in his racquet and climbs in.


103C   INT. KAPLAN'S PORSCHE - NIGHT                                  103C

       He shuts the door and slides the key into the ignition.
       Before he cranks it, he catches himself in the rearview
       and winks at himself.

       Smiling, he turns the key.

       BOOM.

       The Claymore Mine hidden under his seat RIPS the CAR
       apart, shrapnel tearing upward through his body and out
       the roof.

                                                                75.

       The thousand pieces of SHRAPNEL divet the concrete ceiling
       and then bounce across the parking garage floor.


104    EXT. DOWNTOWN THEATER - MORNING                                104

       Stanley is getting out of Marco's car.    Gabriel walks out
       of the theater back door.

                               GABRIEL
                        (over shoulder)
                 Make sure that bus doesn't top out
                 over fifteen-seven.

                                  MERC (O.S.)
                 Yessir.

       Gabriel turns and sees Stanley.

                               GABRIEL
                 Stan, how are you?

                                  STANLEY
                 Fine.

                               GABRIEL
                 Have you finished?

       Stan pulls out the zip disk and hands it to Gabriel who
       dials his cell phone.

                                  GABRIEL

                   Just like I promised, Stanley.

                   I'm about to do something against

                   to tell you something I never tell
                   anyone. I'm going to tell you
                   who I am.

                                    STANLEY
                   Don't bother.     I know who you are.

                                   GABRIEL
                   Do you?    You think I'm a bank
                   robber.    Really, I'm just like you.

                                  STANLEY
                   Like me?   You're a murderer.

                                 GABRIEL
                   That I am. And worse. Much worse.
                   I am forced to operate on a
                   different plane than you. But, I
                   have ethics. Rules to which I

                   200 years ago Thomas Jefferson
                   wrote a letter to Madison because
                   he was concerned that the freedoms
                   of the constitution would be
                   ignored.

                                 STANLEY
                   I don't understand why the fuck
                   you're telling me this.

                                 GABRIEL
                   Listen to me and you will. In the
                   1950s, armed with this letter,
                   J. Edgar Hoover created an
                   organization to protect the
                   freedoms of this country at all
                   costs.

                                 STANLEY
                   I don't care about any of this.
                   All I care about is my daughter.

                                 GABRIEL
                   I'm talking about your daughter.

                                    STANLEY
                   My daughter...

                                 GABRIEL
                   Yes. You, your daughter and 200
                   million other Americans who take
                   their freedoms for granted. You
                   don't understand what it takes
                   to protect those freedoms. That's
                   my job, Stanley, to protect your
                   way of life at all costs.

                                  STANLEY
                   So you and your band of lunatics
                   are really stealing all this money
                   to protect me.

                                 GABRIEL
                   That's right, Stanley --

      He opens the theatre door.

      INT. THEATRE - MORNING

      Stan inside. It's as if he's just teleported into
      Beirut. Weapons, Hummers, a huge armored bus is
      jacked up at one end of the theatre. Gabriel's men go
      about readying themselves. One of the mercs walks over
      to Gabriel to show a modified electronic dog collar.

                                 STANLEY
                          (realization hitting

                   You're going into the fucking bank.

                                 GABRIEL
                   That's what I'm telling you,
                   Stanley. We are at war.

                                  STANLEY
                   War?   Who are we at war with?

                                 GABRIEL
                   Anyone who infringes on America's
                   freedom. Terrorists' states,
                   Stanley. Someone must take their
                   war to them. They bomb a church,
                   we bomb ten. They hijack a plane,
                   we take out an airport. They
                   execute American tourists, we
                   tactically nuke an entire city.
                   We must make terrorism so horrific
                   that it becomes unthinkable to
                   attack Americans.

                                  STANLEY
                   I'm out. I'm not doing this.
                   You're insane.

                                  GABRIEL
                   Maybe. I wanted you to do this
                   because you wanted to, because we
                   need men like you, but our
                   time table's been moved up. Just
                   relax and it will all be over in
                   twenty-four hours. You're rich,
                   Stanley. Pretty soon Holly and
                   you will be basking in the sun on
                   the deck of some eighty-foot
                   scarab, eating bon bons and living
                   the good life.

      He turns to walk off. Stanley looks around. He spots a
      generator and moves toward it. Stanley reaches down to
      the power board on the generator and gives a large dial a
      twist.

      Suddenly, the hundreds of lights in the rack begin to
      arc. In a shower of GLASS they start EXPLODING from the
      huge amperage shooting through them from the generator.
      Gabriel turns to see Stan standing next to the generator.
      He moves toward him just as the room goes black.

      In a moment the secondary lights come up.    No Stanley.

      Early morning in Los Angeles.    People go peacefully about
      their early morning business.

      Suddenly, three red, white and blue Hummers crest a hill
      and tear TOWARD us down the street.

      Halfway down the street, they veer right, jump the curb,
      and SMASH through the front PLATE-GLASS WINDOWS of the
      World Banc.


107   INT. CAB - MORNING                                               107

      Stanley rides in the back of a cab as the cab hauls ass
      to his ex-wife's house.


108   INT. BANK - MORNING                                              108

      As the Hummers roll through the furniture and flying
      glass, the side doors fling open and well-dressed men in
      Italian suits and sunglasses jump out. Customers scream
      and try to flee but are quickly corralled with MACHINE
      GUN BURSTS.

                                                            80-85.

109   EXT. STREET (SOMEWHERE IN SANTA MONICA) - MORNING           109

      A red FERRARI F50 whips around the corner at light speed,
      SCREAMS down the street TOWARD us and SCREECHES to a halt
      outside the bank. It shifts into reverse and slowly
      backs over the curb and into the bank.

      A huge armored bus rolls down the street, through two
      parked cars, and up onto the sidewalk, effectively
      sealing off the front of the glass bank. Mercs begin
      welding metal plates around the armored bus. We hear the
      approaching SIRENS of a fleet of cop cars.

                                                                86.

110   EXT. MALIBU HOUSE - MORNING                                     110

      The cab pulls up in front of Melissa's house.   Stanley
      jumps out and runs up to the front door.


111   INT. BANK - MORNING                                             111

      Several of the mercs finish putting some sort of collars
      on several hostages, including a young, normally good-
      looking-but-now-covered-in-mascara, whimpering blonde
      girl.


112   INT. MALIBU HOUSE - MORNING                                     112

      Stanley busts into her house. In the living room,
      Melissa and the infamous Larry the Porn King are both
      face-down in a pool of blood. Stan freaks. He runs from
      room to room yelling Holly's name. The house is
      deserted. Stanley bursts through the door into Holly's
      room. The room is empty and in disarray.


      CLOSEUP - STANLEY

      As he looks out the window toward LA and pulls out
      Roberts' card.

                                                      FADE TO BLACK.

      THROUGH glass doors, we see the woman slam into the
      locked doors. The SWAT guy pulls her into the street.


114   EXT. STREET                                                     114

      KABOOM!!!

      The EXPLOSION rips the SWAT guy and the girl from the
      beginning apart. This time we see it from ANOTHER ANGLE.
      BALL BEARINGS RICOCHET against the plate steel of the
      bank.

                                                               87.

115   EXT. STARBUCKS COFFEE SHOP - LOW SHOT - DAY                    115

      as the ball bearings bounce across the street and tap
      against the coffee shop.


116   INT. STARBUCKS COFFEE SHOP (SLOW MOTION) - DAY                 116

      Everyone in the coffee shop looks at each other like,
      "What the fuck just happened?"


117   EXT. STARBUCKS COFFEE SHOP - DAY                               117

      As ball bearings roll back into the street.


118   INT. BANK - DAY                                                118

      Stanley is standing in the bank. Three mercs in Donna
      Karen suits point modified M-16s at his head. He stares
      at the ground, shaking his head. Gabriel tosses his
      frappacino against the wall.

                              GABRIEL
                Get that son-of-a-bitch on the
                phone.

      Gabriel walks towards the window, slinging his FN-FAL,
      and pulling on his headset. A.D. Joy answers.

                              GABRIEL
                If you need to test my resolve
                then God help you. You have 25
                minutes. That plane better be on
                the runway.

      He clicks off.    He turns to Stan.

                              GABRIEL
                Get my money, Stanley.

                              STANLEY
                Not until I see my daughter.

      Gabriel snaps his fingers and a ballistic cloth duffel
      bag is thrown to Gabriel. Gabriel is very unhappy. He
      looks at Stanley who is terrified of its contents.

      As he unzips it.

      BACK TO STANLEY

      Stanley almost can't bear to look.


      CLOSEUP - DUFFEL BAG

      As Gabriel slowly reaches in and... Pulls out our buddy
      the giraffe.


      WIDER

      Stanley's heart almost stops.    He sighs as Gabriel tosses
      him the giraffe.

                                 GABRIEL
                   Do you really think I wanted it to
                   come to this. Do you? I am not a
                   psychopath, Stanley, but I told
                   you, I will sacrifice as many
                   lives as it takes to protect our
                   country, including my own.
                          (beat)
                   Now get me my money.

                                 STANLEY
                   Will you let Holly go once you
                   have the money?

                                GABRIEL
                   Both of you. You have my word,
                   Stanley. C'mon.

      They walk past a merc sitting at a desk, a laptop open in
      front of him.

      Marco is paying very close attention to Stan.


119   INT. BANK - DAY                                                 119

      A merc sits at a desk with three laptops and four tiny
      extra monitors, all wired into a large bundle of cables
      that run across the floor.

                                 GABRIEL
                   We okay?

      The   merc looks up. On the monitors and laptop screens
      are   present-time shots of all angles of the building and
      the   surrounding area. The images constantly change as
      the   merc toggles through the images.

                                 MARCO
                   Look at the cover pattern they've
                   set up. The right hand doesn't
                   know what the left's doing.

                                 MARCO (CONT'D)
                   Look at this bozo. If the shit
                   drops, he's gonna cap his buddy in
                   the back of the head. Idiots.

      Stanley sits down at the computer console and brings up
      the bank's mainframe.

                                 STANLEY
                   I need the disk.

      A merc hands it to him and Stanley slides it in the
      computer. His hands work quickly.


120   INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY                                           120

      It is 9:15.

      Now it is 9:35.

                                  STANLEY
                   Almost done.

      Suddenly the lights flicker, Stan's screen blanks out
      momentarily, then blazes back to life, his code
      scrambled. Stan instinctively jerks his hands away from
      the keyboard.

                                STANLEY
                   Whoa! What the hell just
                   happened?

      Gabriel looks at the lights as they flicker back on, the
      huge portable GENERATOR springing to life.

                                 GABRIEL
                   They just cut the power. Forget
                   it. How long to transfer the
                   money?

                                 STANLEY
                   Couple of minutes. Which
                   accounts?

                                 GABRIEL
                   National Bank of Zurich. Spread
                   it evenly over these accounts. It
                   won't be there that long.

                            (dryly)
                   Great.

                                 GABRIEL
                   Good job, Stanley, I got someone
                   who wants to see you.

      They bring Holly out.

                                      STANLEY
                   Holly!

      Stanley grabs her and pulls her close to him.

                                      STANLEY
                   Are you okay?

      Holly nods yes. Stanley and Holly are escorted toward
      the door. Gabriel stands in front, holding his FN-FAL.
      He is speaking in French to several of the mercs.

                                      GABRIEL
                   Hold up.

      Stanley stops. Gabriel walks down the steps and unhooks
      Holly's collar. Stan is about to freak.

                                 GABRIEL
                          (to Stanley)
                   Told you I was a man of my word,
                   Stanley.

      He walks back. Marco unlocks the door. Stanley and
      Holly look at each other. Holly starts to cry.

                                   STANLEY
                   It's okay.    I love you, baby.

      Marco stares at Stanley as they walk out.

                                      MARCO
                   See ya around.

                                      STANLEY
                   I doubt it.

      He starts to walk out...

                                 CYPHER MERC #3
                   Sir, the money just disappeared.

                                      GABRIEL
                   What?

      Gabriel turns around to look at Stanley.    We ZOOM INTO a
      CLOSEUP. He's pissed.

                                 GABRIEL
                   What do you mean, gone?


      WIDER

      We see Stanley. He looks like he just got caught with
      his hand in the cookie jar.

                                  STANLEY
                   Shit!   Run, Holly!

                                  GABRIEL
                   Get her!

      Marco pulls his assault rifle but Stanley waylays him.
      They both hit the ground.


122   EXT. BANK - DAY                                                122

      Holly hauls ass into the street. Once the FBI SWAT guys
      see she is off the sidewalk, they scoop her up.


123   INT. BANK                                                      123

      Gabriel jerks out his weapon and jams it against Stan's
      head as he and Marco roll around on the ground.

                                 STANLEY
                   Won't do you any good. The money
                   jumps every 60 seconds from one
                   numbered account to another and
                   will for the next ten years.
                   'Course it wasn't supposed to
                   happen for another six hours. The
                   power surge must have scrambled
                   the internal clock. But, you kill
                   me and you never get a single
                   dollar.

      Gabriel eases up, wheels spinning at millions of RPMs.

                   You let the hostages go and then
                   I'll tell you where and when you
                   can extract the money. We all
                   walk away, nobody gets hurt. The
                   accounts are encrypted with a 1024
                   bit cipher. Even I can't break
                   through the fire wall. It's my
                   act of God policy.
                          (beat)
                   Deal?

                                   GABRIEL
                   I'm thinking.

      A very tense moment passes.      Gabriel looks around.   He
      has an idea.

                                   GABRIEL
                   Tell ya what.    No deal.

      Marco pulls a length of towing cable from one of the
      Hummer's winches and throws the line over one of the 30-
      foot-high ceiling buttresses.

      Gabriel grabs the cable as it comes down as two mercs
      rush in and grab Stanley, one placing a knife to his
      throat.

                   Marco!   Grab Agent Sculley!

      Marco grabs Ginger and drags her kicking, fighting, over
      to where Gabriel stands, brandishing the cable.

                                 STANLEY
                   No, don't do this.

      Stanley struggles like there is no tomorrow. Gabriel
      hooks the end into a noose with the tow hook, and puts it
      over Ginger's head, pulling it taut around her neck. He
      cuts the cable-tie loose. She digs at them with her
      fingers.

      Two mercs rush in and grab Stanley, one placing a knife
      to his throat.

      Stanley struggles like there is no tomorrow.

                                 GABRIEL
                   In all reality, Stan, she has you
                   to thank for this. That first
                   night in Prague you broke the
                   D.O.D. database that contained her
                   true identity. She's D.E.A.,
                   Stan, but without you, I never
                   would have known.

                                 STANLEY
                          (freaking)
                   What are you doing? Stop!

                                 GABRIEL
                   String up the D.E.A. bitch.

      Marco hits the power switch. Ginger is yanked up into
      the air, hanging twenty feet above the floor.

                                 STANLEY
                   Just let her down. I'll do
                   whatever you want.

                                 GABRIEL
                   Then get me my money, Stan.

      Stanley looks up at Ginger, valiantly struggling for her
      life.

                                 STANLEY
                   I'm not doing shit until you bring
                   her down. I'm serious. Let her
                   down. Now!

                                 GABRIEL
                   Okay.

      Gabriel yanks out his .40 cal. H&K, turns and SHOOTS the
      hanging Ginger.

                                 STANLEY
                   Nooo...

      Stanley looks at her lifeless body as they lower her.

      He looks up at Gabriel and runs at him.

      Gabriel slaps him in the throat, spinning him, and grabs
      Stan around the neck in the crook of his arm.

                   Take a moment, big guy. Don't
                   make me put you in a wheelchair.

      In the b.g. two mercs zip Ginger's body into a black body
      bag and carry her out.

                                 STANLEY
                   You didn't have to kill her.

                                 GABRIEL
                   I didn't Stan, you did.    But we're
                   not done yet.
                          (to Marco)
                   Marco...

      Marco yanks a seventeen-year-old girl up from the floor
      and puts a gun to her head.

                                 GABRIEL
                   There are a lot of hostages here.
                   I cared about Ginger, can you
                   imagine what I could do to someone
                   I don't care about. How long
                   before the money jumps?

                                    STANLEY
                   Sixty seconds.

                                 GABRIEL
                   They better hope you installed a
                   back door or it could be a long
                   day. Somebody get me a laptop.

      A laptop appears. Gabriel hands it to Stanley and nods
      to the mercs who drop him. Stanley drops to his knees,
      placing the computer on the ground.

      Stanley has logged onto the net via modem and we hear
      that familiar PULSE as he does. He connects onto an
      encrypted site on the net. His fingers hum over the
      keys.

      Sweat rolls down Stanley's face as he works on the
      machine. Numbers scroll across the screen. Five columns
      of numbers scroll.

                   I need another laptop, logged on!

      He tries to keep from looking up at the crying hostage.
      The columns decrease. Another laptop appears.

                                 GABRIEL
                   Twenty seconds, Stan.

      His fingers still fly. Three columns now.         He works on
      the other laptop with his right hand.

                   Shut up!

      Two.   Then one.

                                   STANLEY
                   C'mon, c'mon.

      The home page for Grand Cayman Banc appears on the other

      Stanley has typed in the account number and accesses the
      account. He flies through the transfer information.
      Account balance. 6.9 billion dollars.

                                 STANLEY
                   I need your account number.

      Someone hands him a legal pad.         He types it in.

                    Let her go.

       Stanley jumps up and runs over to Marco.        Gabriel puts
       his gun to the back of Stanley's head.

                                  STANLEY
                    Now, goddammit, it's done.   Let

       Gabriel looks at one of his boys who is checking it with
       a different laptop. He nods. Marco drops the girl.

                 in your lives for approximately 55
                 more minutes. This bus has just

                 this will be over before you can
                 say 'cat in the hat.'

                               STANLEY
                 You'll never get away. Even if
                 they have to kill everyone on
                 the bus.

                 Really? Five hundred bucks says I

       Stan slides out of the seat and walks to the front with
       Gabriel. All the hostages' eyes are on him. At the
       front he looks at Gabriel.

                 Take a look.

       Cops block off side streets as the convoy, ala The
       Gauntlet, rolls through L.A.

       Gabriel seems to be in complete control, despite being
       surrounded by every law enforcement officer within a
       hundred miles.

       Stan turns to Gabriel, angry.   He grabs him, pushing him.

                               STANLEY
                 How the fuck can you justify all
                 this?

                               GABRIEL
                 You're not looking at the big
                 picture.

       Gabriel pushes him backward against the hand rail.

                               GABRIEL
                 Stanley, here's a scenario. You
                 have the power to cure all of the
                 world's diseases. But the price
                 for this is that you must kill a
                 single, innocent child. Could you
                 kill that child to save the world?

                                 STANLEY
                 No.

                               GABRIEL
                 You disappoint me, Stanley.   It's
                 the greatest good.

       Silence for several beats.

                               STANLEY
                 How about ten innocents?

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                                 100.

                                  GABRIEL
                    Now you're getting it.   How about
                    a hundred?

       Gabriel becomes intense.

                                  GABRIEL
                    How about a thousand? Not to save
                    the world, but just to preserve
                    our way of life.

                                  STANLEY
                    No man has the right to make that
                    decision. You're no different
                    than any other terrorist.

                                  GABRIEL
                    You're wrong, Stanley. Some men
                    are put here to shape destiny, to
                    protect freedom, despite the
                    atrocities they must commit. I am
                    one of those men. Thousands die
                    every day for no reason at all,
                    where is your bleeding heart for
                    them? You give your twenty
                    dollars to Greenpeace every year
                    and think you are changing the
                    world. What countries will
                    harbor terrorists, when they
                    realize the consequences of what
                    I will do? Did you know I can
                    buy nuclear warheads in Minsk
                    for forty million each? I buy
                    half a dozen, I even get a
                    discount.

       The driver, looking at his watch, says something to
       Gabriel in French.

       Gabriel replies to the driver, also in French.

                    I saw Sugarland Express, Stan.
                    Didn't like the way it ended.

       We see a sign that says "LAX."          The bus turns off before
       they get to the sign.

                    Misdirection, Stanley.

       The bus hurtles down a road toward a bridge over the LA
       river.

       One of the mercs in the front speaks French again.
       Gabriel looks around. He smiles.

                    Listen...

       Faintly, we can hear powerful ROTORS APPROACHING.

       Stanley looks out the window as two of the mercs scramble
       through hatches in the roof.

       A huge black Sikorsky sky crane drops out of the sky. It
       has matched speed with the bus dragging four crane cables
       under it.

       mercs on the roof have hooked the cables to the four
       hard-points welded into the bus' substructure for just
       this purpose. The mercs drop back into...

       Agent Thomas's PHONE RINGS and he answers it. Joy walks

      buildings as it continues to lift.

      The Sikorsky attempts to set the bus on the rooftop. The
      back wheels miss the rooftop and the entire bus starts
      sliding toward the edge. The Sikorsky lifts the entire
      bus back up into the air and then gingerly sets it on the
      rooftop on all four wheels. The CABLES are cut loose
      from the helicopter, and drop down onto the ROOF with a
      loud CLANG.

                It can't end like this.     You can't
                get away.

                                  GABRIEL
                    C'mon, Stan. Everything doesn't
                    always end the way you think it
                    will.
                           (beat, then)
                    'Sides, audiences love happy
                    endings.

       Gabriel strides away. We hear the WHINE of the EXPLORER
       as it does its final POWER UP for lift off.

       Stanley looks around the bus futilely for some way to
       stop Gabriel. Stan can hear the cavalry about to arrive.
       The Explorer slowly lifts upward.


168    EXT. SKYSCRAPER ROOF - DAY                                        168

       The Explorer shoots upward into the sky.

       Stan looks around, all the hostages look back at him.
       Stanley sees one of the Stinger missile launchers, broken
       free of its box.


169B   EXT. BUS                                                          169B

       Roberts runs onto the roof and sees Stanley who has the
       STINGER to his shoulder. He hits the "on" switch and
       it WHINES TO LIFE.

       He sights through the scope as the EXPLORER SCREAMS away
       and pulls the trigger. The MISSILE RIPS OUT of the tube
       and flies toward the EXPLORER.

       BOOM.

       The MISSILE EXPLOSION combined with the fuel creates a
       tremendous fireball.

       Roberts runs and tackles Stanley to the ground. Suddenly,
       SWAT GUYS dressed in full combat gear including masks that
       cover their faces surround them.

       They cuff them.    One of them almost steps on Stanley's
       face.

       Gabriel's barely recognizable burned upper torso and
       head. Stan and Roberts walk into the room through the
       metal doors and stop at the end of the table. Dr.
       Micheals nervously looks up at Stanley and steps back.
       Stanley looks down at the body.

                    Are we sure this is Gabriel?

       Micheals walks over to a light-board on the wall and
       flicks it on. A full dental X-ray glows. Micheals hangs
       another over-top of it.

                    The body's dentals exactly match
                    the dentals the Israeli government

                   substantial amount of money in

                   That's why I'm here. My employer
                   doesn't like drawing attention to
                   himself. He likes to keep a low
                   profile.

                                 WOMAN
                   That's impossible.

                 Everything's fine. Just making the
                 last of some charitable donations..

      Stanley finishes, shuts down laptop.

                               STANLEY
                 How about you, almost done?

                 Yep.   Got it all figured out.

                               STANLEY
                 Well, let's do it.

      They leave table.


      EXT. DINER - SOMEWHERE IN ARIZONA - DAY

      They exit diner. Make their way to a new SUV with a
      thirty foot tricked out Airstream trailer stretched
      out behind it.

                               STANLEY
                 By the way, where exactly are we
                 going?

                               HOLLY
                 The Petrified Forest.

      Stanley opens the driver side door of the SUV.

                   Right.   And I'm driving.

      Holly climbs into the vehicle, as if to take the wheel.
      Stanley slides in next to her.

                                 STANLEY
                   Scoot over, you.


      WIDE SHOT

      WE CRANE UP and AWAY as the vehicle pulls out of the
      desert truck stop...

                                 HOLLY (V.O.)
                   Know why they call it the Petrified
                   Forest?

                                  STANLEY (V.O.)
                   No.   Why?

      ... and drives off down the road.

      FADE IN:

180   EXT. CREDIT SUISSE (MONTE CARLO) - DAY                        180

      A MAN, whom we have not seen before but does maintain a
      certain "Gabriel" air about him, hiding behind shades,
      leans against a three-hundred-year-old column reading a
      newspaper.

      She walks toward him and he signals for the valet.

                               WOMAN FROM BANK
                 You're not fucking gonna believe
                 this. Stanley --

                               MAN
                 -- How much he leave?

                               WOMAN FROM BANK
                 500 bucks.

      He takes the $500 in cash from her hand and hands her the
      paper. They walk down to the dock, where a 50-foot off-
      shore cigarette boat waits, a valet standing next to it.

      He hands the valet the $500. Stepping down into the
      cigarette boat, he grins up at Ginger.

                               GINGER (WOMAN)
                        (steppng in next
                         to him)
                 You don't seem that upset.

                               MAN
                 Did you ever see the Maltese Falcon?

      She looks at him as he CRANKS UP the CIGARETTE and backs
      away from the pier.

                               MAN
                 1941. Nominated for three
                 Academy Awards, lost, but what
                 the fuck does the Academy know
                 anyway. John Houston's first
                 film and probably Bogey's best.

      He turns the BOAT around and POWERS out of the bay.

                               MAN
                 At the end, when they realize the
                 bird's a fake, and all they had
                 gone through and sacrificed was for
                 nothing, Gutman, the bad guy in the
                 movie, says, 'well, sir, what do you
                 think, shall we stand here, shed
                 tears, and call each other names,
                 or shall we go to Istanbul?'
                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                                113.

180   CONTINUED:                                                       180

                                  GINGER
                   Istanbul?   What's in Istanbul?

                                 MAN
                   The, ah, stuff dreams are made of.

                                  GINGER
                   Huh?

      They both smile as the CIGARETTE disappears toward the
      horizon.


                                                        FADE OUT.

                             TERMINATOR



A1      TITLE SEQUENCE - SLITSCAN EFFECT                       A1

1       EXT. SCHOOLYARD - NIGHT                                1

        Silence.  Gradually the sound of distant traffic becomes
        audible.  A LOW ANGLE bounded on one side by a chain-link
        fence and on the other by the one-story public school build-
        ings.  Spray-can hieroglyphics and distant streetlight sha-
        dows.  This is a Los Angeles public school in a blue collar
        neighborhood.

        ANGLE BETWEEN SCHOOL BUILDINGS, where a trash dumpster looms
        in a LOW ANGLE, part of the clutter behind the gymnasium.
        A CAT enters FRAME.  CAMERA DOLLIES FORWARD, prowling with
        him through the landscape of trash receptacles and shadows.

        CLOSE ON CAT, which freezes, alert, sensing something just
        beyond human perception.

        A sourceless wind rises, and with it a keening WHINE.
        Papers blow across the pavement.
        The cat YOWLS and hides under the dumpster.
        Windows rattle in their frames.
        The WHINE intensifies, accompanied now by a wash of frigid
        PURPLE LIGHT.  A CONCUSSION like a thunderclap right over-
        head blows in all the windows facing the yard.

        C.U. - CAT, its eyes are wide as the glare dies.


1A/FX   ANGLE - DUMPSTER                                       1A/FX

        ELECTRICAL DISCHARGES arc from the dumpster to a water
        faucet and climb a drain pipe like a Jacob's Ladder.

                                              CUT TO:


2       EXT. SCHOOLYARD - NIGHT                                2

        SLOW PAN as the sound of stray electrical CRACKLING subsides.
        FRAME comes to rest on the figure of a NAKED MAN kneeling,
        faced away, in the previously empty yard.
        He stands, slowly.
        The man is in his late thirties, tall and powerfully built,
        moving with graceful precision.

        C.U. - MAN, his facial features reiterate the power of his
        body and are dominated by the eyes, which are intense, blue
        and depthless.  His hair is military short.

        This man is the TERMINATOR.

        He glances down, taking calm inventory of himself, and
        notices that a fine white ash covers his skin.  He brushes
        at it unconcernedly as he walks toward the fence, scanning
        his surroundings.

                                              CUT TO:


2A/FX   CRANE SHOT - SCHOOLYARD/CITY - NIGHT                   2A/FX

        CAMERA MOVES UP as Terminator approaches the schoolyard fence
        beyond which is an embankment rolling down in darkness to the
        cityscape below.  The school is perched at the edge of a pro-
        montory offering a respectable view of the urban sprawl teem-
        ing and glistening under a sullen sky.  The night clouds are
        shot through with occasional flashes of LIGHTNING, presaging
        a thunderstorm.

        Terminator stands, hands on hips in prefect symmetry, gazing
        down at the city as the CAMERA REACHES FULL HEIGHT.

                                              CUT TO:


3       EXT. PLAYGROUND - NIGHT                               3

        A beer bottle SMASHES on the ground.  PULL BACK to include
        its ex-owner and his two compatriots, YOUTH GANG MEMBERS,
        lounging on the jungle gym of a deserted playground.  They
        sport nondescript PUNK REGALIA...torn T-shirts, fatigue
        pants, combat boots or high-top sneakers, leather jackets.

        The leader notices something and sits up.

                                LEADER
                           (pointing)
                     Hey, hey...what's wrong with
                     this picture?

        ANGLE - REVERSE, seen past the lounging toughs, Terminator
        walks naked into a pool of streetlight, striding purpose-
        fully toward them.

        ANGLE - OVER TERMINATOR'S SHOULDER, as he approaches them.
        They slide from their perches and drop easily to the ground
        liquid shadows.

                                LEADER
                     Nice night for a walk, eh?

        Terminator stops right in front of them.

                                TERMINATOR
                           (without inflec-
                           tion)
                      Nice night for a walk.

        They surround him, all swagger and malign good humor.

                                SECOND PUNK
                      Washday tomorrow, huh?  Nothing
                      clean, right?

        Terminator eyes them without expression, unhurried.
        Reptilian.

                                TERMINATOR
                      Nothing clean.  Right.

                                LEADER
                      This guy's a couple bricks
                      short.

        Terminator turn to the second punk, ignoring the
        others.

                                TERMINATOR
                      Your clothes.  Give them to me.

        The punks exchange glances, dismayed.

                                TERMINATOR
                           (coldly)
                      Now.

                                SECOND PUNK
                           (bracing)
                      Fuck you, asshole.


        Without warning Terminator hammer-punches him in the temple
        with blinding speed.  The blow flings him with a CLANG into
        the jungle gym.  He drops to the ground in a still heap,
        eyes open, twitching.

        The leader whips out his SWITCHBLADE and slashes in one
        motion.  Terminator ducks back and catches the knife-
        wielder's wrist in an inhuman grip.  Then he punches the
        leader with piledriver force just below the breastbone.

        ANGLE - PAVEMENT, as the knife clatters down.  The punk's
        combat boots are on tiptoe, barely touching the ground.

        ANGLE - TWO SHOT, Terminator and the leader are close
        together as if dancing, but motionless.  Their bodies are in
        total shadow.  The punk's eyes are wide, his veins distended
        with an agonizing pressure.  Terminator jerks his fist back
        with a WET SOUND and the other drops OUT OF FRAME.

        The last tough is stumbling away, gaping with terror.  He
        backs into a chainlink fence, turns to run along it, finds
        he is in a corner.

        Terminator takes a step toward him, his gaze ominous.

        The punk begins shakily stripping off his clothes.
        Thunder peals overhead.

                                               CUT TO:

4       EXT. STREET/NEARBY - NIGHT                             4

        A light RAIN begins to fall.
        Terminator emerges onto the street from the playground,
        pausing in the pool of light under a streetlight to hike
        the collar of the punk's jacket.
               The rain streams down over his face, running into
        and over his eyes.  They do not blink.

                                               CUT TO:

5       EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET/ALLEY - NIGHT                     5

        Another part of the city.  Seedy apartments and storefronts.
        The streets glisten, hissing with sporadic late night traffic.
        SLOW PAN AND DOLLY into the mouth of a narrow alley lined
        with trash containers and fire escapes.  From a recessed
        doorway, two filthy legs sprawl out onto the wet pavement.
        An angry, inarticulate DRUNKARD'S MONOLOGUE rises occasionally
        above the rain sounds.

        ANGLE - DOORWAY,  The derelict rouses from his bitter stupor
        as a brilliant purple glare lights up the wet brickwork
        around him.  A shockwave hurls trash into the air.
        Painted over windows shatter.
        Rat scurry, blinded.

        A FIGURE drops INTO FRAME as if out of the sky and smacks
        the pavement with a muddy splash.

        C.U. - DERELICT, as he blinks at the fading glare, amazed.

        A NAKED MAN, compact and muscular, rises in a defensive
        crouch.  KYLE REESE is 22, but his face has been aged by
        ordeal, the mouth hard, eyes grim.  A crinkled burn scar
        traverses one side of his face from chin to forehead.  Other
        scars, from burns and bullets, mar his hard-muscled body.

        The rain washes a fine coating of white ash from his skin
        as electrical ARCS lace back and forth between the fire
        escapes behind him, HISSING and SPUTTERING.  The sound
        fades, then stops altogether, to be replaced by a rising
        scream of animal agony.

        Reese lurches to his feet and sprints across the alley.

7       EXT. FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT                               7

        CAMERA MOVES WITH REESE as he leaps to the fire escape and
        clambers up to the first landing to crouch beside another
        NAKED MAN who appears to be entangled in the ironwork.  The
        man is contorted with pain as his screams die to a shivering
        gasp.  CLOSER ANGLE reveals that he has been skewered through
        the abdomen by the horizontal iron slats and through the
        shoulder by a railing.  He has materialized in the same
        space occupied by the fire escape structure.  The figure
        slumps, motionless.

        Reese quickly checks for signs of life.  The man is dead.

        Reese descend to the alley floor and crosses to the drunk
        huddled in the doorway.

        A pair of flamboyantly dressed women, obviously working
        girls, passes by the alley mouth.  They do a double take
        when they see Reese, but walk on without breaking stride,
        completely jaded.  He's certainly not a potential customer.

        Reese crouches down as if to speak to the drunk.

                                DERELICT
                      Say, buddy...did you see a
                      real bright light?

        A brilliant white glare stabs into the alley mouth as an
        LAPD cruiser glides slowly by on the street.  The search-
        light illuminates the figure of Reese, crouching over the
        sprawled drunk, just pulling on the other's trousers.

        The cruiser chirps to a stop.  The doors fly open and two
        cops leap out.

                                FIRST COP
                      Hold it, right there!

        Reese hitches his pants and bolt like a shot.  The cops
        draw their guns and race into the alley after him.

        HANDHELD CAMERA or PANAGLIDE, rushing with Reese along the
        narrow alley.  He vaults a pile of tumbled trashcans.
        Whips around a corner.  Leaps the hood of a parked car in
        the cross alley.

        PANAGLIDE PRECEDING COPS, as they snake through the night
        maze.

        WHIP PAN ON COPS, skidding to a stop at the corner in time
        to see Reese vault the fence.  They separate.

        LOW PANAGLIDE WITH REESE, running full tilt, displaying
        incredible agility.

        REESE'S POV, the alley walls blur by.  The view of a hot-
        wired rat in an urban maze.

        C.U. - REESE, CAMERA hugging him as he sprints and turns,
        alternately front-lit, side-lit and silhouetted as the
        electric glare of the city wheels about him.

        ANGLE - ALLEY MOUTH, Reese flashes though intermittent
        cross-lighting in the B.G.

        Another unit arrives out front and Reese melts back into
        the alley, only to see a cop round the corner behind him.
        Sandwiched.  Reese crashes into a steel door, rending the
        lock, and vanishes into the darkness within.

        The newly arrived cops are a K-9 unit.  They open the back
        door of the squad car to release a large black Doberman.

12      INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - NIGHT                          12

        Reese finds himself among the display racks of a discount
        department store.  A searchlight stabs in the front
        window as he dashes into the maze of aisles.

        Three cops enter behind him through the shattered door.

        FAST PANAGLIDE WITH REESE, as he crab-runs low among the
        moving shadows where flashlights quarter the darkness.  He
        bolts the open space behind a display window.  Sees the
        outside searchlight sweep toward him.  Freezes.

        ANGLE - REESE, his feral face frozen among the smooth-
        featured, smiling mannequins.  As the light passes, Reese
        silently moves on.

        ANGLE - COP, passing the end of a long aisle B.G. while in
        the F.G. a hand ENTERS FRAME, removing a knit shirt from a
        hanger.  Reese slips the shirt on quietly and does a fast
        crab-walk across the aisles to melt into the other racks
        and shadows, CAMERA MOVING LOW with him.

13      INT. DEPARTMENT STORE/AISLE - NIGHT                    13

        With a shocking GROWL the police dog hurtles out of the
        shadows, LEAPING RIGHT AT CAMERA.

        ANGLE - REESE AND DOG, a dark blur with teeth, extremely
        Doberman, flies toward Reese.  He spins.  Catches it by
        the throat in mid-air. Arcs it to the floor with unflinching
        precision.

        C.U. - DOBERMAN, suddenly on its back and held by the throat,
        THE DOG YELPS and stares at Reese, who leans very close.
        Inches from its eyes he fixes it with a gaze of uncompromis-
        ing dominance.  Some ancient communication seems to pass
        between the two.

        Reese releases the animal and turns his back on it, selecting
        a long overcoat from a rack.  The dog backs away from him,
        stiff-legged and confused.

        TRACKING WITH REESE as he rounds a corner on the run, still
        shrugging into his long coat.
        Running smack at him is another cop, gun aimed.

        Without slowing, Reese leaps toward him, twisting in mid-air
        like a cat.  The cop FIRES. Misses.  Goes down under Reese's
        tackle and they slide together on the polished floor.

        Before they even come to rest Reese snatches the cop's gun,
        aiming it at the other's face two-handed.

                                REESE
                      What day is it?  The date...

                      What year?

        A SHOT whines off the metal side of an escalator behind
        Reese's head.  He vaults the escalator rail, leaving the
        amazed cop lying on the floor.

        Reese bounds up the frozen steps, pocketing the .38 Police
        Special in his coat.

        Cops dash through the maze of aisles, converging at the
        escalators.

        He stops for a moment beside a rack of shoes.  Slaps one of
        a pair of tennis shoes sole-to-sole against his bare foot.
        Too small.  Another.  Holding the shoes he runs on.

        A door opens quietly and Reese slips out.

        narrow catwalk.  TILT DOWN to include the first LAPD cruiser
        parked at the mouth of the alley.

        Reese drops cat-like beside the unattended police car.
        Cautiously, he opens the door of the cruiser, removes the
        RIOT GUN, an Ithaca pump model, from the dash rack and slips
        it under his coat.  Cradled in a vertical position, the
        shortened weapon is virtually invisible.

        He walks out onto the street and away,  unhurriedly, an
        innocuous pedestrian soon lost in the rain.

        Reese enters a telephone booth.  Harsh light rakes across
        his face, outlining the long scar.  He opens the directory,
        leafs through it.

        ANGLE - MACRO ON PAGE, Reese's finger slides down a column.
        Stops beside the following listings in the big metropolitan

        of diffuse sunlight.

        MOVING WITH A GIRL on a MOPED as she zips through traffic.
        SARAH CONNER is 19, small and delicate-featured.  Pretty in
        a flawed, accessible way. She doesn't stop the party when
        she walks in, but you'd like to get to know her.  Her vulner-
        able quality masks a strength even she doesn't know exists.

        Sarah maneuvers nimbly, apparently in a hurry.

        out for fat kids.
        Sarah removes a stack of college textbooks from the luggage
        carrier and tuns to go into the restaurant.

                      can get here on time if I put
                      you on the floor as a waitress?

                      The pay's the same but you'll
                      make more in tips.

                                SARAH
                      Thanks, Chuck.  I need the

                      money.  Can I still work the
                      hours around my classes?

        Breen turns to punch up a display on the restaurant's
        small accounting computer.  Sarah looks over his shoulder
        as he modifies the week's schedule.

                                BREEN
                      Mmm.  Same schedule's okay.

        Terminator has calmly begun feeding the shells into the
        shotgun.

                      Wrong.

        He raises the barrel and pulls the trigger.  The gun THUNDERS.

        The yellow Maverick pulls to a stop beside a single phone
        booth.

        MOVING WITH TERMINATOR, as he gets out, walks to the booth
        and rapidly pulls its occupant out by his greasy T-shirt,
        flinging him backward into the parking lot.  The guy is
        bear-like, slab-handed, but Terminator doesn't even glance
        back as he steps in to take the man's place.

        A woman's voice, a faint reedy monologue, issues from the

32      INT. BIG BOB'S/DINING AREA

        Sarah is bustling about, trying to service the start of
        the dinner rush.  In waitress parlance, she's 'in it'.
        She runs the gauntlet between tables, precariously balancing
        two full dinner plates on one arm and hand-carrying a
        third.  A customer tugs on her apron for attention and she
        barely averts contributing the chili size to his wardrobe.

                                CUSTOMER
                      Honey, can I get that coffee
                      now?

                                SARAH
                      Yes sir, just a second.

        She reaches her table after near collisions with a Mexican
        busboy and two teenage girls doing cheerleading routines
        in lock-step.

                                SARAH
                      Who gets the Burly Burger?

                                CUSTOMER TWO
                      I ordered Barbecue Beef.

                                CUSTOMER THREE
                      Does mine come with fires?

                                CUSTOMER FOUR
                      He's got the Barbecue Beef,
                      I've got a Chili-Beef Deluxe.

                                SARAH
                      Okay, who gets the Burly Beef?

                                CUSTOMER AT NEXT TABLE
                      Miss, we're ready to order.


        In the process of setting down all the plates Sarah knocks
        over someone's water glass.

                      Oh, sorry.  That's not real
                      leather, is it?

        As she cleans up the spill, a kid at the next booth reaches
        over and dumps a scoop of ice cream into the top pouch of
        Sarah's apron

        She stares down at the mess melting over her hard-earned
        and sags with defeat.  NANCY, a plump, gum-chewing waitress,
        stops beside her to whisper.

                                NANCY
                      Look at it this way: in a

                      care?

        LOW ANGLE with the FRAME comprising a single house, toy-
        littered lawn and mailbox.  EXTREME F.G., by the curb, is
        a CHILD'S PLASTIC TRUCK.

        There is the sound of a CAR ENGINE approaching, and the
        front of the yellow Maverick appears, stopping at the curb.
        Its front tire  CRUSHES the toy.

        PANAGLIDE ON TERMINATOR, preceding him as he steps out of the
        car, pauses by the mailbox to check the name, and strides
        toward the house.

        A YOUNG BOY, playing in the driveway, watches him pass.  The
        boy's DOG, a small Terrier, growls low and mean, crouching
        back from Terminator.

        He rings the doorbell and waits, motionless.
        The door opens a few inches, held by a security chain,
        revealing a frail MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN in apron and rubber
        cleaning gloves.

        pulls the .45 from under his jacket and snaps the cocking
        slide.

                      What is it, Mom?

        She jumps as the door BANGS open.  And stares in dumb
        amazement as the good-looking, intense-eyed man in the
        strange clothes raises a pistol.

        And aims it at her face.

        It all seems less real than "GENERAL HOSPITAL" in that
        half-second before he FIRES.

        He unhurriedly removes the spent clip, reloads the weapon

        Terminator stands at the head of the stairs.
        His hand is bloody where he grasped the dead woman's
        shoulder.

        He starts down the stairs.
        The mother stands paralyzed, unable to breathe.
        He reaches the main floor and walks toward her.
        She edges into a corner, eyes wide.
        He reaches out.

        And wipes his hands clean on her apron.

        Terminator walks out, without expression, leaving the
        woman to sag to the floor in a faint.

        strokes with a hacksaw to sever the wooden stock from
        the riot gun.  It clatters to the ground, leaving a short
        stump, like a pistol grip.

        CUT WIDER as Reese hefts the weapon.  He is crouched in
        an underground service tunnel below a busy street.  Shadows
        of people walking across a grating in the sidewalk above
        him flicker past.  They can't see him in the darkness below
        their feet as he checks the gun's action carefully.  He
        slips it under his overcoat where it hangs from a jerry-

        his overcoat done up to the top button.
        He walks through the sparse morning crowd on the cluttered,
        overbuilt commercial street.
        He is out of sync.
        A stranger in a strange land.
        He holds himself tightly reined, cautious and feral as he
        moves among the unconcerned pedestrians.
        His eyes flick rapidly about.
        He is seeing this Babylon for the first time.

        Reese stops at a hole-in-the-wall take-out stand.  He
        watches people walk away with food.  Moves closer.
        Scrutinizes the next man as he orders.

                      That'll be one-sixty.

                      You're cute.  Cute I remember.

                                SARAH
                      I'm Sarah.  Ginger's roommate.

                                MARCO
                      Yeah, right.  I'm Marco.

        The dance tape ends.

                                GINGER
                      ...and three aaand four!  And
                      that's it ladies!  Now, didn't
                      that feel good?

        The group collapses ensemble.  A chorus of groans.

                                GINGER
                      Let's think positive or next
                      time I'll play the FM version.

        Ginger walks over to Sarah as the class disperses.  Marco
        is leaning on the wall next to Sarah, who is enjoying the
        attention.

                                SARAH
                      ...yeah, really?  Say some-
                      thing in Italian.

        Before Marco can reply, Ginger pulls the front of his gym
        shorts out and peers down.  She shakes her head.

                                GINGER
                      You're wasting your time, kiddo.
                      Let's go.

        She grabs Sarah by the arm and pulls her out the door.
        Sarah catches a glimpse of Marco's expression over her
        shoulder as the door closes.

                                               CUT TO:

        PANAGLIDE WITH THE TWO GIRLS, as they descend to the first
        floor and enter a hallway
        Sarah is gasping with laughter.

                                SARAH
                           (weakly)
                      I don't believe you did that.

        Ginger is adjusting her ever-present WALKMAN-TYPE CASSETTE
        PLAYER at her hip.  She slips on the earphones as they walk
        along.
        Sarah feigns outrage.

                                SARAH
                           (continuing)
                      I had him hooked.  He was
                      just about to ask me out.
                      I could tell.

                                GINGER
                      That guy's a jerk.  I did
                      you a favor.

                                SARAH
                      I'll do the same for you
                      sometime.

        Sarah laughs and claps her friend on the back.  They turn
        in at a door marked WEIGHT ROOM.

                                               CUT TO:

41      INT. WEIGHT ROOM                                       41

        SEVERAL ANGLES, on glistening arms, legs, torsos merging
        into bio-mechanical kinetic sculptures with the chrome-steel
        levers and tubes.  The CRASH and SQUEAL of metal against
        metal.

        In F.G., two Conan-esque arms thrust upward, glistening.
        Ginger's boyfriend, MATT McCALLISTER, the assistant manager
        of the club, strains out his last reps, bench-pressing
        enormous weight on the Nautilus machine.
        Despite his imposing appearance, Matt is one of the warmest
        people you'd ever want to meet.
        His face is contorted, muscles knotted for the last push.
        He heaves it up with a guttural cry.
        Lowering his weights with a CLANG, Matt lies panting, arms
        dangling at his side, eyes closed.
        A pair of female legs appear.

                                GINGER (V.O.)
                           What's this? Sleep therapy?

        Matt opens his eyes.

                                GINGER
                           (continuing)
                      You think somebody's gonna
                      do this for you?  Look at
                      those shriveled bi's.  And
                      you haven't worked lat's or
                      ab's since Wednesday.

                                MATT
                           (smiling)
                      Hello, sweetheart.  Had a
                      rough day?

                                GINGER
                           (softening)
                      Come here, wimp.

        She leans down as he sits up and they meet in a kiss that's
        bad for the other guys' discipline.

        Sarah waits until they break the clinch to speak.

                                SARAH
                      Hi, Matt.

        Matt look backwards over the bench, and replies, upside-down.

                                MATT
                           (grinning broadly)
                      Heeey!  It's my favorite
                      Sarah.  Hi, babe.

        Ginger pulls the pin on Mat's weights and re-inserts it
        beneath the entire stack, the maximum weight.

                                GINGER
                      Alright, warm-ups are over.
                      Back to work, Bunky.

        Ginger readadjusts her headphones as the two girls walk away.

                                MATT
                      'Bye beautiful.  You too,
                      Ginger.

        Two weightlifters nearby look at each other, than at Matt.

                                WEIGHTLIFTER
                      Bunky?

        Sarah lurches away from the curb on her moped, almost
        spilling Ginger who is attempting to ride double.  They
        swing out onto a main thoroughfare and careen through
        the bumper-to-bumper traffic.
        Sarah maneuvers deftly though overloaded and unstable.
        Ginger doesn't know whether to laugh of scream at the
        near-misses.
        She does both.

44      EXT. STREET/CONSTRUCTION SIGHT - DUSK

        On a side street the girls pass an excavation site  between
        high-rises.  They pass OUT OF FRAME as CAMERA HOLDS on the
        construction area and Ginger's shrieks fade.

        In the F.G., under an overpass, Reese sits is a car watching
        the powerful machines moving earth.
        He's in a late-model non-descript GREY SEDAN, one of a row
        of cars gathering dirt beside the construction site.
        Crab-armed back-hoes and massive caterpillars ROAR through
        a curtain of dust, under intense floodlights.  A power-shovel
        moves its great arm, lighting its own way with an arc-light.

        Reese sits motionless in the dark.  Waiting.  The clock in
        the dash ticks quietly.
        He flips on the radio.  A fatuous POP ROCK STATION.
        Reese fishes a magazine off the dirty floor.  His over-
        coat is off, draped over the shotgun on the seat beside
        him.
        His bare arms are sinewy and scarred.

        Reese flips the page of COSMOPOLITAN.
        He look at the glossy photos, the glossy women.
        Fantasy women.  Svelte and seamless.
        The ads fascinate him too: Caribbean vacations and blended
        whiskeys.
        His head sags against the door.
        He gazes dully at the tracks of a passing CATERPILLAR as they
        chew through the dirt.
        The ROAD and CLATTER of treads intensifies as his eyes close.

46      EXT. MELTED RUINS - NIGHT                              46

        TIGHT ON A GLEAMING STEEL TREAD as it grinds through debris.
        The debris is ferroconcrete, girders, and jackstraw heaps of
        HUMAN BONES, burned black.

        There is the sound of EXPLOSIONS, distant, and an intermittent
        electronic WHINE.  Incredibly bright searchlights play over
        the ground.  PANNING with the moving treads through twisted
        wreckage, F.G.
        The screen WHITES OUT with a BLAST, very close.  As the
        debris clatters down, a helmetted head snaps up into FRAME,
        EXTREME F.G.

        The visor of the HIGH-TECH HELMET is shattered, presumably
        by the explosion.  The wearer rips it off, revealing a
        younger Reese, minus his burn scar.
        His face is bathed in sweat, lit by the glow from a CRT
        SCOPE-SIGHT on a strange-looking rifle.
        The sound of SCREAMS and HOARSE SHOUTS not far off, and a
        continuous low murmuring of RADIO CHATTER, grid coordinates,
        casualties, unit placements, medic requests.

        Reese looks over his shoulder at his teammate, a GIRL
        of about sixteen, gaunt, dirty, heavily armed like himself.
        DOLLYING as they start to belly crawl through the bones
        and wreckage.
        Reese looks up.
        Through spires of a collapsed building a terrifying
        SPHINX-LIKE SHAPE moves against the sky...obscured by dust
        and blinding sweeps of its searchlights.
        Though we see little, this is an H-K,Hunter-Killer
        mobile ground-unit.

        Reese crawls, pacing the H-K, under and through, on elbows
        and knees, past mounds of charred skulls.  They
        pass the BODY OF A CHILD, a boy of about 10, center-
        punched with a smoking hole.  The boy clutches a rifle.
        More bodies.  Some in rags, some in uniforms like theirs.
        WOMEN. OLD MEN. CHILDREN.  They're all dirty and gaunt,
        scabrous.  And still bleeding.  Reese scrabbles past a
        dark rat-hole and there are human rats in it.  Some of them
        are sobbing, or screaming.

        Another EXPLOSION.
        The GLARE lights the huddled few.
        Human vermin with mud-caked weapons that haven't been
        invented yet.  Soldiers in a nightmare war.

        Reese and his teammate stop behind a blasted wall, having
        outflanked the massive H-K.  Its flashing blue lights flick
        across the walls, its searchlights sear through the
        debris.

        WIDER, showing the H-K more clearly...a blast-scarred
        CHROME LEVIATHON, with hydraulic arms folded mantis-like
        against its 'torso', and huge underslung GUN TURRETS.

        Reese leaps up and straight-arms a satchel-charge into its
        path.  One tread rolls over the explosive.
        Guns and searchlights swivel.  The head turns ponderously.
        Reese's partner rises, poised to throw hers.
        A POWER-BOLT catches her at the top of her arc, BLOWING
        HER INTO RED MIST.

        Reese is knocked down by the concussion.  Gets up, running,
        as the charges blow.
        The H-K's tread carriers are RIPPED APART.
        It lurches to a stop, burning.

        The following SEQUENCE is extremely FORESHORTENED.
        CUT FAST.  IMPRESSIONS ONLY.
        Running.
        Explosions light the ruins like flashbulbs.
        ENERGY WEAPONS criss-cross the night like tracers.
        LOW ANGLE, up past the burning H-K as its flying counter-
        part, an AERIAL H-K, arcs into view with a TURBOJET WHINE.

        Reese hauls two survivors of his unit into a PERSONNEL
        CARRIER, a CHEVY CAMARO with steel plate welded over it and
        the roof cut away to access the 50 CALIBER MACHINE GUN.
        It's stripped and rusted and bullet-riddled, glassless.
        The TIRES are OFF-ROAD and very gnarly.

        They're driving through the ruins, up and over and through.
        Reese drives like a demon.  Under other circumstances it
        would be considered insane.  Here it is merely very good.

        The machine gun CHATTERS.
        A BLACK SHAPE descends, a demon with searchlights.
        A BOLT OF LIGHT.

        Reese's car flips like a kicked beer can, rolling and
        crumpling.  He's pinned in the wreck, bloody, screaming
        despite his training.  The only other survivor, an
        emaciated BOY of twelve, is pulling for all he's worth
        to drag Reese out before it burns.

        is a SHOTGUN MUZZLE AIMED RIGHT AT US.
        Reese quivers with a curious spasm, similar to the tremors
        of his arrival, and blinks at the boy.

        The boy is white-faced, staring down the bore.  He backs
        away.  We see that he is straddling a bicycle.

        Sarah and Ginger are crammed into the tiny bathroom,
        becoming inextricably tangled in each other's cords as
        they blow-dry, curl hair, and apply make-up.  Ginger
        has her headphones inverted under her chin but in place,
        and is bouncing to music as she dries her hair.  She is
        wearing a short terry-cloth bathrobe that reveals the
        greater part of her legs.  Sarah is in a skirt and bra.

        The phone rings and Sarah goes out into the living room
        to get it.

                                SARAH
                           (answering the

                      Hello?

                           (on phone, deep
                           and breathy)
                      First I'm going to rip the
                      buttons off your blouse, one
                      by one...then run my tongue
                      along your neck, down to your
                      bare, gleaming breasts...

        Sarah cups her hand over the mouthpiece and calls out
        matter-of-factly:

                                SARAH
                      Ginger!  It's Matt.

        She resumes listening.

                                MATT (V.O.)
                      ...and then slowly pull your
                      jeans off inch by inch and
                      lick your belly in circles,
                      further and further down...
                      then I'll pull off your panties
                      with my teeth...

        Sarah is repressing laughter.

                      Who is this?

        Silence.  Then Matt realizes to his horror who he's been
        talking to.

                                MATT (V.O.)
                      Oh my God!  Sarah!  Oh, shit.
                      Jesus, I'm sorry.  I thought
                      you were...Can I talk to Ginger?

                                SARAH
                      Sure, Bunky.

        As Ginger approaches, Sarah hands her the receiver and
        goes into the bedroom.

                                GINGER
                      Hello?

                                MATT (V.O.)
                      First I'm gonna rip the buttons
                      off your blouse...

        Ginger is still listening to Matt, nodding, as Sarah enters
        and starts holding the blouses against herself one by one
        for Ginger's inspection.

                                SARAH
                      What do you think?

        Sarah hold up another one.

                                SARAH
                      How about this?

                                GINGER
                      Great.

                      You're a big help.

                      I hate the beige one.

        Sarah gathers up the blouses and walks out.

                                SARAH (V.O.)
                      This guy's probably a schmuck
                      and I don't care what I wear.

        A couple of BEATS, and she's back in the doorway with
        a concerned expression.

        An unmarked car with a clamp-on light and siren blaring
        screeches to the curb behind two marked black-and-whites
        in front of a funky Venice apartment building.  A small
        crowd  is gathered around the front steps.  LIEUTENANT
        ED VUKOVICH, Homicide Division, gets out of the car and
        strides through the crowd.  He's fiftyish, short, but
        square and solid, a human bulldog gone a little to paunch.
        He chews Juicy Fruit gum like a maniac: a chain-chewer.
        He's homely as an old boot.  And he's not a smart cop, he's
        a wise one; rarer still.  The onlookers, gathered patiently
        for their ten second glimpse of something under a sheet,
        separate for him to pass.

        CAMERA PANAGLIDES AHEAD OF VUKOVICH, as he climbs the switch-
        back staircase two steps at a time.  He passes TWO UNIFORMED
        COPS at the doorway of a second-floor apartment, and enters
        to find a quiet flurry of activity.  Several DETECTIVES and
        a PHOTOGRAPHER prowl around, taking evidence, taking pictures.

        In the center of the living room floor is the body of a
        young woman, crumpled face down in a small lake of blood.
        Two bags of groceries lie split open on the floor in front
        of her.

        Vukovich glances up as he is joined by DETECTIVE SGT.
        TRAXLER.  Traxler is black, lean and very jaded.

                                VUKOVICH
                      Give me the short version.

                                TRAXLER
                      Six shots at less than ten
                      feet.  Weapon was a large
                      caliber--

        Vukovich is looking at the body.

                                VUKOVICH
                      No shit.

        Traxler turns to a passing DETECTIVE.

                                TRAXLER
                      Come on. man.  Don't track
                      it all over.  It's un-
                      professional.

        He turn back to Vukovich, gesturing at the body.

                                TRAXLER
                           (continuing)
                      Okay, let's see...Got a pos-
                      itive on her.  She's Sarah

                           (interrupting)
                      That can't be right.  That's
                      the name of the one Valley
                      Division mopped up this after-
                      noon.

        Traxler slips something off his clipboard and hands
        it to the Lieutenant.

                                TRAXLER
                      Here's her driver's license.

                           (pondering)
                      You gotta be kidding me.  The
                      new guys'll be short-stroking
                      it over this one.  A one-day

        Ginger enters, stopping beside their phone answering machine.

                      Not lately.  Did you check

        She checks under the couch, then behind the drapes.  She
        bends down.

        C.U. - PUGSLEY, as the GREEN IGUANA cocks its head, blinking
        vapidly.

        RESUME WIDE, Sarah lifts the three foot long lizard from his
        perch on the windowsill.  She gives the complacent reptile
        a kiss on its blunt snout.

                      Totally nauseating.

        Sarah drapes the lizard across her shoulders where it sits
        contentedly as she looks for her purse.  Ginger has been
        rewinding the message tape.  She punches PLAY and a MALE
        VOICE is heard.

                      it looks like I won't be able
                      to make it tonight.  I'm really
                      sorry.  Call you in a day or so.
                      Sorry.  'Bye.

                      That bum.  So what if he has
                      a Porsche, he can't treat you
                      like that...it's Friday night

                      I'll break his kneecaps.

                      that's me, or Sarah will get back
                      to you.  Wait for the beep.

        As the message plays, CAMERA DOLLIES OFF the phone machine
        and down the corridor of the dark apartment.  As the bedroom
        door draws near, Ginger's recorded voice fades and is super-
        ceded by CRIES and MOANS.

        FULL SHOT, framed against the streetlit curtains, Ginger and
        Matt from a beautiful tableau of lovemaking in silhouette.
        Their perfect bodies glisten with backlight as they strain
        in passion.

        CLOSER - TIGHT TWO, revealing that Ginger is wearing her
        earphones.  Matt, without breaking rhythm, reaches out to
        the night table and thumbs the volume higher.

        Ginger cries out louder, apparently enjoying his sure touch
        on her volume control.

                      be the goddamned 'Phone Book

                                TRAXLER
                      I hate the press cases.
                      Especially the weird press
                      cases.  Where you going?

                      To make a statement. I'm gonna
                      give them the name.  Maybe the

        He looks at his watch, then straightens his tie.

                      call us.

                      woman earlier today...

        CUT WIDE to show Sarah watching the TV which is suspended
        over the bar.  The place is a crowded, post-movie hangout,
        raucous with laughter and videogames.  The newscast
        continues, ignored by all except Sarah.

                      pronounced dead at the scene in

        A customer gestures for the bartender's attention.

                      Hey, can we change this and

        Sarah leaves her half-finished pizza and beer, getting up
        in a daze.  Followed by puzzles glances, she makes her way
        through the crowd.

        In the crowded hallway by the restrooms, Sarah goes to the
        single payphone and seizes the directory.  She flips rapidly
        through it, then stops, looking down.
        She sees that her name is next on the list.
        The book slips out of her fingers.
        Sarah turns and scans the crowd.
        She's getting looks, covert and otherwise, like any unaccom-
        panied girl on a Friday night.  But is that all they mean?

        Sarah back into the women's restroom.

        She splashes her face with cold water.  In the mirror
        her terrified reflection looks back.  Why me?
        She hears a loud clatter and spins around.
        It's just a drunken woman fumbling with a toilet stall door.
        Sarah edges back out into the corridor.

        sidewalk.  As she passes a figure leaning against the wall
        just outside, the man turns his head to watch her.
        It is Reese, his gaze impassive.
        Streetlight catches the burn scar on his cheek.
        He is motionless, sinister in his long coat.
        Sarah shudders.
        She walks on.

        POV - SARAH, ON CROWD, moving toward and through approaching
        groups of pedestrians.  They seem to be glancing at her.
        Was it always like that and she just never noticed?

        C.U. - SARAH as she look over her shoulder.

        POV - SARAH, ON PIZZA PARLOR DOORWAY.  Reese is gone.
        She resists the urge to run.
        On the opposite side of the street an  LAPD cruiser glides
        slowly by.  Sarah is about to call out but a bus blocks
        her view and when it had passed, the car is turning away
        down a side street.

        She passes a large window with STOKER'S written on it, and
        ducks quickly through the door.

        Her knuckles clench white as he reaches the entrance and
        walks by, unhurriedly, without a glance inside.
        She turns and scan the gloomy interior, which reveals itself
        to be less than savory.  Pool tables and upper-middle lowlife
        in submarine depths of smoky haze.

        Sarah draws stares, menacing in their own right, as she
        weaves between the pool tables to the back of the bar.
        her hands are trembling as she drops a dime in the pay
        phone and dials.

        around, fear feeding on frustration.

        radio.

        The car pulls out with lights and siren on.
        A moment later, Terminator rounds the corner of the building
        and climbs the stairs to the entryway.
        He surveys the bank of call buttons, then turns to consider
        the barred security gate.

        PANAGLIDE WITH GINGER as she ties her terry-cloth robe and,
        leaving Matt in a dead sleep, pads through the dark apartment.
        Down the hall, past the phone with Traxler's message.
        Through the dark living room.
        She has her Walkman in the pocket of her robe and bops to
        herself in the silent gloom as she enters the kitchen.

        When she opens the refrigerator to remove snack fixings, the
        light briefly illuminates the kitchen and in that moment,
        SOMETHING MOVES in the F.G.

        TIGHT ON GINGER, MOVING WITH HER as she backs toward the
        counter with her arms full of snack stuff.

        A SUDDEN CRASH.  A flurry of motion behind her.
        She spins, dropping half her load.
        Ginger fumbles for the lightswitch.

        Revealing Pugsley, sitting there blinking innocently among
        overturned spice bottles on the counter-top.

                                GINGER
                      Shoo.  Go on.  I'll make a
                      belt out of you.

        Pugsley disappears into a large fern by the window and Ginger
        sets about her task, slathering crunchy peanut butter on
        stalks of celery.

        MEDIUM ON MATT, as rustling curtains play patterns of street-
        light over his sleeping face.
        The sound of a faint breeze.
        In the B.G. is the balcony, empty.  The sliding door is open.

        TIGHT ON MATT, as his eyes open at the sound of a quiet,
        repeated CLICKING.

        UP ANGLE - PAST MATT, as the five-inch blade of an industrial
        razor-knife reaches full extension in Terminator's hand,
        right above him.
        It slashes viciously downward.
        Matt rolls and the pillow is SLIT OPEN where his throat had
        been.

                                MATT
                      Whoah!

        Terminator catches him by the hair and slashed down again.
        Matt grabs the wrist in both hands.
        The enormous muscles of his arms, which seem capable of bench
        pressing a Chrysler, strain and knot against the pressure of
        the killer's single arm...
        And still the blade moves closer to his throat.

        With a final heave Matt deflects the down-pressure sideways
        and the blade snaps with a CLINK against the headboard.

        HANDHELD WITH MATT as he rolls off the bed, spins and slams
        his fists together into Terminator's temple.  He picks up a
        brass deco lamp and brings it down with piledriver force.

        Unperturbed, Terminator knocks the lamp away and hurls Matt
        over the bed.

        and hurls himself upon the intruder.
        The titans CRASH INTO A DRESSER, reducing it to kindling.
        Then into the closet door, EXPLODING THE FULL-LENGTH MIRROR.

        Terminator places one hand on either side of Matt's barrel
        chest.  SINKS HIS FINGERS INTO THE FLESH.  An inhuman grip.
        Matt is raised off the floor, contorted with agony, above
        the other's head.

        a plate full of celery stalks and a glass of milk.  CAMERA
        passes the closed bedroom door and STOPS, as Ginger pauses
        to set the plate on top of the glass, freeing one hand to
        open the door.

        AN EXPLOSION OF SPLINTERS in close F.G. as a shape smashes
        through the door right in front of her...Matt's body
        propelled halfway through the door by enormous force.
        Ginger shrieks and leaps back, flinging milk and all into
        the air.

        The door begins to open the pressure of Matt's body
        creates resistance.
        Ginger SCREAMS and back away.

        The door is wrenched open and Terminator steps through with
        the massive .45 drawn.

        HANDHELD WITH GINGER, the walls blur by as she runs.

        TIGHT ON TERMINATOR as the pistol RISES INTO FRAME, aligning
        with his eyes.  BOOM!

        LOW FAST DOLLY WITH GINGER as the bullet punches into her
        shoulder, pitching her on her face outside the bathroom door.

        LOW WIDE ANGLE as she crawls forward, gasping, drowning.
        The implacable figure looms behind her.
        Her expression is agony and reeling, nauseating terror.
        And incomprehension: Why am I suddenly dying?
        Her eyes roll, showing the whites, like a horse tethered in
        a burning stable.

        as she pulls herself into the bathroom.
        She clutches the rim of the toilet.

        LOW ANGLE PAST HER, ON TERMINATOR, as he stands behind her.
        PAN UP, off her.  He takes aim.
        And empties the clip.
        He calmly reloads.

        ensuing silence.
        Terminator spins, drawing an instantaneous bead on the source
        of the sound, but doesn't fire.

                      Machines need love too...

        Terminator turns abruptly back to Ginger's body.  He turns
        it over, assuring himself that she is dead.

                                GINGER'S VOICE

                      Wait for the beep.

        There is a loud tone and the incoming call is heard.

                           (on machine)
                      Ginger, this is Sarah...

        Terminator's head snaps back and he freezes, listening.
        He rises slowly as Sarah's voice continues.

        TIGHT ON HIS UNBLINKING EYES.

                                SARAH'S VOICE
                           (on machine, contin-

                      Stoker's on Pico but I'm too

        Sarah cups the telephone's mouthpiece with her hand and
        glances around frequently.

                      It's Stoker's on Pico. Bye.

        Terminator is rapidly and methodically rifling the contents
        of Sarah's small desk.  SIREN'S WAIL, approaching.
        He picks up a small card.

        E.C.U. - CARD. It is Sarah's college I.D. card, complete with
        color photo of her.

        MACRO ON PICTURE.

        E.C.U. - TERMINATOR'S EYES as he tosses the card down,
        after a fraction of a second's scan.  Picks up something else.

        TIGHT ON SARAH'S ADDRESS BOOK, Terminator pockets this and
        slips out the balcony door.  Climbing over the railing, he
        is gone.

        He hangs up and grabs his coat, motioning to Traxler.

        CLOSER ANGLE as streetlight glare slashes across Terminator's

91      INT. STOKER'S BAR - NIGHT                              91

        The waitress set a cup of coffee in front of Sarah.

                                WAITRESS
                      Anything else?

        Sarah shakes her head "No" and contemplates her trembling
        hands.  She half-turns, catching a glimpse of herself in
        the mirror behind the bar.

        TIGHT ON SARAH, reflected in the mirror.  In the F.G. a
        man at the bar looks up from his beer, straight into her eyes.
        It is Reese.
        He gazes at her coolly for a moment, then glances away.

        C.U. - SARAH, feeling trapped, frantic.

        ANGLE ON FRONT DOOR as it opens and a figure stands silhou-
        etted briefly against a streetlight.

        Reese turns, his eyes flickering to the mirror, the figure.

        C.U. - REESE as he mechanically raises his beer.  His knuckles
        are white.  He slowly undoes the top button of his overcoat.
        There is a glint of metal in the shadows within.
        Reese turns slowly on his barstool as the figure brushes past
        him, out-of-focus F.G.
        Sarah looks up.

        E.C.U. - REESE'S HAND sliding slowly along polished steel,
        a caress.  His finger slips through the triggerguard of the
        riot gun.

        MEDIUM ON SARAH, as the man stops in front of her in close F.G.
        He sits slowly in the booth opposite her.  The angle is OVER
        HIS SHOULDER.

                                SARAH
                           (uncertainly)
                     Lieutenant Vukovich?

        REVERSE ANGLE - It is not Lt. Vukovich.
        Terminator sits motionless for a BEAT.
        Blue eyes so pure and deep.  The eyes of a saint, perhaps.

        The .45 is out and cocked and AIMED DIRECTLY AT CAMERA, almost
        in one motion.
        The bore seems enormous.

        BACK ON SARAH, over the gun barrel, her eyes go wide.  We hold
        a BEAT, like a frozen slice of nightmare.

        MEDIUM ON REESE as he whips the riot-gun to a hip-firing posi-
        tion, his overcoat falling back with a snap.  HE FIRES.

        ON TERMINATOR, as the shotgun blast hits his arm and he FIRES,
        simultaneously.  Sarah screams as the .45 round blows stuffing
        out of the booth seat inches from her face.  Her hair is
        singed by burning gunpowder.  An involuntary cry is punched
        out of her by the double concussions.

        Reese is stroking up another shell as Terminator half-rises
        from booth.

        OVER REESE'S SHOULDER, as he fires, cocks the slide, fires
        again, advancing on Sarah's booth.
        Terminator is blown backward over the center divider,
        crashing through the glasses and pitchers of beer on the
        table opposite, and onto the floor.

        Sarah is screaming, scrunched down in the booth.

        Terminator is lying on his back at the feet of a table-
        full of drunk patrons.
        He has two rifled 12 gauge slugs in his chest and one
        in the arm.

        The bar customers are frozen in the weird tableau, cowering,
        gaping.
        Sarah stops screaming.
        Reese stand motionless, gun aimed.
        In the sudden silence, the sound of him cocking the shotgun
        is abnormally loud.

        ON TERMINATOR, very still.
        Then he smoothly rolls to a crouch and slips the UZI machine
        pistol from beneath his overcoat, where it has been hang-
        ing on a shoulder strap.
        He doesn't seem too impaired as he swings around to fire.

        Reese rolls like a cat and comes up firing.
        A burst from the UZI rakes the bar where he stood.
        An orgy of shattering glass.
        Total pandemonium.

        SEVERAL ANGLES  as patrons of the bar run, scream or dive
        for cover, depending upon their level of intelligence.

        Reese slides through the glass to Sarah's booth and seizes
        her wrists.

        ON TERMINATOR, kneeling amid the chaos, raising the UZI
        one-handed.

        Reese tugs viciously on Sarah's arm and she sprawls across
        the booth seat a moment before the divider and seat cushion
        erupt with hits from the UZI.

        ANGLE ON A RUNNING PATRON as a burst of 9mm fire catches
        him in the chest.  He pitches into Sarah's booth, pinning
        her.

        Reese fires, ducks, fires again.
        Tables crash over.
        A window is blown out.
        A table candle rolls into a pool of high-proof alcohol
        behind the bar.
        It ignites with a WHOOSH.

        Reese feed two shells into the riot-gun.

        TIGHT ON TERMINATOR, an island of slow, precise movement
        amid the confusion.  He drops a spent clip.  Reaches for
        another with his bloody hand.

        MOVING WITH REESE as he vaults the row of booths and starts
        firing.  At point blank range he unloads the shotgun into
        Terminator's belly.

        The roaring fire behind the bar is spreading very quickly.
        The air is thick with smoke.
        Reese tosses the UZI, for which he has no ammo, into the
        fire.  He hauls the dead man off Sarah and reaches for her.

        TIGHT ON SARAH, shrinking away from Reese, hysterical.
        When he grabs her wrist she struggles, eyes wide.

        C.U. - REESE, very intense.

                                REESE
                     Come with me if you want
                     to live.

        She looks where he is pointing.

        glass rains from him, except where it sticks to his blood-
        drenched shirt and coat.

        C.U. - TERMINATOR, as he slowly look up, his blue eyes
        riveting STRAIGHT INTO THE CAMERA.

        through the cluttered kitchen, then down a narrow back
        hallway.  Sarah stumbles and Reese brutally pulls her to
        her feet without slowing.

        He hits a closed door, which crashes open.
        Hauls Sarah through, into another corridor.
        Slams and blot-latches it.
        An instant later an impact from the far side tears the
        latch-screws half out of the wall.

        down the narrow hallway.  He clears the outer door an
        instant before the tongue of flame roars out into the alley.

        TWO LAPD UNITS arrive behind them.  He motions to the

        dark alley.  Sarah stumbles over trashcans.
        Reese pulls her along mercilessly.

        WHIP-PANNING as they clear a corner.
        The B.G. is a blur.

        Behind them Terminator is moving with inhuman speed,
        bounding like a panther, leaping trash cans and other
        obstacles.

        TRACKING C.U. - TERMINATOR, catching the faintest glimpse
        of a red glow in the pupils of his eyes as he passes through
        total shadow.

        We know this is Terminator's POV because Sarah and Reese
        are just ahead of us.  But the image is bizarre, alien.
        Bright and hyper-real.  There is a hint of digitization,
        and the fleeing figures ahead are more luminous than the
        background, suggesting infra-red.
        The margins of the FRAME are crammed with columns of CRT-
        type characters: columns of numbers and acronyms.  The
        data changes more rapidly than any human eye could follow.
        There is no doubt that we are seeing as a machine would see.
        The sound effects are bright and clear, as if they are
        digitized and enhanced as well.

        Reese and Sarah turn a corner by caroming off the wall
        without slowing and pelt down a narrower alley.  This
        one is lined with a row of parked cars and connects to
        the street.  There is little room to run.
        Reese is reloading on the run, dropping shells.

        Behind them Terminator enters the alley, gaining.

        LOW ANGLE, FAST PANAGLIDE ahead of the fleeing pair.
        As they breast the last car Reese shoves Sarah hard,
        pitching her on her face to the pavement.
        He flings open the car door...a shield.
        Drops to the ground.
        Fires into the gas tank of a car further back in the row
        just before Terminator reaches it.

        The car EXPLODES, filling the alley with fire.  An inferno
        funneled between the enclosing walls.

        ANGLE ON REESE AND SARAH behind the car door as flames
        roar over the hood.

        ON TERMINATOR, as he slides to a stop, cut off by the
        wall of flame.

        Reese doesn't waste any time stuffing Sarah into the car.
        Climbing in after and over her he twists two wires together
        and we recognize it as his stolen GREY SEDAN.
        The engine catches.

        A SILHOUETTE rockets out of the flames.
        Terminator, leaping from the roof of the blazing car ahead,
        impacts on the hood of Reese's car.  His hair and coat are
        burning.

        The car backs down the alley.
        Terminator draws back his fist.
        Punches into the windshield.
        Inside, Sarah is sprayed with glass as the killer's fist
        shoots through.
        The lacerated fingers grope for her.

        WIDE as the car shoots backwards out of the alley onto the
        street, narrowly missing an arriving LAPD CRUISER.

        Sarah plasters herself tightly into the seat as the
        fingers grasp her blouse and pull.

        Terminator rolls down off onto the pavement.
        Reese's car shoots forward.

        PANNING WITH SEDAN as it roars past Vukovich, the gathering
        minions of the burning building, an arriving fire
        truck...shoots through a red light and continues to accel-
        erate.

        Terminator gets to a kneeling position, then slowly stands.
        He pats out his smoldering clothing as he watches his quarry

        Reese drives with total, nerveless absorption.  His eyes
        flick to the mirror, to the road, over his shoulder, back
        ...and the world spins outside.
        With occasional glances to Sarah, he speaks to her in a

        He reaches over and runs his hands over her arms, legs,
        chest.  Sarah flinches.
        She feels the BLIND PANIC BOILING UP WITHIN HER.
        She pushes his hand away and opens the door.

        The walls of a narrow alley, inky black, frame a police
        cruiser parked on the street beyond.  Firelight from the
        back of Stoker's lights the street garishly.
        A young cop  stands beside the car talking via radio with
        the mike cord pulled through the side window.  He speaks

        strides purposefully toward the cop, CAMERA following.

        The officer whirls and reaches for his gun but Terminator
        flings him brutally into the side of the car, steps over
        him and opens the door.
        Before getting in he notes the unit number on the roof: 143.
        Then he slides behind the wheel, slips the squad car into
        gear, and pulls out.

                      Alright.  Listen.
                      The Terminator's an infil-
                      tration unit.  Part man, part
                      machine.  Underneath, it's a
                      hyperalloy combat chassis,
                      mircoprocessor-controlled,
                      fully  armored. Very tough...

        He pauses as they slide around another corner.

        Reese's sedan glides out onto a main drag, very subdued.
        He turns the lights on and blends with traffic.
        The helicopter crosses laterally in the distance.

                      But outside, it's living
                      human tissue.  Flesh, skin,
                      hair...blood.  Grown for the
                      cyborgs.

                                SARAH
                      Look, Reese, I know you want
                      to help, but...

                           (cutting her off)
                      Pay attention.  The 600
                      series had rubber skin.
                      We spotted them easy.  But
                      these are new.  They look
                      human.  Sweat, bad breath,
                      everything.  Very hard to
                      spot.  I had to wait 'til
                      he moved on you before I
                      could zero him.

                                SARAH
                      Hey, I'm not stupid, y'know.
                      They can't build anything like
                      that yet.

                                REESE
                      No.  Not yet.  Not for about
                      forty years.

        Reese is driving sedately for a low profile, but his eyes
        rove constantly, searching for a place to ditch the car.
        Sarah's eyes are alert as well, and her tone becomes a bit
        too cool.

                                SARAH
                      So, it's from the future, is
                      that right?

                                REESE
                      One possible future.  Four your
                      point of view.  I don't know the
                      tech stuff.

                                SARAH
                      And you're from the future too?

                                REESE
                      Right.

        They come to a red light and Reese stops.

                                SARAH
                           (patronizingly)
                      Right...

        Like a shot she unlatches the seatbelt, pulls the door lock
        and has the door half open before Reese can react.  He catches
        her arm and hauls her struggling back into the car.

        Sarah sinks her teeth into his hand with all her strength.
        His grip doesn't slacken.
        Slowly, without releasing her, he reaches across with his
        other hand and shuts the door.  His face shows no reaction.

        Sarah draws back and stares at the blood running down his
        arm from the bite, that at his grim, scarred face.  The
        light turns green and Reese drives on.
        Sarah tastes blood and wipes her mouth.

                                REESE
                           (coldly)

                      do.  Don't...do that...again.

        He wipes his hand on his pants.

                                SARAH
                           (weakly, plead-

                      Just let me go.

                           (slow, but intense)
                      Listen.  Understand.  That
                      Terminator is out there.  It
                      can't be reasoned with, it can't
                      be bargained with...it doesn't
                      feel pity of remorse or fear...
                      and it absolutely will not stop.
                      Ever.  Until you are dead.

        Sarah slump in utter resignation.

                                SARAH
                           (quietly)
                      Can you stop it?

        Reese doesn't look at her.

                                REESE
                      Maybe.  With these weapons...
                      I don't know.

        It passes a grey sedan with a shattered windshield.

        He has firm hold of her arm but she seems to be cooperating.
        In the B.G., the chopper hovers, on the far side of the lot.
        Reese approaches the door of a late model brown Buick which
        has been left with its window partway down.
        He unlocks it and they slip inside.

        Reese uses the butt of the shotgun to smash loose the
        ignition assembly.  He begins working on the wires.  A
        police cruiser appears, moving slowly between the rows of
        cars.

        Reese grabs Sarah and pulls her down to huddle below dash
        level.  A moment later a spotlight flashes across the seats
        above them.  They hear the helicopter circling closer.

                                SARAH
                      Reese...why me?  Why does
                      it want me?

        They are lying very close, a forced intimacy.  Reese's voice
        is an urgent whisper, almost in her ear.  A cruiser passes
        so close they can hear its radio clearly.

                      beginning.

                      microsecond...extermination.

        Reese pauses, and when he continues it's less like a military
        briefing, quieter.

        her a ten digit number etches on the skin of his forearm.
        Beneath the numbers is a pattern of lines like the auto-

                      forever...

        The helicopter moves overhead.  Its searchlight illum-

        sound fads, Reese starts the car.

        Sarah, huddles in a blanket, is siting on a bench opposite
        Vukovich's desk.  Motionless.  Her eyes are fixed on the
        middle distance.  She's been crying.  Now she's emptied out.

        The door opens.
        At the sound of the latch Sarah jerks as if struck, and cringes
        involuntarily.  Vukovich enters with Traxler and DR. PETER
        SILBERMAN, a criminal psychologist.  Silberman is smooth
        of skin and manner, young, ambitious and...fat.  He is
        enthusiastic about the workings of the human psyche, as
        emotionally involved as someone pulling the wings off a fly.

        Vukovich sits beside Sarah and hands her a cup of coffee.
        He puts a paternal arm around her shoulders.

        The room costs five dollars a night and that's steep, but
        the FIRE ESCAPE outside the window adds an element of

                      This is great stuff.  I could

        the bullet-proof glass booth enclosing the NIGHT DESK
        SERGEANT'S counter.  The Sergeant hits a button and there
        is a loud BULL-CLACK.  The electric bolt on the security
        door opens and Silberman steps out.

        As he exits the station, he passes Terminator just coming in
        the front door.  He glances at the pale apparition in cap
        and dark wrap-arounds, but goes on.
        Terminator approaches the Desk Sergeant who barely glances
        up when he speaks.

                                TERMINATOR
                      I'm a friend of Sarah Connor.
                      I was told she is here.  Can

                      You can't see here.  She's
                      making a statement.

                      Look.  It's gonna be a while.

        Terminator steps back, scanning the booth, the electric
        door, the rooms beyond.

                                TERMINATOR
                      I'll come back.

        He turns and walks out through the front doors.

        ANGLE PAST DESK SERGEANT, F.G. - ON FRONT DOORS, the officer
        is absorbed in paperwork, not watching as a pair of lights
        get BRIGHTER outside the doors.  RAPIDLY.  He glances up
        at the last second as the glare falls fully on him.  CRASH!
        Several cops and late night loiterers scatter as a car
        smashes into the foyer.  It blasts through the sergeant's

        wild strobing of electrical fires as Vukovich steps
        out of an armory room.  He tosses Traxler an M-16 and
        they run on.

        Terminator stops before another door.  He BLASTS the lock
        with the riot-gun.  Flings open the door, scanning.
        Moves on.
        He is hit twice, chest and leg.
        Firelight flickers from an office doorway as he passes.

        but it's so tiny.  Behind the desk.  She crouches unable to
        believe she has awakened into the same nightmare.

        Vukovich edges open a door and fires half a clip into
        Terminator's back.  His eyes  bulge as the intruder turns,
        slamming a clip into his rifle and calmly fires two rounds.
        Traxler drags Vukovich's body back inside the room.

        MEDIUM ON SARAH, her teeth are chattering with fear as
        SHOTS echo nearby.  There is the RHYTHMIC THUNDER of the
        shotgun, rattling AUTOMATIC FIRE, SCREAMING, and the sound
        of RUNNING FEET.  Getting closer.

        SLOW DOLLY IN ON SARAH begins, ending in TIGHT C.U. as the
        sounds get louder.  More SHOTS.
        Smoke begins to seep under the door.

        DETAIL - DOORKNOB rattling as it is tried from outside.

        E.C.U. - SARAH stifling a cry.  She flinches as if slapped
        as SHOTS sound.

        DETAIL - DOOR KNOB, a series of SHOTS shatter the lock.

        FULL ON DOORWAY - The door bangs open and a figure stands
        silhouetted in the smoky hallway, holding a pistol.

        E.C.U. - SARAH, as she closes her eyes.  Holds her breath.

                                REESE (V.O.)
                      Sarah?

        FULL SHOT - She scrambles out from beneath the desk and runs
        to him in the thickening smoke.

        Gunfire sounds nearby.  They pass bodies.

        They find the Lieutenant propped in a corner, dying.
        Reese bends toward him.
        Vukovich holds out his custom Colt Python .357.

        FAST PANAGLIDE PRECEDING TERMINATOR as he runs through
        the smoky rooms.  A fire is burning, lighting everything
        a flickering orange.
        He emerges onto a landing through a side entrance.  PAN
        to follow his line of sight as he snaps the AR-180 to
        his shoulder.  B.G. a BLUE VOLKSWAGEN RABBIT is roaring
        away across the parking lot.

        TIGHT ON TERMINATOR aiming carefully.  He pulls the trigger.
        It clicks...empty.  Slowly he lowers the scope-sight from
        his eye and watches them go.

        Terminator limps down the steps from the landing and walks
        away as the fire spreads behind the windows of Division
        Headquarters.

        The Rabbit is stopped on the shoulder of a two lane
        secondary road winding through the hills north of L.A.
        Reese is fishing objects out of the car's trunk and
        handing them to Sarah, who holds a flashlight.
        He hands her a blanket, some road flares, and a first
        aid kit.  Then he slams the trunk.  Reaching through the
        side window, he turns the wheel and pushes the car off
        the shoulder, over the embankment.

        DOWN ANGLE INTO RAVINE, past Sarah and Reese, as the car
        trundles down crashing through the underbrush to dis-
        appear among the trees.

        Reese looks out across the valley and the lights of L.A.
        A helicopter circles in the distance, searchlight on.

        ANGLE LOOKING OUT from the mouth of an enclosed concrete
        storm drain that passes under the road.  Reese, followed
        by Sarah, trudges down the slope and ducks inside.
        The floor is wet but he doesn't seem to mind.
        They both hunker down with their backs to the concrete,
        facing each other.
        They look beaten, grimy, exhausted.
        She huddles under the blanket, waif-like.

                                REESE
                      You cold?

                                SARAH

                      Come here.

        She sits beside him and they wrap their arms around each
        other with the blanket covering both of them.

                                SARAH
                      Reese...you got a first name?

                      Kyle.

                                SARAH
                      Kyle, what's it like when you
                      go through time?

                                REESE
                      White light.  Pain.  Like
                      being ripped inside out...
                      slowly.  Like being born,
                      maybe.

        Sarah scowls and draws her hand out from under his jacket.

                                SARAH
                      You're wet.  Oh my god.

        In the beam of the flashlight her hand is glistening
        with blood.

                                REESE
                      I caught one, back there.

                                SARAH
                           (incredulous)
                      Caught one?  You mean you
                      got shot?

        Reese shrugs.

                                REESE
                      It's not bad.

        Sarah sits up and turns toward him.

                                SARAH
                      We gotta get you to a doctor.

                                REESE
                      It's okay.  Forget it.

                                SARAH
                      Forget it?  Are you crazy?
                      Let me see it.

        Sarah opens his jacket and the flashlight beam shows his
        shirt bloodsoaked at the shoulder.

                                SARAH
                           (continuing)
                      Jeez.  You idiot.  Take
                      this off.

        She cradles the flashlight between her knees and opens
        the first aid kit as he removes his jacket.

                                REESE
                           (looking at the
                           wound)
                      See.  Missed everything.
                      Passed through the meat.

        Sarah starts swabbing the flesh wound.

                                SARAH
                      This is gonna make me puke.
                      Talk about something.

                                REESE
                      What?

                                SARAH
                      Just talk.  Tell me about
                      my son.  Is he tall?

        She places a gauze pad in place and starts to wrap it.

                                REESE
                      About my height.  He
                      has your--
                           (winces)
                      ...damn...he has your
                      eyes.

        Sarah glances at his face for a second and then goes back
        to work.

                                SARAH
                      What's he like?

                                REESE
                           (thoughtful)
                      You trust him.  He's got that
                      strength.  You'd die in a
                      second for John.

                                SARAH
                      Well, at least I know what
                      to name him.  I don't suppose
                      you'd know who the father is?
                      So I don't tell him to get
                      lost when I meet him.

                                REESE
                      John never said much about
                      him.  He dies.  Even before
                      the war...

                                SARAH
                           (interrupting)
                      Stop!  I don't want to know.
                      Hold still.  So...it was John
                      that ordered you here?

                                REESE
                      I volunteered.

                                SARAH
                      You volunteered?

                                REESE
                      It was an honor.  A chance
                      to meet the legend.  Sarah
                      Connor.  Who taught her son
                      to fight...organize, prepare.
                      From when he was a kid.  When
                      you were in hiding, before
                      the war.

        She stops taping.  She seems lost, her bravado dissipated.

                                SARAH
                      You talk about things I haven't
                      done yet in the past tense.  It's
                      making me crazy.  I can't think.
                           (pause)
                      Are you sure you've got the
                      right person?

        Reese appraises her coldly.

                                REESE
                      I'm sure.

                                SARAH
                      Come on, me? The mother
                      of the future?  Am I tough?
                      Organized?  I can't even balance
                      my checkbook.  I cry when I see
                      a cat that's been run over...
                      and I don't even like cats.

        She pulls the bandage tight with a knot.

                                REESE
                      Ow!  No, it's okay.  It's
                      better tight.

                                SARAH
                      And anyway, what do I know
                      about guerrilla warfare?

                                REESE
                      You'll learn.

                                SARAH
                           (angry)
                      Look, Reese, I didn't ask for
                      this honor and I don't want it.
                      Any of it.

                                REESE
                      John gave me a message for
                      you.  Made me memorize it.
                      'Sarah"...this is the message...
                      'Sarah, thank you.  For your
                      courage through the dark years.
                      I can't help you with what you
                      must soon face, except to tell
                      you that the future is not set...
                      there is no such thing as Fate,
                      but what we make for ourselves
                      by our own will.  You must be
                      stronger than you imagine you
                      can be.  You must survive, or I
                      will never exist.'  That's all.

        Sarah stares at him as the enormity of it all becomes real
        to her.  Reese moves his arm, testing the bandage.

                                REESE
                           (continuing)
                      Good field-dressing.

                                SARAH
                           (brightening)
                      You like it?  It's my first.

        He rebuttons his shirt and they return to the warmth-

        the night.

                      Sleep.  It'll be light soon.

                           (closing her
                           eyes)
                      Okay.  Talk some more.

                                REESE
                      About what?

                           (murmuring)
                      About where you're from.

        Kyle watches the helicopter circling far in the distance.

                                REESE
                      Alright.

                      You stay down by day, but at
                      night you can move around.
                      The H-K's use infra-red so you
                      still have to watch out.
                      But they're not too bright.
                      John taught us ways to dust them
                      them.  That's when the infiltra-
                      tors started to appear.  The
                      Terminators were the newest,
                      the worst...

        During his monologue we have PANNED into the darkness outside
        and to the helicopter, which flies OUT OF FRAME, leaving
        black.  A ROTOR ROAR fades up.

        Black sky.  Stars.
        With a roar an AERIAL PATROL CRAFT enters close overhead.
        It has flashing red and blue lights and powerful search-
        lights which stab down.

        TILT DOWN

        to a vista of moonlit devastation.
        White ash blows in drifts among fire-gutted ruins.
        Blackened bones lie everywhere in heaps.
        Searchlights sweep the night.
        Another aerial unit hovers several blocks away, firing
        tracers into the ruins.

        as a gleaming chrome H-K grinds through the debris of the
        shattered street on its tank-like tracks, crushing burnt
        skulls.
        Its head turns slowly, playing high-intensity lights over the
        buildings.
        Its hydraulic arms are folded, mantis-like, against its
        'torso'.  After it passes a number of human figures dart

        Reese is among a SQUAD OF MEN in black fatigues, carrying
        equipment and energy rifles, who enter a debris-littered
        tunnel.

        PANAGLIDE WITH THEM as they trot through a labyrinth of
        tunnels, pass several guard-posts.  Reese has a GERMAN
        SHEPHERD on a short leash.

186     INT. PARKING STRUCTURE - NIGHT                         186

        The platoon enters a cavernous chamber, an old parking
        structure, in which a large group is gathering.
        As the entrance, ARMED SENTRIES with dogs are passing in
        new arrivals: men wearing mismatched uniforms or rags and
        carrying all types of weapons from lasers to shotguns.
        Weapons are left at the sentry post.

        FOLLOWING REESE as he patrols the perimeter.
        He walks along a row of CARS, models from the eighties and
        nineties, now stripped, rusty and modified to carry weapons.
        There are conventional military vehicles as well.
        He passes several family groups.
        Gaunt kids are huddles around an old TV SET.
        Its glow bathes them.

        REVERSE ANGLE reveals that the set has been gutted and a
        small cookfire crackles inside the shell.
        Nearby a kid has a LARGE RAT cornered and is whacking it
        with a stick.

        Reese pauses at the end of the row of vehicles and unsnaps
        a pocket in his tunic, removing a small paper rectangle,
        a worn photograph.

        C.U. - REESE, gazing down.  His head snaps around at the
        sudden sound of BARKING.

        ANGLE ON SENTRY POST as the dogs go crazy.

                                SENTRY
                           (shouting)
                      Terminator!

        An innocuous, RAG-DRESSED MAN flips back his poncho to
        reveal a powerful PLASMA-RIFLE.  He opens FIRE, running
        forward.  ENERGY BOLTS rip into the crowd.

        MOVING WITH REESE, running toward the Terminator.

        RAPID CUTS:

        POWERBOLTS EXPLODE among the fleeing people.
        Beams sear the darkness.
        A running CHILD is BURST by a plasma hit.

        ANGLE ON REESE running.  He levels his energy-rifle and
        starts firing.  A powerbolt grazes his cheek, EXPLODING
        a support column behind him.  Part of the ROOF COLLAPSES
        as Reese tumbles.

        Everything is lit as if by lightning.

        C.U. - REESE, semi-conscious.  Burned.  Bleeding.
        Impressions implode on him: running feet, flashes, energy
        beams raking the ground leaving molten worm-tracks, scream-
        ing, a burning dog howling.

        DETAIL - The picture Reese has been looking at has fallen,
        forgotten.  It catches fire and starts to curl.  Before
        the image vanishes we see that it is a picture of Sarah.

        Reese looks up.
        A figure looms above, a silhouette in the smoky, hellish
        glare.  THE TERMINATOR.  Its  eyes glow red.

        A brilliant EXPLOSION WHITES OUT THE SCREEN.

187     INT. CULVERT - DAWN                                    187

        C.U. - SARAH, brightly lit by daylight.  Asleep.  She grimaces
        and groans.
        In the distance a dog is barking.

        Reese, still holding her, lightly lifts her hair from her
        face.  An uncharacteristically tender gesture.  He gently
        caresses her cheek with the backs of his fingers.  When
        she awakens suddenly he snaps his hand away.

        Sarah looks around, momentarily disoriented.  Looks up at
        Reese.

                                SARAH
                      I was dreaming about dogs.

        Reese extricates himself from her and steps out of the
        culvert.

                                REESE
                      We used them to spot Terminators.

        Sarah groans as she straightens her legs.

                                SARAH
                      Your world...it's pretty
                      terrifying.

        stop an approaching car.  She pulls his gun hand down with
        both of hers.

                                SARAH
                      Put that away.  I'll get one.

        She hold out her thumb to passing traffic.
        Reese watches this incomprehensible ceremony skeptically.

                                SARAH

        Reese and Sarah are crammed into the cab of a beat-to-hell
        PICKUP TRUCK with the DRIVER, obviously a surfer.  Laid-
        back, long-haired and well-tanned.
        Reese glowers and watches the scenery through slitted eyes.

                                DRIVER
                      ...and when it breaks right
                      off the point they get some
                      pretty rad tubes up there.

                      night.  I gotta stop and

        They pull off the highway toward a gas station/rest area.

190     EXT. SERVICE STATION - DAY                             190

        The gas station is like an oasis of clutter in a rolling
        stretch of meadows and woods.  It consists of a bunker-
        like building with restrooms and a flanking PICNIC AREA,
        beyond which are WOODS.
        People sit under the trees, enjoying the beautiful day
        while children tear around after the forced inactivity of
        a long trip.

        The three of them get out on unsteady legs.

                      Let's get cleaned up, Kyle.

        She heads for the WOMEN'S RESTROOM and Kyle follows her
        inside.

                                REESE
                           (pushing him out)
                      Yours is over there.

        Instead of following her directions to the Men's Room,
        Kyle wanders toward the drinking fountain.  A bunch of
        kids are running around and throwing water at each other
        with paper cups.

        Reese shambles through them like a zombie.
        He stands among the children, an alien in this land without
        fear.  He watches people at picnic tables laughing and
        listening to portable music.  Kids squeal.  Dogs bark.

                                LITTLE GIRL (V.O.)
                      Can you get my balloon?

        DOWN ANGLE on an achingly beautiful LITTLE GIRL of about
        four.  She points above his head.

        Reese looks up to see a helium-filled mylar balloon stuck in
        the foliage of a tree just above him.  He pulls it down by
        the string and holds it, turning it over dully.

        He crouches down to her eye-level.  She smiles.

                                REESE
                      Aren't you afraid to be out in

                                LITTLE GIRL
                      Huh?

        Reese whirls reflexively at a SCREAM behind him.  The
        mylar balloon bursts in his tense hands.  A teenage girl
        is being doused with water by the boys with plastic jugs.

        The little girl looks at the broken balloon, then glares
        at Reese.  She punches him soundly on the shoulder and
        storms off.

        At this moment she is bowled over by an IRISH SETTER that
        licks her face while she shrieks with laughter.
        Reese seems about to smile but doesn't quite know how to
        go about it.

        Sarah has been idly leafing through the DIRECTORY.  On
        a whim she looks up something.
        She freezes for a moment when she finds the listing.
        Then with a triumphant expression she rips the page out

                                SARAH
                      Reese.  Think it through.
                      We can prevent the war.
                      Nobody else is gonna do it.
                      If we go to anybody official
                      we wind up back in jail and
                      then that walking cuisinart
                      has got us again.  We have to

                      That's not my mission.

                           his manner)
                      Listen.  Understand.  I'm
                      not a military objective,
                      Reese.  I'm a person...
                      You don't own me.

        Reese takes her arm and pulls her to her feet.

                                REESE
                      Let's go.  Time to move out.

                      Fuck you!  Let go of me!

        She jerks her arm free.  He reaches for her again but
        she outdistances him, running.

                                REESE
                           (warning tone)

        She dashes down a footpath among the trees, clutching her
        sign.  Reese follows her into the woods.

                                               CUT TO:


193     EXT. WOODS/CLEARING - DAY                              193

        Only a few yards from the picnic area, the woods take over
        completely.

        PANNING WITH SARAH

        as she runs down the path.
        Reese tackles her from behind and they fall together in
        the long spring grass.
        She struggles violently to get away.

                                SARAH
                      Let...go...bastard...

        She gets one arm free and whacks him hard in the face.
        Reese reacts instinctively, leaping back in a defensive
        crouch.  Sarah freezes when she sees the .357 in his
        hand.

                                SARAH
                           (continuing,
                           scared, but
                           angry)
                      Oh, that's real smart.
                      Go on, shoot me. That's
                      brilliant.

        Reese is trembling as he lowers the gun.
        Sarah too is shaking with emotion.  Tears roll down her
        cheeks and her voice cracks.

                                SARAH
                           (continuing)
                      Jesus Christ, Reese.  Can't
                      you see I'm scared?

        He straightens up and his arms go limp at his sides.
        He turns away.

                                SARAH
                           (continuing)
                      I can't spend my life waiting
                      for that thing to catch up
                      with me...always looking over
                      my shoulder, wondering if I
                      left some tiny clue behind...

        Reese doesn't respond.
        The gun slips from his fingers.
        His will seems to drain from him and he sags to his knees.
        The moment stretches.
        There is only the sunlight moving in shafts through the
        leaves, the sound of a small stream nearby, birds chirping.

                                SARAH
                      Reese?

        She crawls over to him.

        C.U. - REESE

        in profile, with Sarah in B.G.
        His eyes are closed.
        A tear meanders down his cheek.

                      meant to see this...

        He gestures at their surroundings.

                                REESE
                           (continuing)
                      It's...like some dream.
                      This...this...

        He touches the grass, the trunk of a tree.

                                REESE
                           (continuing)

                      ful.  It hurts, Sarah.  More
                      than death.

        He looks are her beseechingly.

                                REESE
                           (continuing)
                      Don't you understand...it's
                      all gone!

        Sarah puts her arm around him.
        She sniffs and wipes at her nose with the back of her hand.

                                SARAH
                      We can change it, Kyle.  We
                      have to try.

        She takes his shoulder in her hands.

                                SARAH
                           (continuing)
                      There's no fate but what we
                      make for ourselves. Right?
                      Come on.  Let's go, kiddo.
                      Whaddya say?

        He picks up her sign and they look at each other for a
        second, then get up.

        Murky.  Claustrophobic.  With knife-slits of hot sunlight.

        MEDIUM ON TERMINATOR

        sitting on the edge of the bed.
        His appearance isn't improving.

        A patch of SCALP is blown away, revealing CHROME underneath.
        A flap of skin dangles from his cheek, which exposes some
        of the DRIVE CABLES which move the lips.
        He is scanning Sarah's address book, turning a page every
        two seconds.

        his eyes tracking rapidly.  His skin is waxy, WHITE, BRUISED,
        GANGRENOUS in places.  He ignores the FEW FLIES crawling
        on his face.

        heading back to the Interstate.  The driver answers her wave
        out the side window.  Reese stops for a moment outside the

        She takes it without thinking as he leaves then realizes
        that she has A LOADED GUN IN HER HAND, without the slightest
        idea of how to use it.  She lays it gently on the dresser.
        As an afterthought, she turns it with one finger so that it
        is pointing the other way.

        Sarah looks through Reese's haul.

                                SARAH
                      Let's see.  Corn syrup.
                      Ammonia.  Moth balls...
                      Mmm.  What's for dinner?

                                REESE
                           (preoccupied)
                      Plastique.

        There are also boxes of shotgun shells, road flares, tape,
        scissors, pans, a strainer and many other odd utensils,
        substances, chemicals.

                                SARAH
                      What's that?

                                REESE
                      Nitroglycerin, basically.
                      Bit more stable.  I learned
                      howto make it when I was a
                      kid.

        Sarah looks a bit stricken as she contemplates the evening
        ahead.

210     INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                                210

        A heartwarming domestic scene.
        Sarah and Kyle have pulled the dresser out to use as a
        worktable.  Pans, packages and bottles clutter the kitchen,
        B.G.  On the table between them are eight ten-inch lengths
        of PLUMBER'S PIPE, threaded each end.  Kyle is showing
        Sarah how to tamp the HIGH-EXPLOSIVE PUTTY into the pipe
        bombs and seal them shut.

                                REESE
                      Make sure there's none on the
                      threads, like this.  Now screw
                      the end-cap on...very gently.


                                SARAH
                      You must have had a fun child-
                      hood.

                                REESE
                      That's good.  Now, seven more
                      like that while I make fuses.

                                SARAH
                      I was thinking, there's so
                      much I've got to show you
                      when we get through this.
                      It's mind boggling, the pos-
                      sibilities...Disneyland, the
                      beach, movies...matinees with
                      popcorn and foot-long hot dogs...

                                REESE
                      Hot dogs?

                                SARAH
                      I want to buy you a hot dog so
                      bad,Kyle...all the things you've
                      never seen and done.  You're here,
                      but wherever you go, and whatever
                      you touch, you bring the war with
                      you.

                                REESE
                      My whole life has been combat.

                                SARAH
                      I want it to be over for you.

                                REESE
                      Not possible.

                                SARAH
                      I want it to be over for me too.
                      I feel like I slipped over some
                      invisible line, that I'm in your
                      world now.  Everything's the same,
                      but I see it differently.
                      It's like, there's you and me,
                      and him...but nobody else can
                      understand or help or even touch
                      us.

        Reese looks up and finally catches her gaze.  He reaches
        out for her hand and it seems he may be taking it to
        comfort her.
        But he turns her wrist to read her watch.

                                REESE
                      We'll head out at 0200.
                      That gives you four hours
                      to sleep if you want.  I'll
                      finish.

211     INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                                211

        ANGLE ON TABLE - The bombs are neatly ranked, finished.
        A nylon satchel lies nearby.  The mess is cleaned up.

        WIDE SHOT reveals Reese sitting in silent vigil at the
        window.  The room is dark, lit only by a streetlight
        outside.
        Sarah is asleep on the bed.

        Reese sits cross-legged, shirtless, his body held rigid.
        The image of discipline.  The .357 is held loosely in one
        hand on his lap.  There is a fresh bandage on his shoulder.

        Sarah wakes up and goes to him in the darkness.  He looks
        at her for a moment as she sits beside him, then back outside.

                                SARAH
                      He'll find us, won't he?

                                REESE
                      Probably.  Sarah, if I get
                      zeroed...

                                SARAH
                      Don't say that.

                                REESE
                      If I do, you have to get away,
                      disappear without a trace.
                      Different country, different
                      name, everything.  In case they
                      send another one.

                                SARAH
                      It'll never be over, will it?
                      Look at me, I'm shaking.
                      Some legend, huh?  You must
                      be pretty disappointed.

                                REESE
                      No.  I'm not.

        Several beats before Sarah speaks again.  Her eyes seem
        luminous in the dark.

                                SARAH
                           (softly)
                      Kyle, the women in your
                      time...what were they like?

                                REESE
                      Good fighters.

                                SARAH
                      That's not what I meant.
                      Was there someone special?

                                REESE
                      Someone?

                                SARAH
                      A girl.  You know.

                                REESE
                           (mechanically)

                           (pause)
                      Never.

        He looks away, outside the window

                                SARAH
                           (softly)
                      I'm sorry.

        Sarah studies him for a moment.
        She's sitting slightly behind him and she puts her hands
        on his shoulders and back, tracing the lines of his scars
        with her fingertips.

                                SARAH
                      So much pain.

                                REESE
                      Pain can be controlled.
                      You disconnect it.

                                SARAH
                      And so you feel nothing.

                                REESE
                      It's better that way.

                                SARAH
                           (with great
                           sympathy)
                      Oh, Kyle.

        Reese takes a long, slow breath before he answers, and when
        he does his voice has a new quality, an unfamiliar tenderness.

                                REESE
                      John Connor gave me a picture
                      of you once.  I never knew
                      why.  It was very old. Torn.
                      Faded.  You were young, like
                      you are now.  You weren't
                      smiling...just a little sad...
                      I always wondered what you
                      were thinking at that second.

        He closes his eyes, reaches toward her.  His fingertips
        trace the contour of her nose, chin, cheeks.

                                REESE
                           (continuing)
                      I memorized every line, every
                      curve...

        He opens his eyes, looking right at hers.

                                REESE
                           (continuing)
                      Sarah, I came across time
                      for you.  I love you.
                      I always have.

        Sarah is quietly overwhelmed.
        Reese looks away.

                                REESE
                           (continuing)
                      I'm sorry.  I shouldn't
                      have said...

                                SARAH
                      Kyle...


        She leans forward and kisses him.
        His face is frozen.  A mask.
        She continues, tenderly.
        He begins to respond.
        The dam breaks and he holds her in a tight, trembling
        embrace, clinging to her like life itself.

        Kyle picks her up and carries her to the bed.
        She kisses his neck and chest, tracing his scars with
        her lips.

        He unbuttons her blouse very slowly.
        Sarah guides his powerful hands over her.

        A SEQUENCE OF CUTS.  DETAILS.  IMPRESSIONS.

        Sarah, a very close angle, as she grimaces in divine agony.
        Reese, his face rapt.
        His hand, clutching the pillow as if to kill it.
        It is explosive, torrential.  A confluence of fate and will.

        TIGHT ON SARAH AND REESE in each other's arms.  Lying
        across his chest, she surveys his face as his eyes close
        drowsily.

                                SARAH
                      I bet you're ticklish.

                      Ticklish?

        Sarah's hand moves OUT OF FRAME.  After a moment Reese
        looks down, puzzled.

                                REESE
                      What are you doing?

                                SARAH
                           (continuing
                           doggedly)
                      You'll beg for mercy in
                      a second.

        Reese seems unperturbed.  Finally he begins to squirm.

                                REESE
                      I don't think I like this.

                                SARAH
                      You're not supposed to.

        Now Reese is becoming desperate.  A grimace spreads across
        his face.  It becomes a grin.  Then he's laughing, trying
        to escape but she won't let him, and they collapse, laughing
        together.
        Sarah gazes at his grin, a glimpse of the Reese that might
        have been, in another life.

        A moment later the grin vanishes at the sound of dogs barking
        outside.
        Reese is off the bed in an instant, crouched tense, eyes
        alert.  Feral as ever.

                                REESE

        The POV approaches a door.  Number 14.

        The door is KICKED OPEN.
        Moving inside.
        The assault rifle sprays the room, exploding the indistinct
        forms on the bed.  Staccato glare.  Approaching the bed.
        Nothing there put the shredded remain of sheets and pillows.

        The POV shifts to the BACK DOOR, which is ajar, and moves
        toward it.  Through the door.  Revealing an EMPTY YARD.

        Terminator turns, looking into CAMERA as a SIZZLING SOUND

        WIDE SHOT - On doorway, from the parking lot, as Terminator

        Terminator lies face down, motionless, F.G., as the debris
        from the blast settles.  A YOUNG GUY ON A HONDA 750 crosses
        the parking lot and stops near him, running forward.
        Terminator starts to get up, moving slowly.

        Reese slides the truck into an ON-RAMP and guns in onto the
        freeway, burying the throttle.  Traffic is light...a few
        18-wheelers.  The truck tops out at 110 and he holds it.
        They flicker rapidly through pools of light and shadow.

        ANGLE OVER REESE'S SHOULDER as they hurtle forward.  An
        interchange flashes by in an instant.

        PACING WITH THE TRUCK, looking back as a single headlight
        arcs radically across all lanes behind them and grows
        BRIGHTER, CLOSING.

        tucked, getting as much speed as possible out of the 750.
        As he GAINS ON THE CAMERA, FILLING FRAME, he unslings the
        assault rifle.  Raises it against the windstream in a one-
        handed pistol grip.

        Colt Python from his coat pocket.  Steering with his elbows,
        he checks the load.  Snaps the cylinder shut.  Glances in
        the rear mirror.  Turns the wheel.

        the pickup, B.G.  The truck swerves suddenly, diving around
        a TRACTOR-TRAILER.  Terminator leans hard to follow.

        LOW WIDE ANGLE preceding the pickup and Terminator as they
        swerve as high speed.  Reese uses the slow semis as static
        obstacles.  He misses them by inches, TIRES SQUEALING.

        ANGLE OVER SARAH'S SHOULDER, through the front window as
        the back of a SEMI-TRAILER hurtles toward them, straight ahead.

        HIGH ANGLE, following both vehicles as Reese feints RIGHT
        and then skids LEFT.  He slides toward the trailer in a
        FOUR-WHEEL DRIFT as Terminator commits to the right.

        M.C.U. - TERMINATOR, over the barrel of the AR, as he FIRES.

        SIDE ANGLE - PASSING TRUCK-TRAILER, bullets strafe across
        it as the pickup vanishes behind.  Terminator skids the
        bike, barely missing an abutment, and is forced onto an
        OFF-RAMP.

        LOW SIDE ANGLE preceding Terminator as he roars down the
        off-ramp without slowing.  Runs the red light at the bottom
        as a hundred miles an hour.  Climbs the ON-RAMP.

        truck.  The angle is past Reese, F.G., on Sarah.
        Terminator appears B.G., converging rapidly as the on-ramp
        joins the freeway.

                                REESE
                      Switch places with me.

        She slides over him while he keeps the hammer down.

        handed.  He FIRES.  ONCE.  TWICE.  AGAIN.

        They enter an interchange.  Ahead lies a LONG, SWEEPING
        CURVE, two lanes wide and elevated.

        Terminator rocks back from a round between the eyes that
        bares metal, the FIRES.

        Bullets rake the pickup.
        The windows are blown out.
        The side mirror explodes.
        Reese is hit.  Drops the .357.

        He FIRES.
        Sarah shrieks as the doorpost next to her head CLANGS WITH
        HITS.

        The short burst EMPTIES THE GUN.
        It CLATTERS TO THE PAVEMENT a moment later, discarded.
        Terminator draws the .38.  Takes aim.

        Sarah SCREAMS.  HITS THE BREAKS HARD.  CRANKS THE WHEEL.
        GLASS behind her EXPLODES with gunfire.

        SWERVING VICIOUSLY the truck SLAMS THE BIKE, sending it
        FLYING INTO A GUARDRAIL.  Terminator goes over the handle
        bars at a hundred miles per hour.

        a body falls beside it, rolling.
        The truck swings in a slow arc.
        TEARS THROUGH THE DIVIDING FENCE.
        Heads back toward her on the wrong side of the freeway.

        She stares in numb horror.
        The nightmare refuses to end.
        She runs to the crippled pickup and sees a front tire flat,
        shredded by a crumpled fender.

        She searches the cab frantically for the KEYS TO THE
        MOTORCYCLES.  Finds them above the sun visor.

        Sarah leaps into the bed of the pickup and attacks the
        motorcycle strap-downs frantically.
        Panting with terror she rolls the bike off the truck.
        It crashes on its side and she falls on it painfully.

        Straining until she CRIES OUT INVOLUNTARILY, she lifts
        it upright.
        KICKS the engine over.

        LOW ANGLE

        as the tanker crashes back through the divider and starts
        UP THE OVERPASS.  Sarah is trapped in that concrete corridor.
        She kicks for her life.
        The bike catches for a moment.  Dies.

        The truck BELLOWS, down-shifting on the curving grade.
        Sarah kicks again and again, crying out with each stroke.
        Again and again, furiously.

        The bike slides to a stop.
        The rearmost set of trailer wheels slams into the guardrail

        Reese crouches in a TRASH-DUMPSTER which is sandwiched
        between the wall and the tanker.  There are only inches
        of clearance as the trailers pass by.

        He lights a PIPE CHARGE, jumps up and wedges it under the
        tank-cylinder of the second trailer.
        He ducks as it rolls on.

        Sarah is stumbling in the glare of the truck's lights.

        E.C.U. - PIPE BOMB, the fuse burning.

        M.C.U. - TERMINATOR, through the windshield, his eye glowing.

        C.U. - REESE huddles in the dumpster.

247/FX  LOW WIDE ANGLE ON SARAH AND TRAILER (PROCESS SHOT)     247/FX

        The REAR TRAILER EXPLODES.  An unbelievable FIREBALL ERUPTS
        SKYWARD, silhouetting Sarah's running figure F.G.
        The dumpster is enveloped by fire and hurled, rolling, down
        the alley.

        Sarah makes it around a corner as the FORWARD TRAILER
        EXPLODES and an OCEAN OF FLAME rolls forward, blasting by her.

        The dumpster topples and Kyle rolls out, surrounded by fire.


248/FX  SEQUENCE - TERMINATOR                                  248/FX

        In the center of the inferno Terminator struggles violently.
        His FLESH FIRES AND SIZZLES.  He tears loose from the
        TWISTED WRECKAGE and collapses to the ground.  Sinks into
        a CHARRED MASS.  STOPS MOVING.

        C.U. - TERMINATOR, mouth open, skull-like, motionless
        in the flames.

        She sees Kyle crumpled face-down near the dumpster, sheltered
        from the heat by its mass.

        She drags his away.  Rolls him over.

        C.U. - REESE, his head lolls.  He opens his eyes

        It would be a wonderful final image.
        Except...TERMINATOR STAGGERS OUT OF THE BLAZE BEHIND THEM.

        M.C.U. - TERMINATOR, the last flakes of flesh are falling
        from him like burning leaves.  His gleaming structure is
        revealed in all its intricacy.  No longer a 'He', but an 'It'.
        It looks like Death rendered in steel.
        A CHROME SKELETON with HYDRAULIC MUSCLES and TENDONS OF
        FLEXIBLE CABLE.  In the sockets of the metal skull, the
        eyeball swivels with a WHIR of tiny servos, both glowing
        red now.

        It turns slowly and fixes its gaze directly INTO CAMERA.

        her mouth.

        FULL SHOT (FX), as the machine takes a step toward them,
        dragging one MALFUNCTIONING LEG.

        PANAGLIDE WITH KYLE AND SARAH as they stagger to their feet
        and run to the nearest building.  They come to a glass door.
        Kyle kicks it in.  Unlatches it.  They enter dark OFFICES
        to the sound of ALARMS and DISTANT SIRENS.

        Sarah and Kyle run down a corridor.
        Through a door, which they close and lock.
        They move off down a cross-corridor.
        The Terminator BLASTS THE DOOR OFF ITS HINGES, F.G., and
        staggers through.  It starts after their receding figures
        as they round the corner at the end of the hall.

        PANAGLIDE PRECEDING THE TERMINATOR as it crashes forward,
        line-of-sight, through the maze.  It splinters partitions.
        Flings desks out of the way.

        FOLLOWING SARAH AND KYLE as they reach a heavy FIREDOOR and
        go through.

256     INT. MANUFACTURING AREA - NIGHT                        256

        Kyle slides the bolts on the metal firedoor.  Behind them
        are acres of machinery in darkness.  Silence.
        CRASH!  The Terminator hits the door from the far side.
        Hinges SQUEAL.

        Kyle goes to a LARGE BREAKER PANEL and opens it.  Starts
        throwing switches.  Behind them, machines START UP ONE BY ONE.

                                SARAH
                           (panting)
                      What are you doing?

                      Cover...our footsteps...

        He sags, sliding down the wall.  She pulls him up.
        Half-carries him into the maze of machines.
        The dark gallery is filled with WHIRRING, CLANKING SHAPES,
        SHATTERING CONVEYER BELTS and improbable mechanisms lashing
        mindlessly.

        Reese slips to the floor and Sarah is no longer able to
        support him.

                                REESE
                           (faintly)
                      Leave me here.

        Sarah crouches beside him.
        Grabs his shirt front.
        Yells over the machines.

                                SARAH
                      I'm not leaving you anywhere
                      you jerk.  Haven't you figured
                      it out?  Kyle, John is our
                      son.

        Reese's eyes refocus.

                                SARAH
                           (continuing)
                      There isn't going to be

                      anybody else.  Listen to
                      me!

        She pauses, then resumes in a commanding, military shout.

                                SARAH
                           (continuing)
                      Move!  Reese! Let's go.
                      Move you ass!

        She drags him to his feet and he staggers on.

        Hinges SHATTER and the firedoor is hurled inward.
        The Terminator scans the darkness.

        ANGLE - PANNING WITH SARAH AND KYLE as they move through
        the machines.

        The cyborg steps forward, scanning methodically.

        Sarah and Kyle move in a crouch through the treacherous
        tangle of pipes and machinery.  Kyle picks up a length of
        pipe to use as a weapon.  As they climb out onto a cat-
        walk between the two huge mechanisms, Sarah clambers over
        an innocuous CONTROL PANEL.
        Her knee inadvertently hits a RED PUSH BUTTON.
        With a ROAR the stamping-plate of a HYDRAULIC PRESS slams
        down an inch from her hand.
        Startled, she tumbles to the catwalk.

        The Terminator's eyes swivel as he hears the single non-
        rhythmic sound.

        Kyle and Sarah run to the end of the catwalk, but find the
        door there locked.

                                SARAH
                      Come on!

        They double back to escape the cul-de-sac.  The Terminator
        steps in front of them, cutting them off.

                                REESE
                           (shouting)
                      Run!

        He pushes Sarah roughly and she stumbles away.
        Kyle raises the pipe with his good arm as the Terminator
        advances.

                                REESE
                           (over his
                           shoulder)
                     Run, damn it!

        She hesitates, backing away.
        The cyborg swings at Reese
        STEEL CLANGS ON STEEL.
        Kyle strikes and parries but is sledgehammered back.

        ANGLE ON CATWALK as Kyle lands in a heap, smashed against
        a stanchion of the railing which prevented him falling to
        the factory floor twenty feet below.

        Sarah turns and runs.

        LOW ANGLE PAST REESE, F.G., as the cyborg approaches him.

        E.C.U. - A FUSE BURNING.

        C.U. - KYLE'S FACE streaked with blood, pressed to the
        floor as a metal foot CLANGS DOWN, F.G.   His eyes snap open.

        Sarah falls, gets up, runs on.
        The Terminator draws back for a death blow.
        And Kyle rolls with the last of his strength, raising
        the pipe bomb he has been cradling.  He jams it between two
        hydraulic cylinders just beneath the cyborg's armored  rib-
        cage.  Then rolls off the catwalk.  Terminator has an instant
        to react, reaching for the bomb, before it EXPLODES.

        Sarah is pitched forward by the blast and slides on the
        floor.
        Slams up against one wall.
        A withering spray of shrapnel strafes the walls around her.
        Pieces of scrap metal clatter throughout the factory, rain-
        ing down.

        C.U. - SARAH, very still.  She winces and opens her eyes.
        Slowly looks up.

        POV - SARAH, as the smoke clears.  The Terminator is GONE.
        Unrecognizable clumps of BURNING DEBRIS lie scattered about.
        Looking down through the grating floor she sees Kyle's
        body.
        LOW ANGLE ON KYLE F.G., Sarah on catwalk above.  Kyle's eyes
        are half-open.  Still.  His face peaceful.
        ANGLE ON ONE OF THE FIRES climbing some plastic tubing and
        triggering a SPRINKLER HEAD.  It begins to rain.
        C.U. - SARAH sitting up as the water runs over her.
        She looks down.  Protruding from her right thigh is a TWISTED
        PIECE OF METAL.  Shrapnel.  Part of the cyborg.  She pulls
        it out, grimacing.  Her leg is broken.

        It is a long time before she can gather the will to move.

        SARAH'S POV - She sees a WALL PHONE several yards away,
        beyond the debris from the explosion.
        She starts to crawl toward it.
        She passes A LARGE CLUMP OF DEBRIS, F.G.

        ANGLE ON DEBRIS (FX) as it rolls over suddenly!
        Now recognizable as the TERMINATOR'S HEAD AND ARMS, with
        half of the scattered torso trailing wires and twisted
        metal.

        IT LUNGES FOR HER!

        Sarah wants to scream this time, from the depths of her
        soul, but there is no scream, only a dry shivering sob.

        The Terminator drags itself SCRAPING over the floor, steel
        fingers clutching.

        Sarah is shaking and whimpering as she scrabbles away,
        crawling in agony.

        ANGLE ON CONVEYOR BELT as Sarah flops from the catwalk
        onto the MOVING STRIP.  She is carried into the intricate
        lattice of equipment.  Sarah rolls off weakly before going
        under a set of sorting rollers.

        ANGLE THROUGH MACHINERY - ON THE TERMINATOR (FX) as it crawls
        after her, dragging its body.  It tracks her unerringly,
        EYES GLOWING.

        Sarah moves deeper into the DARK, CLASHING JUNGLE of machinery.
        Around her is a rain-drenched tangle of CABLES, PIPES and
        unforgiving mechanisms of steel.

        The Terminator clambers through after her.

        C.U. - SARAH - Water pours into her eyes as she catches
        sight of something.  A familiar CONTROL BOX.
        She drags herself toward it.

        C.U. - THE TERMINATOR (FX) - It spots her wedged in a tiny
        crawl space.  No way out.

        It crawls the last few feet,EYES RED IN THE DARK.
        Hypnotized, Sarah watches the Terminator REACHING TOWARD HER.
        She is jammed in a corner.
        Sarah's hand claws around to the front of the control panel,
        seeking the RED BUTTON.

        E.C.U. - HER WET FINGERTIPS FEEL THE BUTTON.

        ANGLE ON THE TERMINATOR (FX), his steel hand reaching out.

        E.C.U. - SARAH, her face inexplicably calm, eyes steady in
        that infinite instant.  She clenches her teeth to keep
        from screaming as she WAITS.

        The Terminator's hand reaches for her throat to crush
        the life out of her and end its long mission.

                                SARAH
                           (voice icy)
                      You're...terminated...fucker!

        E.C.U. - BUTTON, as her bloody finger stabs it down.

        FULL SHOT, showing how the cyborg has been led into the
        MAW OF THE HYDRAULIC PRESS.
        THE STAMPING PLATE THUNDERS DOWN!
        Tons of mechanical pressure flatten the Terminator's head
        and body like tin-foil.  The PRESS SCREAMS, jamming solid.
        Lightning snaps out in one brief blaze, leaping to surround-
        ing machinery, arcing to Sarah's wristwatch.  All the
        Terminator's energy is released in one second.

        ANGLE on the narrow gap between the upper and lower plates:
        a pinpoint of red light DWINDLES AND GOES OUT.
        TIGHT ON SARAH, shivering uncontrollably.  The steel fingers
        are frozen an inch from her throat.  She can only stare as
        water runs over her.

        CLOSE ON the side rail of an ambulance gurney SNAPPING UP
        into position.  Sarah's eyes are closed and she is moved
        OUT OF FRAME.

        WIDE SHOT, showing the gurney being rolled by TWO ATTENDANTS
        past the site of the last explosion.
        SEVERAL POLICE OFFICERS are picking through the debris.

        PANNING WITH THE GURNEY as it is wheeled out, holding on
        TWO FACTORY EMPLOYEES, F.G.
        One, the PLANT MANAGER, bends to examine a piece of the
        cyborg lying at the base of the hydraulic press.
        A COP, B.G., notices this.

                      Look, I told you not to

                      Sure thing, officer.

        He stands and palms a small object to HIS ASSISTANT.  They
        step around the corner.

                                ASSISTANT
                      Weird.  Jap stuff, maybe?

                      Keep it out of sight and

                      anyway, I've got a while yet
                      before you're old enough to
                      understand the tapes.  They're
                      more for me at this point...
                      to help get it all straight.

        COVER SHOT reveals Sarah as the wheel of a dusty landrover
        parked at the pump island of a tiny gas station.  All of
        its signs are in hand-lettered Spanish.  Beyond lies an
        expanse of scrub desert.  The sky scowls with an impending
        storm.

        Sarah speaks quietly into a hand microphone as a dark-
        complected attendant laconically fills her tank.  She
        cradles the cassette recorder in her lap, in the lee of
        her SWOLLEN BELLY.
        She looks to be about SIX MONTHS ALONG.
        Under her down vest she wears a leather shoulder holster
        and the butt of a .357 REVOLVER presses against her
        breast.  She tugs the vest closed as the attendant glances
        her way.  A German Shepherd sits in the back among taped
        boxes and suitcases.

                                SARAH
                           (continuing)
                      Should I tell you about your
                      father?  That's a tough one.
                      Will it change your decision
                      to send him here...knowing?
                      But if you don't send Kyle,
                      you could never be.  God,
                      you can go crazy thinking
                      about all this...I suppose
                      I'll tell you...I owe him that.
                      And maybe it'll be enough if
                      you know that in the few hours
                      we had together we loved a
                      lifetime's worth...

        CLICK.  WHIR.  Sarah jumps at a sound nearby, breaking
        her reverie.  A small MEXICAN BOY has snapped her picture
        with a beat-up Polaroid camera.  He holds it out to her,
        speaking rapid Spanish.

                                ATTENDANT
                      He says you are very beautiful,
                      Senora, and he is ashamed to ask
                      five American dollars for this
                      picture, but if he does not,
                      his father will beat him.

                                SARAH
                      That's a pretty good hustle,
                      kid.  Four.  Quatro.

        The boy takes her four dollars and she watches the
        snapshot develop.  It is a good photograph of her,
        the wind lightly ruffling her hair, expression thought-
        ful, slightly sad.

        We recognize it as the one Reese carried in 2029.
        She slips it into her short pocket.

                                ATTENDANT
                      Mil trescientos...fifteen dollars
                      American.

        As she pays him, distant thunder rolls.
        The boy yells something in Spanish as he runs off.

                                SARAH
                      What did he say?

                                ATTENDANT
                           (accented)
                      There is a storm coming in.

        Sarah gazes at the thunderheads building up out over the
        desert.  Heat lightning pulses in their depths.

                                SARAH
                           (quietly)
                      I know.

        CAMERA CRANES UP as she pulls away, driving across the
        flat desert on a ribbon of highway.  A brilliant flash
        crescendos from horizon to horizon out at the rim of the
        world.

        Revised final shooting script



1       EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

        Downtown L.A.  Noon on a hot summer day.  On an EXTREME LONG LENS the
        lunchtime crowd stacks up into a wall of humanity.  In SLOW MOTION
        they move in herds among the glittering rows of cars jammed bumper to
        bumper.  Heat ripples distort the torrent of faces.  The image is
        surreal, dreamy... and like a dream it begins very slowly to

                                                DISSOLVE TO:

2       EXT. CITY RUINS - NIGHT

        Same spot as the last shot, but now it is a landscape in Hell.  The
        cars are stopped in rusted rows, still bumper to bumper.  The
        skyline of buildings beyond has been shattered by some
        unimaginable force like a row of kicked-down sandcastles.
        Wind blows through the desolation, keening with the sound of ten
        million dead souls.  It scurries the ashes into drifts, stark
        white in the moonlight against the charred rubble.
        A TITLE CARD FADES IN:

                        LOS ANGELES, July 11, 2029

3       ANGLE ON a heap of fire-blackened human bones.  Beyond the mound is a
        vast tundra of skulls and shattered concrete.  The rush hour crowd
        burned down in their tracks.

4       WE DISSOLVE TO a playground... where intense heat has half-melted the
        jungle gym, the blast has warped the swing set, the merry-go-round
        has sagged in the firestorm.  Small skulls look accusingly from the
        ash-drifts.  WE HEAR the distant echo of children's voices... playing
        and laughing in the sun.  A silly, sing-songy rhyme as WE TRACKS
        SLOWLY over seared asphalt where the faint hieroglyphs of hopscotch
        lines are still visible.

        CAMERA comes to rest on a burnt and rusted tricycle... next to the
        tiny skull of its owner.  HOLD ON THIS IMAGE as a female VOICE speaks:

                                VOICE
                3 billion human lives ended on August 29th, 1997.
                The survivors of the nuclear fire called the war
                Judgment Day.  They lived only to face a new
                nightmare, the war against the Machines...

        A metal foot crushes the skull like china.

        TILT UP, revealing a humanoid machine holding a massive battle rifle.
        It looks like a CHROME SKELETON... a high-tech Death figure.  It is
        the endoskeleton of a Series 800 terminator.  Its glowing red eyes
        compassionlessly sweep the dead terrain, hunting.

        The SOUNDS of ROARING TURBINES.  Searchlights blaze down as a
        formation of flying HK (Hunter-Killer) patrol machines passes
        overhead.  PAN WITH THEM toward the jagged horizon, beyond which we
        see flashes, and hear the distant thunder of a pitched battle in
        progress.

5       EXT. BATTLEFIELD - NIGHT

        THE BATTLE.  Human troops is desperate combat with the machines for
        possession of the dead Earth.  The humans are a ragtag guerrilla
        army.  Skynet's weapons consist of Ground HKs (tank-like robot
        gun-platforms), flying Aerial HKs, four-legged gun-pods called
        Centurions, and the humanoid terminators in various forms.

        SEQUENCE OF RAPID CUTS:
5A      Explosions!  Beam-weapons firing like searing strobe-light.
5B      A gunner is an armored personnel carrier fires a LAW rocket at a
        pursuing Aerial HK, bringing it down in a fiery explosion.
5C      Another APC is crushed under the treads of a massive Ground HK.

5D      A TEAM OF GUERRILLAS in a intense fire-fight with terminator
5E      endoskeletons in the ruins of a building.  Three terminator
5F      endoskeletons advance, firing rapidly.  Another (complete cyborg),
        with flesh ripped open and back broken, gropes for a rifle on the
        ground.

5G      A Centurion overruns a human firing position.  Soldiers are cut
        down as they run.  Fiery explosions light the ranks of advancing
        machines.

6       IN A BLASTED GUN EMPLACEMENT at the edge of battle, a man watches
        the combat with night-vision binoculars.  He wears the uniform of a
        guerrilla general, and a black beret.  He is still amid running,
        shouting techs and officers.

        C.U. MAN, pushing slowly in as the battle rages O.S.  He lowers the
        binoculars.  He is forty-five years old.  Features severe.  The left
        side of his face is heavily scarred.  A patch covers that eye.  An
        impressive man, forged in the furnace of a lifetime of war.  The name
        stitched on the band of his beret is CONNOR.  We push in until his
        eyes fill frame, then...

                                                DISSOLVE TO:

        FIRE.  SLOW, BOILING, ENORMOUS.  FILLING FRAME.

                                VOICE (SARAH CONNOR)
                Skynet, the computer which controlled the machines,
                sent two terminators back through time.  Their
                mission: to destroy the leader of the human
                Resistance... John Connor.  My son.

                The first terminator was programmed to strike at
                me, in the year 1984... before John was born.
                It failed.

                The second was set to strike at John himself,
                when he was still a child.  As before, the
                Resistance was able to send a lone warrior.  A
                protector for John.  It was just a question of
                which one of them would reach him first...

                                                DISSOLVE TO:

7       EXT. TRUCKSTOP - NIGHT

        Wild fingers of BLUE-WHITE ELECTRIC ARCS dance in a steel canyon
        formed by two TRACTOR TRAILERS, parked side by side in the back lot
        of an all-night truck stop.  Then...

        The strange lightning forms a circular opening in mid-air, and in
        the sudden flare of light we see a FIGURE in a SPHERE OF ENERGY.
        Then the FRAME WHITES OUT with an explosive THUNDERCLAP!

        Through the clearing vapor we see the figure clearly... a naked man.
        TERMINATOR has come through.  Physique: massive, perfect.  Face:
        devoid of emotion.  Terminator stands and impassively surveys its
        surroundings.

8       INT. TRUCK STOP DINER - NIGHT

        On a back route to north L.A.  A handful of local TRUCKERS hunch over
        chili-sizes, CAT hats pushed back on their heads.  Three BIKERS are
        playing a game of pool in the back, their Miller empties lining the
        table's rail.  The dive's owner, LLOYD, a fat, aging biker-type in a
        soiled apron, stands behind the bar.  Nothing much going on...

        Then the front door opens and a big naked guy strolls in -- that
        doesn't happen every night.  All eyes simultaneously swivel toward
        Terminator.  Its emotionless gaze passes over the customers as it
        walks calmly through the room.  Everyone frozen, not sure how to
        react.

8A      TERMINATOR POV.  A digitized electronic scan of the room, overlaid
        with alphanumeric readouts which change faster than the human eye
        can follow.  In POV we move past the staring truckers, past the
        owner and the awestruck WAITRESS, and approach a large nasty-looking
        biker puffing on a cigar.  His body is outlined, or "selected", and
        thousands of estimated measurements appear.  His clothing has been
        analyzed and deemed suitable...

8B                              TERMINATOR
                I need your clothes, your boots, and your
                motorcycle.

        The big biker's eyes narrow.  He takes a long draw on this cigar,
        the tip cherry-red hot.

                                CIGAR BIKER
                You forgot to say please.

        He grinds the cigar out on Terminator's chest.  Which produces not
        the slight reaction of pain.  Terminator calmly, and without
        expression, grabs Cigar by his meaty upper arm...
        Cigar screams from the hydraulic grip.

        Terminator doesn't see Cigar's friend, behind him, holding his pool
        cue by the narrow end like a Louisville Slugger.  The heavy send
        whistles in a powerful swing and CRACKS IN TWO across the back of
        Terminator's head.

        Terminator seems not to notice.  Doesn't even blink.  Without
        releasing his grip on Cigar, he snaps his arm straight back and grabs
        Pool Cue by the front of his jacket.  Suddenly the heavyset biker
        finds himself flying through the nearest window.  CRAASSH!

        Terminator hurls Cigar, all 230 pounds of him, clear over the bar,
        through the serving window into the kitchen, where he lands on the
        big flat GRILL.  We hear a SOUND like SIZZLING BACON as Cigar
        screams, flopping jerking.  He rolls off in a smoking heap.

        The third biker whips out a knife with a eight-inch blade and slashes
        at Terminator's face.

        Terminator grabs the arcing blade with his bare hand.  Holding it by
        the razor-sharp blade he jerks is from the guy's hand.
        Ultra-fast here: He flips it.  Grabs the handle like you're supposed
        to hold a knife.  Grabs the biker and slams him face-down over the
        bar.  Then brings the knife whistling down, pinning the biker's
        shoulder to the bar top with his own steel.

9       INT. KITCHEN

        The doors BANGS OPEN and Terminator strides in.
        The Mexican cook does a fast fade as Terminator walks toward Cigar,
        who is cursing in pain on the floor.

        With his deep-fried fingers he struggles to get out the .45 auto
        tucked under his leather jacket.  But he can't even hold onto it.
        Terminator takes it from him.  Instead of pointing it at him,
        Terminator carefully examines weapon, analyzing its caliber and
        operating condition.  Terminator never threatens... that's a human
        thing.  He just takes.

        Cigar senses what he must do when the emotionless eyes come back to
        him.  He slides the keys to his bike across the floor to Terminator's
        foot.  Then painfully starts getting out of his jacket.

10      INT. TRUCK STOP

        Terminator strides from the kitchen, fully clothed now in a black
        leather jacket, leather riding pants, and heavy, clean boots.  He
        moves toward the moaning biker pinned to the pool table.  Without
        slowing his stride he jerks the knife out.  The guy slumps to the
        floor, groaning, behind him.

        Terminator continues toward the front of the diner, passing Lloyd,
        the owner.  At the door, he comes abreast of two truckers who sit
        frozen like a snapshot in mid-bite.  One of the truckers finally
        nods.

                                TRUCKER
                Evening...

        Terminator impassively stares back.  Then moves on out the door.

11      EXT. TRUCK STOP

        Terminator walks out, surveying the parked Harleys.  Sticks the .45
        in his belt and swings one leg over a massive CUSTOM ELECTRO-GLIDE.
        He slips the dagger in his boot and the key in the ignition.  Kicks
        over the engine.  It catches with a roar and he slams the heavy iron
        into gear with a KLUNK.

        Lloyd appears at the diner's door with a sawed-off 10-GAUGE
        WINCHESTER LEVER-ACTION SHOTGUN.  He fires into the air and jacks
        around round in fast, aiming at Terminator's back.

                                LLOYD
                I can't let you take the man's wheels, son.
                Now get off or I'll put you down.

        Terminator turns and considers by coldly.  He eases the shifter up
        into neutral.  Rocks the bike onto its kickstand.  Swings him leg
        over and walks calmly toward the guy.

        Terminator strides right up to Lloyd, staring straight into the
        shotgun's muzzle.  Lloyd starts sweating, trying to decide is he's
        going to kill a man in cold blood.  He's still trying to decide when
        Terminator's hand blurs out like a striking cobra and is somehow
        suddenly holding the shotgun.

        Lloyd gapes, knowing he's screwed.  Then...
        Terminator reaches toward him.  Oh shit...
        And slips the sunglasses out of Lloyd's shirt pocket.  Puts them on.
        Strides back to the Harley and roars off in a shower of gravel.

12      EXT. FREEWAY - NIGHT

        Terminator roars down the freeway, heading for L.A.  Cold neon flares
        across the chrome of the big bike.  The 10-gauge is jammed through
        the clutch and brake cables, across the handlebars.  The lights flow
        over Terminator's wrap-around sunglasses like the tracks of tracer
        rounds.

                                                CUT TO:

13      EXT. OVERPASS - NIGHT

        The First Street Bridge.  Rusting chain-link fence and graffiti-
        covered walls.  An L.A.P.D. BLACK-AND-WHITE cruises the empty street.

        A TREMENDOUS BLUE-WHITE GLARE suddenly spills out between the columns
        of the overpass.  The young UNIFORMED COP in the car whips his head
        around at the source of the light.  He pulls over quickly, in time
        to see...

13A     The powerfully arcing electrical discharge reaches its peak between
        the columns.  Lightning climbs the chain-link fence and light
        standards, lighting up the night, and papers swirl in a blasting
        whirlwind.

13B     The cop climbs from his cruiser as the glow fades.
        He sees vapor dissipating as he approaches the spot where he saw the
        strange light.  He draws his revolver and cautiously moves into the
        shadows between the rows of pillars.

        A NAKED MAN glides from a shadowed doorway behind the cop.  Nothing
        special about him.  Certainly not built like a terminator.  The flash
        of light and fact that he is naked are pretty good clues that he
        just arrived from the future.  His features are handsome bordering
        on severe.  His eyes are gray ice.  Penetrating.  Intelligent.

        THE COP spins at a sound.  Too late.  Mr. X is already on him.  The
        blow is lighting fast and the cop drops like a bag of sand.

        LOW ANGLE as the unconscious cop hits the deck, his BERETTA 9mm
        AUTOMATIC clattering next to him.  A hand ENTERS FRAME and picks up
        this pistol.

                                                CUT TO:

13C     HIGHLY POLISHED BLACK SHOES rounding the rear tire of the police
        cruiser.  FOLLOW THE SHOES to the cruiser's door then MOVE UP as
        Mr. X, dressed now in LAPD blue, climbs behind the wheel.  He
        looks and acts exactly like a cop.  Cool, alert, confident in his
        power, his expression emotionless and judgmental.
        Mr. X, now Officer X, puts the car in gear and drives into the night.

                                                CUT TO:

14      INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE/GARAGE - DAY

        TIGHT ON YOUNG JOHN CONNOR, who at his moment is ten years old and
        busy reassembling the carburetor on his Honda 125 dirtbike.  He has
        ripped Levi's and long stringy hair.  A sullen mouth.  Eyes which
        reveal an intelligence as sharp as a scalpel.  The Ramones' "I Wanna
        Be Sedated" blasts from a boom box next to him.

        A WOMAN, JANELLA VOIGHT, stands in the doorway of the garage,
        yelling over the music.

                                WOMAN
                ...John?  John!  Get in here right now and
                clean up that pigsty of yours.

        John's friend TIM, a thirteen-year-old Hispanic kid, watches as John
        replies by turning up the volume on the boom box.
        Janelle gives up with a SLAM of the house's back door.

                                TIM
                Your foster parents are kinda dicks, right?

                                JOHN
                Gimme that Phillips right there.

15      INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

        Janelle storms into the room.  TOD VOIGHT, her husband, watches
        sports on the TV.  They're both in their thirties.  Middle-class
        working stiffs.

                                JANELLE
                I swear I've had it with that goddamn kid.
                He won't even answer me.
                        (neither does he)
                Todd?  Are you gonna sit there or are you gonna
                do something?

        He sighs.  Throws down the TV's remote and heads for the garage.

16      INT. GARAGE

        John hops on the bike.  Kick-starts it.  Tim picks up John's nylon
        bag, then climbs on the back.  Todd ENTERS and shouts over the
        engine, which John revs louder and louder.

                                TODD
                John!  Get your ass inside right now and do
                what your mother says!

        John pins Todd with a defiant glare.

                                JOHN
                She's not my mother, Todd!

        He revs the engine and peels out of the garage, with Tim almost
        falling off the back.  They take off down the street.

17      EXT. VACANT LOT/DRAINAGE CANAL

        John cuts through a vacant lot to a trail running beside a fenced-in
        drainage canal.  He guns the bike through a hole in the retaining
        fence.  Tim's eyes go wide as they roar down the concrete embankment.

17A     IN THE DRAINAGE CANAL John zig-zags along, throwing up a
        roostertail of muddy water.  Tim shouts, pretending he didn't just
        see his life flash before his eyes.  He slaps John on the back.

                                TIM
                Major moves, homes!  So... where is your
                real mom, anyway?
                        (John doesn't answer)
                She dead or something?

        It's hard to read John's expression.

                                JOHN
                She might as well be.

        John twists the throttle angrily and the bike lunges forward.

18      EXT. PESCADERO STATE HOSPITAL - DAY

        A SIGN on a chain link fence topped with concertina wire reads:
        PESCADERO STATE HOSPITAL FOR THE CRIMINALLY INSANE.  Beyond it
        squats an imposing four-story building.  Institutional brick.
        Barred windows.  About as inviting as KGB headquarters.  Security
        guards patrol the manicured grass.

19      INT. HOSPITAL - MAXIMUM SECURITY WING

        Sunlight is a barred slash on the bare institutional wall.  The room
        is empty of all furnishings save the bed, a stainless steel sink,
        toilet, and a dented metal mirror.  WE HEAR a rhythmic grunting,
        small explosions of breath in perfectly-metered time.

        PAN TO a bedframe leaned upright against the wall, legs facing
        outward.  A pair of sweaty hands grip one leg.  Tendons knot and
        release as SOMEONE does pull-ups.  A man of tangled hair hides the
        face that comes INTO FRAME, dips out, comes back.

        WIDER.  A WOMAN in a tank top and hospital pants in hanging from the
        top leg of the vertical bedframe.  Her body is straight and taut.
        Knees bent so the feet clear the ground.  The arms are lean and
        muscular.  The inmate, face hidden, pulls up, dips, pulls up.  Like
        a machine.  No change in rhythm.

20      INT. HOSPITAL/CORRIDOR

        FIGURES MOVE TOWARD US down a corridor of polished tile and two-
        tone walls.  DR. PETER SILBERMAN, a smug criminal psychologist,
        leads a group of young INTERNS.  Following laconically, are THREE
        BURLY ATTENDANTS.

                                SILBERMAN
                The next patient is a 29-year old female
                diagnosed as acute schizo-affective disorder.
                The usual indicators... depression, anxiety,
                violent acting-out, delusions of persecution.
                        (the interns nod judiciously)
                Here we are.

        Silberman stops at one of the SOUNDPROOF STEEL DOORS.  There is a two-
        way speaker beneath a tiny window.  Silberman flips the intercom
        switch.

21      INT. CELL

        Silberman's scrubbed and cheerful face at cell window.  HIS VOICE
        comes over the tinny speaker.

                                SILBERMAN
                'Morning, Sarah.

        REVERSE ANGLE as she turns slowly into CLOSE UP.
        SARAH CONNOR is not the same woman we remember from last time.  Her
        eyes peer out through a wild tangle of hair like those of a cornered
        animal.  Defiant and intense, but skittering around looking for
        escape at the same time.  Fight or flight.  Down one cheek is a long
        scar, from just below the eye to her upper lip.
        Her VOICE is a low and chilling monotone.

                                SARAH
                Good morning, Dr. Silberman.  How's the knee?

22      INT. CORRIDOR

        Silberman's smug composure drops a second.  Then returns.

                                SILBERMAN
                Fine, Sarah.
                        (he switches off, speaks to
                        the interns)
                She, uh... stabbed me in the kneecap with a
                screwdriver a few weeks ago.

        Sarah watches them talking about her through the glass, but can't
        hear them.  She feels like a lab animal.  The interns look in at her
        through the glass as Silberman talks.  With her face drawn, eyes
        haggard and hair wild, she looks like she belongs where she is.

                                SILBERMAN
                The delusional architecture is interesting.
                She believes a machine called a "terminator",
                which looks human of course, was sent back
                though time to kill her.  And also that the
                father of her child was a soldier, sent to
                protect her... he was from the future too...
                        (he smiles)
                The year 2029, if I remember correctly.
                        (the interns chuckle)
                Let's move on, shall we?

        As the interns walk on, Silberman steps close to DOUGLAS, the head
        attendant, and speaks low.

                                SILBERMAN
                Douglas, I don't like seeing the patients
                disturbing their rooms like this.  See that she
                takes her thorazine, would you?

        DOUGLAS is 6'4", 250 pounds and warm-hearted at a rattlesnake.  He
        nods, catching Silberman's meaning, and gestures for the other
        attendants to hang back as Silberman moves on in his rounds.

23      INT. CELL

        Sarah looks up as the cell door opens.  Douglas walks in slowly,
        idly tapping his POLICE BATON against the door in a ominous rhythm.
        The other two orderlies ease in behind him.  One of them carries a
        STUN BATON (like a sawed-off cattle prod).  The other has a tray with
        cups of red liquid-thorazine.

                                DOUGLAS
                Time to take you meds, Connor.

        Sarah faces him, weight centered.  Feral eyes darting from one to the
        other.

                                SARAH
                You take it.

        Douglas grins, casual --

                                DOUGLAS
                Now you know you got to be good 'cause you up
                for review this afternoon...

                                SARAH
                I'm not taking it.  Now I don't want any
                trouble...

                                DOUGLAS
                Ain't no trouble at all --

        He whips the baton in a whistling backhand, which --
        WHAP!  Takes her square in the stomach.  She doubles over and drops
        to her knees, unable to breathe.  Douglas tips the bed and it slams
        down with a crash, right new to her.  He takes her stun wand from
        the other attendant and walks forward.

        TIGHT ON SARAH, grimacing and struggling to breathe.

                                SARAH
                You... son of a... AAARRGH!!

        The stun wand hits her between shoulder blades as she tries to rise.
        It drives her to the floor, pinning her like a bug.  Little
        ELECTRIC ARCS CRACKLE as the baton makes her writhe in pain.
        Douglas grabs her by the hair and jerks her up to her knees.  Holds
        the cup of thorazine in front of her lips.

                                DOUGLAS
                Last call, sugar.

        Gasping, she chokes the zombie juice down.

24      EXT. BANK PARKING LOT - DAY

        John furtively hunches before a Ready-Teller machine at the rear of
        a local bank while his friend Tim stands lookout.  John slips a
        stolen ATM card into the machine slot.  It is something he's rigged
        up, because trailing from the card is ribbon-wire which goes to
        some kind of black-box electronics unit he's got in his ever-present
        knapsack.  He holds the pack between his knees and pulls out a
        little lap-top keyboard, which is also connected to the black-box.

        John enters a few commands and the plasma-screen displays the PIN
        number for that account.  He quickly enters the number on the Ready-
        Teller's keypad and asks it for 300 bucks.  The machine whirs then
        begins dispensing twenty-dollar bills.  Tim looks back over his
        shoulder amazed.

                                JOHN
                Easy money!

                                TIM
                Where'd you learn all this stuff?

        John collects the twenties as the machine kicks them out.  A cool and
        professional electronic-age thief at ten years old.

                                JOHN
                From my mom.  My real mom, I mean.  Come on
                baby...
                        (he grabs the last bills)
                Let's go!

        They sprint around the corner to an --

25      EXT. ALLEY BEHIND BANK

        They huddle behind the building as John counts out Tim's share.
        He folds five twenties and palms them to the other kid.  When John
        opens his wallet to put in his money, Tim notices a picture in a
        plastic sleeve.

                                TIM
                That her?

        John reluctantly shows his friend the Polaroid.  It is a shot of
        Sarah.  Pregnant, in a jeep near the Mexican border.  John doesn't
        know it now, but he will carry the photo with him for over 30 years,
        and give it to a young man named Kyle Reese, who will travel back in
        time to become his father.  Yes, that photo.

                                TIM
                So she's pretty cool, huh?

                                JOHN
                Actually, no, she's a complete psycho.  That's
                why she's up at Pescedero.  She tries to blow up
                a computer factory, but she got shot and arrested.

                                TIM
                No shit?

                                JOHN
                Yeah, she's a total loser.  C'mon, let's check
                out the 7-Eleven, whatya say?

        John has tried to sound casual, but we see in his eyes that is really
        hurts.  He slaps Tim on the shoulder and they jump onto his Honda.
        John fires up and they whine off down the alley.

        Officer X ignores the question.  He casually scans the living room.

                Well, you could if he was here.  Be he took off
                on his bike this morning.  Could be anywhere.
                You gonna tell me what his is about?

                                OFFICER X
                I just need to ask him a few questions.

        Janelle appears in the doorway behind Todd, concerned.

                There was a guy here this morning asking about

                                TODD
                Yeah, big guy.  On a bike.  Has that got
                something to do with it?

        Officer X registers the significance of that.  He realizes who the
        big guy must be.  He smiles.  Reassuringly shakes his head no.

                                OFFICER X

        stroking her cheek.  She wakes up to see --

        KYLE REESE.  Sitting on the edge of her bed, looking exactly the
        same as we last saw him in 1984.  Scruffy blonde hair and a long
        raincoat.

                                SARAH
                Kyle..?  You're dead.

        He gives her a gentle smile.

                                REESE
                I know.  This is a dream, Sarah.

                Oh.  Yeah.  They... make me take this stuff...

        He puts a finger to her lips.  Then silently unfastens her restraints.
        They gaze into each other's eyes.  And in the look that his death
        and the horror she has been through since hasn't touched their love
        at all.

        She melts into Reese's arms.  Pulls him to her.

                I love you.  I always will.

                Where's John, Sarah?

        Sarah opens her eyes and he is no longer in her arms.  He is standing
        across the room.  Pinning her with an accusing gaze.

                They took him from me.

                                REESE
                It's John who's the target now.  You have to
                protect him.  He's wide open.

                I know, but I'm not as strong as I'm supposed
                to be.  I can't do it.  I'm screwing up the

                Remember the message... the future is not set.
                There is not fate but what we make for ourselves.

        He turns toward the door.

                                SARAH
                Kyle, don't go!

                                REESE
                        (turning back to her)
                There's not much time left in the world, Sarah.

        Reese goes out the door.  Sarah jumps from the bed, frantic.  Yanks
        the door open.  Follow her out.

30      INT. CORRIDOR

        Sarah staggers from her cell.  Reese is already, impossibly, a
        hundred feet away, striding down the dim corridor.  A silhouette
        in a long coat, disappearing around a corner.

        Sarah runs after him, her bare feet slapping the cold linoleum.
        Her hospital gown floats out behind her as she dream-runs along the
        seemingly infinite corridor.  She reaches the corner, slides around
        it, and...

30A     Slams right into the arms of Douglas and his three helpers.  They
        grab her as she struggles and screams.  The Silberman is there,
        smiling soothingly.  They force her down and she is pinned to
        the floor, screaming.  A new figure approaches... one even more
        menacing.

        TERMINATOR walks toward her, with heavy measured steps.  Backlit,
        eyes concealed by the sunglasses, it stands over her like the angel
        of death itself.  It reaches down and...
        Takes her hand.  Lifts her up.  Leads her to a door.  They go through
        together.  Emerging into...

30B     A BEAUTIFUL SUNLIGHT MORNING.  CHILDREN are playing nearby... sliding
        down slides, clambering through a jungle gym.  Sarah knows this
        dream know... it's is the worst of all her nightmares.  She starts
        to scream but no sound comes out.

30C     THE SKY EXPLODES into WHITE LIGHT.  Everything is seared by the unholy
        glare, hotter than a thousand suns.  The children ignite like
        match heads.  Sarah is burning, screaming silently, everything silent
        and overexposed.  Terminator's flesh and clothing are burning,
        silently.  It grips her hand, Virgil to her Dante in this tour of the
        nuclear-age Inferno.

30D     THE BLAST WAVE HITS... a near-solid wall of compressed air followed
        by 250-mph winds.  The children, charcoal statues frozen in positions
        of play, explode into black leaves of ash and swirl away.  SOUND
        hit now, with a thunderous roar.  Sarah's scream merges with the
        howl of the wind as the blast hits her, exploding the flesh from her
        bones.  Beside her, Terminator is stripped of its burnt flesh,
        becoming a smoking skeleton of steel.

30E     Then she wake up... in her cell, shackled to the bed.  Sunlight hurts
        her eyes.  She looks desperate and defeated.  She knows the war is
        coming.  It visits her every time she closes her eyes.  Lost and
        alone, Sarah feels all hope recede for herself and for humanity.

31A     The REAL SARAH dispassionately watches herself on the screen.  Her
        expression is controlled.  Silberman watches her watching.  They are
        in a brightly-lit interview room.  TWO ATTENDANTS stands nearby.

31B                             VIDEO SARAH
                The children look like burnt paper... black,
                not moving.  Then the blast wave hits them and
                they fly apart like leaves..."

        Video Sarah can't go on.  Real Sarah watches herself cry on tape,
        her expression cold.  We hear Silberman speak on the tape.

                                VIDEO SARAH
                It's not just a dream.  It's real, you moron!

                        attendant)
                everybody... you're all fucking dead!

        She is raving, half out of her chair.  The orderly moves to inject
        her with something.

                                VIDEO SARAH
                You're the one living in a dream, Silberman,
                not me!  Because I know it happens.  It
                happens!

31C     Silberman pauses the tape... freezing Sarah's contorted face.
        Real Sarah turns away from the screen, he expression stony.

                                SARAH
                I was afraid... and confused.  I feel much
                better, now.  Clearer.

        Silberman gives a calculated paternal smile.

                                SILBERMAN
                Yes.  Your attitude have been very positive
                lately.

        Sarah looks up at him.  Her voice is hopeful.

                                SARAH
                It has helped me a lot to have a goal, something
                to look forward to.

                                SILBERMAN
                And what it that?

        As she answers, WE PULL BACK, revealing that we have been looking
        through a one-way mirror from an adjacent OBSERVATION ROOM.  In the
        shadows of the observation room we see that interns from the
        earlier rounds, and a couple of STAFF PSYCHOLOGISTS.  They smoke and
        make the occasional note.

                                SARAH
                You said I could be transferred to the minimum
                security wing and have visitors if I showed
                improvement in six months.  Well, it's been six
                months, and I was looking forward to seeing my
                son.

                                SILBERMAN
                I see.  Let's go back to what you were saying
                about these terminator machines.  Now you think
                they don't exist?

        CLOSE ON SARAH.  Her voice sounds hollow.

                                SARAH
                They don't exist.  I see that now.

        Silberman leans back, studying her.  Toying with her.

                                SILBERMAN
                But you've told me on many occasions about how
                you crushed one in a hydraulic press.

                                SARAH
                If I had, there would have been some evidence.
                They would have found something at the factory.

                                SILBERMAN
                I see.  So you don't believe anymore that the
                company covered it up?

        Sarah shakes her head no.

        The elevator doors slide open with a whisper and MILES DYSON strides
        out.  Black.  In his early thirties.  The star of the Special
        Projects Division.  He's brilliant, aggressive, driven.  Dyson walks
        down the corridor, swinging his arms... a man in a hurry.  A man
        with much to do.

        He reaches a solid security door and zips his ELECTRONIC KEY-CARD
        through the scanner.  The door unlocks with a clunk.
        The sign next to the door reads: SPECIAL PROJECTS DIVISION:

        He nods to the guards as he passes through the security checkpoint.
        They can see all activities on the floor on their bank of monitors.
        He unlocks another service door with his card and enters --

35      INT. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (A.I.) LAB

        The lab is quite large, comprising banks of processors, disk drives,
        test bays, prototype assembly areas.  Extremely high tech.

                                DYSON
                Greetings, troops.

        He is jokingly saluted by fellow members.  Not a lab coat in sight.
        This is strictly jeans and sneakers crowd.  All young and bright.
        They sit at their consoles drinking Coke and changing technology as
        we know it.  A young LAB ASSISTANT rushes over to Dyson.  Name tag
        says he's BRYANT.

                                BRYANT
                Mr. Dyson?  The material teams wants to run
                another test on the uh... on it.

                                DYSON
                Yup.  Come on.  I'll get it.

        Dyson produces an unusual-looking KEY from his pocket as they stride
        through the lab.  Bryant has to hustle to keep up.

                                BRYANT
                Listen, Mr. Dyson, I know I haven't been here
                that long, but I was wondering if you could tell
                me... I mean, if you know...

                                DYSON
                I asked them that question once.  Know what
                they told me?  Don't ask.

36      INT. VAULT ROOM

        Dyson enters with Bryant.  Dyson and a GUARD stand together before
        what looks like a high-tech bank vault.  It requires two keys to
        open, like the launch controls in a nuclear silo.  The guard and
        Dyson insert their keys and turn them simultaneously.  Dyson then
        enters a passcode at a console and the vault unlocks itself with a
        sequence of clunks.  The door swings open and Dyson enters.  Bryant
        stays outside with the guard, who notes Dyson's name and item on a
        clipboard.

37      INT. VAULT

        Dyson walks to a stainless steel cabinet and opens it.  Inside is a
        small artifact in a sealed container of inert gas.  IT -- a ceramic
        rectangle, about the size of a domino, the color of liver.  It has
        been shattered, painstakingly reconstructed and mounted on a metal
        frame.

        Dyson removes the artifact, it its insert-gas, and sets it on a
        specially-designed cart.  He handles it like the Turin Shroud.
        Dyson closes the cabinet.  Turns to the one next to it.  Opens its
        door.  In this cabinet is a larger object... an intricate METAL HAND
        AND FOREARM.

        At the elbow, the metal is twisted and crushed.  But the forearm and
        hand are intact.  Its metal surface scorched and discolored, it
        stands upright in a vacuum flask, as if saluting.  This is all that
        remains of the terminator Sarah destroyed.  Dyson stares at it, lost
        in thought.  The he closes the cabinet, BLACKING OUT FRAME.

        still watching through the mirror.  Reviewing Sarah's condition.

                                SARAH
                So what do you think, Doctor?  I've shown a lot
                of improvement, haven't I?

                                SILBERMAN
                You see, Sarah... here's the problem.  I know
                how smart you are, and I think you're just
                telling me what I want to hear.  I don't think
                you really believe who you've been telling me
                today.

        We go tight on Sarah's reaction.  And we see that Silberman is right.
        She was playing him and it didn't work.  And she knows she's fucked.
        Her tone becomes quite pleading.

                                SARAH
                You have to let me see my son.  Please.  It's
                very important.  He's in danger.  At least let
                me call him --

        Silberman pins her with his sweet reptilian gaze.

                                SILBERMAN
                I'm afraid not.  Not for a while.  I don't see
                any choice but to recommend to the review board
                that you stay here another six months.

        Sarah's eyes turn cold and lethal in one second.  She knows she's
        lost.  She knows this guy is just playing with her, and she --
        LEAPS ACROSS THE TABLE AT HIM.

        Silberman jumps back and the attendants dive on her.  She is writhing
        and twisting like a bobcat.  Silberman whips open a drawer and pulls

40B     Terminator wheel the Harley around, cutting onto a street which runs
        parallel to the canal.  Terminator hauls ass at keep John in sight.
        He catches glimpses of the kid through trees and houses.  Loses him.
        Catches one last glimpse of him heading into the parking lot of a
        large SHOPPING MALL.

41      INT. GALLERIA - DAY

        John works his way through a crowded video arcade.  Sees some guys he

        We don't hear the dialogue.

42      INT. GALLERIA PARKING LOT

        TERMINATOR'S idling Harley shakes the parking garage walls.  He stops
        at a row of bikes near the escalators.  John's little Honda sits
        proudly with the big street bikes.  Terminator parks.

        OFFICER X is moving through the flow of shoppers.  The place is a zoo.
        He stops some kids and shows them the picture.  They shrug.

43A     IN A CROWDED VIDEO ARCADE JOHN is lost in an intense battle, going for
        a new high score at "Missile Command".  He parries deftly at the enemy
        ICBMs deploy their MIRVs... the warheads stream down... it's more than
        he can deal with.  The world gets nuked.  Game over.  He slouches
        away from the game, looking for another.  Bored.

        RACK FOCUS to Officer X passing the entrance of the store behind him.
        The cop moves on, down the concourse, out of sight.
        John gets in an "Afterburner" simulator game.

43B     ON TERMINATOR, walking through the crowd in slow motion.  Scanning.
        He moves with methodical purpose, knowing the target is close.  We
        see that he is, incredibly, carrying a box of LONG-STEM ROSES.  Like
        some hopeful guy with a hot date.

43C     THE COP is pointed toward the arcade by come kids hanging out at the
        multi-cinema.  He walks into the maze of kids engaged in synthesized
        combat.  Cheap electronic effects blare above the crowd noise.

43D     JOHN is shooting down MiGs at Mach 2.  His friend Tim slides up next
        to him.  Taps him on the shoulder, trying to play it cool.

                                TIM
                Some cop is scoping for you, dude.

        John looks around the corner of the "Afterburner" ride.  Sees the cop
        showing a picture to some of the kids.  The kids point his way.

        John ducks just as the cop glances over.  He slinks out the other side
        of the ride and heads for the back of the store, instinctively
        retreating.  Sarah has taught him that cops are bad news.

        THE COP scans the crowded arcade.  Glimpses John, looking back as he
        moves around a row of machines.  Starts toward him.

        JOHN sees the cop homing in and starts walking fast.  Looks back.
        THE COP is shoving through clots of kids.  One of them is slammed to
        the floor.  As eddy of outrage behind the cop as he gains speed.
        John breaks into run.  So does the cop.
        Kids scatter like ten-pins as the cop charges after John.
        John sprints through the arcade's back officer and store-rooms.

        John emerges through a firedoor into a long corridor with connects
        to the parking garage.  He's running full out, when around the corner
        ahead of him comes...

        TERMINATOR.  Time stretches to nightmarish crawl as John tries to
        brake to a stop.  Terminator reaches into the box of roses.

        SLOW MOTION.  The cold back steel of the SHOTGUN emerges at the box
        falls open, the roses spilling to the floor.  TERMINATOR'S BOOT
        crushes the flowers as it moves forward.

        JOHN, transfixed by terror, is trapped in the narrow featureless
        shooting gallery of the corridor.  THE SHOTGUN COMES UP.  Terminator
        expressionlessly strides forward.  Jacks a round into the chamber,
        slow and fluid.

        John looks behind him for a place to run.  Sees the cop coming toward
        him, pulling his Beretta pistol.  Incredibly, John realizes the cop
        is aiming his gun at him!
        John looks back at Terminator.  He is starting into the black muzzle
        of the 10-gauge now.  Aimed right at his head.  He realizes he's
        screwed.  Then something crazy happens...

                                TERMINATOR
                Get down.

        John instinctively ducks.  Terminator pulls the trigger. KABOOM!

        THE COP catches the SHOTGUN'S BLAST square in the chest just as he
        fires the pistol.  The pistol's shot goes wild.

        TERMINATOR pumps another round into him.  The another.  And another.
        Advancing a step each time he fires, he empties the shotgun into the
        cop, blowing his backward down the corridor.  The sound is DEAFENING.
        Then silence.

        THE COP lies still on his back.

44A     Terminator is now standing right over John.  They both watch as the
        cop, incredibly, sits up unharmed and gets to his feet.  Terminator
        grabs John roughly by his jacket.  Clutches the kid to his chest
        then spins around at the cop opens fire with the Beretta.

44B     The "cop", who not only isn't a cop, he clearly isn't even human,
        pulls the trigger so fast it almost seems like a machine-pistol.

        ON TERMINATOR'S BACK, as the 9mm slugs slam into it, punching bloody
        holes in the motorcycle jacket.

        JOHN is bug-eyed with fear, but completely unscratched.  Terminator's
        body has blocked the bullets.

        The Beretta CLACKS empty.  Terminator turns at the sound.
        Shoves John behind a Coke machine.  Drops the empty shotgun.  Starts
        walking toward the "cop".
        The empty magazine clatters to the floor.
        The cop inserts another one.  Snaps back the slide.
        Terminator still has twenty feet to go.
        He doesn't break his purposeful stride.

        The cop opens fire.  Bullets rake Terminator's chest.  He doesn't
        even flinch.
        Ten feet to go.  BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM!  Neither the cop nor Terminator
        show the slightest change in expression as the gun rips Terminator's
        wardrobe to shreds.

        CLACK.  The pistol empties again.  Terminator stops two feet in front
        of the cop.  The appraise each other for a second.

        We realize now that the cop is a terminator too.  We don't know the
        details yet, but let's call him the T-1000 (since that's what he is).
        A newer model than the one we've come to know so well (the 800
        Series "Arnold").  This guy's a prototype... and he's got quite a
        few surprises.

        T-1000 AND TERMINATOR size each other up.  Terminator moves first.
        He grabs T-1000 in his massive hands but the T-1000 snaps back with a
        counter-grip.  After about two seconds of intense slamming, the walls
        on both sides of the corridor have all the plaster smashed in, and
        the two battling machines have blasted through the wall and
        disappeared.

        JOHN, totally stunned by all this, remembers to move.  He staggers to
        his feet.  Stumble-runs toward the parking garage.

44C     THIRD LEVEL CONCOURSE.  A plate glass window EXPLODES and Terminator
        crashes through to the tile floor like a sack of cement amid the
        screaming crowd.

44D     T-1000 turns without a word and heads back through the store after
        John, accelerating slowly into a loping, predatory run.

44E     Terminator is totally still.  A JAPANESE TOURIST cautiously steps
        forward and takes a picture of the body.  Suddenly, Terminator's
        eyes snap open.  The stunned tourist backs away.

        He sits up and looks around.  Gets his bearings.  Rises smoothly to
        his feet.  All servos seem to be working fine.  The tourist's camera
        whirs as the motor-drive runs on by itself, taking shot after show.
        The owner isn't even looking through the eyepiece, he's so shocked.

45      INT. PARKING GARAGE

        John is frantically pumping the kick-start of his bike, scared
        shitless and the damned thing won't start.  His hands are shaking so
        badly he can't find the choke.  He looks up to see --
        The T-1000 running down the corridor toward him.
        John fumbles with the choke.  The bike catches.  He slams it in gear
        and spins the bike out into the main aisle of the garage.

        John looks back... the T-1000 is behind him, running.  He twists the
        throttle and guns the little bike forward.  Incredibly, the T-1000
        is gaining.  This nightmare isn't happening.  John races out the exit
        ramp, and charges right into the street.

46      EXT. STREET

        John shoots into the busy traffic.  Cuts off a BIG-RIG TOW TRUCK.
        The DRIVER swears.  Hits his air horn.  What the driver doesn't see
        is the cop, running faster than O.J. Simpson at the airport, who
        emerges onto the street and runs back at his truck.

46A     IN THE TRUCK.  The driver hears a thump as something slams against his
        door, then feels himself pulled right out.  T-1000 slides in and
        takes his place.  The truck is still rolling along about 25 mph.
        T-1000 accelerates after John without missing a beat.  It can see him,
        up ahead, weaving through traffic.

46B     Out of the garage entrance, Terminator roars onto the street on the
        Harley.
        He accelerates after the others.

47      EXT. FLOOD CONTROL CHANNEL

        John slides his bike down the service ramp faster than he's ever done
        it before.  He races along the bottom of the canal, turning into a
        narrower tributary which has vertical sides.

        He looks back.  No sign of pursuit.
47A     Suddenly he sees the sun blocked out by a great shadow.
        The Kenworth tow-truck... big as a house, all chrome and roaring
        diesel engine... crashes through the fence and launches itself right
        into the center of the canal.

        It crashes down, 15 feet to the ground, going about 60, hits at an
        angle and tears into the concrete wall with a hideous grinding of
        metal.  It ricochets back and forth between the walls then, bellowing
        like a gunshot stegosaurus, it just keep on plowing forward, gathering
        speed.

47B     John looks back and sees this wall of metal almost filling the narrow
        concrete canal and he milks every last bit of throttle the little bike
        has.  The Kenworth is all muscle, tearing along the canal like a train
        in a tunnel.  Its big tires send up huge sheets of muddy spray,
        backlit in the setting sun.  It looks like some kind of demon.  And...
        it's gaining.

47C     ABOVE THEM, on the service road running parallel, Terminator is
        fighting to overtake them.  He looks down and sees John with the tow-
        truck from Hell catching up to him.  It is only about twenty feet
        behind him and still gaining.

47D     ANGLE IN THE CANAL, looking back past a desperate John, at the wall
        of metal filling frame behind him.

47E     ABOVE, Terminator cuts the bike suddenly hard to the left, leaving the
        road.  Hitting an earth embankment just right, he jumps the bike into
        the air like Steve McQueen in "The Great Escape" and vaults the fence
        bordering the canal.  It slams down at the edge of the canal and tears
        along, inches from the drop-off on a dirt path, accelerating past the
        truck in the canal below.

47F     John hits some water and slews momentarily, loosing speed.  The
        massive push-plate on the front of the truck slams into his back
        fender.  Panicked, he pulls a little ahead.  All this is happening at
        about sixty miles and hour.  Top speed for the little dirt bike.

47G     SLOW MOTION as Terminator jumps the bike again.  This time the 700-
        pound Harley sails out into space and drops into the canal.  It arcs
        down between the truck and John, hitting on its wheels.  It bottoms
        out, an explosion of sparks under the frame.  Only the ultra-fast
        reflexes of a machine could keep the bike upright.  Terminator fights
        for control.

47H     He guns the throttle and the powerful bike roars up beside John's tiny
        Honda.
        Terminator sweeps the kid off his machine with one arm and swings him
        onto the Harley, in front of him.  John's Honda weaves and falls,
        smashing instantly under thundering tires.

        The Harley roars ahead.  It hits eighty.  Ahead is an overpass, and
        supporting it is an abutment which bisects the canal into two
        channels.  The Harley thunders into one channel, which is essentially
        a short tunnel.

47I     The truck can't fit on either side.  Neither can it stop, at that
        speed.  Tires locked, it slides on the muddy concrete and piles into
        the concrete abutment at seventy.

47J     Terminator and John emerge from the tunnel, looking back to see a
        fireball blasting through behind them as the truck's side-tanks
        explode.

        Terminator stops the Harley.  John peers around his body to see the
        destruction.  A burning wheel wobbles out of the tunnel and flops in
        the mud.  Terminator revs the bike and they roar away, down the canal,
        disappearing around a bend.

47K     ANGLE ON THE FIRE, as a column of black smoke rises from the overpass.
        Smoke boils from the tunnel as well, and inside it is a solid wall of
        flame.  A figure appears in the fire.
        Just an outline.  Walking slowly... calmly.
        The figure emerges from the flames.

        It is human-shaped but far from human.  A smooth chrome man.  Not a
        servo-mechanism like Terminator is underneath, with its complex
        hydraulics and cables... this thing is a featureless, liquid chrome
        surface, bending seamlessly at knees and elbows as it walks.  It
        reminds us of mercury.  A mercury man.  Its face is simple, unformed.
        Unruffled by thousand-degree heat, it walks toward us.

        With each step detail returns.
        First the shape and lines of its clothing emerge from the liquid
        chrome surface, then finer details... buttons, facial features,
        ears...

47K     But it's still al chrome.  With its last step, the color returns to
        everything.  It is the cop again... handsome young face, blond hair,
        mustache.  Icy eyes.  It stops and looks around.

        It is a perfect chameleon.  A liquid metal robot.  A killing machine
        with the ultimate skills of mimicry for infiltration of human society.

47L     ANGLE NEARBY, as several police cruisers and a fire truck pull up.
        T-1000 climbs out of the canal behind them.  More cops arrive.  T-1000
        blends in perfectly.  There are always cops at diasters and scenes of
        violence.  We now see why its choice of protective mimicry is so
        perfect.
        It walks among the other cops unnoticed.
        Gets into one of the squad cars.  Starts it and drives away.

48      EXT. SIDE STREET - NIGHT

        Terminator, with John in front of him on the Harley, roars down the
        empty street.  John cranes his neck around to get a look at the
        person/thing he is riding with.  The image is strangely reminiscent
        of father/son, out for an evening ride.

        John is still in shock from the experience of what just happened and
        he's just a ten-year kid, but he's also John Connor who will someday
        rise to greatness, and we see a bit of that in him even know.

                                JOHN
                Whoa... time out.  Stop the bike!

        Terminator immediately complies.  He leans the bike into a turn.
        They head into a nearby alley.

49      EXT. ALLEY

        Terminator and John rolls into the alley and come to a stop.  John
        slides off the gas tank.  Terminator impassively stares at him.  John
        checks him out.  Tentatively speaks.

                                JOHN
                Now don't take this the wrong way, but you are
                a terminator, right?

                                TERMINATOR
                Yes.  Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.

                                JOHN
                No way!

        John touches Terminator's skin.  Then the blood on his jacket.
        His mind overloads as the reality of it hits him.

                                JOHN
                Holy shit... you're really real!  I mean...
                whoah!
                        (stepping back)
                You're, uh... like a machine underneath, right...
                but sort of alive outside?

                                TERMINATOR
                I'm a cybernetic organism.  Living tissue over
                a metal endoskeleton.

                                JOHN
                This in intense.  Get a grip, John.  Okay, uh...
                you're not here to kill me... I figured that part
                out for myself.  So what's the deal?

                                TERMINATOR
                My mission is to protect you.

                                JOHN
                Yeah?  Who sent you?

                                TERMINATOR
                You did.  Thirty years from now you reprogrammed
                me to be your protector here, in this time.

        John gives him an amazed look.

                                JOHN
                This is deep.

50      EXT. STREET - NIGHT

        John and Terminator on the bike again, weaving through the side
        streets.  They blend into the evening traffic.  In the darkness,
        Terminator's wounds are not readily visible.  John cranes his head up
        and back.

                                JOHN
                So this other guy?  He's a terminator too,
                right, like you?

                                TERMINATOR
                Not like me.  A T-1000.  Advanced prototype.
                A mimetic polyalloy.

                                JOHN
                What does that mean?

                                TERMINATOR
                Liquid metal.

                                JOHN
                Radical.

                                TERMINATOR
                You are targeted for termination.  The T-1000
                will not stop until it complete its mission.
                Ever.

        John mulls that over.

                                JOHN
                Where we going?

                                TERMINATOR
                We have to leave the city, immediately.  And
                avoid the authorities.

                                JOHN
                Can I stop by my house?

                                TERMINATOR
                Negative.  The T-1000 will definitely try to
                reacquire you there.

                                JOHN
                You sure?

                                TERMINATOR
                I would.

                                                CUT TO:

51      EXT. PAYPHONE

        John is quickly going through his pockets for change.  He has plenty
        of bills but no quarters.

                                JOHN
                Look, Todd and Janelle are dicks but I gotta
                warn them.  Shit!  You got a quarter?

        Terminator reaches past John and smashes the cover plate off the
        phone's cash box with the heel of his hand.  A shower of change
        tumbles out.  Terminator hands one to John.  John dials.

52      INT. VOIGHT HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

        Janelle Voight picks up the kitchen phone and cradles it with her
        shoulder which she continues to chop vegetables with a large knife.
        She answers sweetly.

                                JANELLE
                Hello?

                                JOHN
                        (filtered through phone)
                Janelle?  It's me.

        In the backyard, John's German Shepherd is going bonkers, barking at
        something.

                                JANELLE
                John?  Where are you, honey?  It's late.  You
                should come home, dear.  I'm making a casserole.

        AT THE PAYPHONE.  John listens, an odd look on his face.  He covers
        the phone's mouthpiece and turns to Terminator.

                                JOHN
                        (whispering)
                Something's wrong.  She's never this nice.

        IN THE VOIGHTS' KITCHEN.  Todd comes through the kitchen's back door.
        Just home from work.  He ignores Janelle and opens the fridge.  Grabs
        a carton of milk.  Takes a sip.  Frowns at the dog's barking.

                                TODD
                What the hell's the goddamn dog barking at?
                SHUT UP, YOU MUTT!

        TIGHT ON JANELLE as Todd growls around the kitchen behind her.  He
        passes OUT OF FRAME next to her.  Janelle switches the phone to her
        other hand then... THUNK!  Her free hand seems to do something out of
        frame.  There is a gurgling, and the sound of liquid dribbling onto
        the floor. (Don't go away.  We'll find out what happened in a moment)

        AT THE PAYPHONE

                                JOHN
                The dog's really barking.  Maybe it's already
                there.  What should I do?

        Terminator takes the phone from John's hand.  Janelle's voice is
        floating through the receiver.

                                JANELLE
                        (filtered)
                John?  John, are you okay?

        Terminator speaks into the phone in a perfect imitation of John's
        voice...

                                TERMINATOR
                        (in John's voice)
                I'm right here.  I'm fine.
                        (to John, a whisper)
                What's the dog's name?

                                JOHN
                Max.

        Terminator nods.  Speaks into the phone.

                                TERMINATOR
                Hey, Janelle, what's wrong with Wolfy?  I can
                hear him barking.  Is he okay?

                                JANELLE
                        (filtered)
                Wolfy's fine, honey.  Where are you?

        Terminator unceremoniously hangs up the phone.  Turns to John.

                                TERMINATOR
                Your foster parents are dead.  Let's go.

        Terminator heads for the bike.  John, shocked, stares after him.

53      INT. VOIGHT HOUSE/KITCHEN

        Janelle hangs up the phone.  Her expression is neutral.  Calm.

        PAN OVER along her arm, which is stretched out straight from the
        shoulder.  Partway along its length her arm has turned smoothly into
        something else... a metal cylinder which tapers into a sword-like
        spike.  Now we see Todd Voight PINNED TO A KITCHEN CABINET by the
        spike which has punched through his milk carton, through his mouth
        and exits the back of his head into the cabinet door.  His eyes are
        glassy and lifeless.

        The spike is withdrawn -- SWIISHHTT! -- so rapidly, Todd is actually
        standing there a second before he slumps out of sight.  THUMP.
53A     Janelle doesn't bat an eye as the spike smoothly changes shape and
        color, transforming back into a hand, and then...

53B     JANELLE CHANGES rapidly into the COP we now know as the T-1000.  The
        change has liquid quality.  T-1000 opens the back door.

54      EXT. VOIGHT HOUSE/BACKYARD - NIGHT

        T-1000 approaches the big German Shepherd, which slinks away from it,
        barking in fear.  T-1000 walk right into CLOSE UP.  Reaches down, OUT
        OF FRAME.  We hear that sickening THUNK followed by a shrill YELP.
        Then T-1000's hand snaps up INTO FRAME holding a bloody dog collar.
        The tag reads "MAX".
        T-1000 nods thoughtfully.  Heads back to the house.

55      EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

        Dark.  Off a quiet street.  Terminator stands near the Harley,
        watching John pace before him.  John's brain is calling time-out.
        This is all too weird.

                                JOHN
                I need a minute here, okay?  You're telling me
                it can imitate anything it touches?

                                TERMINATOR
                Anything it samples by physical contact.

        John thinks about that, trying to grasp their opponent's parameters.

                                JOHN
                Like it could disguise itself as anything...
                a pack of cigarettes?

                                TERMINATOR
                No.  Only an object of equal size.

        John's still reeling from meeting one terminator, which now seems
        downright conventional next to the exotic new model.

                                JOHN
                Well, why doesn't become a bomb or something to
                get me?

                                TERMINATOR
                It can't form complex machines.  Guns and
                explosives have chemicals, moving parts.  It
                doesn't work that way.  But it can form solid
                metal shapes.

56      INT. VOIGHT HOUSE - NIGHT

        T-1000 walks down the dark hall.  It passes the bathroom and we see
        the real Janelle's legs through the half-open door.  The shower is
        running.  Her blood mixes with water on the white tile floor.

56A     In John's bedroom the T-1000 begins searching methodically in the
        dark.
        Calmly and dispassionately ripping the room apart for any clues that
        could lead it to its target.  T-1000 finds a box of audio cassettes
        marked "Messages from Mom".  In it are some letters, and envelopes
        filled with snapshots.  It begins looking through some of the
        photos...

        SHOT OF JOHN AND SARAH during the missing years.  Sarah in olive
        cammos with an RPG 7 grenade launcher, teaching John how to aim.
        Sarah with a group of military-clad Guatemalan men, standing next to
        cases of Stinger missiles.  John and Sarah in a Contra camp, deep in
        the mountains.

57      EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

        John is now sitting on the curb, lost in stunned thought.  Terminator
        stands above him, watching the street like a Doberman.  He glances
        down at John.

                                JOHN
                We spent a lot of time in Nicaragua... places
                like that.  For a while she was with this crazy
                ex-Green Beret guy, running guns.  Then there
                were some other guys.  She'd shack up with
                anybody she could learn from.  So then she
                could teach me how to be this great military
                leader.  Then she gets busted and it's like...
                sorry kid, your mom's a psycho.  Didn't you
                know?  It's like... everything I'd been brought
                up to believe was just made-up fantasy, right?
                I hated her for that.
                        (he looks up)
                But everything she said was true.
                        (he stands)
                We gotta get her out of there.

                                TERMINATOR
                Negative.  The T-1000's highest probability for
                success now would be to copy Sarah Connor and
                wait for you to make contact with her.

                                JOHN
                Oh, great.  And what happens to her?

        Terminator's reply is matter-of-fact.

                                TERMINATOR
                Typically, the subject being copied is
                terminated.

                                JOHN
                TERMINATED!?  Shit!  Why didn't you tell me?
                We gotta right now!

                                TERMINATOR
                Negative.  She is not a mission priority.

                                JOHN
                Yeah, well fuck you, she's a priority to me!

        John strides away.  Terminator goes after him and grabs him arm.
        John struggles against the grip.  Which doesn't do him much good.

                                JOHN
                Hey, goddammit!  What's your problem?

        Starts dragging John back to the bike.  John spots a couple of
        collage-age slab-o-meat JOCK-TYPES across the street and starts
        yelling to them.

                                JOHN
                Help!  HELP!!  I'm being kidnapped!  Get this
                psycho off of me!

        The TWO JOCKS start toward him.  John yells in outrage to Terminator.

                                JOHN
                Let go of me!!

        To his surprise, Terminator's hand opens so fast John falls right on
        his butt.
        He looks up at the open hand.

                                JOHN
                Oww!  Why'd you do that?

                                TERMINATOR
                You told me to.

        John stares at him in amazement as he realizes...

                                JOHN
                You have to do what I say?!

                                TERMINATOR
                That is one of my mission parameters.

                                JOHN
                Prove it... stand on one foot.

        Terminator expressionlessly lifts one leg.
        John grins.  He's the first on his block...

                                JOHN
                Cool!  My own terminator.  This is great!

        The two guys get there and look at Terminator standing there calmly
        with one leg up in the air.  This big guy in black leather and dark
        glasses, standing like a statue.

                                FIRST JOCK
                Hey, kid.  You okay?

        John turns to him.  No longer needing to be rescued.

                                JOHN
                Take a hike, bozo.

                                FIRST JOCK
                Yeah?  Fuck you, you little dipshit.

                                JOHN
                Dipshit?  Did you say dipshit?!
                        (to Terminator)
                Grab this guy.

        Terminator complies instantly, hoisting him one-handed by the collar.
        the guy's legs are pinwheeling.

                                JOHN
                Now who's the dipshit, you jock douchebag?

        Immediately, things get out of hand.  The guy's friend jumps behind
        Terminator and tries to grab him in a full nelson --
        Terminator throws the first guy across the hood of a car --
        Grabs the second by the hair, whips out his .45 in a quick blur, and
        aims the muzzle at the guy's forehead.
        John grabs Terminator's arm with a yell as he pulls the trigger --
        John's weight is just enough to deflect the gun a few inches.  The
        guy flinches, stunned by the K-BOOM next to his ear.  He stares,
        shocked.  Pissing himself.  John is freaking out, too.
        He screams at Terminator.

                                JOHN
                Put the gun down!  NOW!!

        Terminator sets the .45 on the sidewalk.  John scoops it up fast then
        turns to the shocked civilians, who can't believe what just happened.

                                JOHN
                Walk away.

        They do.  Fast.  John grabs Terminator by the arm and tugs him toward
        the bike.  John still holds the gun, reluctant to give it back.

                                JOHN
                Jesus... you were gonna kill that guy!

                                TERMINATOR
                Of course.  I'm a terminator.

        John stares at him.  Having your own terminator just became a little
        bit less fun to him.

                                JOHN
                Listen to me, very carefully, okay?  You're not
                a terminator any more.  Alright?  You got that?
                You can't just go around killing people!

                                TERMINATOR
                Why?

                                JOHN
                Whattaya mean, why?  'Cause you can't!

                                TERMINATOR
                Why?

                                JOHN
                You just can't, okay?  Trust me on this.

        Terminator doesn't get it.  John just stares at him.  Frightened at
        what just almost happened.  He gets a glimpse of the responsibility
        that comes with power.  Finally he hands the .45 back to Terminator,
        who puts it away.

                                JOHN
                Look, I'm gonna go get my mom.  You wanna come
                along, that's fine with me.

                                                CUT TO:

58      INT. VOIGHT HOUSE/BEDROOM - NIGHT

        T-1000 finds an envelope... a letter from Sarah to John sent since
        she's been at Pescadero State Hospital.  It reads the return address
        on the envelope.  It has what it needs.  It picks up a tape player
        and the battered shoebox full of Sarah's tapes and exits.

                                                CUT TO:

59      CLOSE ON A BLACK & WHITE PHOTOGRAPH.  The image is a nightmare from
        the past.  It is a surveillance camera still-frame from the L.A.
        police station where the first terminator made such an impression in
        1984.  We see the blurry forms of the cop frozen in the emergency
        lights of a burning corridor.

        A black-clad figure stands at the end of the corridor.  The guy has
        short-cropped hair and dark glasses.  An AR-80 assault rifle in one
        hand, and a 12-gauge in the other -- holding them both like toy
        pistols.
        ANOTHER PHOTO is slapped on top of the first.  Another still-frame
        blow-up is placed over the last.  Terminator looms in CLOSEUP.

                                DETECTIVE WEATHERSBY (O.S.)
                These were taken at the West Highland police
                station in 1984.  You were there.

        WIDER.  We're in --

59A     INT. INTERVIEW ROOM/PESCADERO - NIGHT

        The photos are lying on the table in front of Sarah, placed there by
        DETECTIVE WEATHERSBY.  His partner DET. MOSSBERG, and Dr. Silberman,
        sit at the table as well.  Two uniformed cops, plus Douglas, stand by
        the door.  Sarah stares listlessly at the top photo.  She's
        withdrawn, haggard... drugged-looking.

                                MOSSBERG
                He killed seventeen police officers that night.
                Recognize him?

        Weathersby slaps another black-and-white eight-by-ten on the table.
        A closeup of Terminator taken by the Japanese tourist at the mall.
        It's the same face.

                                MOSSBERG
                This one was taken by a Japanese tourist today.

        Sarah doesn't react.  It's hard to tell she's thinking.  Whether she's
        up hope or is just in a drugged stupor.

                                WEATHERSBY
                Ms. Connor, you've been told that your son's
                missing.  His foster parents have been murdered,
                and we know this guy's involved.  Talk to us.
                Don't you care?

        Sarah stares up at him.  A cold and empty stare.  He glances at
        Silberman.
        Then at his partner.

                                MOSSBERG
                We're wasting out time.

        One of the uniformed cops opens the door and Mossberg strides into
        the hall.  Weathersby and the two uniforms follow him out, with
        Silberman right behind.

                                SILBERMAN
                Sorry, gentleman...

        TIGHT ON SARAH, slumped under the bright lights.  Totally out of it.
        Then we see her hand, creeping along the edge of the table toward the
        stack of photos.  She slips off the paper clip binding the stills
        together, and hides it between her fingers.  Douglas jerks her up by
        the arms and leads her out.

                                                CUT TO:

60      INT. SARAH'S CELL

        Douglas inches up the last of Sarah's restraints.  Then her leans
        over her... looking down.  Even wrecked as she is, we see the beauty
        in her face.  He bends down.  We think he's going to kiss her.
        Instead he runs his tongue across her face like a dog would.  She
        seems not to even see him.  Her dull eyes past him.  He can't
        provoke a reaction.  Even here, strapped down, the two of them alone,
        she give him no superiority.  He smirks and leaves.  We hear the
        sound of his night-stick tapping its way down the corridor, growing
        fainter.

        Sarah's eyes snap suddenly alert.  There is intensity and resolve in
        them.  She slips the paper clip out from between her fingers and
        awkwardly spreads it open into a straight piece of wire.  With slow,
        painful concentration she moves it toward the lock of the restraints
        that bind her wrists to the bed at her sides.

                                                CUT TO:

61      EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

        Terminator and John charge through the night on the Harley.
        Streetlights flare past them like comets.  Two serious guys with a
        mission.  One a ten-year old kid, the other a half-man/half-machine
        cyborg from the post-Apocalyptic future.

                                                CUT TO:

62      INT. SARAH'S CELL

        TIGHT ON RESTRAINT LOCK as it unlatches... successfully picked by
        Sarah's paper clip.  This is not an easy thing to do.  But Sarah
        taught herself a lot of things in her years of hiding.

        SARAH, her hands free, sits up and releases the Velcro straps on her
        feet.  She rolls off the bed and we see her in a whole new light.
        She is totally alert, almost feral in her movements.

                                                CUT TO:

63      EXT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE

        GUARD SHACK.  A bored security guard glances up as an LAPD black-and-
        white pulls up.  He raises the barricade and nods at the T-1000/cop
        as it passes.

        THE CRUISER pulls in next to the other police vehicles.  The T-1000
        walks toward the main entrance.

                                                CUT TO:

64      INT. SARAH'S CELL/CORRIDOR

        Sarah is using the paper clip on the door lock.  She hears an echoing
        tapping sound.  It's getting louder, coming her way.  She goes back
        to work on the lock.

65      IN THE CORRIDOR.  Douglas the attendant is tapping his stick along
        the wall like he does every night on his rounds.  He shines a little
        mag-light in the windows of the cells as he passes, barely slowing.

65A     He rounds the corner.  His footsteps echo in the dark hallway.
        The tip of the stick hits the wall.
        Tap, tap, tap... getting closer to Sarah's cell.  He stops at the
        door.  He is about to shine his light in when he notices that a
        utility closet across the hall is open.  He goes to shut it,
        absently flicking his light into the dark closet.  He notices
        something strange among the buckets and cleaning supplies.  A mop lies
        on the floor, with its handle snapped off about halfway up.  The
        other half is missing.

        Douglas ponders this for half a second, then hears a SOUND behind him
        and spins around.  The sound he heard was Sarah's cell door.
        The missing two feet of MOP HANDLE fill his vision as it CRACKS
        viciously across the bridge of his nose.

        250 pounds of doughy attendant hit the floor like a sack of cement.
        Sarah slams the makeshift baton down expertly across the back of his
        head, bouncing him off the linoleum.  Lights out, Douglas.
        She drags him into her cell and locks him in with his own keys.  Then
        swaps her mop-handle for his nice heavy night-stick.

65B     Sarah moves down the dark corridor, cat-stepping in her bare feet.
        She holds the baton like a pro, laid back along the forearm, police-
        style.  She looks dangerous.

                                                CUT TO:

66      INT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE/CORRIDOR

        A long corridor ends at a reception area, which is closed, and a
        NIGHT RECEIVING DESK, which is a glass window where they can buzz you
        in through a heavy door.  A NIGHT NURSE types at a desk nearby.  She
        looks up at the sound of footsteps and sees a young cop (T-1000)
        walking toward her.

                                T-1000
                You have a Sarah Connor here?

        She assumes he's with the other cops.  Smiles.

                                NIGHT NURSE
                Running late, aren't you?

        She turns to the inner door to buzz him in and sees Silberman and the
        cops coming toward the door from the other side.

                                NIGHT NURSE
                Your friends are on their way out now...

        When she turns back to the window, T-1000's no longer there.  She
        goes to the counter and leans out to see if he's at the drinking
        fountain or someplace.  No.  Reception is empty.  And so is the long
        corridor beyond.  She frowns.  Too weird.

66A     Silberman comes through the solenoid door with Mossberg and
        Weathersby, the two uniformed cops, and the hospital security guard.
        The guard retrieves his 9mm pistol from a lock-out box behind the
        night desk.  Silberman faces him.

                                SILBERMAN
                Lewis, see these gentleman out and them lock
                up for the night.

        The security guard nods.  Silberman goes back into the secure area of
        the hospital and the cops walk down the long corridor to the main
        doors.  No sign of T-1000.  Mossberg and the other cops exit, and
        the guard locks the door behind them.

66B     The guard walks slowly back along the long corridor.  The hall is
        dark, with the light at the night desk far ahead like a sanctuary.
        His footsteps ring hollowly on the tile floor.  His keys jingle.

66C     ANGLE ON FLOOR as the guard's feet pass through FRAME.  An instant
        later the floor starts to move.
        It shivers and bulges upward like a liquid mass, still retaining the
        two-tone checkerboard of the tile.  It hunches up silently into a
        quivering shadow in the darkness past the guard.

66D     Up ahead we hear typing.  The night nurse has her back to us, working.
        The guard stops as the drinking fountain.  Bends to take a sip.
        Behind him the fluid mass as reaches six feet of height and begins to
        resolve rapidly into a human figure.  It loses the color and texture
        of the tile and becomes... THE GUARD.

        T-1000's mass has been spread out a quarter of an inch thick over
        several square yards of floor.  The guard walked over the T-1000, and
        his structure was sampled that instant.  Now we see it drawing in and
        pulling up to form the figure of the guard.

        The T-1000/Guard's feet are the last to form, the last of the "liquid
        floor" pulling in to form shiny black guard shoes.  The shoes detach
        with a faint sucking sound from the real floor as the T-1000/Guard
        takes its first step.

66E     The real guard spins at the sound of footsteps to see... himself.
        He has one deeply disturbing moment to consider the ramifications of
        that.  Then he sees his double calmly raise its hand and,
        inexplicably, points his right index finger directly at the real
        guard's face, about a foot away.  In a split second, the finger
        spears out, elongating into a thin steel rod which snaps out like a
        stiletto, slamming into the guard's eye.
        It punches into the corner of the eye, past the eyeball like a trans-
        orbital lobotomy tool, and emerges from the back of the guard's skull.

        Life quietly empties from the guard's face.  He is dead weight,
        hanging from the rod/finger with suddenly reacts -- SSSNICK.  As the
        guard slumps, the T-1000 takes his weight easily with one hand and
        walks him, like it's carrying a suit on a hanger, back toward the
        night desk.  The wounds are so tiny, no blood drips onto the floor.

66F     ON THE NIGHT NURSE, glancing up as the T-1000/Guard walks past,
        dragging something casually which she can't see because it's below
        the countertop.

                                NIGHT NURSE
                Whatcha got, Lewis?

                                T-1000/GUARD
                Just some trash.

        She nods, uninterested.  Keeps typing.  T-1000 moves past, dragging
        the unseen guard toward a closet down the hall from the night
        receiving station.  T-1000/Guard removes the Browning High-Power
        pistol and the keys from the real guard's belt, then stuffs the body
        into the utility closet.

66G     INT. CORRIDOR/NIGHT RECEIVING DESK

        T-1000/Guard comes back out and glances at the nurse.

                                T-1000/GUARD
                All set.

        She glances toward it.  Sees the Beretta in its holster.

                                NIGHT NURSE
                Gotta check the gun first, Lewis.

                                T-1000/GUARD
                Yeah, sorry.

        T-1000 opens the locker and blocks it from her view with its body as
        it mimes putting the gun in.

66H     CLOSE ANGLE ON T-1000'S CHEST, from inside the locker.  Instead of
        setting the gun in the locker, it inserts the pistol into it own
        chest, where is disappears inside like it was dropped into a pot of
        hot fudge.  It withdraws its hand.  The chest is once again a surface
        that looks like cloth, buttons, name-tag etc.  You'd ever guess it was
        really an intelligent liquid metal.

        T-1000 slams the locker door and waits as the nurse hits the button
        unlocking the door with a BUZZ-CLACK.  T-1000/Guard goes through.

                                                CUT TO:

67      INT. ISOLATION SECURITY CHECKPOINT

        A small room before a short SALLY-PORT corridor designed to prevent
        violent inmates from making a run for it.  There are doors at each
        end.  The first one is barred like a jail-cell door, and the second
        is a steel fire door.  The attendants have a video monitor with which
        they can see the corridor on the other side of the doors.

        The two bored attendants barely notice the T-1000/Guard as it
        approaches.  Looks briefly at a chart next to the door, seeing
        SARAH CONNOR is in #19.

67A     IN THE ISOLATION WARD, the T-1000 passes a nurses' station which looks
        a cage, walled in by heavy metal mesh.  Silberman, leaning in the open
        doorway, is talking to an attendant in the cage.  He doesn't glance
        twice at Lewis the Guard passing by.

68      SARAH, moving like a ghost in the darkened corridor, hears footsteps
        coming and quietly but quickly unlocks a cell next to her with
        Douglas' master key.
68A     She slips into the cell and waits as the footsteps pass.
        We glimpse the T-1000/Guard pass the window.
        She waits as the footsteps fade away.  She looks over.  A female
        inmate, strapped to a bed, watches her with bird-like eyes.  She puts
        a finger to her lips -- SSHHH.  The inmate nods.  Sarah exits.

68B     POV MOVING TOWARD nurse's station.  We hear Silberman's voice,
        reviewing medication with the night attendant.

        ON SILBERMAN, yawning, looking at his watch.
        He turns to go... Sarah is there.
        She slams into him, hurling him through the door into the cage and
        follows him in.  The orderly jumps up, going for his stunner, but she
        nails him with Douglas' baton.  WHAP-WHAP-WHAP!  You can barely see
        the thing she's swinging it so fast.  The guys goes down.

        Silberman lunges for the alarm button and she cracks down hard on his
        arm.  He cries out and grabs his wrist.
        She grabs him by the hair and slams him face down on the desk,
        smacking him behind the knees expertly with the baton.
        His legs buckle and he drops to his knees with his chin on the desk.
        She pins him with one hand.  He face is full of outraged disbelief.

                                SILBERMAN
                You broke my arm!

                                SARAH
                There's 215 bones in the human body, motherfucker.
                That's one.  Now don't move!

68B     Moving rapidly, she whips open a medication drawer and grabs a
        syringe.
        They keep a few of these handy for tranking unruly patients.  She
        jams it into the orderly's butt and fires the whole shot.  Still
        holding the empty syringe, she sees what she need next.
        They keep the toxic cleaning supplies in here to keep the inmates from
        drinking Drano.  She grabs a plastic jug of LIQUID PLUM'R and slams
        it down on the desk inches from Silberman's eyes.

        She jams the empty syringe into the plastic jug.
        Draws back the plunger.  The syringe fills with blue liquid.
        She whips it out of the jug and jams the needle into Silberman's neck.
        His horrified eyes rack toward it.  10 cc's of blue death fill the
        cylinder.
        Her thumb hovers over the plunger.
        She jerks him to his feet by the collar and gets a tight grip on him,
        then hauls him through the door.

69      IN THE CORRIDOR outside cell #19 the T-1000 stops and looks in the
        window.  Douglas, his face a bloody mess, yells to be heard.

                                DOUGLAS
                Open the door!  The goddamn bitch is loose in
                the halls!

        To Douglas' amazement, Lewis the Guard turns impassively and walks
        away, leaving him shouting soundlessly at the window.

                                                CUT TO:

70      EXT. HOSPITAL

        Terminator and John are approaching the guard gate on the Harley.
        They can see the guard inside looks up at the sound of the engine.

                                JOHN
                Now remember, you're not gonna kill anyone,
                right?

                                TERMINATOR
                Right.

        John looks at him.  He's not convinced.

                                JOHN
                Swear.

                                TERMINATOR
                What?

                                JOHN
                Just say "I swear I won't kill anyone."

        John holds his hand up, like he's being sworn in.  Terminator stares
        at John a beat.  Then mimics the gesture.

                                TERMINATOR
                I swear I will not kill anyone.

        Terminator stops the bike and gets off.
        The guard, sensing trouble, has his gun drawn as he comes out of the
        shack.  Terminator walks toward him drawing his .45 smoothly.  BLAM!
        He shoots the guard accurately in the thigh.
        The guy drops, screaming and clutching his leg.
        Terminator kicks the guard's gun away, then smashes the phone in the
        shack with his fist.  He pushes the button to raise the gate and walks
        back to the bike.

                                TERMINATOR
                He'll live.

        Terminator climbs onto the bike.  They drive toward the hospital,
        heading down an ambulance ramp to an underground receiving area.

71      INT. ISOLATION FLOOR

        The attendants at the security checkpoint look up at the monitor as
        someone enters the corridor.  They see Sarah, holding Silberman at
        syringe-point.
        Sarah speaks to them through an intercom on the wall.  Her voice
        comes through the speaker.

                                SARAH
                Open it or he'll be dead before he hits the
                floor.

        The attendants' adrenaline levels just went off the scale.  The first
        attendant shakes him head no.  The amperage here is really high.  The
        second attendant keys the intercom switch.

                                2ND ATTENDANT
                There's no way, Connor.  Let him go.

        Silberman's face is the color of suet.

                                SILBERMAN
                It won't work, Sarah.  You're no killer.  I don't
                believe you'd do it.

        Her voice is a deadly cold hiss.

                                SARAH
                You're already dead, Silberman.  Everybody here
                dies.  You know I believe that.  So don't fuck
                with me!

                                SILBERMAN
                Open the goddamn door!

        The attendants looks at one another.  One of them hits the solenoid
        button.  The far door unlocks.

71A     IN THE LOCKOUT CORRIDOR.  Sarah pushes Silberman ahead of her.
        The nearer, barred door must be unlocked manually.
        One of the attendants cautiously approaches.  Nervously unlocks it.

                                SARAH
                Step back!
        
        He does.  She faces both of them.

                                SARAH
                Down on the floor!  Now!

        They comply.  She comes through with Silberman, giving them a wide
        berth.  Starts backing down the hall away from them, still holding
        her hostage.  She's actually pulling this off.

71B     ANGLE FROM BEHIND HER.  What we can see, but she can't see, it a
        third orderly waiting just around the corner.  He's poised, ready to
        jump her when she comes abreast of him.

        ON SARAH backing up.  She reaches the corner.
        The third attendant lunges, grabbing her syringe-hand.
        Sarah spins on the orderly and catches him across the throat with the
        nightstick.  He loses interest fast, dropping to his knees and
        gagging.  Silberman pulls away, screaming at the top of his lungs

                                SILBERMAN
                Get her!

        They scramble up as Sarah takes off like a shot around the corner.
        One of them hits the panic button and ALARMS begin to sound.

72      IN THE ISOLATION WARD, the T-1000 is looking in at a very stoned
        attendant inside the nurses' station when the alarms shriek through
        the halls.  It reaches into its chest and pulls out the 9mm pistol.
        Heads for the security entrance.

73      IN ANOTHER CORRIDOR in the maze of the vast hospital, Sarah flies
        past us, her bare feet slapping on the cold tiles.  The orderlies
        charge after her.
        She's like an animal in a maze.  She turns the corner, glancing off
        the wall, and sprints on without slowing.  She reaches a steel door.
        Tries it.  Locked.
        Footsteps like a drum solo behind her.

        She fumbles with Douglas' keys, breathing hard.  Jams the master in.
        The orderlies are bearing down on her at full tilt.
        Sarah gets the door open.  Dives through.  Slams it.
        She turns a deadbolt knob just as the first orderly grabs the latch
        on the other side.  He's too late.

        Sarah sees them beyond the window, fumbling with their keys.

73A     Sarah is in another sally-port corridor.  A jail-cell type barred
        door is between her and the corridors of the ward beyond.
        She sprints to the walls of bars, jams her key into the door.
        She unlocks and pulls open this door just as she hears the latch of
        the one she just came through being unlocked.

        She flings herself frantically through the barred door as the first
        orderly comes through behind her.
        She slams the bars shut.  CLANG.
        Her keys are dangling from the lock on the other side from her.
        The orderly is racing at her, white-lipped with rage.

        She reaches back through the bars, turns the key, and purposefully
        snaps it off in the lock.  An instant later the big orderly slams
        against the door, grabbing through the bars for her as she dances
        back just out of reach.
        He lunges against the steel bars, unbelievably pissed off.

        Sarah takes off running, looking back at the frustrated orderlies.
        They're shouting at each other, unable to fit their keys into the
        lock --
        The broken-off key tip makes it impossible to get their keys in.
        Silberman shouts at them.

                                SILBERMAN
                Go around, goddamnit!  Go around!!

        The orderlies run back the way they came, and along a cross-corridor
        to another set of doors.

73B     ON SARAH as she rounds a corner and sees the elevators ahead.
        Now she's home-free.  At a full-tilt sprint, she's nearly there when
        the elevator doors part...

        TERMINATOR steps out... his head swivels to face her.
        Sarah reacts, stricken by the image from her worst nightmares.
        Her eyes go wide as momentum carries her forward.
        Her bare feet slip on the slick tile.  She slams to the floor,
        staring up at the leather-clad figure with the shotgun.

        She loses all semblance of courage and some of her sanity.
        She's not even aware that she is screaming, or what would be
        screaming if she could get the breath to do it.
        In slowed-down dream-time, Sarah scrambles back along the floor like a
        crab, spinning and clawing her way to her feet along the wall.

        She runs like the wind, like in her nightmare.  If she looked back she
        would have seen John step warily out of the corridor behind
        Terminator.  John, however, catches a glimpse of the fleeing Sarah and
        figures out instantly what happened.

                                JOHN
                Mom!!  Wait!

        Sarah doesn't hear.  She has clicked fully into her own nightmare.
        They take off running after Sarah.

73C     She is pelting down the long corridor, back the way she came.  As she
        reaches an intersection with a cross-corridor a white-clad figure
        blurs from that corridor.  The orderly hits her in a flying tackle.
        She skids across the floor, shrieking and struggling.  The other two
        orderlies leap into the fray.

                                SARAH
                No!  Help me!  Goddamnit, it's gonna kill us
                all!!!

        She is shouting, pleading, trying to get them to understand what is
        coming.  They grab her thrashing arms and legs.  They don't even look
        where the out-of-control woman is pointing... back along the corridor.

        They have pinned her to the cold tiles, a ring of faces above her.
        Silberman leans down to her, holding a syringe with a heavy dose of
        trank.  Sarah cranes her neck and sees the dark silhouette of
        Terminator coming up behind them.  It is exactly her nightmare.
        She screams in utter hopelessness.

        Terminator, holding the shotgun in one hand, reaches down and grabs
        one of the orderlies with his other hand.  He hurls the 200-pound
        guys against the far wall of the corridor.  SMACK!  He drops to the
        floor.
        The other two orderlies react instantly, leaping onto the intruder.
        Terminator seems to disappear for a moment under the two big guys.
        Then there is an explosion of white-clad figures, as the orderlies are
        flung outward like they stepped on a land mine.
        One crashes through a window of safety glass and is caught before a
        two-story fall by the outer steel bars.  The other crashes through an
        office door, splintering it into kindling.

        Silberman has jumped to hold Sarah.  He is grabbed by a roll of skin
        at the back of his neck and lifted like a cat.  The doctor feel his
        feet pedaling above the ground.  He looks into the expressionless
        face.  And it hit him.  Sarah was right... this guy isn't human.
        He feels the fabric of reality crumbling.
        Then he feels himself flying through the air.  The wall smacks him,
        then the floor kicks him in the face.  He decides to lie there a
        second.

        Sarah blinks, staring up at the figure looming over her.
        John kneels next to her.

                                JOHN
                Mom, are you okay?

        She looks from Terminator to John.  Back to Terminator.
        Is this a nightmare?  Or has she finally gone truly bad?

        Incredibly, Terminator politely reaches his hand down to her, offering
        to help her up.  The last thing she ever expected to see.

                                TERMINATOR
                Come with me if you want to live.

        The orderlies are stirring.

                                JOHN
                It's all right, Mom.  He's here to help.

        Sarah, is a daze, takes the huge hand in her shaking fingers.
        Terminator lifts her to her feet.

73D     John sees a GUARD standing thirty feet away, on the other side of the
        walls of bars.  John doesn't know what we know, but he knows
        something's not right with this guy.  Terminator turns to follow
        John's gaze.
        The T-1000 had its pistol in its hand, at its side.
        Terminator pushes John behind him.  They start backing up.

73E     The T-1000 walks forward, reaching the bars.  It doesn't stop.
        Its body divides like jello around the bars.  As it squeezes itself
        through like metal playdough, its surface reforms perfectly on our
        side.  We see it deform and squeeze through like a viscous paste
        forced past an obstacle.
        Silberman has recovered enough to be sitting up and watching this.
        That faint snapping sound is his mind.
        There is a CLANK and we see that the guard's gun has caught against
        the bars... the only solid object.  The T-1000 turns its wrist and
        tries again, slipping the gun endwise through the gap.

73F     Sarah is agape.  Not reacting.  It's been a heavy day for her.
        Terminator grabs John by the seat of his pants and hooks him up onto
        his back.  John grabs him around the neck.  Terminator raises the
        shotgun and starts backing up.

                                TERMINATOR
                Go!  Run!

        Sarah doesn't need to be told twice.
        T-1000 walks toward them, opening fire with the Browning Hi-Power.
        Terminator straight-arms the 12-guage like a pistol and FIRES.
        The stunned orderlies flop face down on the floor as the corridor is
        filled with high-velocity lead.  One of them, stupidly running for the
        cross-corridor, gets hit by the T-1000.

        Terminator is hammered by several slugs, and the T-1000 is cratered
        by two buckshots hits.  It staggers, but comes on.  In the craters
        we see bright mercury before they close and reseal, disappearing in a
        second.

73G     Terminator makes it around the corner and breaks into a run.  Ahead,
        Sarah is already at the elevator.  Terminator and John pile in and
        John slaps the button for "Garage Level".

        The doors start to close.  T-1000 clears the corner.
        Terminator slams John and Sarah back against the side walls as the
        T-1000 charges at them, rapid firing the Browning.
        The rounds hit the steel doors as they close.
        T-1000 keeps pumping them at the closing gap.
73H     Inside, they see the backside of the doors denting with the hits that
        are punching holes in the other side.

73I     The Browning locks open, empty.  T-1000 drops it without a glance
        back.  The doors close.  K-WHAM!  The T-1000 hits them a split second
        later.  The elevator hasn't moved yet.  SSWWIKK!

73J     A sword-like blade rams through in between the doors, forcing them
        open.  Terminator jams the shotgun through the widening gap.  Punches
        the muzzle right INTO T-1000's face -- BOOM!!
73K     We get a glimpse of the T-1000's head blown apart by the blast.  It
        is hurtled back.  The doors close.  The car descends.

73L     ON THE T-1000, outside the elevator.  Its head, which is blown apart
        into two doughy masses lying on the shoulders, reforms quickly.
        There is no trace of the injury.  It sees the closed door and jams its
        hands between them, its fingertips becoming pry-bars.  It pulls the
        doors apart with inhuman strength
73M     and LEAPS INTO THE OPEN SHAFT.
        It falls two floors and...

74      IN THE ELEVATOR.  Out trio hears a loud THUMP on the roof.
        Terminator, reloading the shotgun, looks up.
        Sarah grabs the .45 from his waistband and aims it at the ceiling.
        BEAT...
        Then CLANGG!! a swordlike shaft punches through the ceiling and spears
        down four feet into the elevator car.
        It is inches from Sarah's face.
        She opens fire, BAM-BAM-BAM -- right through the roof.
        Lighting-fast the lance withdraws and thrusts down again, slashing
        Terminator's jacket, and missing John by inches.
        Terminator chambers a round and K-BOOM! the 12-guage opens a hole in
        the ceiling.
        Terminator rocks out in a fury of firing/cocking/firing as the metal
        shafts slash down again and again.  Sarah yells in pain as one of them
        slices open her upper arm.

75      The doors open.  Sarah pulls John out as soon as the gap is wide
        enough.
        They emerge into the basement.  We see the Harley parked nearby.

        Terminator, in a rearguard action, fires another blast through the
        ceiling and runs out.  He throws his leg over the Harley, kicks it to
        life with one powerful stroke and then whips something out of the
        inner pocket of his jacket.  He throws it to John.  A road flare!?

76      In the elevator, the T-1000 has bashed a hole in the ceiling big
        enough to...
        Pour itself through.
        A massive blob of mercury extrudes from the opening.  The mass drops
        through the hole, down out of frame, then comes back up into frame
        as Officer X.

        It seems to need just a second to get its mental act together after
        doing this king of taffy-pull with itself.  It opens its eyes and
        sees --

77      TERMINATOR, the shot gun held in his teeth, astride the roaring
        Harley twenty feet away.  Terminator twists the throttle and pops the
        clutch.
        The back tire screams on the concrete.  The front wheel lifts off the
        ground and the heavy bike launches in a thundering wheelie.

        Terminator gets off just before the bike hurtles into the elevator.
        The Harley slams the T-1000 square and smashes it right through the
        back wall of the elevator.
        Terminator rolls to his feet.
        Johns strikes the flare on the concrete.  Tosses it.
        Terminator catches the life flare with one hand.
        Levels the shotgun with the other.
        With his last round he blows a big hole in the bike's gas tank.
        Gas splashes everywhere, covering the struggling T-1000.
        Terminator tosses the flare.  KA-VOOOM!

        The explosion knocks Terminator backward off his feet, enveloping him
        in the fireball.  He gets up, smoking, and runs after John and Sarah
        toward the exit ramp.

78      AT THE EXIT RAMP.  They are partway up when a blue-and-white hospital
        security car comes screeching down the other way.
        Without breaking stride Sarah runs right at the car.  It skids to a
        shrieking halt.  She's in the guy's face with the .45 in both hands.

                                SARAH
                Out of the car!!

        The patrol guy is thinking what he can try when BLAM! she puts a round
        through the glass next to his head.

                                SARAH
                RIGHT NOW!

        The door opens and the guy is coming out with his hands up as
        Terminator arrives.  The cyborg flings the rent-a-cop out of the way
        and slides behind the wheel.  Sarah gets John into the back seat and
        dives into the front passenger seat as --

78A     Terminator slams the car into reverse and punches it, lighting up the
        tires on the slick ramp.
        Terminator hands the shotgun over his shoulder to John and tells him
        to reload.  John pulls some shells from the pocket of his army jacket
        and starts feeding them in.
        Terminator power backward up the ramp, scraping along one wall, barely
        in control.  Because...

79      The T-1000 is running at them out of the inferno below.
        This guy won't quit.  Shifting from chrome mode to cop-form as it
        runs.
        It sprints up the ramp after the retreating car.  T-1000 is gaining.

80      Terminator hands Sarah another magazine for the .45.  She snatches
        it, drops the other out, and slaps in the new one.  Cocks the slide.
        The car backs along the service driveway toward the security gate.
        John hands the shot gun back to Terminator.
        He leans out the window and takes aim at the pursuer.
        The T-1000's face is right in the headlights.
80A     Terminator fires, blowing a hole in its shoulder.  Shiny liquid metal
        visible in the hole, which then closes.
80B     Sarah, half out the passenger window, opens fire.
        The car crashes backward through the security barricade.

                                TERMINATOR
                        (calmly)
                Hang on.

        He cuts the wheel hard.  The car slews into a reverse 180, swapping
        ends with a screech.
        T-1000 is almost on them.
        Terminator punches it.  The car accelerates forward.

80C     T-1000 leaps.  Lands on the trunk.
        Its hand is a metal crowbar slammed down through the trunk lid.
        Feet dragging on the pavement, it slams its other hand down,
        punching another metal hook into the trunk lid, pulling itself up.
        Terminator turns to Sarah.

                                TERMINATOR
                Drive.

        Terminator heaves himself half out the driver's window.  Sarah slaps
        her foot down on the throttle and steers from the passenger side.

80D     T-1000, fully on the car now, holds on with one hook-hand while it
        slams the other into the back window, sweeping away the glass and
        missing John by inches as he ducks.
        It draws back for another swing, lunging forward as --

80E     Terminator whips the shotgun over the roof of the car.
        Fires point-blank.
        Hits the T-1000's arm just above the "hand" which anchors it to the
        car.  The 12-guage blows the arm apart, severing the hook-hand.

80F     T-1000 tumbles backward off the accelerating car.
        John looks out the back window, his eyes wide.
        He sees the T-1000 roll to his feet and continue running.
        But he's dropping way behind now.  Sarah has the car floored and the
        liquid-metal killer won't catch them on foot.

80G     John watches, in awe, as the "crowbar hand", stuck into the trunk
        right in front of him, reverts to the neutral polyalloy... a kind of
        think mercury.  The gray metal slides off the trunk of the car and
        falls onto the road to lie there in a quivering blob.

80H     The car speeds off into the night.
        REVERSE on the T-1000, walking now, coming right up into closeup,
        watching the tail lights recede.  It looks down.

80I     ANGLE ON BLACKTOP, tight on the liquid metal blob.  Next to it is the
        T-1000's shiny cop shoe.  The mercury blob crawls and rejoins the
        main mass, disappearing into the "shoe".

81      INT./EXT. SECURITY CAR

        A GHOST CAR blasts out of the darkness on a long stretch of moonlight
        highway.  Headlights off, the hospital security car punches a hole in
        the wind.

81A     INSIDE THE SPEEDING CAR the energy is still high.  The air is blowing
        in the shattered windows as Terminator drives the car easily by
        electronic night-vision.  His eyes glow faintly red.

                                JOHN
                Can you see anything?

81B     TERMINATOR'S POV.  A monochrome image of the highway lit bright as
        day.

81C     Terminator replies in a matter-of-fact tone.

                                TERMINATOR
                Everything.

                                JOHN
                Cool.

        Sarah looks at Terminator, still not quite believing this is
        happening.  But this is a different Sarah than the waitress of 1984.
        She spends only a second or two dealing with the unbelievable.
        Then she turns to John in the back seat.

                                SARAH
                You okay?

        He nods.  She reaches for John and we think she's going to hug him.
        She starts to rub her hands over him and we realize she's checking for
        injuries, very clinically the way a vet checks a dog for broken bones.

        He pulls away from her.  He hates her always checking him, treating
        him like he might break, like some piece of rare china.

                                JOHN
                I said I was okay.

        Sarah looks at him, exasperated and stern.

                                SARAH
                It was stupid of you to go there.

        John stares at her, surprised.

                                SARAH
                Goddamnit, John, you have to be smarter than
                that.  You're too important!  You can't risk
                yourself, not even for me, do you understand?
                I can take care of myself.  I was doing fine.
                Jesus, John.  You almost got yourself killed.

        We see his chin quiver.  He's a tough kid, but all he really wants is
        for her to love him.  He hasn't had enough years on the planet yet to
        be the man of steel she demands.

                                JOHN
                I... had to get you out of the place... I'm
                sorry, I...

        His face crumples.  He starts to cry.  Sarah gives him a cold stare.

                                SARAH
                Stop it!  Right now!  You can't cry, John.
                Other kids can afford to cry.  You can't.

        He's trying to be brave, he really is.  Terminator turns and sees the
        water leaking from his eyes.  It doesn't make and sense to him.

                                TERMINATOR
                What is wrong with your eyes?

        John turns away, ashamed.  Sarah lets her breath out, realizing how
        keyed up she is.  She turns to Terminator, giving him a wary once-
        over.

                                SARAH
                So what's your story?

                                                CUT TO:

82      EXT. MENTAL HOSPITAL

        The cops have shown up, as they always do.  There are black-and-whites
        everywhere, and ambulances are arriving.  Two cops and an orderly are
        required to subdue poor Doctor Silberman, who is raving at the top of
        his lungs.

                                SILBERMAN
                ... it was all true and we're all going to die
                and the changed, I saw him change!!

        It's quite pathetic.
        A nurse shoots him up with a sedative.  They lead him away.

82A     T-1000 walks unperturbed among the milling cops.  No one notices him.
        It slips into its cruiser and drives off into the night.

83      INT. CAR

        Terminator drives steadily into the black night.

                                SARAH
                This T-1000... what happens when you shoot it?

                                TERMINATOR
                Ballistic penetration shocks it, but only for a
                few seconds.

        Sarah thinks about that.  Then:

                                SARAH
                Can it be destroyed?

                                TERMINATOR
                Unknown.

        They ride along in silence for a few seconds.
        Sarah sees something up ahead, some lonely neon in the blackness.

                                SARAH
                Pull in here.  We have to ditch this car.

84      EXT. SERVICE STATION - NIGHT

        A rundown gas station with a buzzing neon sign and no one around.
        They pull into the drive and slowly cruise past the empty office.  A
        sign in the window says CLOSED SUNDAYS.  They continue around the
        building to the garage's back door.

        AT THE GARAGE DOOR.  Terminator breaks the lock on the roll-up door
        and raises it.  Sarah pulls the security car in out of sight.
        Terminator rolls the door down behind them.

85      INT. GAS STATION

        Dark.  Sarah switches on the single drop-light.  She and Terminator
        look at each other.  Terminator is shot-up and bleeding, and Sarah
        has a vicious slash in her upper arm which was soaked her sleeve with
        blood.

                                SARAH
                You look like handmade shit.

                                TERMINATOR
                So do you.

                                                CUT TO:

86      TIGHT ON FIRST-AID KIT from the office, plus some not-so-oily rags, a
        bottle of rubbing alcohol, a few small tools, and other makeshift
        odds and ends.  Terminator's hand comes into shot.  Sets down a bloody
        rag.  Picks up a clean one.

        WIDER.  Sarah sits on an empty crate.  Terminator's is beside her,
        suturing her wound with some fine wire from the winding of an
        alternator.  Using a pair of needlenose pliers he draws the wire
        through her pale skin with a delicate hand.

                                TERMINATOR
                I have detailed files on human anatomy.

        Sarah stares into his face, inches away, fighting the pain.  She
        doesn't like him being this close to her to begin with, let alone
        carving on her.

                                SARAH
                I'll bet. Makes you a more efficient killer,
                right?

                                TERMINATOR
                Correct.

                                                CUT TO:

87      TIGHT ON TERMINATOR'S BACK.  The leather jacket is riddled with bullet
        holes.  Sarah and John help pull it off, revealing Terminator's
        broad, muscular back beneath.

        WIDER.  John and Sarah stare in amazement.  There are at least twenty
        bullet holes in him.  Back.  Arms.  Legs.  Fortunately they're all
        9mm.  The holes are small and the damage cosmetic.

                                JOHN
                Does it hurt?

                                TERMINATOR
                I sense injuries.  The data could be called
                pain.

        TIGHT ON SARAH AND TERMINATOR.  Sarah starts washing the bullet holes
        in his broad back with alcohol.

                                SARAH
                Will these heal up?

        Terminator nods.  She reaches into the bloody wounds with pliers and
        finds the copper-jacketed bullets, flattening against the armored
        endoskeleton.  Pulls them out.  They CLINK one by one into a glass.

                                SARAH
                That's good.  Because if you can't pass for
                human, you won't be much good to us.

        She concentrates on removing the slugs.  CLINK.  CLINK.

                                JOHN
                How long do you live?  I mean, last?

                                TERMINATOR
                A hundred and twenty years on my existing
                power cell.

        Sarah nods, pulling out another slug.  CLINK.  The glass nearly full
        of flattened bullets.  She begins to sew the holes closed with a few
        wire sutures.  John watches in quiet amazement, the two warriors
        calmly fixing each other.

                                JOHN
                Can you learn?  So you can be... you know.
                More human.  Not such a dork all the time.

        Terminator turns towards him.

                                TERMINATOR
                My CPU is a neural-net processor... a learning
                computer.  But Skynet presets the switch to
                "read-only" when we are sent out alone.

                                SARAH
                        (cynical)
                Doesn't want you thinking too much, huh?

                                TERMINATOR
                No.

                                JOHN
                Can we reset the switch?

                                                CUT TO:

88      E.C.U. OF AN X-ACTO KNIFE cutting into Terminator's scalp at the base
        of his skull.  His voice calmly directs Sarah as she spreads the bloody
        incision and locates the maintenance port for the CPU in the chrome
        skull beneath.

                                TERMINATOR
                Now open the port cover.

        She wipes away the blood and uses the garage-mechanic's air tools to
        unscrew the port cover.

88A     TERMINATOR POV (DIGITIZED) as he watches her work in a mirror they've
        taken from the washroom.  Sarah and John are standing behind him.
        Her hands are covered with blood, like a surgeon's.

                                TERMINATOR
                Hold the CPU by its base tab.  Pull.

        Following the instructions, she reaches in with a pair of tweezers and
        PULLS -- there is a BURST OF STATIC and the screen goes BLACK.

                                                CUT TO:

89      TIGHT ON JOHN AND SARAH looking at what she has removed.  A reddish-
        brown ceramic rectangle with a connector on one end.  About the size
        and shape of a domino.  On close inspection it appears to be made up
        of small cubes connected together.  It is identical to the shattered
        one in the vault at Cyberdyne Systems.  Now we know it is that that
        Miles Dyson values so highly.  The brain of a terminator.

89A     WIDER.  John walks around Terminator and looks at his face.
        Eyes open, he is completely inert.  Dead.

        John lifts his huge hand.  The dead servos whine sullenly as he forces
        them.  It's like rigor mortis.  He releases the hand and it stays in
        the lifted position.  Sarah examines the CPU chip.

                                JOHN
                Can you see the pin switch?

        She ignores him.  See looks at Terminator.
        The back at the chip.
        Then she sets it on the work table and picks up a small sledge hammer.
        John realizes what she is about to do.  Dives at her as the sledge is
        whistling down.

                                JOHN
                No!!!!

        He slaps his hand down over the chip.
        Sarah barely stops the sledge before smashing his fingers.

                                SARAH
                Out of the way, John!

                                JOHN
                No!  Don't kill him!

                                SARAH
                It, John.  Not him.  It.

                                JOHN
                Alright, it!  We need it!

        John keeps his hand right where it is.

                                SARAH
                We're better off by ourselves.

                                JOHN
                But it's the only proof we have to the future...
                about the war and all that.

                                SARAH
                I don't trust it!  These things are hard to
                kill, John, believe me, I know.  We may never
                have this opportunity again.

                                JOHN
                Look, Mom, if I'm supposed to ever be this great
                leader, you should start listening to my
                leadership ideas once in a while.  'Cause if you
                won't, nobody else will.

        Smart kid.  He's got her.  She nods, reluctantly.  He palms the chip
        and studies it minutely.

89B     John takes a pin and moves the almost invisible switch to the other
        position.
        It is now in "write" mode.  Then he grimaces as he inserts the wafer
        back into the slot in Terminator's skull.

89C     TERMINATOR VISION flares back to life in a burst of static.  The image
        forms.  Sarah and John stands behind him in the mirror.

                                TERMINATOR
                Was there a problem?

        John glances sheepishly at Sarah,  Then smiles at Terminator.

                                JOHN
                No problem.  None whatsoever.

                                                CUT TO:

90      JOHN SLEEPING, lying on a pile of rags next to a stack of tires.
        The lights are off.  Sarah sits nearby, cross-legged, he back against
        the wall.
        The .45 is cradles in her lap.  She looks weary, but she won't allow
        herself to sleep with Terminator present.

        By the office windows, in a slash of moonlight, is Terminator.  He
        stands silent and still, watching the night.  Only his eyes move,
        tracking with the occasional car passing on the road.  He figure
        silhouetted and still.

                                                DISSOLVE TO:

91      SAME IMAGE.  Now DAYLIGHT streams in the dusty windows.
        Terminator has not moved.  Faithful machine sentinel.  He turns at a
        sound.  John stirs, waking up.  He squints into the sunlight.  Sarah
        is still awake.  She gets up, wincing at the pain in her arm.

                                                CUT TO:

92      EXT. GAS STATION - DAY (LATER)

        John and Terminator walks to an old Chevy pickup parked behind the
        garage.  The day is clear but windy.  Dust devils chase themselves
        behind the place.  The pickup is locked but Terminator breaks the side
        window with his fist and opens the door.  He and John climb in.

92A     IN THE PICKUP.  Terminator has this trick (which you could do too if
        you had servo-driven steel fingers) where he smashes the cowl around
        a steering column with one blow from the palm of his hand.  When it
        shatters he strips it away with a single move, and then turns the stub
        of the lock-mechanism with his fingertips.  This starts the vehicle.
        It takes about three seconds.

        In fact, he does it so quickly, the truck is running by the time John
        flips down the sun visor.  A set of keys drops out and John catches
        them.  Dangles them in front of Terminator's eyes.

                                JOHN
                Are we learning yet?

92B     Sarah comes out.  She's found a mechanic's coverall inside, used but
        fairly clean.  It doesn't fit her too well, but it's better than the
        stuff from the hospital.  She's still barefoot.
        The sun, which she hasn't seen in months, hurts her eyes,
        Terminator and John pull up in the pickup.  She gets in.

92C                             TERMINATOR
                We need to get as far from the city as possible.

                                SARAH
                Just head south.

                                                CUT TO:

93      INT./EXT. PICKUP TRUCK/HIGHWAY - DAY

        THE OPEN ROAD.  The pickup roars through light traffic down a long
        stretch of highway.  They set three abreast on the bench seat, John
        in between, like some improbable family on a car trip.
        Sarah leans over to get a look at the speedometer.

                                SARAH
                Keep it under sixty-five.  We can't afford to
                be pulled over.

        Terminator backs off the throttle slightly.

                                TERMINATOR
                Affirmative.

                                JOHN
                No, no, no.  You gotta listen to the way people
                talk.  See, you don't say like "Affirmative" or
                some shit like that.  You say... no problemo.

        Terminator nods, filing away the information.  Sarah is ignoring the
        lesson, lost in thought.

                                JOHN
                It someone comes off to you with an attitude,
                you say "eat me"... if you wanna shine them on,
                it's "Hasta la vista, baby".

                                TERMINATOR
                "Hasta la vista, baby"?

                                JOHN
                Yeah, or "later, dickwad."  Or if someone gets
                upset you say "chill out."  Like that.  Or you
                can do combinations.

                                TERMINATOR
                Chill out, dickwad.

                                JOHN
                That's great!  See, you're getting it.

                                TERMINATOR
                No problemo.

                                                CUT TO:

94-95   OMITTED

96      EXT. ROADSIDE STAND/GAS STATION - DAY

        There's a gas pump and a sleazy fast-food stand.  Picnic tables are
        set up at the side of the food stand.  A family sits at one, children
        playing and running about.
96A     The pickup truck pulls into the lot.  Stops at the gas pump.
        Sarah turns to John.

                                SARAH
                You got any cash?

        John pulls what's left of his Ready-Teller money from his pocket.

                                JOHN
                Only a couple hundred bucks.  I'll give you
                half.

        Sarah grabs all of it.  Peels off a twenty, hands it to John.

                                SARAH
                Get some food.

        She opens the truck door and steps out.  John turns to Terminator.

                                JOHN
                No sense of humor.

97      THE ORDERING WINDOW as John and Terminator approach.

                                JOHN
                And that's another thing.  You could lighten up
                a bit, yourself.  This severe routine is getting
                old.  Smile once in a while.

                                TERMINATOR
                Smile?

                                JOHN
                Yeah.  Smile.  You know.  People smile, right?
                Watch.

        Goes to the order window.

                                JOHN
                        (smiling broadly)
                Hi.  Nice place you got here.  How's business?

                                WINDOW WOMAN
                        (stone-faced)
                Gimme a break.

                                JOHN
                        (to Terminator)
                Okay.  Bad example.  Over there, look.

        John points at THREE TEENAGE GUYS standing at a drinking fountain
        nearby.  One of them has said something funny and the others are
        laughing, grinning.

                                JOHN
                Like that.

        TERMINATOR POV (DIGITIZED)  The real-time image continues while a
        replay of one of the guys grinning runs in a window.  It expands, so
        that the guy's mouth fills the window.  Replays again in slow motion.
        A vector-graphic of the lips smiling appears, along with an array of
        symbolic data.

        Terminator tries it.  The result is dismal.  A rictus-like curling of
        the lip.  Terminator's next effort is a marginal improvement.

                                JOHN
                I don't know, maybe you could practice in front
                of a mirror or something.

98      EXT. REST STOP/PICKUP TRUCK - DAY (LATER)

        Sarah and John are eating cheeseburgers and fries, sitting in the
        truck and on the curb respectively.  They are parked away from the
        other families, at the end of the gravel parking area.  Terminator
        is pouring coolant into the radiator.  Sarah is deep in through,
        turning and turning the whole thing in her brain.  John, unable to
        deal with her silence, goes around to where Terminator is working.

98A     John sees two kids playing with machine-gun water pistols nearby,
        viciously squirting each other.

                                FIRST KID
                You're dead!

                                SECOND KID
                Am not!

                                FIRST KID
                Are so!

        John and Terminator watch them rolling on the ground in a fight to the
        death.  Sarah rounds the front of the truck, and sees the kids.  John
        sighs, solemn.  He looks up at the cyborg.

                                JOHN
                We're not gonna make it, are we?  People, I
                mean.

                                TERMINATOR
                It is in your nature to destroy yourselves.

        John nods, depressed.

                                JOHN
                Yeah.  Drag, huh?

                                SARAH
                I need to know how Skynet get built.  Who's
                responsible?

                                TERMINATOR
                The man most directly responsible is Miles Bennet
                Dyson, Director of Special Projects at
                Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.

                                SARAH
                Why him?

                                TERMINATOR
                In a few months he creates a revolutionary
                type of mircoprocessor.

                                SARAH
                Then what?

98B     Terminator closes the hood and gets into the truck as he speaks.

                                TERMINATOR
                In three years Cyberdyne will become the largest

                Uh huh, great.  Then those fat fucks in
                Washington figure, what the hell, let a computer
                run the whole show, right?

                                TERMINATOR
                Basically.

                        out)
                The Skynet funding bill is passed.  The system

                are removed from strategic defense.  Skynet
                begins to learn, at a geometric rate.  It becomes

                In a panic, they try to pull the plug.

                                SARAH
                And Skynet fights back.

        They accelerate back onto the highway.

                                TERMINATOR
                Yes.  It launches its ICBMs against their
                targets in Russia.

                                SARAH
                Why attack Russia?

                                TERMINATOR
                Because Skynet knows the Russian counter-strike
                will remove its enemies here.

                                SARAH
                Jesus.
                        (beat, then)
                How much do you know about Dyson?

                                TERMINATOR
                I have detailed files.

                                SARAH
                I want to know everything.  What he looks like.
                Where he lives.  Everything.

99      INT. DYSON HOUSE - DAY

        Miles Dyson sits at the huge desk in his study.  He is deep in
        thought, tapping away at the keyboard of his home computer terminal.
        Next to desk are racks of sophisticated gear.  On a Sunday morning,
        when most men are relaxing, spending time with their families, Dyson
        is hard at work.

        IN A PROFILE CLOSEUP we see him in deep concentration, his mind
        prowling the labyrinth of his new microprocessor.

        A WOMAN'S FACE ENTERS FRAME soundlessly behind him.  He doesn't hear
        her.  His wife, TARISSA, extends her tongue and traces it down the
        back of his neck.  He smiles and turns to kiss her good morning.
        She's still in her bathrobe, holding coffee.  He's been up for hours.
        He turns and goes back to work, forgetting instantly that she is
        standing there.

        She watches him work, the arcane symbols moving across the screen.
        We see her frustration, her inability to truly enter the magic box
        of his world.

                                TARISSA
                You going to work all day?

                                DYSON
                I'm sorry, baby.  This thing is just kicking my
                ass.  I thought we had it with this one...

        He points to a metal box on his desk, about two feet long.  As
        assembly of small cubes.  It looks like a dinosaur version of
        Terminator's CPU.

                                DYSON
                ... but the output went to shit after three
                seconds.  I'm thinking now it's the way I'm
                matrixing the command hierarchies...

                                TARISSA
                You need a break.  You'll see it clear when you
                come back.

                                DYSON
                I can't

                                TARISSA
                Miles, it's Sunday.  You promised to take the
                kids to Raging Waters today.

                                DYSON
                Oh.  I can't, honey.  I'm on a roll here.

        He takes her hands.  We see a childlike excitement in his face.  He
        wants so badly to share the almost orgasmic thrill of discovery,
        the satisfaction of creation.

                                DYSON
                Baby, this thing is going to blow 'em all away.
                It's a neural-net process --

                                TARISSA
                I know.  You told me.  It's a neural-net
                processor.  It thinks and learns like we do.
                It's superconducting at room temperature.
                Other computer are pocket calculators by
                comparison.
                        (she pulls away from him)
                But why is that so goddamn important, Miles?
                I really need to know, 'cause I feel like I'm
                going crazy here, sometimes.

                                DYSON
                I'm sorry, honey, it's just that I'm thiiis
                close.

        He holds up his thumb and index finger... a fraction of an inch apart.
        She picks up the prototype.  It doesn't look like much.

                                DYSON
                Imagine a jetline with a pilot that never makes
                a mistake, never gets tired, never shows up to
                work with a hangover.
                        (he taps the prototype)
                Meet the pilot.

                                TARISSA
                Why did you marry me, Miles?  Why did we have
                these two children?  You don't need us.  Your
                heart and your mind are in here.
                        (she stares at the metal box
                        in her hands)
                But it doesn't love you like we do.

        He takes the anodized box from her hands and sets it down.  Then he
        puts his hands on her shoulders and kisses her gently.  She acquiesces
        to his kiss.

                                DYSON
                I'm sorry.

        Tarissa glances over his shoulder.  She nods her head toward the
        doorway to the study.  Dyson turns and sees their two kids standing
        there.  Danny (6) and Blythe (4) look rumpled and adorable in their
        PJs.  Dyson wilts at their hopeful expressions.

                                TARISSA
                How about spending some time with your other
                babies?

        Dyson grins. The forces of darkness have lost this round.  He holds
        out his hands and his kids run to him, cheering.

                                                CUT TO:

A100    EXT. DESERT/COMPOUND - DAY

        The desert northwest of Calexico.  Burning under the sun like a
        hallucination.  Heat shimmers the image, mirage-like.
        Terminator turns the pickup off the paved road and barrels along a
        roadbed a sand and gravel, trailing a huge plume of dust.
        A sign at the turnoff says:     CHARON MESA     2 MI
                                        CALEXICO        15 MI

A101    AHEAD is a pathetic oasis of humanity in the vast wasteland, a couple
        of aging house-trailers, surrounded by assorted junk vehicles and
        desert-style trash.  There is a dirt airstrip behind the trailers, and
        a stripped Huey helicopter sitting on block nearby.

        The truck rolls to a stop in a cloud of dust.  The place looks
        deserted.  The door to the nearest trailer bangs in the wind.

                                SARAH
                        (to Terminator and John)
                Stay in the truck.

A102    ANGLE FROM INSIDE ANOTHER TRAILER, NEARBY.
        A DARK FIGURE in the F.G. has an AK-47 trained on the pickup as
        Sarah gets out.

        ON SARAH peering through the backlit dust.
        The sound of wind.  She approaches the trailer.

                                SARAH
                        (in Spanish)
                Enrique?  You here?

        She hears KACHANK! behind her and spins, whipping out her .45 in one
        motion.

        ENRIQUE SALCEDA stands behind a rusting jeep, a 12-gauge pump trained
        on her.  He is mid-forties, a tough Guatemalan with a weathered face
        and heavy mustache.  He wears cowboy boots and a flak vest, no shirt.

                                SALCEDA
                You pretty jumpy, Connor.

        His fierce face breaks into a broad grin.  The shotgun drops to his
        side as he walks toward her.  When he reaches her he hugs her, then
        steps back.

                                SALCEDA
                        (in Spanish)
                Good to see you, Connor.  I knew you'd make it
                back here sooner or later.

        He grins at John as he steps from the truck, and then clocks
        Terminator getting out.

                                SALCEDA
                Oye, Big John!  Que pasa?  Who's your very large
                friend?

                                JOHN
                        (perfect Spanish)
                He's cool, Enrique.  He's... uh... this is my
                Uncle Bob.
                        (to Terminator, in English)
                Uncle Bob, this is Enrique.

        Terminator smiles.  Sort of.  Salceda squints at him,

                                SALCEDA
                Hmmm.  Uncle Bob, huh?  Okay.
                        (yelling)
                Yolanda.  Get out here, we got company.  And
                bring some fucking tequila!

        A thin Guatemalan KID, FRANCO, eighteen or so, comes out of the
        trailer with the AK-47, followed by Salceda's wife, YOLANDA.  She has
        THREE younger children with her, from a five-year-old GIRL, JUANITA,
        to a year-and-half-old BOY.  She waves at John.  They exchange
        greetings in Spanish.  They seem like nice people.
        Terminator looks down at John, next to him.  He says quietly...

                                TERMINATOR
                Uncle Bob?

                                SALCEDA
                        (to Sarah)
                So, Sarahlita, you getting famous, you know
                that?  All over the goddamn TV.

        Salceda rips the cap off the tequila bottle.  The two-year-old toddles
        to Terminator and grabs his pants, sliming them with drool.
        Terminator looks down at the tiny kid, fascinated.  What is it?
        He picks up the child with one huge hand.  Looks at it.  Turns it
        different ways.  Studying it.  Then sets it down.  The kid waddles
        off, a little dizzy.

                                SALCEDA
                Honey, take Pacolito.  Thanks, baby.

        She hands him the tequila and takes the child.  Salceda takes a long
        pull from the Cuervo bottle.

                                SALCEDA
                        (to Terminator)
                Drink?

        Terminator gestures "no" at the proffered bottle, but Sarah grabs it
        and takes a long pull.  She lowers it without expression.  Her eyes
        don't even water.

                                SARAH
                I just came for my stuff.  And I need clothes,
                food, and one of your trucks.

                                SALCEDA
                        (grinning)
                Hey, how about the fillings out of my fucking
                teeth while you're at it?

                                SARAH
                Now, Enrique.
                        (turns to Terminator and John)
                You two are on weapons detail.

                                                CUT TO:

A103    EXT. COMPOUND/BEHIND THE TRAILERS

        There is an aging and rusted Caterpillar sitting behind one of the
        trailers.  John expertly backs it toward Terminator who is holding
        one end of a piece of heavy chain which disappears into the sand.

                                JOHN
                Hook it on.

        Terminator hooks the chain onto the towhook on the back of the
        tractor.  John hits the throttle and the Cat churns its treads,
        pulling some massive load.  A six-by-eight foot sheet of steel plate
        moves slowly under six inches of sand.

        John drags it far enough to reveal... a rectangular hole in the
        ground.  Like the mouth of a tomb.  The kid drops down from the
        tractor and walks to the hole.

                                JOHN
                One thing about my mom... she always plans
                ahead.

A104    INT. WEAPONS CACHE

        From inside the "tomb".  Sunlight slashes down into a cinder-block
        room, less than six feet wide but over twenty long.  Sand spills down
        the steps.  The walls are lined with guns.

        John precedes Terminator into Sarah's weapons cache.  Rifles, pistols,
        rocket launchers, mortars, RPGs, radio gear.  At the far end, boxes
        containing ammo, grenades, etc. are stacked to the ceiling.
        Terminator gets real alert.  Scanning, wondering where to begin.  He
        picks up a MAC-10 machine pistol.  Racks the bolt.

                                TERMINATOR
                Excellent.

                                JOHN
                Yeah, I thought you'd like this place.

A105    EXT. COMPOUND/NEARBY

        Sarah emerges from a trailer.  She has changed.  Boots, black fatigue
        pants, T-shirt.  Shades.  She looks hard.
        Salceda is nearby, packing food and other survival equipment with
        Yolanda.  He looks up as Sarah approaches, and slaps the side of a
        BIG FOUR-BY BRONCO next to him,

                                SALCEDA
                This is the best truck, but the water pump is
                blown.  You got the time to change it out?

                                SARAH
                Yeah.  I'm gonna wait till dark to cross the
                border.
                        (she pulls him away from
                        Yolanda)
                Enrique, it's dangerous for you here.  You get
                out tonight, too, okay?

                                SALCEDA
                Yeah, Saralita.  Sure.
                        (he grins)
                Just drop by any time and totally fuck up my
                life.

        She slaps him on the shoulder.

                                                CUT TO:

A106    INT. WEAPONS CACHE

        Terminator returns from carrying out several cases of ammo.  John is
        selecting rifles from a long rack.

                                JOHN
                See, I grew up in places like this, so I just
                thought it was how people lived... riding
                around in helicopters.  Learning how to blow
                shit up.

        John grabs an AK-47 and racks the bolt with a practiced action.
        Inspects the receiver for wear.  Doesn't like what he sees.  Puts is
        back.  His movement are efficient.  Professional.  Uninterested.

                                JOHN
                Then, when Mom got busted I got put in a
                regular school.  The other kids were, like,
                into Nintendo.

        Terminator has found a Vietnam-era "blooper" M-79 grenade launcher.
        A very crude but effective weapon.  He opens the breech and inspects
        the bore.

                                JOHN
                Are you ever afraid?

        Terminator pauses for a second.  The thought never occurred to him.
        He searches him mind for the answer...

                                TERMINATOR
                No.

        Terminator slings the M-79 and starts looking for the grenades.

                                JOHN
                Not even of dying?

                                TERMINATOR
                No.

                                JOHN
                You don't feel any emotion about it one way
                or the other?

                                TERMINATOR
                No.  I have to stay functional until my mission
                is complete.  Then it doesn't matter.

        John is idly spinning a Sig Saur 9mm pistol on his finger... backwards
        and forwards like Bat Masteron.

                                JOHN
                Yeah.  I have to stay functional too.
                        (sing-songy)
                "I'm too important".

        Terminator pulls back a canvas tarp, revealing a squat, heavy weapon
        with six barrels clustered in a blunt cylinder.  Chain-ammo is fed
        from a canister sitting next to it.  A G.E. MINI-GUN.  The most
        fearsome anti-personnel weapon of the Vietnam era.
        Terminator hefts it.  Looks at John as if to say "Can I?  Please?"

                                JOHN
                It's definitely you.

A107    EXT. COMPOUND - DAY/LATER

        Sarah and John have their weapons and supply selections laided out on
        two battered picnic tables for cleaning and packing.  Maps, radios,
        documents, explosives, detonators... just the basics.  Sarah is field-
        stripping and cleaning guns, very methodical.  There is no wasted
        motion.

        Not far away, John and Terminator are working on the Bronco.  They're
        greasy up to their elbows, lying on their backs under the engine
        compartment, ratcheting bolts into places on the new water pump.

                                JOHN
                There was this one guy that was kinda cool.
                He taught me engines.  Hold this a second.  Mom
                screwed it up, of course.  Sooner or later she'd
                always tell them about Judgment Day and me being
                this world leader and that's be all she wrote.

        John thinks he's being causal, but his longing for some kind of
        parental connection is obvious.

                                TERMINATOR
                Torque wrench please.

                                JOHN
                Here.  I wish I coulda met my real dad.

                                TERMINATOR
                You will.

                                JOHN
                Yeah.  I guess so.  My mom says when I'm, like,
                45, I think, I send him back through time to
                1984.  But right now he hasn't even been born
                yet.  Man, is messes with your head.  Where's
                that other bolt?
                        (Terminator hands it to him)
                Thanks.  Mom and him were only together for one
                night, but she still loves him, I guess.  I see
                her crying sometimes.  She denies it totally,
                of course.  Like she says she got something in
                her eye.

        They crawl out from under the truck into the bright sunlight.

                                TERMINATOR
                Why do you cry?

                                JOHN
                You mean people?  I don't know.  We just cry.
                You know.  When it hurts.

                                TERMINATOR
                Pain causes it?

                                JOHN
                Uh-unh, no, it's different... It's when there's
                nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway.  You
                get it?

                                TERMINATOR
                No.

        Terminator gets into the Bronco and turns the ignition key and the
        engine catches with a roar.

                                JOHN
                Alriight!!  My man!

                                TERMINATOR
                No problemo.

        John grins and does a victorious thumbs up.
        Terminator imitates the gesture awkwardly.
        John laughs and makes him get out of the truck, to try the move again.

A108    SARAH, across the compound, pauses in her work to watch John and
        Terminator.

A109    SARAH'S POV... we don't hear what John and Terminator are saying.  It
        is a soundless pantomime as John is trying to show some other gestures
        to the cyborg.  Trying to get him to walk more casually.  John walks,
        then Terminator tries it, then John gestures wildly, talking very
        fast... explaining the fundamental principles of cool.  They try it
        again.  Continued ad lib as we hear:

                                SARAH (V.O.)
                Watching John with the machine, it was suddenly
                so clear.  The Terminator would never stop, it
                would never leave him... it would always be
                there.  And it would never hurt him, never shout
                at him or get drunk and hit him, or say it
                couldn't spend time with him because it was too
                busy.  And it would die to protect him.  Of all
                the would-be fathers who came and went over the
                years, this thing, this machine, was the only
                one who measured up.  In an insane world, it was
                the sanest choice.

        Sarah clenches her jaw and goes grimly back to work... a strong woman
        made hard and cold by years of hard choices.

A110    EXT. ROAD - DAY

        A police cruiser is parked off the side of a quiet, empty road on the
        outskirts of Los Angeles.  A ribbon of traffic moves steadily by on a
        freeway in the distance.  Nothing stirs around the cruiser except some
        pump-jacks sucking the earth on the hill behind it.

A111    IN THE CRUISER.  The T-1000 sits inside.  John's notes and letters are
        spread out on the seat beside it.  Sarah's voice speaks from a
        cassette deck.  John's tapes.  Her voices mixes with the static filled
        chatter of the radio that T-1000 monitors for any signs of its
        targets.

                                SARAH
                ... if we are ever separated, and can't make
                contact, go to Enrique's airstrip.  I'll
                rendezvous with you there.

        T-1000 whips around and rewinds the tape, replaying the last section.
        It then snaps up the envelope of photos we saw earlier.

        ECU on envelope.  We see the postmark:  "Charon Mesa, Calif."

        TIGHT ON T-1000 staring at the postmark on the envelope.  It glances
        up at the sound of crunching gravel.  In the rear-view it sees a BIKE
        COP pulling onto the shoulder behind it.  The big KAWASAKI 1100 idles
        up next to the T-1000, still seated in the cruiser.

                                BIKE COP
                Howdy.  I saw you pulled over here earlier.
                Everything okay?

                                T-1000
                Everything's fine.  Thanks for checking.
                        (it gets slowly out of
                        the car)
                Since you're here, though, can I talk to you
                a second...

A112    EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY/MINUTES LATER

        The T-1000 thunders along on the Kawasaki 1100, doing about a hundred
        and twenty.  PAN WITH IT until it recedes toward the horizon.

A113    EXT. COMPOUND - DAY (LATE AFTERNOON)

        Sarah sits at the picnic table.  The weapons are cleaned and her work
        is done.  She hasn't slept in twenty-four hours and she seems to have
        the weight of the whole world on her shoulder.
        She draws her knife from its belt sheath.
        Idly starts to carve something on the table top... the letter "N".

A114    NOT FAR AWAY, John and Terminator are packing the Bronco for the trip.

A115    ON SARAH, AT THE TABLE as she looks up from her carving, thinking.
        She watches Salceda's kids playing nearby... wrestling with a mutty
        dog and loving it.  Sarah watches Yolanda walking her toddler by her
        hands.  Backlit, stylized.  She looks over at John.  Loading guns and
        supplies.

A116    ANGLE ON kids playing.

A117    SARAH'S HEAD droops.  She closes her eyes.

A118    TIGHT ON small children playing.  Different ones.
        Wider now, to reveal a playground in a park.  Very idyllic.  A dream
        playground, crowded with laughing children playing on swings, slides,
        and a jungle gym.  It could be the playground we saw melted and frozen
        in the post-nuclear desolation of 2029.  But here the grass is vibrant
        green and the sun is shining.

118A    Sarah, short-haired, looking drab and paramilitary, stands outside the
        playground.  An outsider.  Her fingers are hooked in a chain-link
        fence and she is staring through the fence at the young mothers
        playing with their kids.  A grim-faced harbinger.

118B    Some girls play skip-rope.  Their sing-song weaves through the random
        burbling laughter of the kids.  One of the young mothers walks her
        two-year-old son by the hands.  She is wearing a pink waitress
        uniform.  She turns to us, laughing.
        It is Sarah.  Beautiful.  Radiant.  Sarah from another life,
        uncontaminated by the dark future.  She glances at the strange woman
        beyond the fence.

118C    Grim-faced Sarah presses against the fence.  She starts shouting at
        them in SLOW MOTION.  No sound comes from her mouth.  She grabs the
        fence in frustration, shaking it.  Screaming soundlessly.
        Waitress Sarah's smile falls.  Then returns as her little boy throws
        some sand at her.  She laughs, turns away, as if the woman at the
        fence were a shadow, a trick of light.

118D-118F  OMITTED

118G    THE SKY EXPLODES.  The children ignite like match heads.  Sarah is
        burning, screaming silently, everything silent and overexposed.

118H    THE BLAST WAVE HITS... devouring the cowering mothers and children.
        Sarah's scream merges with the howl of the wind as the shockwave rips
        into her, blasting her apart and she...

119     Wakes up.
        All is quiet and normal.  The children are still playing nearby.  Less
        than fifteen minutes have gone by.

        Bathed in sweat, Sarah sits hunched over the table.
        Every muscle is shaking.  She is gasping.
        Sarah struggles to breathe, running her hand through her hair which is
        soaked with sweat,  She can escape from the hospital, but she can't
        escape from the madness which haunts her.

        She looks down at the words she has carved on the table, amid the
        scrawled hearts and bird-droppings.  They are:  "NO FATE."
        Something changes in her eyes.  She slams her knife down in the table
        top, embedding it deeply in the words.  Then gets up suddenly and
        we --

                                                CUT TO:

A120    LONG LENS on Sarah walking toward us, striding across the compound
        with grim purpose.  She carries a small nylon pack and a CAR-15
        assault rifle.  Her face is an impassive mask.  She has become a
        terminator.

A120A   JOHN LOOKS UP from his work in time to see Sarah throw the rifle
        behind the seat of their stolen pickup, jump in and start it.  She
        slams it in gear.  Salceda walks up to John.

                                SALCEDA
                She said you go south with him...
                        (he points at Terminator)
                ... tonight, like you planned.  She will meet
                you tomorrow in...

        But John is moving, running after her.

                                JOHN
                Mommm!! Wait!!

A120B   MOVING WITH SARAH as she leaves the compound.  We see John running
        after her... yelling.  Can't hear his words.  She looks in the rear-
        view mirror but doesn't slow down.

A121    EXT. COMPOUND - DUSK/MINUTES LATER

        John and Terminator ponders the message carved into the top of the
        picnic table.  Sarah's knife is still embedded there.

                                JOHN
                "No fate."  No fate but what we make.  My father
                told her this... I mean I made him memorize it,
                up in the future, as a message to her --
                Never mind.  Okay, the whole thing goes "The
                future is not set.  There is no fate but what
                we make for ourselves."

                                TERMINATOR
                She intends to change the future somehow.

                                JOHN
                I guess, yeah --
                        (snaps his fingers as it hit him)
                Oh shit!!

                Yeah, gotta be!  Miles Dyson!  She's gonna blow
                him away!

        John motions to Terminator and breaks into a run.

                                JOHN

                This is tactically dangerous.

                Drive faster.

                                TERMINATOR
                The T-1000 has the same files that I do.  It
                could anticipate this move and reacquire you
                at Dyson's house.

                                JOHN
                I don't care.  We've gotta stop her.

                                TERMINATOR
                Killing Dyson might actually prevent the war.

                                JOHN
                I don't care!! There's gotta be another way.
                Haven't you learned anything?!  Haven't you
                figured out why you can't kill people?

        Terminator is still stumped.

                                JOHN
                Look, maybe you don't care if you live or die.
                But everybody's not like that!  Okay?!  We have
                feelings.  We hurt.  We're afraid.  You gotta
                learn this stuff, man, I'm not kidding.  It's

A124    EXT, DYSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

        The house is high-tech and luxurious.  Lots of glass.  Dyson's study
        is lit bluish with the glow of his computer monitors.  He is at the
        terminal, working.  Where else?  We see him clearly in a long shot
        from an embankment behind the house.

        A DARK FIGURE moves into the foreground.  Rack focus to Sarah as she
        turns into profile.  She raises the CAR-15 rifle and begins screwing
        the long heavy cylinder of a sound-suppresser onto the end of the
        barrel.

129A    INT. DYSON HOUSE

        Dyson's kids, Danny and Blythe, are playing in the halls with a radio-
        controlled off-road truck.  Danny drives and Blythe scampers after it,
        trying to catch it.  They stop in the hall outside Dyson's study and
        sees him working at his terminal.  Danny puts a finger to his lips,
        shushing Blythe.  His expression is mischievous.

129B    With the silencer in place, Sarah eases back the bolt and then slips
        it forward, chambering a .223 round.  Then she lies down on the
        embankment.
        He cheek pressed against the cool rifle-stock, she slides one hand
        slowly forward to brace the weapon, taking the weight on her elbow.
        Her other hand slips knowingly to the trigger.

        Her expression is cold, impassive.  She looks through the scope at the
        man in the house.  She feels nothing as she raises the rifle.

        DYSON, in deep thought.  The rhythmic sounds of keys as he works.
        Symbols on the screen shift.

        ON HIS BACK we see the glowing red dot appear.  It is the target dot
        of Sarah's laser designator.  It moves silently up his back toward
        his head.

131     EXT. DYSON HOUSE/EMBANKMENT

        IN EXTREME CLOSEUP we see Sarah's eye at the night-scope.
        TIGHT INSERT on her finger as it tightens on the trigger, taking out
        the slack.  She takes a deep breath and holds it.  Adjusts her
        position minutely.

132     INT. DYSON HOUSE

        The laser dot jiggles on the back of Dyson's neck and then rises,
        centering on the back of his skull.

132A    LOW ANGLE as Danny's Bigfoot truck roars toward us -- FILLING FRAME.
        Thump.  It hits Dyson's foot.  He jerks, startled, and looks down
        as --
        POP!!
132B    His monitor screen is BLOWN OUT spraying his with glass.  He jerks
        back, utterly shocked... and spins to see the huge hole blown through
        the window behind him.  This saves him as K-THUMP! -- the second shot
        blows the top of his high-backed chain into an explosion of stuffing
        an inch from his head.
        Instinctively he dives to the carpet as --

        BLAM BLAM BLAM -- rounds blast through the window, tearing into his
        desk and computer, blowing his keyboard into shrapnel.
132C    With the monitor screen blown out, the room is in darkness.  Sarah
        can't see Dyson now, down behind his desk.  She puts round after round
        into the heavy desk, blasting one side of it into kindling.

132D    Dyson, scared out of his mind, has his face jammed against the carpet,
        terrified to move.  He sees his kids in the hall.

                                DYSON
                Run, kids!  Go!  Run!

132E    IN THE HALL, TARISSA rounds the corner at a dead run.  She sees the
        kids running toward her and grabs them in her arms.  Down the hall,
        in the dark study, she sees Dyson on the floor amid the splinters and
        shrapnel of the continuing fusillade.

                                TARISSA
                Miles!  Oh my God!!

                Stay back!!

132F    ON THE FLOOR, Dyson flinches as chucks of wood and shattered computer
        components shower down on him.  He looks desperately toward the door,
        but knows he'd be totally exposed.  He'd never make it.

133     SARAH's rifle empties with a final CLACK!
        She throws it down and draws her .45 smoothly from a shoulder base.
        She starts toward the house, snapping back the slide on the pistol,
        chambering a round.  She is in a fast, purposeful walk, keeping her
        eyes fixed on the target.  She is utterly determined to kill this man.

134     FROM UNDER THE DESK Dyson can see a sliver in the backyard.  He sees
        Sarah's feet as she strides toward him.  He tenses to make a break for
        the door.

        Sarah raises the pistol, eyes riveted ahead, controlling her
        breathing.  Dyson springs up in a full-tilt sprint.  She tracks him.
        He hooks a foot on the cord of a toppled disk drive.
        BOOM!  Her shot blows apart a lamp where his head was.
        He hits the floor hard, but keeps moving, scrambling forward.

        Crunch of glass behind his as Sarah's dark form is framed in the
        blown-out floor-to-ceiling window.  Dyson leaps toward the hall.
        BOOM!  Her second shot spins him.  He hits the floor in the hallway.
        Tarissa is screaming.  Dyson struggles forward, stunned.  There is a
        .45-caliber hole clean through his left shoulder.  He smears the wall
        with blood as he staggers up.  Looking back, he sees the implacable
        figure behind him, coming on.

        He topples through a doorway as --
        BOOM!  BOOM!  Shots blowing away the molding where he just was.

135     EXT. DYSON HOUSE/STREET

        Terminator and John leap from the jeep, sprinting toward the house.
        The shots sound muffles from outside.

                                JOHN
                Shit, we're too late!

136     INT. HOUSE

        Advancing with Sarah we enter the living area.  Tarissa has Blythe and
        she's screaming at Danny, who has run back to his collapsed father.

                                TARISSA
                Danny!  DANNY!

                                DANNY
                Daaaaddddeeee!

        Danny is pulling at Dyson, crying and screaming, as his father tries
        to stagger forward.  Tarissa drops Blythe and runs back for Dyson,
        grabbing him.  Sarah looms behind them with the pistol aimed.

                                SARAH
                Don't fucking move!  Don't FUCKING MOVE!!
                        (she swings the gun on
                        Tarissa)
                Get on the floor, bitch!  Now!!  Fucking down!
                NOW!!

        Sarah is crazy-eyed now, shaking with the intensity of the moment.
        The kill has gone bad, with screaming kids and the wife involved...
        things she never figured on.  Tarissa drops to the knees, terrified
        as she looks into the muzzle of the gun.  Blythe runs to Dyson and
        hugs him, wailing.

                                BLYTHE
                Don't hurt my father!

                                SARAH
                        (screaming)
                Shut up, kid!  Get out of the way!!

        Dyson looks up, through his pain and incomprehension.  Why is this
        nightmare happening?  The black gun muzzle is a foot from his face.

                                DYSON
                        (gasping)
                Please... let... the kids... go...

                                SARAH
                Shut up!  SHUT UP!!  Motherfucker!  It's all
                your fault!  IT'S YOUR FAULT!!

        We see her psyching herself to pull the trigger... needing now to hate
        this man she doesn't know.  It's a lot harder face-to-face.  She is
        bathed in sweat, and it runs into her eyes.  Blinking, she wipes it
        fast with one hand, then gets it back on the gun.  The .45 is
        trembling.

        TIGHT ON SARAH as we see the forces at war behind her eyes.
        She looks into the faces of Dyson, Tarissa, Blythe, Danny.
        Sarah takes a sharp breath and all the muscles in her arms contract
        as she tenses to fire.
        But her finger won't do it.
        She lowers the gun very slowly.  It drops to her side in one hand.

        All the breath and energy seems to go out of her.
        She weakly raises her other hand in a strange gesture, like "Stay
        where you are, don't move".  As if, should they move, the fragile
        balance might tip back the other way.
        She backs away from them slowly, panting.  It's as if she's backing
        away in terror from what she almost did.  She reaches a wall and
        slumps against it.  Slides down to her knees.  The gun falls limply
        from her fingers.
        She rests her cheek against the wall.

136A    The front door is kicked in.
        Terminator steps inside.  John grabs his sleeve and pushes past him.
        He scopes out the situation in two seconds... Sarah, the gun, the
        sobbing family.  John moves to Sarah while Terminator checks Dyson.

        John kneels in front of his mother.  She raises her head to look at
        him.  He sees the tears spilling down her cheeks,

                                JOHN
                Mom?  You okay?

                                SARAH
                I couldn't... oh, God.
                        (she seems to she him for
                        the first time)
                You... came here... to stop me?

                                JOHN
                Uh huh.

        She reaches out and takes his shoulder suddenly, surprising him...
        drawing him to her.  She hugs him and a great sob wells up deep inside
        her, from a spring she had thought long dry.  She hugs him fiercely
        as the sobs wrack her.

        John clutches her shoulders.  It is all he ever wanted.

                                JOHN
                It's okay.  It'll by okay.  We'll figure it
                out.

                                SARAH
                I love you, John.  I always have.

                                JOHN
                I know, Mom.  I know.

        TARISSA looks around at the bizarre tableau.  Terminator has
        wordlessly ripped open Dyson's shirt and examined the wound.

                                TERMINATOR
                Clean penetration.  No shattered bone.
                Compression should control the loss of blood.

        He takes Tarissa's hands and presses them firmly over the entrance and
        exit wounds.

                                TERMINATOR
                Do you have bandages?

                                DYSON
                In the bathroom.  Danny, can you get them for
                us?

        Danny nods and runs down the hall.
        John disengages from Sarah.  She wipes her tears, the instinct to
        toughen up taking over again.  But the healing moment has had its
        effect, nevertheless.

        John walks toward Dyson and Terminator.

                                DYSON
                Who are you people?


        John draws the Biker's knife from Terminator's boot.  Hands it to him.


                                JOHN
                Show him.

        Terminator takes off his jacket to reveal bare arms.
        John takes Blythe by the hands and leads her down the hall, away
        from what is about to happen.

136B    TIGHT ON TERMINATOR'S left forearm as the knife makes a deep cut just
        below the elbow.  In one smooth motion, Terminator cuts all the way
        around his arm.  With a second cut, he splits the skin of the forearm
        from elbow to wrist.

        TERMINATOR grasps the skin and strips is off his forearm like a
        surgeon rips off a rubber glove.  It comes off with a sucking rip,
        leaving a bloody skeleton.

        But the skeleton is made of bright metal, and is laced with hydraulic
        actuators.  The fingers are as finely crafted as watch parts... they
        flex into a fist and extend.  Terminator holds it up, palm out, in
        almost the exact position of the one in the vault at Cyberdyne,

        HOLD ON DYSON reacting to the servo-hand in front of him.
        He's seen one of these before.
        Tarissa is screaming now, but he doesn't hear her.

                                DYSON
                My God.

                                TERMINATOR
                Now listen to me very carefully.

137     INT. HOUSE/KITCHEN - LATER

        Sarah puts out her fifth cigarette.  She's sitting on the counter.
        John, Terminator, Dyson, and Tarissa are at the kitchen table, under
        a single overhead light.

        Dyson looks like that guy on the Sistine Chapel wall, the damned
        soul... eyes fixed and staring with terrifying knowledge.  His
        shoulder is bandaged.  Terminator's arm is wrapped with a blood-soaked
        bandage below the elbow.  The steel forearm and hand gleam in the
        harsh kitchen light.  TRACKING AROUND THE TABLE as Terminator
        speaks... we don't hear the words.

                                SARAH (V.O.)
                Dyson listened while the Terminator laid it all
                down.  Skynet.  Judgment Day... the history of
                things to come.  It's not every day you find
                out you're responsible for 3 billion deaths.
                He took it pretty well, considering...

        Terminator finishes speaking.

                                DYSON
                I feel like I'M gonna throw up.

        He looks around at them, clutching the table like he's about to blow
        away.  His face, his posture, his ragged voice express soul-wrenching
        terror.  This is a man ripped out of normal life into their grim
        world.  His voice is pleading.

                                DYSON
                You're judging me on thing's I haven't even
                done yet.  Jesus.  How were we supposed to know?

        Sarah speaks from the shadows behind them.  Dyson turns to find her
        looking right at him.

                                SARAH
                Yeah.  Right.  How were you supposed to know?
                Fucking men... all you know how to do is thrust
                into the world with your... fucking ideas and
                your weapons.  Did you know that every gun in
                the world is named after a man?  Colt, Browning,
                Smith, Thompson, Kalashnikov... all men.  Men
                built the hydrogen bomb, not women... men like
                you thought it up.  You're so creative.  You
                don't know what it's like to really create
                something... to create a life.  To feel it growing
                inside you.  All you know how to create is
                death... you fucking bastards.

                                JOHN
                Mom, Mom, we need to be more constructive here.
                I don't see this as a gender-related issue.
                        (to the Dysons)
                She's still tense.
                        (to Sarah)
                We still have to figure out how to stop it all
                from happening.  Right?

                                TARISSA
                But I thought... aren't we changing things?  I
                mean... right now?  Changing the way it goes?

                                DYSON
                        (seizing on that)
                That's right!  There's no way I'm going to
                finish the new processor now.  Forget it.  I'm
                out of it.  I'm quitting Cyberdyne tomorrow...
                I'll sell real estate, I don't care,,,

                                SARAH
                        (coldly)
                That's not good enough.

        Dyson's voice is pitiful.

                                DYSON
                Look, whatever you want me to do, I'll do.  I
                just want my kids to have a chance to grow up,
                okay?

                                TERMINATOR
                No one must follow your work.

                                DYSON
                        (thoughts racing)
                Alright, yeah.  You're right.  We have to
                destroy the stuff at the lab, the files, disk
                drive... and everything I have here.  Everything!
                I don't care.

                                                CUT TO:

138     FIRE ROARING IN A METAL TRASH BARREL.
        Stacks of files are dumped onto it.
        WIDER reveals we are in --

138A    EXT, DYSON'S BACKYARD - NIGHT

        Terminator dumps lighter fluid liberally over the fire, which flares
        up, lighting his face demonically.  Sarah, Dyson, Tarissa, and John
        return from his office with more stuff -- files, notes, optical disks.
        Even his kids are carrying stuff.  It all goes into the fire.  Dyson
        drops the prototype onto the fire... his eyes hollow and distant.

        He stares into the fire, watching his world burning.  The has a
        sudden thought.

                                DYSON
                Do you know about the chip?

                                SARAH
                What chip?

                                DYSON
                They have it in a vault at Cyberdyne...
                        (to Terminator)
                It's gotta be from the other one like you.

                                TERMINATOR
                        (to Sarah)
                The CPU from the first terminator.

                                SARAH
                Son of a bitch, I knew it!

                                DYSON
                They told us not to ask where they got it.  I
                thought... Japan... hell, I don't know.  I
                didn't want to know.

                                SARAH
                Those lying motherfuckers!

                                DYSON
                I was scary stuff, radically advanced.  It was
                shattered... didn't work.  But it gave us ideas,
                It took us in new directions... things we would
                never have thought of.  All this work is based
                on it.

                                TERMINATOR
                I must be destroyed.

                                SARAH
                        (to Dyson)
                Can you get us in there, past security?

                                DYSON
                I think so, yeah.  When?

        Dyson looks at her, Terminator, then John.  Sees his answer.

                                DYSON
                Now?
                        (he takes a breath)
                Yeah, right.

        He turns to his wife.  Her face is streaked with tears, but her eyes
        are strong and clear.  Tarissa puts her hands on his arm.  She is
        stunned by what she's heard, but dealing with it.  She believe them.

                                TARISSA
                Miles, I'm scared.  Okay.  But the only thing
                that scares me more than you going... is you
                not going.

        He nods.  She's right.

                                SARAH
                        (to Terminator)
                Is it safe for them here?

                                TERMINATOR
                        (to Tarissa)
                Take your kids.  Go to a hotel.  Right now.
                Don't pack.
                        (to the others)
                Let's go.

                                                CUT TO:

138B    EXT, HIGHWAY - NIGHT

        Pavement rushing at us, lit by headlights.  Beyond, darkness.

                                SARAH (V.O.)
                The future, always so clear to me, has become
                like a black highway at night.  We were in
                uncharted territory now... making up history
                as we went along.

        TILT UP to reveal a rectangle of light ahead.  The Cyberdyne
        Building...

139     INT. CYBERDYNE SYSTEMS BUILDING/LOBBY - NIGHT

        TIGHT ON A CARD-KEY SCANNER as Dyson's hand zips his security card
        through a slot in one motion.  There is the sound of a servo-lock,
        and --

139A    DYSON enter the spacious lobby, followed by Sarah, John, and
        Terminator last of all.  In a frontal angle, the others block
        Terminator from view.

        THE GUARD at the front desk, GIBBONS, looks up as Dyson moves toward
        him.  Dyson is pale and sweaty, but smiles warmly at the guard,
        speaking well before he reaches the desk.

                                DYSON
                Evening, Paul.  These are friends of mine from
                out of town, I just thought I'd take them up
                and show them around.

                                GIBBONS
                I'm sorry, Mr. Dyson.  You know the rules about
                visitors in the lab.  I need written authoriz --

        K-CHAK!  Gibbons is staring down the barrels of Sarah's .45 and
        Terminator's MAC-10.

                                TERMINATOR
                I insist.

        The guard is too stunned to move.  We see that Terminator is wearing
        his jacket and one black glove.
        Gibbon's eyes go to the silent alarm button on the console.

                                SARAH
                Don't even think about it.

        Gibbons nods.  He stays frozen.  Terminator circles quickly and gets
        the guard out of the chair.  John pulls a roll of duct-tape from his
        knapsack and tears off a piece.

140     INT. SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR

        ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN and Terminator leads the group warily into the
        corridor.  They have a cart piled high with gear in nylon bags.
        Dyson motions down the corridor to the right.  As they walk, he
        continues to fill them in --

                                DYSON
                The vault needs two keys to open.  Mine...
                        (holds up key)
                ... and one from the security station.  It's in
                a locker but my card should access it.  Here
                we go.

        They stand in front of a wide security door.  A sign above reads
        SPECIAL PROJECTS DIVISION:  AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY.  Dyson zips
        his key-card through the scanner and the door unlatches.

141     OMITTED

142     INT. FIRST FLOOR CORRIDOR/LOBBY

        A ROVING GUARD, MOSHIER, strolls down the long corridor from the
        first-floor office block.  A punch clock swings at his hip, and he's
        just completed his circuit of the building.  He passes the back of
        elevators and rounds the corner to the front desk, calling out --

                                MOSHIER
                Honey, I'm home...

        He sees the desk is deserted and frowns.  Figures Gibbons must be in
        the can, so checks that first before getting alarmed.
        TRACKING WITH HIM to the restroom around the corner,

                                MOSHIER
                Hey, man, you shouldn't leave the --

142A    OVER HIS SHOULDER we see past the door as he pushes it open, revealing
        Gibbons handcuffed to the urinal.  Moshier spins on a dime and sprints
        to the desk where he slams down on the silent alarm button.

153     INT. SECURITY STATION

        The security station is a pass-through area with a counter, behind
        which are desks and a bank of monitors, showing boring movies about
        empty corridors.  Dyson crosses quickly to a locker behind the
        monitor area.  He swished his card repeatedly through the scanner on
        the locker.  Nothing happens.  The light on the locker is blinking
        red.  Sarah notices Dyson's alarmed expression.

                                DYSON
                What?  WHAT IS IT?

        Dyson whips around, staring at a light flashing on the console behind
        him.

                                DYSON
                Silent alarm's been tripped.  It neutralizes
                the codes throughout the building.  Nothing'll
                open now.

        We see his nerve snapping.

                                DYSON
                We should abort.

                                SARAH
                NO!! We're going all the way!  You got that,
                Dyson?

        She's right in his face.  Somehow, it works for him.  He nods, getting
        some resolve from somewhere.

144     INT. LOBBY

        Moshier's gotten Gibbons loose.  He's on the phone to the cops.

                                GIBBONS
                ... multiple armed subjects.  Look, I think
                it's the guy from that mall shootout, and the
                woman... yeah, her.  Pretty sure.  Just send
                everything you've got in the area --

145     INT. SECURITY STATION./LAB

        John jumps up on the desk next to the wall-mounted locker.  Dyson
        stares in amazement as John starts pulling his counter-electronics
        gear out of his knapsack.  It's just another Ready-Teller to him.

                                JOHN
                You guys get started on the lab... I can open
                this.

145A    Dyson leads Terminator and Sarah to the main lab doors.  Another
        servo-lock.
        He tries his card.  Nothing.

                                DYSON
                No good.

                                TERMINATOR
                Let me try mine.

        He unslings the M-79, pulling it over his shoulder in one motion.
        Sarah grabs Dyson and drags him back down the hall.
        Terminator opens the breach and slide in one of the fat 40mm H.E.
        grenades.  He flips the thing closed with a snap of the wrist.

                                SARAH
                        (yelling as she runs)
                John!  Fire-in-the-hole!

        John drops what he is doing, and covers his ears.
        Terminator fires at inhumanely close range.
145B    The door EXPLODES into kindling.  The concussion blow his jacket
        open, and flying shrapnel whizzes all around him.  Before the
        thunderclap has faded Terminator walks into the fire and smoke.
        John goes back to work without missing a beat.
        Sarah and a stunned Dyson walk through the burning doorframe into the
        Artificial Intelligence Lab.

        A SIREN is sounding.  The HALON FIRE-CONTROL SYSTEM has been
        triggered.  The invisible gas roars in, putting out the flames.

                                DYSON
                Fire's set off the halo system!  Here...
                hurry!

        Dyson runs to a wall cabinet and pulls out some BREATHING MASKS.  He
        hands one to Sarah and dons the other.  Then he reaches out to hand
        one to Terminator.

                                DYSON
                Here!

        Terminator doesn't need a mask, since is oxygen requirements are so
        low.  He ignores Dyson as he removes his massive backpack and opens
        it.  Dyson shrugs and tosses the mask on a desk.  He turns to Sarah.

                                DYSON
                        (yelling through the mask)
                We'll have to keep these on a couple minutes,
                till the gas clears.

        Terminator pulls two five-gallon jerry-cans of gasoline from his
        pack.
        Sarah starts pulling out book-sized, olive-grab CLAYMORE MINES,
        stacking them next to the gasoline.  Dyson stares.  Part of him can't
        believe they're really doing this.

                                                CUT TO:

146     INT. DYSON HOUSE - NIGHT

        The T-1000 moves slowly though the ravaged office, analyzing what has
        happened here.  It walks down the dark hallway.  The place is
        deserted.  The police-walkie clipped on its belt (real, not simulated)
        blares to life.

                                DISPATCHER (V.O.)
                All units, all units.  211 in progress at 2144
                Kramer Street, the Cyberdyne building.  Multiple
                suspects, armed with automatic weapons and
                explosives.  SWAT unit is en route...

147     EXT. HOUSE/STREET

        The T-1000 sprints up and throws its leg over the big C.H.P. Kawasaki.
        Fires it up.  It smokes an arcing scorch-mark on the pavement as it
        spins around and roars away.

                                                CUT TO:

148     INT. CYBERDYNE BUILDING/LAB

        TIGHT ON A LARGE DISK DRIVE.  State-of-the-art.  Very expensive.  A
        FIRE AXE smashes down through the housing, shattering the disk.

148A    WIDER, revealing a scene of high-tech pillage.  Terminator beats the
        disk drive into junk and steps to another.  WHAM.  Same routine.  He's
        already demolished half a dozen.
        Sarah topples a file cabinet, scattering files.
        Dyson staggers up with an armload of heavy M-O (magnetic-optical)
        disks and drops them on a growing stack in the middle of the floor.
        He and Sarah have their breathing masks hanging down around their
        necks, since the halon gas has dissipated.

                                DYSON
                        (to Sarah, panting)
                Yeah, all that stuff!  And all the disks in
                those offices.  Especially my office...
                everything in my office!
                        (to Terminator)
                These, too!  This is important.
                        (SMASH!)
                And all this here... that's it.

148B    Sarah goes into Dyson's office and starts hurling everything out the
        door onto the central junkpile... books, files, everything on the
        desk.
        A FRAMED PHOTO of Dyson's wife and kids lands on top of the heap.
        Tarissa, hugging Danny and Blythe, all grinning.  The glass is
        shattered.

148C    Terminator cuts a swath, under Dyson's direction, exploding equipment
        into fragments with his inhuman swings.
        SMASH!  It's carnage.  Millions in hardware, and all irreplaceable
        fruits of their years of research... shattered, broken, dumped in a
        heap for the big bonfire of destiny.
        Dyson stops a second, panting.

                                DYSON
                Give me that thing a second.

        Terminator hands him the axe.  Dyson hefts it one-handed.  He turns to
        a lab table... on it is another prototype processor.

                                DYSON
                I've worked for years on this thing.

        Swinging awkwardly but with great force he smashes the axe down onto
        the processor prototype, exploding it into fragments.  His shoulder is
        agony, but he looks satisfied.

149     INT. SECOND FLOOR SECURITY STATION

        John taps away at his little lap-top, which is running code
        combinations into the card-key lock.  Suddenly, the green light on 
        the lock goes on and it unlocks with a clunk.

                                JOHN
                Easy money.

        He whips it open, revealing a rack of keys.  But the VAULT-KEY is
        distinctive, a long steel rectangle on a neck-chain.  John grabs it
        and runs toward the lab.

150     INT. LAB

        Sarah and Terminator are working like a crack team, rigging the
        explosives.  She is taping the claymores to the gas cans with duct
        tape to create powerful incendiary bombs.  Terminator is attaching
        claymores and blocks of C-4 plastic explosive to the large MAINFRAME
        COMPUTER cabinets nearby.  All the claymores are wired back to one
        detonator with has a RADIO-CONTROL RELAY switch.

                                DYSON
                How do you set them off?

        Terminator shows him a REMOTE DETONATOR, a small transmitter with a
        red plunger.

                                TERMINATOR
                Radio remote.

        He makes a plunger-pushing motion with his thumb and an accompanying
        "click" sound.  Dyson nods.
        Just then John comes running in, holding up the key.

                                JOHN
                I got it.  Piece of cake.

                                SARAH
                        (to Dyson and Terminator)
                Go!  I'll finish here.

        They run out as the SOUND OF SIRENS grow louder outside.

                                TERMINATOR
                I'll deal with the police.

                                JOHN
                Remember what I said, you can't...

                                TERMINATOR
                Trust me.

151     EXT. CYBERDYNE BUILDING

        The security duo of Moshier and Gibbons cowers behind cars in the
        parking lot in front of the building.  They turns as L.A.P.D. BLACK-
        AND-WHITES pour into the lot, turn the area into a disco of whirling
        blue and red lights.

152     OMITTED

153     EXT. CYBERDYNE BUILDING

        The cops are jumping from their cars and ducking behind them.
        Emphasis on small arms here.  Behind them an ugly BLACK SWAT VAN
        screeches into the lot.

153A    We hear the THUMP OF ROTORS as a POLICE CHOPPER arrives and swings in
        close to the building.  It rakes its XENON SPOTLIGHT through the
        second floor offices.

154     INT./EXT. SECOND FLOOR OFFICE

        Terminator crosses the office toward the floor-to-ceiling windows.
        He is outlines starkly by the spotlight as it rakes through the dark
        offices.  Without breaking stride he kicks an executive desk toward
        the window.
154A    Glass explodes outward and the desk topples, falling to the sidewalk
        below.

154B    Terminator, standing at the edge, FIRES A LONG BURST with strafes the
        police cars lines up below.  Cops duck as glass flies.  Terminator,
        with his superb aim, hits no one.  But noticed is served.

154C    The cops (surprise) FIRE BACK.  Terminator turns and is walking
        calmly from the window as glass, office furniture, drapes etc. are
        riddled by return fire.  A few rounds hit his back, but he doesn't
        notice.  He reloads as he walks.

155     INT. VAULT ANTECHAMBER

        TIGHT ON A KEY inserted into one of the vault locks.

        WIDER as John and Dyson stand poised, hands on keys.

                                JOHN
                And let's see what's behind door number one.

        Dyson nods and they turns the keys together.  The vault grumbles to
        itself, withdrawing it locking bolts with a final KLONK!
        Together Dyson and John swing the door open.

156     EXT./INT. LOBBY

        The varsity takes the field as the SWAT TROOPERS sprint forward by
        squads.  They flank the lobby and work their way inside, deploying
        rapidly.  They move and freeze, behind cover, quivering with
        adrenaline.  They have all that great SWAT equipment:  body armor,
        gas-masks, M-16s, tear-gas launchers, ropes.  The works.  They make
        a lot of hand signals and keep their mouths shut.  They're well-
        trained and deadly.

157     OUTSIDE we see cops firing TEAR GAS grenades through the broken
        windows into second-floor offices.

158     INT. VAULT

        John and Dyson are isolated from the world in this silent steel womb.
        Dyson opens the cabinet containing the terminator relics.  It's John
        turn to stare with uneasy deja-vu as he sees the terminator hand and
        CPU.

        Then in one vicious move he sweeps his arm behind the inert-gas flasks
        and hurls them to the floor.  They SHATTER.  John snatches the CPU
        and the metal hand out of the broken glass.

                                JOHN
                Got ol' Skynet by the ball now, Miles.  Come
                on, let's book!

        Clutching the steel hand and pocketing the chip like it's a Mars bar
        he just bought, John runs out.  Dyson follows.

159     INT. FIRST FLOOR CORRIDOR/STAIRWELL

        We see the advance squad of SWATs make it to one of the stairwells.
        They start up, two at a time, covering each other ritualistically by
        the numbers.

160     INT. LAB/HALL

        John pelts into the lab with Dyson stumbling along behind him.
        Sarah is just finished wiring all the charges to the central
        detonator.

                                JOHN
                Ready to rock?

                                SARAH
                Ready.

        John tosses her the metal hand.  She catches it and bends to put the
        hand in her empty back-pack.  Sarah zips the pack and starts to shuck
        into it.

        Dyson's running out of steam.  The bandages at his shoulder are soaked
        with seeping blood.  He stands in the middle of the lab, saying
        goodbye in his mind, looking weak and empty.
        Terminator strides into the lab.

                                TERMINATOR
                Time to go.  Right now.

        He and John head back the way they came, through security.
        Sarah sees that in her work, she has set the detonator down twenty
        feet away, near where Dyson is standing.

                                SARAH
                Dyson, hand me the detonator.  Let's go --

        He gingerly picks up the detonator.  Starts toward her.  Then --
160A    CRASH!!  THE DOORS AT THE BACK END OF THE LAB ARE KICKED OPEN.
        SWAT LEADER  and two others OPEN FIRE.
        Their M-16s rake the room.  Sarah dives behind a computer cabinet.
        Dyson is HIT.  He is slammed to the floor by the impacts.

161     IN THE HALL, John hears the firing and spins to run back.

                                JOHN
                Mommm!!!

        Terminator grabs him as bullets slam into his broad back.  He makes
        it around the corner with John, out of the line of fire.

162     IN THE LAB, bullets rake over Sarah's head, smacking all around her,
        clanging into the machine protecting her.  She can see Dyson, slumped
        on the floor.  Debris and flying glass rain on her as the SWATs pour
        on the fire.  The detonator is clutched in his hand.  He rolls to face
        her, his eyes bulging from the pain of his torn-up guts.

                                DYSON
                Go.

162A    Sarah hesitates a split second.  Then she snap-rolls and fast-crawls
        through broken glass and debris into the hall where --

        TERMINATOR grabs her by the jacket and hauls her roughly to her feet.
        Bullets rake the walls behind them as they sprint forward.  They
        round the corner.  John does a fast take that she's not hit and they
        run together through the security checkpoint.

163     INT. SECURITY STATION/CORRIDOR

        John reaches the first door, and tries it.  Locked.
        Terminator unslings the M-79 blooper smoothly, opening the breach.

                                TERMINATOR
                Get back.

        He pulls a grenade from the bandolier over his shoulder, and slides
        it into the bore.  Flick his wrist.  The breech snaps shut.  Sarah
        and John have a split second to duck and cover.

                                TERMINATOR
                Cover you ears and open you mouth.

163A    They do.  KABOOM!!! Twenty feet away the door, and half the wall
        around it, EXPLODES outward.  The backblast hits Terminator full
        force, but he strides through the smoking hole before the debris has
        even hit the floor.

165     INT. LAB

        SWAT LEADER moves cautiously through the lab.  Cat-stepping, he
        circles around a desk which block Dyson's body from his view.  His
        M-16 is leveled crisply.  We look over his shoulder as he rounds the
        desk, revealing --

        MILES DYSON is not dead.  He will be very soon, but at this moment he
        is conscious.  He has propped himself up against the desk, and holds a
        BOOK in one hand.  A heavy technical manual.

        Below the book is the detonator, upright on the tile floor.
        The message is clear.  "Shoot me, the book drops on the plunger.
        Adios."  Dyson wheezes, trying to draw enough breath to talk.

                                DYSON
                I don't know... how much longer... I can...
                hold this thing...

        SWAT Leader seems to see the wires, the claymores, the gas cans all
        around him for the first time.  His eyes, visible through his gas-
        mask, go very wide.
        He spins and motions his squad back.

                                LEADER
                Fall back!!  Everybody out!  Move it!  OUT
                NOW!

        They retreat so fast they crash into the next group coming up the
        stairs.

166     INT. CORRIDOR

        Terminator reaches the main elevators.  Hits the button.  Sarah and
        John are coughing and stumbling in the choking darkness, buddy-
        breathing with the single mask.  The doors open.  They get in the
        elevator and head down.

167     INT. LAB

        Dyson is lying amid the ruins of his dreams.  Sprawled on the floor,
        he has his back propped up against the desk.  He is bathed in his own
        blood, which runs out in long fingers across the tiles.  His breathing
        is shallow and raspy.  He still holds the book, trembling, above the
        switch.

        In his lap is the picture from his desk.  He has pulled it from the
        debris next to him.  A tear trickles from his eye.  His wife and
        children smile up at him through broken glass.

168     OMITTED

169     CUT TO THE PUPIL OF HIS EYE, at the moment of death, the instant the
        light fade from his eyes and he is gone --
        His arm drops and the book his the switch --

170     EXT. BUILDING

        As the face of the building EXPLODES in an eruption of glass and fire.
        Remains of the second-floor windows shower the parking lot and a huge
        fireball rolls out, leaping into the sky.
        The cops look up, stunned.  The helicopter banks away from the heat.
        Burning debris falls among the cop cars and a number of officers 
        break ranks, pulling back.

171     ONLY ONE OF THEM seems to be moving with purpose.  A BIKE COP who has
        just arrived drives through the disorganized crowd, directly toward
        the building.

171A    T-1000 guns the bike up a ramp to a pedestrian bridge which crosses
        from a parking structure to the Cyberdyne building.  It enters on the
        second floor, which is now a burning maze.

172     INT. SECOND FLOOR/OFFICE/CORRIDOR

        T-1000 drives into the smoky wreckage.  It draws a Hoechler and Koch
        MPK machine pistol and cruises slowly into the firelit offices,
        scanning.

172A    IN THE CORRIDOR the bike skirts flaming wreckage as it idles forward.
        T-1000 scans the leaping shadows for its prey.

173     INT. GROUND FLOOR/ELEVATOR/LOBBY

        The elevator doors part and Terminator eases a look out into the
        corridor.  The walls on either side of him ERUPT WITH BULLET HITS.
        The SWATs have the lobby end of the corridor blocked off.  They're
        totally trapped, cut off and screwed.

                                JOHN
                        (to Sarah)
                Don't forget.  It's always darkness right
                before... you're totally fucked.

173A    The SWATs fire a tear-gas grenade toward the elevators.  It spews the
        vicious CS gas out in a swirling cloud which envelops Sarah and John,
        who are pressed against the back wall of the elevator.

                                TERMINATOR
                Keep your eyes closed.  Don't move.
                        (they nod, eyes squeezed shut)
                I'll be back.

        He slings the grenade launcher over his shoulder and walks out into
        the corridor.

173B    BLAM.  A tear-gas grenade ricochets from wall to wall as it flies down
        the corridor.  It skids to rest in front of Terminator, throwing out
        a white cloud which quickly fills the corridor.
173C    In the elevator, Sarah and John are choking, handing the breathing
        mask back and forth desperately.  They're scarred.  This looks like
        it.
173D    ANGLE ON THE SWAT TEAM, gripping their weapons at the mouth of the
        corridor.  They watch the boiling cloud, waiting.

173E    THEIR POV -- on the wall of boiling smoke.  A FIGURE APPEARS.  Walking
        Totally unaffected.  Terminator emerges from the smoke.  Not even
        misty-eyed.  Not what they expected.

                                LEADER
                        (through megaphone)
                Stop where you are.  Lie down on the floor,
                face down.  Down on floor, now!

        He continues to stride toward them.
        The SWATs tense up.  They've never seen anything like this.  They're
        not sure what to do.  Closer and closer.

                                LEADER
                Drop him.

        They OPEN FIRE.  The corridor is filled with CRACKING THUNDER.  The
        rounds tear into Terminator's chest.  Stomach.  Face.  Thighs.  His
        leather jacket leaps and jerks as the rounds hit him.  The SWATs
        think the guy's wearing body armor or something.  They keep firing.
        The rounds tear into him, staggering him slightly, but he keeps
        moving.

                                LEADER
                You're not hitting him!

                                SWAT #1
                        (getting scared)
                Yes I am!

        Terminator draws his .45 smoothly.  Unhurried.  He shoots the nearest
        man in the left thigh.  As he screams and drops, Terminator shoots
        him in the right thigh.  Terminator bends down and picks up the 
        shrieking man's weapon... the TEAR-GAS LAUNCHER.

        It is one of those new rotary jobs that hold 12 rounds in a big drum.
        Terminator shoots the next SWAT in the chest with the tear-gas
        launcher.  The gas canister hits the guy's body armor and doesn't
        penetrate.  But it's like getting slugged in the stomach with a full-
        swing from a baseball bat.  The SWAT fold double and hits the tiles,
        gasping.

        Terminator is an image from Hell, a tall figure in shredded black
        leather, streaked with blood.  One eye is a bloody socket, the metal
        eye-servo glistening.  The flesh of one cheek hangs down in tatters,
        revealing the chrome cheekbone beneath.  The whole front of his 
        jacket is blown open, revealing his metal armor chest.

        The remaining SWATs start to fall back.  One turns to run and --
        KPOW!  A gas canister nail him in the back, sending him sprawling.

173F    Terminator fires three gas canisters into the lobby.  It fills
        rapidly with the white gas, cutting the visibility to a few feet.  It
        is total pandemonium.  SWAT LEADER crouches in the fog, white-
        knuckling the rifle.  Terminator looms suddenly out of the mist right
        in front of him.  POOM!  Terminator drills him in the leg with the
        .45.  As the guy screams and drops rifle to clutch his leg, Terminator
        rips his gas mask off.  The SWAT leader drops writhing to the floor,
        choking and gagging, clutching his bleeding thigh.

        Terminator walks up to two SWATs at the front doors.  POW-POW.  Leg
        and leg.  He snatches their masks as they fall.  The gunfire has
        stopped.  Nobody an see anything.  Screams and whimpers echo in the
        smoke.

174     EXT. BUILDING

        Smoke boils out of the front door as a figure emerges.  Firing the
        tear-gas launcher with one hand, Terminator launches all remaining
        rounds among the cop vehicles.  Unprotected officers run, choking
        and half-blind, slamming into cars and tripping over each other.  It
        is a total rout.

175     AT THE SWAT VAN on of the SWATs is rapidly handing out the remaining
        masks to unprotected cops.  A FIGURE appears out of the smoke beside
        him.  He looks up.  His mask is ripped off and he is handed the empty
        launcher.  Instinctively he catches it.  Terminator grabs his flak
        vest with one hand and sails him out into the mist.

175A    INT. SWAT VAN

        Terminator strides the length of the van and climbs into the driver's
        seat.  No keys in the ignition.  He flips down the sun visor.  The
        keys fall into his hand.  He starts the van and slams it into gear.

176     INT./EXT. LOBBY

        The tear gas has cleared to a thin haze.  The uninjured SWATs are
        tending their wounded.  They look up at the sound of shouts and a
        roaring engine.

176A    THE SWAT VAN CRASHES INTO THE LOBBY in an explosion of glass and
        debris.  Cops scatter as the van screeches across the lobby in a 
        smoking one-eighty, sliding to a stop across the corridor which leads
        to the bank of elevators.  Terminator backs up until -- crunch -- he
        seals the corridor with the back of the van.

176B    Sarah and John stumble along the corridor, coughing.
        They leap into the back of the van and Terminator hits the throttle.
        The van roars across the lobby and exits through blown-out windows.

                                                CUT TO:

177     INT./EXT SECOND FLOOR

        T-1000, astride the Kawasaki, looks down from a second-floor office
        and sees the van tearing across the parking lot with the remaining
        cops firing at it.  It knows.  It looks around.  Analyzing options.
        It sees the helicopter hovering outside the building at the end of
        this corner office block...
        It twists full throttle on the powerful bike.
        Roars through the office, accelerating fast, straight at the
        windows --

178     T-1000 BLASTS OUT THROUGH THE GLASS, airborne on the motorcycle.  It
        rockets across the gap to the hovering chopper and --
178A    SLAMS into the canopy.  The impact of bike and rider pitches the
        chopper radically.  The startled PILOT fights to regain control as the
        bike tumbles to the pavement below.
178B    The T-1000 doesn't.  It clings to the shattered canopy.
        Nightmarishly, the pilot watches as the T-1000 smashes its head
        through the plexiglass canopy and rapidly POURS ITSELF through the
        jagged hole.  It reforms instantly into its previous self on the
        passenger seat.

178C    It hurls the pilot out of the chopper and slides into the driver's
        seat.
        The chopper is auto-rotating, spinning out of control.  It drops
        toward the parking lot.  T-1000 recovers control ten feet above the
        ground.

178D    Cops hits the deck as the tail-boom swings around, going over them by
        inches.
        The chopper lifts out in a power climb, roaring away across the
        parking lot toward the fleeing SWAT van.

        OKAY, BUCKLE YOUR SEATBELTS, HERE IT COMES...

179     INT./EXT. SWAT VAN/HIGHWAY - NIGHT

        Terminator looks back at his two passengers as he turns the boxy van
        onto a divided highway.  Sarah and John are catching their breath,
        still coughing from the CS gas.  Terminator look to the rear-view
        mirror.  He sees the xenon searchlight of the chopper behind them,
        gaining.

        Sarah looks around the inside of the SWAT van.  It is a rolling
        armory.  There are rifles, ballistic vests, all manner of equipment.

                                SARAH
                John, get under these.  Hurry!

        He sits against the front bulkhead of the van and she pile bullet-
        proof vests on top of him, completely covering him.  Then she grabs
        two M-16s from the wall-rack and loads them.  She starts on a shotgun
        as --

180     The SWAT van weaves through sparse traffic at high speed.
        Terminator slews the unstable van around cars and trucks which seem to
        be crawling.  The van hits it top speed of eighty.  They swerve to
        miss the back end of A WHITE 18-WHEEL TANKER.
180A    The chopper swings in behind them, closing fast.
180B    T-1000 reaches through the shattered canopy with the MPK machine
        pistol and FIRES.  The back of the can CLANGS WITH HITS.  The door
        windows are BLOWN IN.

        Terminator weaves the van, trying to throw off the T-1000's aim.
        The unstable vehicle screeches and wobbles on the edge of control.
        One of the doors is kicked open.  Sarah, wearing a ballistic vest,
        crouches in the doorway, whipping up the M-16.  SHE OPENS FIRE.

180C    Bullets riddle what's left of the chopper's canopy as the T-1000
        returns fire.
        The van is stitched with hits.

180D    INSIDE THE VAN holes are punched through the thin sheet-metal walls,
        ripping up the interior.  The vests covering John are hit repeatedly.
        We see that Sarah has hung two Kevlar vests on the inside of the back
        door and she ducks behind these as bullets hit around her.  She pops
        back out and fires in controlled bursts.  The M-16 empties and she
        grabs another.

180E    Terminator serves around a car which is changing lanes, hitting it
        and knocking it skidding.

181     OMITTED

181A    Sarah reloads and keeps firing.  The van swerves around a Toyota.  A
        moment later the helicopter passes it, the rotor just clearing the top
        of the car.

181B    T-1000 FIRES the machine pistol.
181C    Sarah has popped out to fire.  She takes a HIT in the thigh, and
        several rounds hammer into her Kevlar vest.  She is thrown back onto
        the floor of the van.  She lies there, an exposed target...

181D    Terminator sees the T-1000 preparing to fire again.
        He locks up the van's brakes.  Tires scream as the vehicle shimmies.
        Sarah is thrown forward, sliding up to the bulkhead next to John.
182     And the helicopter SLAMS RIGHT INTO THE BACK OF THE VAN.
        The rotor disintegrates.  The back doors of the van are crushed in as
        the canopy, the whole front of the fuselage is HAMMERED INTO JUNK,
        trapping the T-1000 inside the twisted metal.  The chopper hits the
        pavement, flips, sideways, and cartwheels... smashing itself into a
        shapeless mass of twisted metal.
        It falls away behind the van, tumbling end over end.

182A    Terminator fights to control the van, which is fishtailing violently
        from the impact.  It smashes up against the center divider, screeching
        along the concrete, and then pulls away.  Terminator puts the hammer
        down and the van accelerates.  He swerves to avoid an UGLY PICKUP
        crawling like a snail ahead.

        THE RIGHT FRONT FENDER of the van, crumpled by slamming the wall, is
        sawing into the tire.  The tire blows and peels off the clean rim.
        The steel wheel grinds across the pavement, striking trails of sparks,
        and the van slides sideways and topples --
        STEEL SCREAMS on pavement as the van grinds to a stop on its side.

182B    INSIDE THE VAN, John crawls to Sarah, who is groaning and holding her
        bleeding leg.  She is white and shocky.  Terminator starts to
        extricate himself from the crumpled driver's seat.

183     BACK DOWN THE ROAD, THE HELICOPTER wreckage is a crumpled ball of junk
        metal, unrecognizable.  Behind it, the TANKER TRUCK brakes hard, 
        shuddering and groaning, trying to stop.  The big tires lock up in
        clouds of tire-smoke.  The rig comes to a shuddering stop just short
        of the wrecked chopper.

183A    The shaken DRIVER jumps down.
        The behind the wreckage a cop emerges, walking toward him.

                                DRIVER
                Goddamn, are you alri --

183B    SSSHHCK!  T-1000 drives a blade through the man's abdomen and walks
        on past without slowing, or even looking at him.

183C    It climbs into the open cab of the tanker.  Releases the brake.
        As the truck bellows are rolls forward we see the large blue letters
        on the side which say "CRYOCO INC.  LIQUID NITROGEN SUPPLY'.

184     AT THE SWAT VAN John and Terminator are carrying Sarah out of the
        wreck.  Terminator has the M-79 slung over his shoulder, the
        bandolier of grenades, and his .45 stuck in his waistband.  John has
        borrowed a 12-GAUGE RIOT GUN from the SWATs.

184A    The pickup they passes seconds earlier pulls up to them.  The DRIVER,
        A Hispanic guy in his 50's, is getting out to help them.  Terminator
        and John hear a CRASH and look back as the
185     helicopter wreckage is knocked aside by the accelerating tanker truck.

186                             JOHN
                Holy shit.  Come on, Mom... we gotta keep
                moving... come on --

                                TERMINATOR
                        (to the pickup owner)
                We need your truck.

        The guy seems to know better than to try and stop him as Terminator
        slides Sarah into the front seat and climbs in behind the wheel.  John
        runs to the passenger side.

187     THE TANKER ROARS, spewing smoke from its chrome stacks as it shifts
        up through the gears.

188     Terminator slams the pickup in gear, checking the rear-view.  The
        tanker is a hundred feet behind them now, and really moving.
        Terminator puts the throttle down, but the pickup is and old slug
        loaded down by a heavy home-made wooden camper-shell.  It accelerates
        slowly.

189     THE TANKER slams into one end of the SWAT van, spinning it out of the
        way with a roar and screech of twisting metal.  The 18-wheeler shifts
        to a higher gear, still accelerating.

190     INT./EXT. PICKUP TRUCK

        With the tanker right behind them, Terminator cuts the wheel, swerving
        the pickup back and forth across the lanes.
        The big rig stays right on them, it tanker whiplashing violently.

                                JOHN
                Faster!  He's right on us!

        Terminator doesn't reply.  He rapidly unslings the blooper, still
        around his neck, and reaches for a grenade.

191     LOW ANGLE ON THE TRACTOR-TRAILER as it roars right up to the lens,
        filling frame with chrome and lights.

191A    K-WHAM!!  It rams the backs of the pickup, sending it skidding.

191B    Then the T-1000 pulls the tractor trailer up alongside the pickup and
        crabs over, sandwiching it against the center divider.  The spinning
        chrome hubs tear into the passenger side door and the guard rail
        screeches along the other side.

        The pickup bucks and shakes insanely.  It ricochets violently between
        the big-rig and the divider
        Horrible SCREECH of tortured steel.
        Sparks pour in sheets of fire from both sides.
        The windshield shatters as the door-posts buckle in.
        Metal and glass shower in through the side windows.
        The frame twists and buckles.  John feels like the fillings are being
        shaken right out of his teeth.
        The wooden camper disintegrates, falling away as kindling behind
        them.

191C    INT. TANKER CAB

        T-1000 holds the wheel hard over, mercilessly grinding the pickup.
        The whole rig jerks and shakes with the violence of the sustained
        hammering.

191D    INT./EXT. PICKUP

        Terminator slides toward the passenger side.  Keeping his foot on the
        gas he lifts John over him and puts him in the driver's seat.

                                TERMINATOR
                Drive for a minute.

                                JOHN
                Where you going?!

        Terminator slams the shattered windshield with the palm of his hand.
        Held together by the plastic laminate, the windshield flops out of its
        frame.  It flies over the top of the truck.

191E    Terminator pushes his upper body out over the dashboard and stands up.
        He turns and aims the M-79 one-handed.
191F    POOM!  The grenade misses the T-1000 by less than a foot.  It EXPLODES
        against the front bulkhead of the tanker, almost at the top.  Liquid
        nitrogen pours from the opening, swept back by the 60-mph windstream.

191G    The big-rig swerves as T-1000 regains control.  The tanker swings like
        a pendulum behind the cab.

191H    The pickup accelerates, getting back out in front by a few yards.
        Behind it the big-rig is trailing a swirling comet-tail of nitrogen
        vapor.  It is gaining again.

        Terminator, still standing, opens the breech and starts to reload.
191I    John cuts across the highway and takes an OFF RAMP.

191J    T-1000 swerves the smoking behemoth across the lanes and down the
        ramp after him, still accelerating.  It is twenty feet behind them
        and closing when Terminator closes the breech and FIRES.

191K    The grenade hits the front grill and EXPLODES.
        The radiator is destroyed, along with half the hood.  Steam blasts
        out, obscuring the whole front of the truck.

191L    The semi rams the back of the pickup again.  Spewing smoke and vapor
        like some demon locomotive, the tractor-trailer pounds into the back
        of the pickup.  Driving it right through the intersection at the
        bottom of the ramp, and straight toward --

        EXT. STEEL MILL

        The chase has led them to an area of heavy industry.

192     THE GATES are blasted off their hinges as the semi rams the pickup
        right through them.  Terminator struggles to reload amid the chaos
        and impacts.  He has THREE GRENADES LEFT on the bandolier.

        John isn't even steering.  They are just being pushed.  There's
        nothing he can do.  They are rocketing down the broad thoroughfare
        which leads directly to the MAIN BUILDING of the plant.

192A    Terminator pulls himself onto the roof of the pickup.
        He leaps to the bed, takes two powerful strides and --
        Leaps onto the semi.  He climbs rapidly onto the hood.
192B    And FIRES POINT BLANK THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD.
        Right into T-1000's face.
        The EXPLOSION blows out all the glass and fills the cab with smoke
        and fire  Terminator grabs onto the air-horn as the truck starts to
        SHUDDER AND
192C    SCREAM.  IT IS JACK-KNIFING.
        Almost dream-slow the cab begins to swing sideways, until its tires
        are shrieking over the pavement.  The tractor is smashed back at
        right-angles to the tanker-trailer which begins to slide broadside.

192D    The juggernaut bucks and shudders as the tires and smoke sideways
        across the pavement.
        It begins to topple.
        Terminator hold on as the side of cab becomes the top.
        With an unholy scream, like the unoiled hubs of Hell, the whole rig
        slides on its side at 60 mph toward the steel mill.  A sheet of sparks
        sixty feet wide trails behind it on the pavement.

192E    John sees what's behind him, then snaps around to see the building
        looming right in front.  The huge rolling doors are partly open.
        No choice.
        He steers right through them into the mill, as --

192F    Terminator, with one second to go, leaps from the cab --
        He flies through the open doors as --
        The tanker hits the building and --

193     INT. STEEL MILL/MAIN AISLE

        Terminator slams to the floor of the mill and rolls, as --
        The tanker-trailer smashed into a massive concrete support at one side
        of the doors.  Thunderous carnage of twisting metal.              o
193A    It splits wide open.  A river of liquid nitrogen pours out at -230.

193B    John hits the brakes, sliding out of control.  He slows almost to a
        stop but hits a steel support column head-on.  He and Sarah are
        slammed forward, hard.

193C    Terminator, still clutching the M-79 blooper, rolls and slides across
        the floor.
        He smashes through a railing and slams up against the base of a
        massive machine.

193D    The semi cab swings about the trailer wreckage, into the building, and
        shudders to a stop.  Liquid nitrogen sprays over the cab, flooding out
        around it in a HISSING WAVEFRONT OF ULTRACOLD.
        Freezing vapor swirls everywhere, obscuring the wreck.

193E    TERMINATOR lies still.  A beat.  Then he rolls weakly, rising on one
        elbow to survey the scene.

193F    IN THE WRECKED PICKUP, John stirs.  He is stunned, and blood runs from
        his nose.  Dazed, he realizes he is in a steel mill.  There are
        sirens, and he can see men running... shouting.  He turns and sees
        what they are running from...

193G    The wall of nitrogen vapor spreads from the demolished tanker.  It is
        a strange vista of fire and ice.  The huge SMELTERS pour out orange
        light and fire from the sides of the huge galley, while the freezing
        vapor rolls down the center.

193H    TIGHT ON THE WRECK.  A billowing gray cloud.  Deep inside, the shape
        of the cab in visible.  A FIGURE emerges, pulling itself out.  It
        drops to the floor.  The hissing, boiling river of liquid nitrogen
        flows around its feet.

194     The T-1000 staggers, moving slowly, painfully.  It has finally been
        affected by something.  Its feet are freezing to the ground as it
        walks...

194A    CLINK!  One of its feet breaks off at a glassy angle.  It stumbles
        forward, and --
194B    Its other foot snaps off.  As it catches its balance on the stump of
        its other ankle,
194C    the whole lower leg shatters at the impact.  It topples forward to its
        knees.
        Catches itself on one hand.  Liquid nitrogen flows around the hand.

        Now the hand is stuck to the pavement.
194D    The T-1000 pulls and... CLINK!  The hand snaps off at the wrist.
        It looks stupidly at the glassy stump of a wrist.  For the first time
        we see an expression on its face we know to be a true one...
        The expression is pain.  Agony.  Its mouth opens in a soundless
        scream as the hoar-frost races up its legs, across its body.
194E    And that's the position it freezes in.
        It has become a statue, kneeling in the frozen vapor, that surprised
        look of agony frozen on its face.

        The liquid nitrogen stops flowing and begins to evaporate.
194F    Terminator, just beyond the boundary of the cold, can see the T-1000
        clearly.
        He draws his .45 and aims.

                                TERMINATOR
                Hasta la vista, baby.

194G    K-POW!  The single shot blows the T-1000 into a million diamonds
        spraying up into the air.  They shimmer across the ground for twenty
        feet in all directions.
        Terminator lowers the gun, satisfied.
        He looks like he needs a vacation.

195     JOHN AND SARAH have seen it from the pickup.  She is in bad shape.
        Conscious but very weak.  He tries the door.  It's jammed.  He kicks
        it open.

                                JOHN
                Okay, Mom, we gotta get out now, come on.
                That's it.

        He helps her slide down from the seat of the truck.  Her knees give
        way.  John has to take a lot of her weight.  He reaches in and picks
        up the riot gun off the seat.  They hobble toward --

195A    TERMINATOR.  On his knees, he looks into the dissipating cloud of
        vapor.  The heat of the furnaces has evaporated all the liquid
        nitrogen.

196     INSERT, TIGHT ON THE FLOOR - the T-1000 shards are melting,
        liquefying.  Hundreds of drops of mercury, spattered across the floor.
        Orange light of the enormous black-furnaces dances on liquid metal.

197     TERMINATOR struggles to rise.  One arm is shattered, the hand smashed
        and useless.  And some leg-servos are damaged.  He can barely stand.
        John and Sarah arrive.

                                TERMINATOR
                We don't have much time.

                                JOHN
                What?

        Terminator points.  John and Sarah watch as --

198     INSERT, T-1000 DROPLETS are creeping together.  Fusing into larger
        blobs.  These pools shiver and run together, soon forming a central
        mass.

199     ON JOHN AND SARAH, realizing it's not over.

                                JOHN
                Come on!  Let's go!

        Terminator gets one of Sarah's arms over his shoulder and they go.
        BEHIND THEM, something is moving.
200     A HEAD is forming up out of a pool mercury.  it rises, as shoulders
        form.  hunching up from the liquid mass.  Half-formed, it turns to 
        look straight at them.

        John looks back in new terror as --

        The T-1000 rises to man-height.  It is still in mercury form, but its
        features are forming rapidly.  It takes its first step after them.
        Sarah stumbles and they pull her up.
201     Terminator himself has a pronounces limp, dragging one leg with a
        shattered ankle joint.  John's the one pulling, straining, driving
        them forward.  They round a corner into --

202     INT. AISLE BETWEEN FURNACES

        It is a maze of monstrous machinery.  The heat is tremendous.
        The air shivers with a pounding roar.
        Sarah cries out in pain and stumbles again.

                                JOHN
                Come on, Mom, you can do it!  Come on!!

        They drag her up, and stagger on.  Her leg is bathed in blood and she
        is deathly pale.  He looks back.

203     INT, MAIN GALLERY

        The T-1000 steps INTO FRAME.  Fully formed.  The hell-fire light
        glints on its impassive cop face.  It walks forward.  At first it
        seems unaffected by its crystallization but --

203A    ANGLE ON ITS HAND as it touches a railing in passing.  The railing is
        covered with O.S.H.A. yellow-and-black safety tape.
        The hand turns yellow and black, the color fading to normal by about
        the elbow.  It rips the hand from the railing with difficulty.  There
        is a sound like adhesive tape ripping off a surface.

203B    The T-1000 looks at its yellow-and-black striped hand.  It wills the
        hand back to normal.  We see ripples of "static" or system noise
        moving subtly over the surface of its body.  It's starting to
        "glitch".

203C    TRACKING WITH THE T-1000'S FEET.  With each step, the pattern on the
        tile floor "invades" its lower legs.  Fades as the foot is lifted.
        Returns as it is set down.  The foot is trying to meld with the floor.
        The chameleonic function is out of control.
        The T-1000 is losing it.  It moves forward, searching.  It rounds the
        corner, entering the aisle between the furnaces.

204     INT. AISLE

        Terminator sees the SILHOUETTE closing on them through the smoky
        gleam.  The T-1000 breaks into loping run when it sees them,
        Terminator turns to Sarah over John.

                                TERMINATOR
                Keep going.

        John shakes his head no.  The T-1000 is almost on them.

                                TERMINATOR
                RUN!

        John runs, dragging, half-carrying Sarah as best he can.
        She can barely stay conscious.  Half-running, delirious, she stumbles
        and drops to her knees.  John pulls but she can't rise.

                                JOHN
                        (crying, shouting)
                Come on, you gotta try... please, Mom.  Get up!

        John looks back to see --

204A    TERMINATOR trying to load the M-79.  With his shattered hand, he can
        barely maneuver is last grenade into the breech.
        T-1000 smacks the weapon out of his hands.  It clatters to the floor.

        The grenade spins across the floor, rolling under some machinery.
        Terminator lunges, slamming the T-1000 against a wall with all his
        weight.  The battle is joined.

204B    JOHN AND SARAH have reached the back of the aisle.  It is a cul-de-
        sac, blocked on the end by the base of an IMMENSE SMELTER CRUCIBLE.
        They turn to watch the titans battle in silhouette, backlit by the
        molten sparks falling from the furnaces above.  The battle which will
        decide their fate.

204C    Terminator grabs the T-1000 and hurls it with awesome force against
        the opposite wall of the narrow alley.  In less time than it would
        take to turn, the
204D    T-1000 morphs trough itself, front to back... face emerging from the
        back of its head.
204E    It comes off the wall straight at Terminator, who smashes his good
        fist into its face.  The pile-driver blow buries Terminator's fist
        almost to the elbow.

204F    But the T-1000's head morphs in a split-second into a hand which grips
        Terminator's wrist, and the head "emerges" somewhere else, the
        geometry shifting faster than we can follow.
204G    The T-1000 slams Terminator into a large machine, jamming his arm into
        the moving works.  A massive sliding bar SCISSORS HIS ARM, smashing it
        into junk at the elbow, pinning him in the machine.

        Terminator strains against the machine pinning him.  We hear his
        servos whining with overload.  The T-1000 turns and lopes toward Sarah
        and John.

        Sarah screams and hurls John into a gap between the machines.  He
        falls into a maze of pipes and girders.

205     INT. MAZE OF MACHINES

        JOHN turns to see her in the entrance of the narrow gap.  She could
        follow him but she doesn't.  SUDDENLY a dark mass moves toward him.
        John gasps as a huge steel counterweight, driven by a chain 6 inches
        thick, slides toward him.  He rolls out of the way.  When he looks
        back, he cannot see the opening.

                                JOHN
                Mom!  MOMMM!!

206     INT. AISLE BETWEEN FURNACES

        TERMINATOR strains to reach a 6-foot steel bar lying near him.  Steel
        workers use them to move the red-hot ingots around.  He gets hold of
        the end and uses it as a lever.  With titanic effort he spreads the
        massive components which are holding him, and withdraws him arm, which
        is severed at the elbow.  Dangling junk hands from the crushed joint.

207     SARAH has lost sight of John.  It is much of a goodbye as they will
        have.
        She turns as the T-1000 closes on her.  She is half-slumped against
        the sooty machines, looking barely conscious.  She struggles to load
        a shell into the empty weapon.  At the last instant she whips up the
        RIOT GUN and FIRES.

A207    T-1000's face is blown open, but quickly reforms as it closes on her.
        She fumbles to get another shell into the magazine but --
A208    THUNK!  A steel needle slams through her shoulder, pinning her.
        The polymorphic killer cocks back its other hand.  The index finger
        extends as a gleaming needle, toward her eye --

                                T-1000
                Call to John.  Now.

207C    WHAM!!  SOMETHING whistles down on the T-1000 with such force that is
        cleaves it head and body in two down to the naval.  The 6-foot steel
        bar is imbedded in its body.  Terminator hurls the killer off Sarah.

207D    The T-1000 pulls the steel shaft out of itself and attacks him with
        fury.
        Swinging again and again.  Hammering Terminator back.  Terminator
        falls back against the wall.

        Behind the T-1000 is an enormous I-beam, hanging from two chains.  It
        is used to lift ingots into the smelters, and it runs on a linear
        track.
207E    The T-1000 grabs the I-beam and rolls it down the track.  Straight at
        Terminator.  The two-ton girder smashes into his chest, crushing the
        armor.
        The T-1000 pulls the I-beam back, and then heaves it forward again.
        Terminator turns and takes the second blow on the shoulder.  We hear
        metal crush and break inside him.  He sags, turning to grip the
        wall...
        The third blow slams into his back, smashing his spine and pelvis.  We
        hear servos ratcheting and failing.  He drops to his knees, crucified
        on a wall of machinery.
        The fourth blow is centered between his shoulder blades.  Sound of
        crushing metal.  His skull is partially caved in.
        He slides to the floor.

207F    ON THE T-1000, emotionless as it walks forward.

207G    TERMINATOR is a pathetic shape on the floor.  He is trying to crawl,
        feebly.
        Dragging his malfunctioning legs behind the crushed spine.  His arm
        stump screeches on the tile floor as he inches himself forward.  His
        exposed machine eye burns red with determination.

        We see his prize.  He has the M-79, with the breech still open, 
        cradled in the crook of his ruined arm.  He good hand, the exposed
        steel one, is reaching for the last grenade, which is visible under
        the skirt of the massive smelter base.  His metal fingers reach out
        for it as --

207H    The T-1000 raises the heavy steel bar over his head and stabs it down
        with unbelievable force.  It punches into Terminator's back, through a
        gap in the shattered armor.  The T-1000 levers it back and forth,
        widening the hole.  Then is raises the pointed bar again and slams it
        down.
        It punches right through.  Emerging from Terminator's chest.
        And into the floor.  He is pinioned.  The cyborg sags face down and
        stop moving.  The light goes out of his eye.

                                                CUT TO:

208     INT. MAZE OF MACHINERY

        John scuttles like a rat through the gut of the smelter.  Above him,
        vast machines churn untended.  He hears a voice... SARAH'S
        Calling low and urgent to him.

                                SARAH
                John?  John?  Can you hear me?  Where are you?

208A    He crawls out of the shadows.
        Onto a landing next to one of the SMELTER CRUCIBLES.  Molten steel
        glows bright orange in the crucible of the furnace.  Heat shimmers
        the air, giving everything a hallucinatory quality.

        John sees Sarah nearby, limping toward him.  She can barely move, her
        leg bathed in blood.  He runs toward her.

                                SARAH
                        (gasping)
                Help me, honey...

        TIGHT ON SARAH, her stoic face, as she hobbles forward, reaching out
        to him.  Something rises behind her, OUT OF FOCUS.

209     ANOTHER, IDENTICAL, SARAH... but this one has a shotgun.
        Aimed right at us.

209A    JOHN freezes.  Which is which?  He looks down.  The first Sarah's
        feet are melded with the floor, sucking and fusing with the tiles as
        she walks.  They have the color and pattern of the tiles up to the
        knee.

                                SARAH
                John, get out of the way!!

                                JOHN
                        (screaming)
                SHOOT!!!!

209B    John dives aside.  The Sarah-form spins, changing into you-know-who.
        Sarah starts unloading the shotgun into it.  BOOM!  It staggers back.
        K-CHAK.  She chambers another round.  BOOM!  It staggers again.
        K-CHAK.  BOOM!  And again.  And again.

209C    The T-1000 is blown back a step and Sarah advances with each shot.
        The craters in the T-1000's body "heal" slowly.  Its power is waning.
        She FIRES again.  And again.  Her eyes blazing with feral intensity.
        She walks it back, right to the edge of the pit of MOLTEN STEEL.

        K-CHAK... CLICK.  She's empty.  The T-1000 is right at the edge.  In a
        second it will recover its composure, as its crater hits close slowly.
        She has failed.  Now it will kill them both,
        Except...

210     CLOSEUP TERMINATOR, as the chain drive brings it into view.
        Half human flesh, half chrome steel.
        His red eye gazes right at us as he --
        FIRES.

210A    The T-1000 takes the round in the belly.  The grenade EXPLODES inside
        its body.  A huge hole is blown clean through it, and it is ripped
        open and peeled back, half inside-out.  It topples into the molten
        steel and --

211     The T-1000's head and upper body reappear above the molten steel.
        It is screaming.  A terrifying, inhuman siren of a scream.
        It is changing, morphing, transforming into anything and everything
        it's ever been so rapidly the eye can barely follow it --
        We catch a glimpse of Janelle Voight checkered with the linoleum tile
        colors, Lewis the Guard with knives exploding from his face, other
        faces, switching at a stroboscopic rate now... a face every two frames
        until they merge into one face --

        The T-1000 screams and slips beneath the surface of the molten steel.
        We see liquid silver running in dissipating whorls over the
        superheated surface... until it vanishes, swirling into nothing.

212     JOHN runs to Sarah.  She stands staring into the pit.  The empty
        shotgun slips from her fingers.  Clatters to the floor.  He sees that
        she's okay and he runs to the fallen Terminator.

212A    The crippled cyborg is trying to rise.  Its servos whine and stutter.
        It pathetically lifts itself to a kneeling position, collapses...
        tries again.
        John lifts for all he's worth.  Sarah joins them, helping.
        The help the crippled machine get on its feet.  It can barely stand.

                                TERMINATOR
                I need a vacation.

        They walk to the edge of the pit.  Terminator looks down and sees
        that it is over.

                                JOHN
                        (to Terminator)
                Is it dead?

                                TERMINATOR
                Terminated.

        John unzips Sarah's backpack and takes out the hand of the first
        terminator.

                                JOHN
                Will it melt in there?

                                TERMINATOR
                Yes.  Throw it in.
        
        He does.  It sinks into the lava.  Vanishes.

                                TERMINATOR
                And the chip.

        John takes it out of his pocket.  Looks at it.  Tosses it into the
        smelter.

                                SARAH
                It's finally over.

                                TERMINATOR
                No.  There is another chip.

        He touches a metal finger to the side of his head.

                                TERMINATOR
                And it must be destroyed also.

        John suddenly understands what he means.
        Terminator looks at Sarah.  They both know what must be done.
        John shakes his head.

                                JOHN
                No!

                                TERMINATOR
                I'm sorry, John.

                                JOHN
                No, no no!!  It'll be okay.  Stay with us!

                                TERMINATOR
                I have to go away, John.

                                JOHN
                Don't do it.  Please... don't go --

        Tears are streaming down his face.

        TIGHT CLOSEUP TERMINATOR, turning toward John.
        The human side of his face is in shadow, so we see mostly the chrome
        skull and the red eye.

                                TERMINATOR
                It must end here... or I am the future.

                                JOHN
                I order you not to!

        Terminator puts his hand on John's shoulder.  He moves slightly and
        the human side of his face comes into the light.
        He reaches toward John's face.  His metal finger touches the tear
        trickling down his cheek.

                                TERMINATOR
                I know now why you cry.  But it is something I
                can never do.
                        (to both of them)
                Goodbye.

        Sarah looks at Terminator.  Reaches out her hand to shake it.
        They lock eyes.  Warriors.  Comrades.

                                SARAH
                Are you afraid?

                                TERMINATOR
                Yes.

        He turns and steps off the edge.
213     They watch him sink into the lava.
        He disappears... the metal hand sinking last... at the last second it
        forms into a fist with the thumb extended... a final thumbs up.
        Then it is gone.

214     HOLD ON JOHN AND SARAH, watching through the heat ripples as we --

                                                DISSOLVE TO:

215     THE SUN, PURE IN A CLOUDLESS SKY
        Tilting down reveal that we are in a park, very green.  People are
        casually dressed, having fun.  Cycling, reading... children are
        playing in a playground.

        Beyond the line of tree we see the skyline of Washington, D.C., with
        the Capital Building and the Washington Monument.  The skyline is
        subtly changed, with a lot of new buildings, advanced high-rises.
        A CARD APPEARS

                                July 11, 2029

        WE BOOM DOWN AND TRACK LATERALLY through a playground in the
        foreground.  Children swinging on swings.  Sliding down slides.
        Timeless things that 4 decades of technical advancement will not
        change.  As we track we hear:

                                SARAH (V.O.)
                August 29th 1997 came and went.  Nothing much
                happened.  Michael Jackson turned forty.  There
                was no Judgment Day.  People went to work as
                they always do, laughed, complained, watched
                TV, made love.

        We pass a jungle gym, neither melted nor burned, but full of kids
        swinging and yelling raucously.  Past it we drop down to see a boy
        pumping the pedals of a tricycle.

                                SARAH (V.O.)
                I wanted to run down the street yelling... to
                grab them all and say "Every day form this day
                is a gift.  Use it well!"  Instead I got drunk.

        STILL TRACKING we come to rest on an elderly woman seated on a bench.
        It is SARAH, now 64 years old.  The world has aged her, but she seems
        at peace in this moment.  She speaks into a microcassette recorder.

                                SARAH (V.O.)
                That was thirty years ago.  But the dark future
                which never came still exists for me, and it
                always will, like the traces of a dream lingering
                in the morning light.  And the war against the
                machines goes on.  Or, to be more precise, the
                war against those who build the wrong machines.

        There is a man in is forties playing with two small children
        nearby.  He turns.  It is John Connor.  Through he has the same stern
        features in adulthood, there is no eye-patch, no scarring.  He is far
        from the haggard man on grim destiny we saw in the world that might
        have been.  But there is still penetrating intelligence, even wisdom,
        in his eyes.

                                SARAH (V.O.)
                John fights the war differently than it was
                foretold.  Here, on the battlefield of the
                Senate, the weapons are common sense... and
                hope.

        A FOUR-YEAR-OLD GIRL runs to her to have her shoelace tied.

                                GIRL
                Tie me, grandma.

        Grandma Sarah smiles.  It is the only time we have seen her smile so
        far.  She bends as the little girls puts her foot up on the bench.
        She ties as we hear:

                                SARAH (V.O.)
                The luxury of hope was given to me by the
                Terminator.  Because if a machine can learn
                the value of human life... maybe we can too.

        Sarah ruffles the kids's hair as she runs off to play with her dad.

          FADE IN ON:
          
          
          INT.   DEATH ROW/CELL - DAWN
          
          START TIGHT ON MARCUS WRIGHT. He's an intense, powerful man,
          20's-30's, his head shaven. Marcus stares INTO CAMERA with a
          resigned expression. We hear the voice of a PRIEST:
          
                               PRIEST
                     Yea, though I walk through the valley
                     of the shadow of death, I will fear
                     no evil: for thou art beside me; thy
                     rod and thy staff they comfort me...
          
          CAMERA PULLS BACK, straight up. MARCUS lies in his cot,
          staring at the ceiling. He's smoking a CIGARETTE. This
          OVERHEAD ANGLE reveals a PRIEST with a BIBLE, in a folding
          chair beside him. A CHESS SET, stacks of BOOKS, WRITING
          MATERIALS in the cell. TWO GUARDS wait, shackles in hand.
          
          MARCUS has no interest in scripture. He blows a cloud of
          SMOKE which drifts in the direction of the PRIEST, who blinks
          and shuts his bible.
          
          One of the GUARDS unlocks the cell door for--
          
          DR. SERENA KOGAN. She's in her 30's-50's, brilliant,
          attractive, but thin and pale, a scarf tied around her head.
          She carries a CLIPBOARD. The PRIEST backs off to give her
          some privacy with Marcus.
          
                               SERENA
                     Marcus-- I'm Doctor Serena Kogan, I'm
                     with Project Angel. You consented to
                     donate your body to science...

          CONTINUED:
          
                                 MARCUS
                       Yeah, I'm pretty much done with it.
          
                                 SERENA
                       You've been chosen for our research.
          
                                   MARCUS
                       Chosen?    Lucky me.
          
                                 SERENA
                       We just need a couple of signatures...
          
          Marcus sits up, she passes him the clipboard and pen-- he
          notes that her hands are SHAKING.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       You don't need to be scared.
          
                                   SERENA
                       I'm not.    It's nerve degeneration.
          
          MARCUS looks up from the form, takes in the scarf covering
          her sparse hair.
          
                                   MARCUS
                       Cancer?
          
                                  SERENA
                           (NODS)
                       You're not the only one with a
                       death sentence.
          
          MARCUS meets her eyes.      She studies him a beat.
          
                                 SERENA (cont'd)
                       What you're doing is important,
                       Marcus. Our work is still highly
                       experimental... but you may be
                       helping people in ways you can't
                       begin to imagine.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       I'm a regular hero.
          
          With that sarcastic comment, he SIGNS HIS NAME-- we see the
          words "PROJECT ANGEL" at the top of DENSE TYPE on the form.
          
          SERENA takes the clipboard, starts to rise.         She touches his
          hand for a moment.
                                                                   (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED: (2)
          
                                  SERENA
                     Thank you.     And... I'm sorry.
          
                               MARCUS
                     No one lives forever.
          
          THE GUARD sees SERENA out.

          LOW ANGLE - MARCUS' CHAINED ANKLES clank as the GUARDS lead
          him down the corridor, past PRISONERS in their cells; some
          avert their eyes, others give a nod or raise a fist.
          
                               PRIEST (V.O.)
                     Marcus, this is your last
                     opportunity to make a confession...
          
          MARCUS stares straight ahead, taking deep, steady breaths,
          struggling not to succumb to fear.
          
                               PRIEST (V.O.) (cont'd)
                     Is there nothing you would say to
                     Officer Martinez' family?

          FOREARM... A NEEDLE punctures his skin.
          
                               MARCUS (V.O.)
                     What can I say. I was seventeen, I
                     was angry, I was stupid.
          
          FINGERS turn the VALVE to release the LETHAL CHEMICALS.
          
          CLOSE ON MARCUS' EYES, looking up toward--
          
          THE DEADLY I.V., running into his arm.
          
          From this, he looks toward--
          
          HIS REFLECTION in a one-way mirror, the dim shapes of
          WITNESSES beyond.

          As the lethal injection takes hold, his POV moves to BRIGHT

          From the WHITE SCREEN, a FACE emerges, backlit, blurred--
          it's SERENA. She's in focus for just a moment, leaning INTO

          EXT.   CORNFIELD - DUSK
          
          CORNSTALKS as far as the eye can see, rustling in a summer
          breeze. FIGURES are moving within the FIELD. We only make
          them out in SILHOUETTE, but all carry HEAVY RIFLES.
          
          
          INT.   A-10 COCKPIT - DUSK
          
          A COMPUTER TARGETING SCREEN - the FIGURES are HIGHLIGHTED in
          this tactical display, as is an OCTAGONAL HATCH into the
          ground beneath the corn.
          
          
          EXT.   CORNFIELD - DUSK
          
          THE FIGURES in the corn look up-- we hear an AIRCRAFT
          APPROACH with a JET WHINE--
          
          FWOOM! A MASSIVE CONCUSSION as a BUNKER-BUSTING MISSILE
          BORES into the earth at high-velocity, burrowing deep--
          
          --then a HUGE BLAST - FLAME and DIRT are thrown high in the
          air, many of the FIGURES blown sky-high.
          
          A FLAMING BODY hits the ground IN FG, FACE TO CAMERA... we
          now see it was a STEEL TERMINATOR-- its METAL SKULL BLOWN
          OPEN and SCORCHED, its RED EYES SHATTERED.
          
                                                                (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                            5.
          CONTINUED:
          
          A-10 WARTHOGS-- stubby attack planes-- SCREAM from the sky,
          RAKING THE REMAINING FIGURES with CANNON FIRE, BLASTING THEM
          to bits. These aircraft no longer bear traditional U.S.
          insignia-- they're painted in WILD COLORS, graffiti lettering
          says things like: "BOT BLASTER," "KILL FOR CONNOR," "RAGE
          AGAINST THE MACHINES," etc... Resistance fighters.
          
          Motley military and civilian CHOPPERS LAND in the CORNFIELD,
          disgorging RESISTANCE SOLDIERS. These are human troops in
          high-tech HELMETS, carrying slightly futuristic conventional
          ASSAULT WEAPONS.
          
          THE WARTHOGS veer off, laying NAPALM in the distance behind
          the SOLDIERS. The troops run toward--
          
          --AN OPENING which has been blown into the ground, the
          remains of the octagonal hatch where the bunker-buster hit.
          
          A surviving TERMINATOR rises from the SINGED CORN, FIRES its
          PLASMA RIFLE--
          
          --DROPPING A SOLDIER. His comrades FIRE EXPLOSIVE BULLETS--
          and BLOW THE ROBOT APART. The LEADER of this assault group
          waves his soldiers to enter the dark hatchway.
          
          
          INT.   UNDERGROUND FACILITY/CORRIDOR - NIGHT
          
          COLLAPSED CEILINGS, FLAMES, a high-tech installation in
          ruins; RED LIGHTING, distinctive of Skynet environments.
          
          SOLDIERS flick on HELMET LAMPS and make their way carefully
          inside-- pretty deserted. They kick aside rubble to enter--
          
          
          INT.   UNDERGROUND FACILITY/ROBOTIC ROOM - NIGHT
          
          HELMET BEAMS play over BANKS OF ELECTRONICS and--
          
          --a dozen fixed, INDUSTRIAL ROBOTS-- not remotely HUMANOID--
          engaged in mysterious tasks, mechanical arms at work.
          
          THE SOLDIERS rake the room with GUNFIRE-- MACHINERY
          collapses, SPARKS from EXPLODING CIRCUITRY.
          
          
          INT.   UNDERGROUND FACILITY/CORRIDOR - NIGHT
          
          Deeper into the complex, A HEAVY DOOR BLOWS off its hinges.
                                                              (CONTINUED)

                                 TEAM LEADER
                       Clear!
          
          SOLDIERS move from cover and through the blown door.
          
          
          INT.   UNDERGROUND FACILITY/STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT
          
          TUBES and FIBER-OPTIC CABLES run into DOZENS OF GLASS
          CYLINDERS filled with translucent PINK LIQUID. The SOLDIERS
          make their way in, alert-- but nothing's moving in here.
          
          THE TEAM LEADER peers into a cylinder, aims his HEADLAMP at--
          
          --A small MASS OF TISSUE floating inside, connected to a
          dense network of FIBER-OPTIC CABLES... it's a HUMAN BRAIN.
          
                                 TEAM LEADER
                       Oh God.
          
          THE TEAM LEADER recoils-- but before he can say more, the
          ROOM SHAKES with a DEAFENING ROAR.
          
          
          EXT.   CORNFIELD - NIGHT
          
          A huge ESCAPE SHIP rises straight up from an open HATCHWAY.
          Nearby TROOPS crouch and FIRE after it. THE SHIP PIVOTS in
          mid-air and ROARS OFF, SOLDIERS dodging the ENGINE BLAST.
          
          
          INT.   UNDERGROUND FACILITY/STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT
          
          THE TEAM LEADER speaks into his headset. The OTHER SOLDIERS
          inspect the many CYLINDERS, react in horror and shock.
          
                                 TEAM LEADER
                       You will not believe the shit we
                       found down here--
          
          As he speaks, CAMERA FINDS a GREEN LED on the ceiling-- which
          suddenly FLASHES RED and BLINKS RAPIDLY--
          
          
          EXT.   CORNFIELD - NIGHT
          
          WIDE - AN IMMENSE SUBTERRANEAN BLAST causes a few hundred
          yards square to SWELL and then COLLAPSE.
          
                                                             (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          JETS of FLAME, SMOKE and DIRT RISE in the aftermath.
          
          
          INT.   CHOPPER - NIGHT
          
          A PANICKED PILOT on the radio:
          
                                 PILOT
                       --repeat, that was not us! A ship
                       escaped, they musta blown the place
                       themselves! Jesus, a lot of our
                       guys were still down there...
          
          
          EXT.   CORNFIELD - NIGHT
          
          SOLDIERS above ground help the WOUNDED to EVAC CHOPPERS.
          
          IN FG, FIND the STEEL SKULL of the dead TERMINATOR.
          
                                                             DISSOLVE TO:
          
          
          EXT.   CORNFIELD - DAY
          
          SAME ANGLE-- the TERMINATOR now half-sunk in mud. A FIELD
          MOUSE has nested in its skull cavity, seeking shelter from
          RAINDROPS.
          
          Months have passed, the season changed-- CORN long dead, a
          black stubble. RAIN falls.
          
          A PATCH OF MUD stirs-- something below is moving.       The MUD
          roils, seeming to assume a HUMAN SHAPE...
          
          EYES OPEN, looking around in shock, the naked FIGURE is so
          drenched in mud we can't recognize it at first. The figure
          rises, looks up at the sky, and FALLING RAIN washes away mud
          from his face... it's MARCUS WRIGHT. He opens his mouth,
          makes a few GUTTURAL NOISES... then SCREAMS.
          
          CAMERA PULLS UP from MARCUS' AGONIZED FACE...
          
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
                                                                          8.
          
          
          EXT.   PLATEAU - EVENING
          
          BARE FEET trudge through the dirt. MARCUS moves along a
          slight rise, wrapped in torn and filthy RAGS, mud caked on
          his body. Eerie silence. Reaching the edge of a rise, he
          sees in the distance--
          
          A DECIMATED CITY, buildings collapsed into rubble.
          
          
          EXT.   DEAD CITY - NIGHT
          
          MOONLIGHT. THE SKELETON of a large DOG lies on the ground,
          partially covered by a dusting of SNOW. It still bears a
          rotting COLLAR attached to a CHAIN.
          
          MOVE to a CHAIN-LINK FENCE, partially collapsed, a singed,
          faded sign: "BEWARE OF DOG."
          
          WIDER, we're in the low-rent district of this CITY IN RUINS--
          rubble, random walls still stand. Hulks of cars, rusted,
          windowless. It's been over a decade since the bombs fell.
          
          MARCUS is the only thing alive here. He moves down this
          block, picks up a handful of SNOW, brings it to his lips.
          
          A COLLAPSED NEWSSTAND. MARCUS walks past the racks, picks up
          a MAGAZINE which crumbles in his hands.
          
          A HUMAN SKELETON, clothes in tatters, is half-buried behind
          the collapsed counter. There's a bulge in its shirt pocket.
          
          MARCUS gingerly reaches into the pocket and fishes out a
          cellophane-wrapped PACK OF CIGARETTES and a butane LIGHTER.
          
          MARCUS sits on a piece of rubble by the skeleton. He tears
          open the packet and puts a dried-out, stale cigarette to his
          lips, tries the lighter a few times, finally gets a flame.
          He lights the cig, inhales deeply-- he waits for a rush,
          feels nothing. He takes a few more drags, increasingly
          disappointed, then flicks the cigarette away.
          
          He rises, looks toward a caved-in STOREFRONT, makes out a
          clothing store's TATTERED SIGN on the ground, amidst broken
          glass: "SALE! GOING OUT OF BUSINESS! EVERYTHING MUST GO!"
          
                                                                            9.
          
          
          INT.   RUINED CLOTHING STORE - NIGHT
          
          FALLEN RACKS, CLOTHES and SHOES covered in years of dust and
          rubble. MARCUS, grateful to be rid of the rags, has pulled
          on jeans and sneakers, using the CIGARETTE LIGHTER for
          illumination. He kicks away some FALLEN CEILING TILES from a
          RACK OF ARMY JACKETS. He holds one up-- looks good.
          
          
          INT.   RUINED BAR - NIGHT
          
          Partially collapsed, a downscale watering hole. Broken
          stools, booths, a dead pinball machine. MARCUS, dressed now,
          again using the LIGHTER to find his way, sorts through the
          broken glass and rubble behind the bar, comes up with--
          
          A DUSTY BOTTLE OF WHISKY.
          
                               MARCUS
                     Hallelujah.
          
          He unscrews the cap, raises the bottle to a SKELETON on the
          floor nearby. Marcus takes a long pull-- and CHOKES,
          instantly dizzy. He sinks to the floor, passing out.
          
                                                      CUT TO BLACK.
          
          MEMORY MONTAGE: quick, fragmentary, impressionistic POVs,
          blurred, altered. SFX of HEARTBEATS, a RESPIRATOR.
          
          --WEBS of TUBES and FIBER-OPTICS FILLS THE FRAME.
          
          --GRIDS OF LASER LIGHT scan rapidly INTO CAMERA.
          
          --DIGITAL DISPLAYS blink through murky LIQUID. SERENA moves
          INTO FRAME, a look of concentration on her face as she peers
          through the LIQUID, INTO CAMERA. She starts to smile.
          
                                                       DISSOLVE TO:
          
          
          EXT.   DEAD CITY - DAY
          
          BLUE SKY. TILT DOWN to find MARCUS, who plods on through the
          dead city's outskirts. He pauses near a collapsed BUS KIOSK.
          A SMILING WOMAN stares out at him from a faded ADVERTISEMENT.
          
          MARCUS studies the woman. She's nothing like Serena, but her
          expression recalls the beckoning vision.
                                                              (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                           10.
          CONTINUED:
          
          He runs his hand over the image of her face, pulls away a
          chunk of cracked, graffitied GLASS over the poster. Then he
          carefully tears the poster to remove the woman's face, folds
          the paper, slips it in a pocket and continues on.
          
          
          EXT.   HIGHWAY - NIGHT
          
          Deserted, CAR HULKS about, crumbling SKELETONS at the wheels.
          MARCUS moves down the center of the freeway on this MOONLIT
          NIGHT, paying little attention to anything around him. We're
          in mostly flat, treeless plains.
          
          From the opposite direction, FIGURES approach, moving through
          the darkness. Marcus hurries excitedly toward them, the
          first living creatures he's seen. He waves.
          
                                  MARCUS
                       Hey!   Yo, over here!
          
          The FIGURES pause, turning toward him in unison.
          
                                 MARCUS (cont'd)
                       Damn it's good to see you guys, I felt
                       like I was the last man on...
          
          He freezes in his tracks. These aren't humans. They're T-
          400s-- PLASTIC-SKINNED TERMINATORS-- armed with PLASMA
          RIFLES. They wear a motley collection of found CLOTHING, but
          their male humanoid faces are identical, unnatural and
          motionless, like masks. Their EYES FLICKER RED as they scan
          him.
          
                                   MARCUS (cont'd)
                       Oh God...
          
          Marcus backs away, runs.      The T-400s stare after him-- but
          don't fire.
          
          ANGLE THROUGH BINOCULAR MASK - MARCUS running for all he's
          worth, heading toward the viewer. We hear a muttering VOICE:
          
                                 BOY
                       Hey mister, where you goin' in such
                       a hurry?
          
          ANGLE ON A BOY, scrawny and filthy, in his early to mid
          teens. He crouches on the supports of a FREEWAY SIGN.
          
                                                                (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                            11.
          CONTINUED:
          
          He wears layers of TATTERED, OVER-SIZED CLOTHING.     He
          scrambles quickly down from the sign.
          
          AT AN OFF-RAMP, Marcus' pace slows as he moves to get off the
          freeway, when--
          
          THE BOY emerges from behind some RUBBLE, holding a HANDGUN in
          one hand, a lit OIL LANTERN in the other.
          
                                 BOY (cont'd)
                       Whoah, whoah-- hang on there.   Got
                       any food?
          
          Marcus raises his hands, shakes his head.     The boy looks him
          over dubiously.
          
                                 BOY (cont'd)
                       You look like you been eating
                       pretty good.
          
          The boy moves closer, puts down the LANTERN, frisks Marcus
          with one hand while holding the gun on him with the other.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       You're human... you can see me, you
                       can touch me. This place is real.
          
          THE BOY makes a dubious face, yanks a handful of PAPER SCRAPS
          from Marcus' pocket.
          
                                 MARCUS (cont'd)
                       I thought I was in hell.
          
                                 BOY
                           (raises an eyebrow)
                       This sure ain't heaven.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       Those things with masks, red eyes--
          
                                 BOY
                           (CASUALLY)
                       Terminators-- T-400s.   What is this stuff?
          
          THE BOY unfolds the paper scraps in the LANTERN LIGHT--
          
          ANGLE ON PAPER SCRAPS - the WOMAN'S FACE from the poster, a
          fragment of a MODEL'S PHOTO from a MAGAZINE AD, a painting of
          a FEMALE FACE from a PAPERBACK COVER.
                                                                (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED: (2)
          
          THE BOY looks puzzled, intrigued by the pictures. But with
          sudden speed, MARCUS GRABS THE BOY'S GUN HAND and wrenches it
          hard-- it FIRES into the air. MARCUS gets control of the
          gun, wraps one arm around the boy's throat.
          
                              MARCUS
                    If I'm not in hell, where am I?!
          
                              BOY
                        (CHOKING)
                    Texas!
          
          The NOISE of a SHOTGUN PUMPING close behind MARCUS--
          
          MARCUS spins to face his attacker, pressing the handgun into
          the boy's cheek. He's face to face with--
          
          A GIRL, a couple of years younger than the BOY, training the
          shotgun at Marcus' head-- she looks ready to shoot.
          
                              GIRL
                    Let him go!
          
                              MARCUS
                    First put down the shotgun.
          
          THE GIRL shakes her head angrily.   She wears an aged, beloved
          BASEBALL CAP with a STAR on it.
          
                              BOY
                    Do what he says.
          
                              GIRL
                    He'll kill us both!
          
                              MARCUS
                    I don't wanna kill anyone.
          
                              BOY
                    Do it, Star. Put it down.
          
          She shakes her head slightly, aiming carefully at Marcus'
          head, just a few feet away, a slight smile on her face.
          
                              GIRL
                    There was only one bullet in that gun.
          
          MARCUS hooks his foot around the oil lantern and deftly--
          
                                                             (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED: (3)
          
          --BOOTS IT at the GIRL. BURNING OIL spills across her leg,
          she cries out and fumbles the shotgun. MARCUS tosses the BOY
          at her, the two of them SPRAWL on the ground, the shotgun
          falling to one side--
          
          MARCUS quickly snatches up the shotgun.
          
          Using SNOW, the BOY helps the GIRL extinguish the flames from
          her clothing.
          
          MARCUS stands over the kids with a gun in each hand.   He
          struggles to control anger, speaks quietly.
          
                              MARCUS
                    I don't like it when people point
                    guns at me.
          
                              GIRL
                    It wasn't loaded.
          
          MARCUS quickly checks the chambers of both the shotgun and
          handgun-- indeed, both are empty.
          
                              MARCUS
                    You took on a guy like me with one
                    bullet and an empty shotgun?
                        (studies them admiringly)
                    Pretty stupid.
          
          He shoves the handgun in his belt, puts the shotgun down and
          kneels to pick up fallen scraps of paper-- a few have caught
          FIRE and are incinerated.
          
          THE BOY and GIRL get to their feet, stare at Marcus.
          
                              GIRL
                    Can I have my gun back?
          
          MARCUS shrugs, gestures for her to pick it up.   He still
          looks at the PICTURES in his hands.
          
                              GIRL (cont'd)
                    Where'd you get those?
          
                              MARCUS
                    In the city.

                        (steps away from him)
                    The city? Oh man. That place is
                    red hot.
          
                              MARCUS
                        (a small smile)
                    Seemed kinda dead to me.
          
                              BOY
                    No-- radiation.
          
          A SPOTLIGHT appears in the distance-- a ROVING HUNTER-KILLER
          moving in their direction.
          
          Quickly, automatically, the kids dive for cover behind a WALL
          OF DEBRIS. MARCUS looks toward the LIGHT, unaware of danger.
          
          THE BOY bolts from behind cover, grabs MARCUS by the arm--
          
                              BOY (cont'd)
                    Get down, they've seen the light!
          
          He drags Marcus back behind the debris wall, just in time--
          
          As the H-K nears, the LIGHT FINDS the BURNING OIL. It FIRES
          BLUE PULSES, which CHEW up the asphalt nearby-- then it moves
          on, failing to pick out the humans. Marcus is dumbfounded.
          
                              MARCUS
                    That wasn't a helicopter...
          
                              BOY
                    It's an H-K-- hunter-killer.   Where
                    the hell have you been?
          
                              GIRL
                    Rads musta fried his brains.   Let's
                    go, Kyle.
          
          The H-K has vanished in the distance. The girl rises.   The
          boy-- KYLE-- shakes his head, stays at Marcus' side.
          
                              KYLE
                    What's your name?
          
                              MARCUS

                     She doesn't remember her name--
                         (re: her cap)
                     --so I call her Star.
          
          STAR gives Marcus a small, reluctant wave.
          
                               KYLE (cont'd)
                     Gonna be light soon, Marcus, better
                     find cover. We spotted some
                     buildings half a mile that way.
          
          KYLE points but gets no response. He shrugs, sets off with
          Star in that direction. Kyle calls over his shoulder:
          
                               KYLE (cont'd)
                     You can come if you want.

                         (hissing at him)
                     Why? We don't need him.

                         (a shrug, sotto)
                     I like him. He's funny.
          
          MARCUS looks around at the desolate world-- and the two teens
          receding ahead of him. After a beat, he follows.
          
                                                            CUT TO:

          KYLE, STAR and MARCUS move along the roadside, heading toward
          dark BUILDINGS a few hundred yards off near an overpass.

          A MEXICAN FAST FOOD JOINT, windows broken, sign collapsed,
          near a two-story MOTEL with a COVERED CARPORT. The pavement
          is CRACKED, the structures WEATHERED, abandoned for a decade.
          
          MARCUS, KYLE and STAR suddenly rise from a hiding spot by a
          DUMPSTER in a parking area. KYLE scans the FAST-FOOD PLACE
          with the binoculars, while STAR studies a WATCH she carries.

          They drop down again.
          
          ONE AEROSTAT patrols the area. It's a surveillance drone the
          size of a softball, shiny steel, an inset camera lens with a
          RED GLOW. It flies in a geometric pattern, hovering every
          few seconds before continuing on. It vanishes around the
          corner of the fast-food joint, moving in the direction of the
          motel. STAR has been timing its moves.
          
                                 STAR

          KYLE and STAR dash for the fast-food entrance, MARCUS just
          behind. They round the doorway and--
          
          
          INT.   FAST FOOD JOINT - DAY
          
          --drop down inside behind an upended table in what was once a
          taco place, remnants of Mexican decor.
          
          THROUGH A DIRTY WINDOW, they see the AEROSTAT buzz past,
          flying its pattern. It moves on without spotting them, then
          takes off in a new direction.
          
          KYLE and STAR set to searching the place, something they've
          done many times. They go through trash cans, check behind
          the counters and in the kitchen. MARCUS gets up, still
          looking out the windows.
          
                                 MARCUS

                       Aerostat-- one of Skynet's eyes.
                       They patrol places like this,
                       looking for survivors.
          
                                 STAR
                       Yes!
          
          She's come up with some UNOPENED PACKETS OF CONDIMENTS from a
          bag of TRASH. KYLE trots over.
          
                                 KYLE
                       Any red ones?
          
          She nods excitedly, hands him a packet.    He tears it open,
          sucks down the contents eagerly.

          STAR discards one packet, sucks at another-- and immediately
          makes a pained face and tosses the packet aside.
          
                                    STAR
                       Yuk!
          
          MARCUS picks up the packet, looks at it.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       Jalapeño sauce.
          
          STAR and KYLE pause in their eating, stare at him.
          
                                 STAR
                       You can read.
          
          MARCUS shrugs modestly.

                       So can I.
                           (off Star's look)
                       Well, sort of... a little.
          
          With obvious reluctance, STAR holds a packet of mustard
          toward Marcus.
          
                                    STAR
                       Want some?
          
          Marcus gallantly waves it away.
          
                                    MARCUS
                       No thanks.     Not hungry.

          STAR closes tattered curtains, plops on the bare bed, ready
          for sleep. The room's a mess, GRAFFITI here and there, trash
          scattered about; they're not the first squatters who've been
          here. THE GUNS and STAR'S WATCH lie on a dresser.
          
          KYLE sits before the TV-- he's scratching STICK FIGURES onto
          the screen with a rusted POCKETKNIFE. One is clearly meant
          to be him; the smaller one, wearing a baseball cap, is Star.
          
                                 KYLE
                       You ever watch television?

                       It was great.
          
          KYLE plops on the bed next to STAR, who's already out.
          MARCUS studies them.
          
                                 MARCUS

          MARCUS notices now that Kyle is asleep-- it's as if he's
          lulled him with a bedtime story. Marcus is oddly touched,
          pulls a cover over both the kids. KYLE starts, half-asleep--

          So saying, KYLE falls back asleep. MARCUS sighs, moves
          through the room, quietly opens a drawer or two and finds--
          
          A BIBLE.

          AFTERNOON LIGHT, MARCUS sits on the floor by a room door,
          shotgun leaned on the wall at his side. He has the bible
          open in his lap, head bowed over it. CLOSER-- his eyes are
          closed, he's asleep.
          
          THE DOOR OPENS behind him, STAR peers out-- and looks
          relieved to see Marcus is still with them. As she takes a
          step toward him, he starts awake.

          Star's face lights up, she nods eagerly, sings along:
          
                              MARCUS & STAR
                    "How I wonder what you are... up
                    above the world so high, like a
                    diamond in the sky..."
          
          STAR is dizzy with emotion, wipes an eye, turning away.
          
                              MARCUS
                    You OK?
          
                              STAR
                        (shakes her head)
                    Somebody used to sing that to me.
          
          MARCUS puts the phonebook aside, puts a hand on her arm; and
          she leans into him for a hug, tears forming in her eyes.
          
                              STAR (cont'd)
                    Stay with us, Marcus. Please.

          MARCUS looks down at her, affected.

          EXT.   MOTEL - DAY
          
          AEROSTAT POV - a PIXELLATED ELECTRONIC IMAGE as it patrols
          the MOTEL AREA in its geometric pattern. It ZOOMS into the
          CARPORT, quickly scanning the abandoned VEHICLES, among which
          is an aged, open JEEP WRANGLER, its HOOD UP, parked beside a
          customized VAN. The cars are covered in DUST, the TIRES
          FLAT, they've been sitting here for a decade.
          
          OBJECTIVE ANGLE - the AEROSTAT zips off on its rounds. After
          a moment, the VAN DOOR slides open. MARCUS moves quickly
          back to the JEEP, KYLE and STAR behind him.
          
          STAR checks her WATCH while MARCUS goes back to work on the
          JEEP'S ENGINE. He's found some tools, already has removed
          and cleaned SPARK PLUGS, dismantled the DISTRIBUTOR. KYLE,
          meanwhile, returns to INFLATING one of the tires with a
          BICYCLE PUMP.
          
                               KYLE
                     If we get it to move, will you
                     teach me to make it go?
          
                               MARCUS
                     It's called driving.   Sure.
          
          STAR wipes DIRT off the side of the VAN, revealing air-
          brushed ARTWORK beneath...
          
                                STAR
                     Wow.   What were these like?
          
          MARCUS looks up from his work to see--
          
          A WHITE UNICORN in a FIELD OF FLOWERS.
          
                               MARCUS

          EXT.   MOTEL - NIGHT
          
          THE AEROSTAT zips past the CARPORT.   As soon as its gone--
          
                                 STAR
                     Now!
          
          THE JEEP is suddenly PUSHED from the carport, tires somewhat
          inflated. MARCUS is on one side of the rear, KYLE on the
          other, STAR behind the wheel, the seat moved all the way up.
          
          They get the vehicle to a slight SLOPE, it begins to roll on
          its own.
          
                               MARCUS
                     Pop the clutch! Let your foot up!
          
          ANGLE IN JEEP
          
          We see it's been hot-wired. STAR has her foot all the way
          down on the clutch, now lets up--
          
          THE JEEP BUCKS and SPUTTERS... but CATCHES. As soon as it
          does, MUSIC BLARES from the tape deck-- raucous HEAVY METAL,
          the aged cassette SPEEDS and SLOWS. MARCUS runs for the
          driver's side, but the JEEP is pulling ahead fast.
          
          ANGLE IN JEEP
          
          STAR is staring at the speaker, mesmerized at the sound of
          the MUSIC. When she looks out the windshield--
          
          --she's about to HIT A WALL, SQUEALS in terror--
          
          --MARCUS vaults in and pushes her aside, squeezing behind the
          wheel, hitting the brakes and throwing the Jeep into neutral.
          
                               KYLE
                     Aerostat's coming!
          
          KYLE hops in back as MARCUS adjusts the seat and FLOORS IT.
          THE KIDS are exhilarated as MARCUS zooms out of there,
          heading off-road across the plains, LIGHTS OFF, MUSIC LOUD.
          
                                 STAR
                     Music...

                     Sort of.

          CONTINUED:
          
          MARCUS turns the MUSIC DOWN.       He looks up to see--
          
          --THE AEROSTAT, right over their heads, keeping pace with the
          vehicle, RED LIGHTS FLASHING.
          
          KYLE rises in back, SWINGS at it with the SHOTGUN BUTT--
          
          THE AEROSTAT deftly dodges the blows.
          
                                 STAR
                       Oh no! It's gonna call a
                       Harvester, we're dead--
          
          MARCUS SLAMS on the brakes-- the AEROSTAT stops a few feet
          ahead of them, hovering in the air.
          
          MARCUS picks up an X-shaped LUG WRENCH from behind his seat,
          rises, taking aim--
          
          --and HURLS THE WRENCH with amazing speed and power--
          
          --it flies like a throwing star and SMASHES the AEROSTAT to
          BITS in a shower of SPARKS and METAL.
          
          The three of them stare breathlessly for a moment.
          
                                  KYLE
                       Wow.   You're good.
          
          MARCUS flexes his hand, startled at his own strength.
          
                                                            DISSOLVE TO:
          
          
          EXT.   TEXAS PLAINS - NIGHT
          
          The JEEP moves off-road, HEADLIGHTS OFF, traveling by
          MOONLIGHT. It SWERVES and BUCKS from time to time. MUSIC
          PLAYS from the TAPE DECK, something more melodic.
          
          ANGLE IN JEEP - KYLE behind the wheel, having the time of his
          life, MARCUS supervising, STAR enjoying the breeze and the
          unfamiliar sensation of a moving vehicle.
          
                                   STAR
                       Faster!
          
                                   MARCUS
                       No!    You're doing fine.
                                                                    (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          The SONG suddenly GARBLES, turning to NOISE. MARCUS ejects
          the tape, pulls it out-- it's unspooled, tangled in the
          stereo's guts. THE KIDS groan disappointedly. STATIC from
          the radio now... but a FAINT VOICE audible beneath it.
          
                                 MARCUS (cont'd)
                       Ssh.
          
          MARCUS FIDDLES with the dial. He can't get the SOUND clear,
          rolls through the dial. Varying levels of STATIC, then a
          relatively CLEAR VOICE:
          
                                 RADIO VOICE
                       --proper ratio of ammonium nitrate
                       to diesel fuel. A bomb of this
                       type can be contained in an
                       ordinary plastic garbage bag, and
                       will detonate on impact...

                       This recording has described booby-
                       traps and explosive devices. It
                       will repeat every two hours on
                       different frequencies to avoid
                       Skynet jamming...
          
          STAR points toward the horizon.    Marcus looks up.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       Stop the car.
          
          KYLE ACCELERATES.

                       Other pedal, other pedal!
          
          They SCREECH to a halt.
          
          IN THE DISTANCE - a RED GLOW of FLAMES far away. SILHOUETTED
          against this, strange FLYING VEHICLES and spindly, spider-
          like MACHINES are just visible.

          moves off in a new direction and vanishes into the darkness.

          HIGH ANGLE - a crumbling SERVICE STATION with a RUSTING
          TANKER on flat tires, the cab long gone.   MOVE TO FIND the
          JEEP approaching off-road.
          
          THE JEEP pulls to a stop, MARCUS gets out from behind the
          wheel and moves to the TANKER. STAR and KYLE, with his
          binocs, scan the area for signs of Skynet surveillance.
          
                               KYLE
                     We oughta find a place to hole up
                     for the day...
          
          MARCUS pounds on the TANKER-- a deep echo.
          
                                 MARCUS
                     Damn it.    Empty.
          
          KYLE sniffs the air.
          
                               KYLE
                     You smell that?
          
          STAR sniffs the air herself, eyes going wide.
          
                                 STAR
                     Food!
          
          They both hop out of the Jeep, running toward the GARAGE,
          each carrying their unloaded GUNS.
          
          HIGH ANGLE - from BEHIND THE RUSTING SIGN, an AEROSTAT
          appears, aimed at the kids, LIGHTS BLINKING.
          
                                                                           29.
          
          
          INT.   SERVICE STATION - DAWN
          
          KYLE and STAR slither under a partially open GARAGE DOOR.
          The space is dark, SMOKE-FILLED... STRIPS OF DRIED MEAT hang
          from the hydraulic lift. The two youths look amazed and
          delighted. Kyle shoves the gun into his waistband, moves to
          the closest strip and PEELS OFF A PIECE, takes a tentative
          bite, then gnaws ravenously. Star leans the shotgun against
          the wall and follows suit.
          
          MARCUS lifts the garage door and enters, DAWN LIGHT streaming
          in behind him.
          
                               MARCUS
                     What is this?
          
                                KYLE
                         (mouth full)
                     Who cares?
          
          Marcus squints at something in the darkness.   He takes a step
          forward, then grabs Star's arm.
          
                               MARCUS
                     Spit it out!

                     It's good!
          
          Now KYLE reacts to what Marcus saw, GAGS and SPITS out meat.
          He's staring at--
          
          --a dried, severed HUMAN HAND, resting on a GRILLE in the
          sunken SERVICE PIT, where a CHARCOAL FIRE smolders.
          
          Star sees it too, turns and RETCHES, just as--
          
          --three animal-like CANNIBALS emerge from the back of the
          garage-- two burly, ugly, unshaven MEN and a wild-eyed,
          unhealthy-looking WOMAN with matted hair. We'll call them
          PIG, BULL and COW. PIG grabs the SHOTGUN, BULL grabs KYLE
          and yanks the HANDGUN from his waistband.
          
          COW grabs STAR, shoves her into the center of the garage,
          beside Kyle and Bull. Bull tosses the handgun to COW who
          keeps it trained on the kids, sizing them up.

                                 COW
                       Not much meat on `em.
          
          PIG eyes Marcus, points the shotgun in his face.
          
                                 PIG
                       This one's fi-i-ine--
          
          MARCUS raises two fingers like a peace sign-- then shoves
          them into the barrels of the shotgun. PIG snorts and PULLS
          THE TRIGGER-- CLICK.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       Oops.
          
          MARCUS yanks the gun away and tosses it aside, HEAD-BUTTS
          Pig, who staggers backward, BLOOD SPRAYING from his nose.
          
          COW points the unloaded HANDGUN at Marcus-- CLICK CLICK.
          
          KYLE and STAR get free of BULL and dash for the exit, they're
          out of there in a flash.
          
          BULL CHARGES MARCUS, who dodges him, grabs the man and--
          
          --HURLS HIM HEAD FIRST into the CHARCOAL PIT-- his BODY
          SIZZLES against the coals, he SCREAMS and WRITHES.
          
          COW picks up an AXE with two hands and SWINGS it at MARCUS
          who GRABS the HANDLE with one hand and YANKS it away.
          
          COW knows she's met her match, turns and flees, heading out
          the way Kyle and Star went.
          
          MARCUS advances on PIG and BULL, brandishing the AXE. Pig
          squirms back across the floor, wiping BLOOD from his face.
          
                                 PIG
                       We didn't kill `em! I swear to
                       God, they was dead already, we
                       wasn't gonna let `em rot--
          
          BULL has scrambled out of the coal pit, but is in too much
          pain to rise.
          
                                 BULL
                       Go `head, take as much as you want,
                       we're on the same side here--

          CONTINUED: (2)
          
          Marcus looks ready to finish them off-- but reacts to CRIES
          from outside, a loud MECHANICAL RUMBLE.
          
          
          EXT.   SERVICE STATION - DAY
          
          A HARVESTER-- a GIANT INSECT-LIKE TERMINATOR-- is outside the
          station. Many times the size of a human being, MULTIPLE ARMS
          and LEGS sprout from its thorax, it has multiple CAMERA EYES
          on long, swiveling stalks-- it carries KYLE and STAR, the
          kids struggle frantically, caught in the harvester's jointed
          steel appendages.
          
          One unblinking EYE SCANS KYLE, another STAR; the harvester
          produces a NEEDLE from one of its arms, INJECTS the boy-- who
          instantly goes limp, unconscious. It does the same to STAR.
          
          As COW emerges--
          
          --THE HARVESTER SPRINGS on her, with startling speed. She
          SCREAMS as the enormous terminator hoists her into the air
          with the others, INJECTS her and begins moving toward--
          
          --A TRANSPORT. This consists of CONTAINER resembling a semi-
          trailer or wheeled dumpster, attached within a FRAMEWORK that
          features movable ENGINE PODS and a mysterious ARMATURE at the
          front. A STEEL LID in the top of the container OPENS
          hydraulically, the Harvester DEPOSITS the HUMAN CAPTIVES
          inside, and the LID SLAMS SHUT.
          
          MARCUS has emerged from the garage, still carrying the AXE.
          He stays low, hidden behind the tanker, watching as--
          
          --PIG and BULL flee through a back entrance to the garage,
          immediately attracting the attention of--
          
          --the Harvester, which sets off in pursuit.
          
          Marcus comes to a decision.    He SPRINTS into the open, toward
          the TRANSPORT, and--
          
          --CLAMBERS up the side, hitting the thing at full speed,
          using an engine pod to boost himself higher. He's still
          short but swings the AXE and--
          
          --hooks the AXE HEAD over the top of the container, like a
          grappling hook. He pulls himself up and--
          
          
                                                              (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                          32.
          CONTINUED:
          
          --crawls across the roof, to the LID. There's a barred,
          reinforced MESH PANEL here, through which he can see--
          
          ANGLE IN TRANSPORT
          
          --about TWENTY HUMAN PRISONERS, unconscious on the steel
          floor. Among them are KYLE and STAR. Star MOANS, opens her
          eyes briefly and sees--
          
          --MARCUS' SILHOUETTE above her.
          
          Her eyes flutter shut again.
          
          MARCUS struggles to raise the sealed lid, but there's no
          purchase available, just a smooth seam. Suddenly--
          
          --the TRANSPORT JERKS. MARCUS nearly loses his footing as
          the TRANSPORT STARTS ROLLING forward. He drops to his belly,
          seeing that the transport is approaching--
          
          --the HARVESTER, which now carries PIG and BULL, both
          unconscious. THE LID OPENS and the Harvester DROPS the two
          men INSIDE-- but its camera eyes fail to register Marcus, who
          crouches behind the open lid. As the lid BEGINS TO CLOSE,
          the Harvester attaches to the armature at the front of the
          transport, making itself an aerodynamic part of the machine.
          
          MARCUS THRUSTS THE HEAD OF THE AXE under the closing LID in
          order to prevent it from sealing. THE LID grinds against it,
          but remains ajar. A moment later--
          
          --THE ENGINE PODS ROTATE DOWNWARD, FIRE and--
          
          --THE TRANSPORT LIFTS OFF THE GROUND. Within moments, the
          airborne dumpster has risen hundreds of feet in the air.
          
          
          EXT.   AERIAL - DAY
          
          MARCUS moves to the edge, looks down in astonishment at the
          fallow plains far below. Looking to the side, he sees--
          
          --A PAIR OF HUNTER KILLERS, swooping in quickly to provide an
          escort for the slower moving transport.
          
          WIND buffets Marcus, he hangs on for dear life. Clinging to
          the top of the transport, he slowly makes his way back toward
          the LID. As the transport BANKS, he almost loses his grasp,
          dangling for a moment before the craft rights itself.
                                                            (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                          33.
          CONTINUED:
          
          MARCUS reaches under the jammed lid and pulls with all his
          might. This thing is really heavy, plus he's fighting the
          WIND BLAST. MARCUS hears something behind him--
          
          THE HARVESTER has spotted him and is now prying itself loose
          from the armature. Also buffeted by the wind, it starts to
          move gingerly down the length of the transport toward Marcus.
          
          MARCUS must let the LID CLOSE. He snatches up the AXE, takes
          a couple of WHACKS at the thing, DENTING the metal, but doing
          no serious damage. The Harvester KNOCKS the weapon out of
          his hand, Marcus has no choice but to keep backing away.
          
          MARCUS is driven to the back of the transport. Struggling
          for handholds, he lowers himself out of sight, down the
          framework along the side, getting out of the wind. Suddenly--
          
          --STEEL CLAWS WRAP around him FROM BELOW, YANK him downward.
          
          THE HARVESTER has crawled around the SIDE of the TRANSPORT,
          and under the BOTTOM, in order to GRAB HIM. The hideous
          machine now holds him in its clutches, hundreds of feet in
          the air, its CAMERA EYES fixed on him.
          
          THE HARVESTER produces its needle, it's coming at his face--
          but MARCUS frees one hand, grabs the syringe, managing to
          hold it back, inches from his skin. His strength is
          weakening, but as the Harvester makes its final thrust--
          
          --he JERKS the NEEDLE to one side and it BENDS against one of
          the Harvester's own steel limbs.
          
          Undaunted, the creature crawls up the side of the transport,
          Marcus still in its clutches. It moves to the lid, which
          OPENS. It lets go of Marcus to drop him inside when--
          
          --MARCUS seizes two of its appendages and swings up onto the
          harvester's back, where he--
          
          --GRABS a couple of EYE STALKS, trying to RIP them from the
          harvester's thorax, LOOSE WIRES SPARK. The Harvester twists
          and thrashes, it's like he's a rodeo rider. A LIMB wraps
          around him, starting to CRUSH him in a vise-like grip, when
          SUDDENLY--
          
          --CANNON FIRE RIPS through the towering HARVESTER, blowing
          its thorax to PIECES, barely MISSING MARCUS.
          
          
                                                            (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                          34.
          CONTINUED: (2)
          
          A PAIR OF A-10 WARTHOGS-- the same colorful ground attack
          aircraft we saw in the first battle-- ROAR PAST on either
          side of the transport.
          
          THE CRIPPLED HARVESTER topples off the side of the transport,
          still clutching MARCUS and--
          
          --CATCHES on an ENGINE POD, the creature and Marcus both
          suspended in the air. THE HARVESTER ROASTS in the ENGINE
          BLAST, its CPU finally dies. Marcus is suspended below the
          engine, the steel limb RELEASES HIM, he has to cling to it
          now, to keep from falling.
          
          The HUNTER-KILLERS peel out in pursuit of the two Resistance
          planes.
          
          A DOGFIGHT ensues between the much larger, more heavily
          armored H-Ks, and the smaller, more maneuverable WARTHOGS.
          CANNON FIRE CATCHES an H-K but has no effect. The H-Ks' BLUE
          PLASMA PULSES barely miss the planes, which loop and bank.
          
          An AIR-TO-AIR MISSILE STREAKS from a WARTHOG and BLASTS the
          ENGINE of an H-K. AN EXPLOSION, the thing starts flying
          erratically, heading downward and--
          
          --CRASHING to earth in a glorious FIREBALL.
          
          
          EXT.   AERIAL & RIVER - DAY
          
          The planes are nearing a RIVER, bordered by sickly TREES. On
          the far banks, even from above, we see ominous MILITARY
          FORTIFICATIONS-- CONCRETE BUNKERS, ANTI-AIRCRAFT GUNS, etc.
          
          MARCUS meanwhile, is trying to climb up the dead Harvester,
          avoid the ENGINE BLAST and find a handhold on the transport.
          
          THE A-10 that shot down the H-K comes around for another pass
          at the transport, but--
          
          --ANTI-AIRCRAFT GUNS at the far side of the river let out a
          VOLLEY of BLUE PLASMA-FIRE. The BURSTS arc toward the A-10,
          which swerves and climbs, but--
          
          --PLASMA FIRE destroys a wing, the A-10 SPINS out of control.
          
          THE OTHER A-10 breaks off its dogfight with its H-K and
          speeds away from the river.
          
                                                            (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          MARCUS is tantalizingly close to the upper lip of the
          transport, he reaches out and--
          
          --THE FRIED HARVESTER suddenly dislodges from the ENGINE POD,
          taking Marcus with it, into FREEFALL.
          
          WITH MARCUS, plummeting downward toward earth, a hundred feet
          below, the transport continuing on its way above, crossing
          the river.
          
          MARCUS' POV - the ground and treetops getting closer. At the
          last moment, his continuing forward momentum takes him OVER
          THE RIVER and--
          
          MARCUS and the DEAD HARVESTER HIT THE WATER, hard, vanishing
          below the surface with enormous SPLASHES.
          
          The surviving H-K and the TRANSPORT continue across the river
          into Skynet territory, vanishing in the distance.
          
          CAMERA MOVES to FIND a PARACHUTE, drifting earthward on the
          unfortified side of the river.
          
          
          EXT.   RIVERBANK - DUSK
          
          HOLD ON LAPPING WATER for a beat.      Then--
          
          --MARCUS breaks the surface, staggering toward shore, he
          drops to his knees in the shallows.
          
          WAKES APPEAR behind him. Hearing the water stir, Marcus
          turns to see numerous DARK SHAPES moving rapidly in on him,
          from different directions, FLASHES OF METAL visible beneath
          the surface. These are HYDROBOTS-- AQUATIC TERMINATORS-- but
          we don't get a good look at them (yet) and Marcus isn't
          sticking around. He scrambles for the riverbank and makes
          his way into the leafless trees.
          
          
          EXT.   TREES - EVENING
          
          MARCUS moves past the trunks of bare trees, pauses, looks
          over the water in the direction the transport took.
          
                                  BLAIR (O.S.)
                       Yo!   Up here!

          CONTINUED:
          
          BLAIR WILLIAMS, the helmeted pilot who ejected, hangs from
          the tangled remains of her parachute, caught in the trees
          about fifteen feet in the air above Marcus.
          
          MARCUS moves closer.    Blair struggles to saw through her
          lines with a KNIFE.
          
                                 BLAIR (cont'd)
                       Who are you--
          
          The LINES suddenly SNAP, Blair FALLS from the tree.
          
          Marcus' reflexes are fast as ever, he's beneath her in an
          instant and CATCHES HER. He holds her in his arms:
          
                                 MARCUS
                       Name's Marcus.
          
                                 BLAIR
                       You can put me down now, Marcus.
          
          He does so. Blair pulls off her helmet, her hair is short.
          She's in her 20s, pretty, petite but strong, a no-nonsense,
          battle-hardened member of the Resistance. She pulls a
          COMPASS from her flight suit, consults it briefly as she
          orients herself.
          
                                 BLAIR (cont'd)
                       I've got an ELT, but I can't call
                       for a rescue here. There's an
                       outpost a few miles upriver-- not
                       my favorite people in the world,
                       but it's safe. Let's move.
          
          Blair is already moving, Marcus hesitates, then points across
          the water.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       I'm heading that way.
          
                                 BLAIR
                           (a short laugh)
                       The hot zone? No you're not.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       I've got to get to my friends--
          
                                 BLAIR
                       What friends?

                              MARCUS
                    Couple of kids. They were in that
                    flying dumpster--
          
                              BLAIR
                    The Skynet transport? It was
                    carrying people?
                        (off his nod)
                    Christ, we almost shot it down.
                    There've been rumors about a
                    concentration camp, but...
          
          She shakes her head, gestures toward the river.
          
                              BLAIR (cont'd)
                    You can't get across-- river's
                    fulla hydrobots--
          
                                 MARCUS
                    Hydrobots?
          
                              BLAIR
                    They can't see, but they have killer
                    sonar. They'll attack anything that
                    moves or makes a sound. Even if you
                    get past them, you'd be dead before
                    you covered a hundred yards. If the
                    terminators don't get you, the fallout
                    will-- heavy rads all the way to the
                    Gulf coast, nothing can live there.
          
          Marcus absorbs this, starts walking with her.
          
                              MARCUS
                    You're with the Resistance.
          
                              BLAIR
                    Lt. Blair Williams, I fly for what
                    used to be the Air National Guard.
          
          She puts a hand out, listening.   She signals for him to lay
          low, behind a fallen tree.
          
          NEARBY-- a pair of T-1s on patrol rumble into view. They
          pause, scanning the area, chain-guns at the ready. They
          start to move toward BLAIR and MARCUS' hiding place.
          
          BLAIR quickly grabs a STONE and, staying down, hurls it as
          far away as she can--
                                                             (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED: (3)
          
          THE STONE strikes a few BRANCHES--
          
          THE T-1s suddenly turn in that direction, GUNS BLAZING--
          
          THE WOODS in the immediate vicinity are torn to pieces by the
          GUNFIRE, small FIRES erupt from the incendiary bullets-- it's
          definitely overkill.
          
          THE T-1s roll over to inspect the damage, out of view.
          
          BLAIR whispers:
          
                               BLAIR (cont'd)
                     Stupid bastards. Come on.
          
          She and Marcus move away quickly, away from the trees.    When
          they're a safe distance from the robots--
          
                               MARCUS
                     I don't know... this has gotta be
                     some kind of, like, dream or
                     hallucination. Like what happens
                     to people right before they die...
          
          Blair SLUGS him hard, in the arm.     He doesn't flinch, but he
          looks surprised.
          
                               BLAIR
                     That snap you out of it?
          
          MARCUS shakes his head.   They keep walking.
          
                               BLAIR (cont'd)
                     Well hell, maybe you are dreaming. Do
                     us all a favor and wake up already.
          
                                                               CUT TO:
          
          
          EXT.   MUTANT FOREST - NIGHT
          
          THE MOON over a scrubby forest, trees just a few feet high.
          BLAIR and MARCUS seem like giants as they move among them.
          They've been talking a while, Blair's absorbing something.
          
                               BLAIR
                     So let me get this straight, Marcus.
                     There you are on death row, they stick
                     a needle in your arm...

                       and the next thing you know, you're
                       here.
                           (off his nod)
                       Since this ain't the resurrection,
                       there's only one possibility.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       Let's hear it.
          
                                 BLAIR
                       Whatever they pumped into your veins just
                       knocked you out. This Angel Project you
                       signed up for-- there was a lotta
                       cryogenic stuff going on before the bombs
                       fell, they musta froze your ass.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       What the hell for?
          
                                 BLAIR
                       Drug tests, medical experiments, organ
                       harvesting, who knows? You said you
                       had no family, no friends-- why let a
                       body like yours go to waste?
          
          She's looking him over as she says this, it almost sounds
          flirtatious. Marcus changes the subject.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       I've never seen trees like these.
          
                                 BLAIR
                       We're in a mutation zone. I saw a
                       two-headed squirrel here once--
          
                                 MARCUS
                       Freaky.
          
                                 BLAIR
                           (SHRUGS)
                       Tasted like chicken.
          
          BLAIR pauses, checking a small GEIGER COUNTER she carries--
          it CLICKS a bit.
          
                                 BLAIR (cont'd)
                       Levels are tolerable now, but just.
                       We can't spend the night here.
          
                                                                (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED: (2)
          
          They start moving again.   Marcus pauses, listens:
          
                              MARCUS
                    What was that?
          
                              BLAIR
                    I didn't hear anything--
          
          Now they both hear an eerie HOWL, changing in pitch-- like a
          coyote on crack. More than one picks up the CHORUS.
          
                                BLAIR (cont'd)
                    Skindogs.
          
          She pulls a SIDEARM, holds it at the ready as she starts
          running, away from the direction of the noise. Marcus keeps
          up at her side, looking behind them.
          
          WITH THE DOGS
          
          We don't get a good look at them, but there's a pack of large
          BEASTS moving quickly through the undergrowth, gaining on the
          fleeing humans.
          
          BLAIR sees they won't outrun them. She spins, FIRES in the
          direction of the approaching PACK. Suddenly it's quiet-- the
          animals fan out, forming a circle around Blair and Marcus.
          
                              MARCUS
                    They're surrounding us.
          
          QUICK SHOTS of MUTANT EYES, glowing in the dark-- ENLARGED
          TEETH-- DARK, MASSIVE FORMS moving through the brush.
          
                              BLAIR
                    They're smart. And they don't
                    scare easy.
          
          After a few tense beats, from the foliage--
          
          A SKINDOG leaps at BLAIR from behind-- it's hideous, the size
          of a Great Dane, hairless, with veiny, wrinkled skin and
          long, catlike CLAWS. Before Blair can react, MARCUS leaps
          between her and the dog, grabs the slavering creature by the
          throat. It SNAPS its ELONGATED TEETH at him, but he manages
          to BREAK its neck and hurl it toward--
          
          TWO MORE SKINDOGS moving in for an attack.

          CONTINUED: (3)
          
          BLAIR FIRES a few SHOTS at the encroaching pack, we hear a
          few YELPS--
          
          MARCUS protects her, effortlessly tosses a few more SKINDOGS
          aside, ignoring vicious bites and scratches.
          
          The other SKINDOGS turn on dead and injured pack members,
          begin TEARING INTO THEM. There's an opening now, the two
          humans make a run for it.
          
          BLAIR catches her breath, looking him over, seriously
          impressed by his strength and calm.
          
                               BLAIR (cont'd)
                     You saved my ass. Thanks.
          
          MARCUS shrugs, turns back to see the feeding frenzy.
          
                               MARCUS
                     Dog eat dog world.
          
          
                                                         DISSOLVE TO:
          
          
          EXT.   NORMAL FOREST - NIGHT
          
          It's darker now, the moon is down. MARCUS and BLAIR move
          gingerly-- she TRIPS, he catches her before she falls.
          
                                BLAIR
                     Thanks.
          
          BLAIR sighs, yawns, sits against a tree.
          
                               BLAIR (cont'd)
                     It's not far, but we'll never get
                     across the mine field at night.
                     Might as well STAF till morning.
          
          MARCUS nods, sits a few feet away from her.
          
                               BLAIR (cont'd)
                     C'mere, it's cold. I don't bite.
          
          MARCUS slides toward her, she nestles against him.
          
                                MARCUS
                     Staf?   What's that mean?

                       and fuck.
          
          Soon they're kissing passionately.      But MARCUS pulls away,
          rolls onto his back.
          
                                 BLAIR (cont'd)
                       You holding out for lipstick?
                       Lingerie? Or am I not your... type?
          
                                 MARCUS
                       I'm not gay. In prison, I thought
                       about puss-- women all the time. But
                       now... it's not working. Who knows,
                       all those years on ice...
          
                                 BLAIR
                       Maybe it's just gonna take some time.
                       Before you're completely thawed out.
          
          She's slipped a hand inside his pocket for warmth... now she
          pulls out the SCRAPS of paper, with women's faces. She
          squints at these in the dark.
          
                                 BLAIR (cont'd)
                       What are these?
          
                                 MARCUS
                       I dunno. They just... sorta
                       reminded me of her.
          
                                 BLAIR
                       Who?
          
          MARCUS speaks carefully, unsure how to articulate this.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       There's a woman, the last woman I
                       saw before... when I was under, the
                       dead time-- she kept coming to me.
                       I think she must've saved me.

          She closes her eyes, settling against him, her head against
          his chest. Marcus stares up into the darkness.

          DARKNESS. We just make out KYLE and STAR among the other
          PRISONERS, most of whom are awake now in the steel container.
          Star still wears her baseball cap. The prisoners are JOSTLED
          as the transport touches down.
          
                               KYLE
                     We've landed.
          
          
          EXT.   LOADING ZONE - NIGHT
          
          The TRANSPORT has landed amongst numerous CONTAINERS, CRANES
          and VEHICLES-- all is dimly lit, enveloped in a vague reddish
          HAZE. THE FLYING FRAMEWORK and ARMATURE detach from the
          TRANSPORT, and TAKE OFF into the air again-- leaving the
          trailer-like wheeled CONTAINER. Something resembling the CAB
          of a semi-truck backs into position, latching onto attachment
          points on the container.
          
          
          INT.   TRANSPORT - NIGHT
          
          --A SMALL PANEL SLIDES OPEN   at the front of the transport,
          and a half-dozen PROCESSING   AEROSTATS buzz inside from the
          cab. These are larger than    the spy drones, with attached
          PINCERS that can encircle a   person's arm.
          
          PRISONERS duck, try to dodge these things. But they quickly
          buzz from captive to captive, latching onto their arms-- we
          hear SCREAMS, see FLASHES OF LIGHT from the aerostats.
          
          KYLE tries to bat away an AEROSTAT, but its PINCERS latch
          onto his forearm. A SIZZLING SOUND-- Kyle CRIES OUT with the
          pain, a flash of RED LIGHT-- then the aerostat DETACHES and
          moves to its next victim.
          
          STAR gets the same treatment from a different AEROSTAT.   She
          moves to Kyle's side, tears in her eyes, sucking on her
          burned wrist to ease the pain.

                       I don't know...
          
          KYLE looks grimly down at--
          
          --a fresh BAR CODE seared into his arm.

          THE CAB and CONTAINER, now resembling a semi, pulls out of
          the loading area. Digitally controlled, it needs no
          headlights as it rolls in the near-darkness.
          
          OVERHEAD ANGLE as the vehicle moves onto a cloverleaf access
          ramp leading to a HIGH SPEED SUNKEN HIGHWAY, a river of fast-
          moving TRAFFIC heading in both directions-- unlit vehicles
          moving close together at 120 mph through the reddish gloom.

          step over undergrowth. CAMERA MOVES to find a STRAND OF
          BARBED WIRE, emerging from the dirt a few feet away.
          
          MARCUS pauses, almost having stepped on a WATERMELON.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       We're in somebody's garden.
          
          BLAIR stops walking, alarmed, a few feet away from him.

                       Christ... there's supposed to be

          through a gap where the wire had fallen.

          DARK. We hear BABIES CRYING from nearby, FUMBLING in the
          dark, muttered CURSES-- then a MATCH lights a CANDLE.
          BARNES, 20-ish, good-looking and cocky, yawns and sneers,
          annoyed at being awakened. TWO WOMEN share his mattress.
          
                                 BARNES
                       Somebody feed those things!
          
                                 MORRISON
                       Start up the generator, Barnes.
          
          MORRISON is bearded, long-haired, bleary-eyed, a middle-aged
          man in charge here. He sits up in bed, also beside A COUPLE
          OF WOMEN. This place has become an underground crash pad,
          communal living for about a dozen people-- Morrison and
          Barnes the only men, four or five WOMEN and quite a few
          CHILDREN of varying age.
          
          BARNES grunts, yanks the blanket off his bedmates, who CRY
          OUT in protest. He wraps it around himself, carries the
          candle as he steps around other SLEEPING FIGURES, makes his
          way toward a METAL STAIRCASE winding downward. Moments
          later, we hear a GAS ENGINE start up-- LIGHTS flicker on.
          
          The place is pretty grimy and run-down, but it was once a
          military environment. There's a BANK OF TV MONITORS against
          one wall, which COME TO LIFE. A couple of the WOMEN move
          toward the adjacent NURSERY AREA to tend to the babies-- one
          of them, LISA, moves to the TV MONITORS. She squints at one.
          
                                 LISA
                       We got company!

          BARNES pokes his head up from a concealed TRAPDOOR thirty
          yards from BLAIR and MARCUS, who are hoarse from shouting.

                       Blair? Good to see you.

                                 BARNES
                       Kinda dumb-ass, wandering around in
                       a mine field.

                       It's too early for that military crap.
          
          BARNES consults a MAP, turning it to orient himself.
          
                                 BARNES (cont'd)
                       OK, if you keep walking straight
                       you're gonna get blown all to

                       oh... five steps.
          
          BLAIR and MARCUS obey, moving cautiously.

          They slowly pace five steps.      On the fifth one, there's a
          CLICK beneath Marcus' foot--
          
          A horrified moment of eye contact between him and Blair-- she
          DIVES TO THE GROUND, away from him as--
          
          BOOM!   MARCUS is thrown through the air by the EXPLOSION--
          
          MARCUS' BODY lands a few feet from the trap door.

          JANE, a doctor, moves toward MARCUS with scissors and other
          medical tools, cuts away a tattered pants leg, the shreds of

          JANE opens Marcus' shrapnel-torn shirt, takes the scalpel and
          gingerly pulls it across the flesh of his chest. No effect.

          inch thick STEEL CABLE.
          
          MARCUS thrashes, trying to free himself, then looks up and
          sees that--
          
          --the CABLES are strung through HEAVY STEEL BOLTS which have
          been DRILLED THROUGH HIS CALVES, locking them together. His
          FOREARMS have been immobilized in the same grotesque fashion.
          
          From above, the BEAM OF SUNLIGHT shines through the narrow
          crack between an enormous pair of SLIDING STEEL PANELS.
          
          MARCUS twists his neck to look downward--
          
          MARCUS' POV-- a circular pit below, the dark bottom invisible
          to him-- he's hanging near the top of an empty MISSILE SILO,
          its ICBM launched years ago.
          
          At one edge of the silo pit, near scaffolding and tool carts,
          SMALL CHILDREN have gathered to stare. Also there is BARNES--
          he leans back, eyes closed, in a folding chair, with an RPG
          in his lap. One of the KIDS taps Barnes' leg and he jerks
          upright. He immediately trains his weapon on MARCUS, clearly
          nervous now that the terminator is conscious.
          
          MARCUS stares at Barnes, deadpan, for a beat.
          
                               MARCUS
                     Boo!

          mechanical gears, steel plating, hydraulics, etc.

                     hydraulics, but mostly titanium
                     microgears... This looks like some sort
                     of aeration and hydration system,
                     function unclear at this point. Valves
                     and what looks like an access panel
                     below the ribcage...

                       presumably to protect the CPU.
          
          MATTRESSES have been piled to one side, we now see framed,
          cracked and yellowing POSTERS of MILITARY EQUIPMENT-- AIR
          FORCE JETS, ATLAS ROCKETS, etc. These are interspersed with
          crude CHILDREN'S DRAWINGS on the walls.
          
          BLAIR sits at a battered dining table, surrounded by angry
          outpost RESIDENTS, including JANE and MORRISON.

          At the communications area by the TVs, LISA wears a HEADSET,

          BLAIR is first to reach the edge of the silo, horrified at
          the sight of the dangling MARCUS. BARNES keeps the RPG
          trained on him, they shout over each other.
          
                               MARCUS

                     It keeps talkin' at me. God this

                       It does seem lifelike-- is the face
                       able to mimic emotions--?
          
          MARCUS rolls his eyes, makes an angry FACE at the CAMERA.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       This shit is ridiculous. What the
                       hell do you want from me?
          
                                 CONNOR
                           (STUNNED)
                       I-- I need to know what you are.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       So do I! I don't know what I am, what
                       I'm doing here, I don't know shit--
                       maybe I never did, but-- I'm sick of it!
                       Just blow my head off or let me go.
          
                                 CONNOR
                       This isn't right. I can't be
                       having a conversation with a
                       terminator, Skynet isn't that
                       sophisticated yet. Unless... were
                       you sent here from the future?
          
                                 MARCUS
                           (very confused)
                       What?
          
                                 CONNOR
                       Skynet's developing a time
                       displacement field, we've decrypted
                       recent data transmissions.
                           (SADLY)
                       I know for a fact that soon machines
                       will be travelling back decades. To
                       try and stop us from winning this war
                       before it begins...
          
          Marcus takes this in for a sober moment.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       You're out of your mind, aren't you?
          
          This earns outraged glares from the others, but Blair stifles
          a smile. Barnes moves to strike him, Morrison stops him.

          INT.   COMMAND CENTER/CONFERENCE AREA - DAY
          
          Densely marked MAPS on a CONFERENCE TABLE. CONNOR is now
          flanked by a couple of SENIOR ADVISORS, older military men--
          along with KATE BREWSTER, late 30s, now his wife-- and
          visibly PREGNANT. She's poring over FAXES of the X-RAY
          IMAGES. (Like Connor, all military personnel here favor
          casual dress, at most pins or patches to indicate rank.)
          
                               KATE
                     He's not a cyborg-- no blood, no
                     human tissue over the endoskeleton.
          
                               CONNOR
                     Besides, the first T-800s won't be
                     manufactured until `26.
          
                               ADVISOR #1
                     Maybe he's a one-off, an experiment.
          
                               ADVISOR #2
                     Let's hope. If there are more out there
                     like him, we're in serious trouble.
                     Christ, a terminator with attitude...
          
                               KATE
                     Where did they find him?
          
                               ADVISOR #1
                     East-central Texas, near an area of
                     heavy Skynet concentration. The
                     outpost where they're holding him is
                     reasonably secure, but it's not much
                     more than a commune.
          
                               CONNOR
                     I want him extracted.
          
                                ADVISOR #1
                     Done.   What then?
          
          CONNOR picks up the FAXES, disturbed by them.

                       Get him to our best people for
                       disassembly, find out what makes him
                       tick. We need to get into that metal
                       skull, crack his CPU at all costs.
          
          THE ADVISORS nod, pick up their papers and exit. As soon as
          they're gone, Connor sits wearily in a chair, tosses the X-
          rays and papers onto the table, his authoritative mask
          slipping. Kate touches his arm. He leans his head against
          her pregnant belly.
          
                                 CONNOR (cont'd)
                       Kate, why did I become leader of
                       the Resistance?
          
                                 KATE
                       Because people trust you... you
                       give them faith--
          
                                 CONNOR
                       No. Because I knew I would be, I
                       was told. I know when and where the
                       major battles are going to take
                       place. I know I'm going to send my
                       own father back through time to save
                       my mother-- even though I haven't
                       met him yet. Christ, I even know
                       the year I'm going to die...
          
                                 KATE

                                 CONNOR
                       So how could I not know about this?!
          
          He BANGS HIS FIST on the table atop the PAPERS.

          INT.   OUTPOST/CORRIDOR & LAUNCH TUBE - DAY
          
          MARCUS is marched down the corridor to the launch tube,
          Frankenstein-like, MORRISON holding the chains, keeping a
          safe distance from him, while BARNES keeps the RPG trained at
          Marcus' head.

          CONTINUED:
          
          Marcus shuffles awkwardly, the bolts hampering his ankles.
          It's reminiscent of his death walk at film's opening.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       Feels like I been here before...
                       what are you gonna do to me?
          
                                 MORRISON
                       Nothing. Los Angeles is sending a
                       chopper-- seems you're some kind of VIP.
          
          They reach the edge of the SILO PIT-- a long drop, smooth
          walls, a long METAL LADDER leading down into darkness.
          MARCUS pauses by the ladder, holds up his bolted arms
          questioningly-- "now what?"
          
          At a look from Morrison, he and Barnes BODY-CHECK MARCUS at
          once, sending him flying over the edge--
          
          MARCUS FALLS the thirty feet or so, strikes the concrete
          FLOOR of the launch tube with a sickening THUD, the CHAINS
          clattering down around him.
          
          MARCUS is stunned, barely conscious as the LADDER is PULLED
          UPWARD. It's like the bottom of a well, twenty feet in
          diameter, sheer concrete walls, the floor BLACKENED from a
          rocket blast.
          
          ANGLE UP - his captors look down at him for a moment, then
          move out of view.
          
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          
          INT.   TRANSPORT - NIGHT
          
          CAMERA MOVES past the PRISONERS, a couple dozen total... An
          HISPANIC COUPLE huddle against one wall, whispering to each
          other IN SPANISH... COW rocks in despair, head in her hands,
          BULL and PIG mutter to each other nearby... an OLDER WOMAN
          prays, going through rosary beads... FIND STAR and KYLE.
          She's watching as KYLE uses his pocket knife to CARVE an
          image in the wall of the transport. He looks up.
          
                                 KYLE
                       We're stopping.

          The BACK PANEL rolls upward. CONTROL ROBOTS-- reminiscent of
          the treaded T-1s but without the heavy weaponry-- flank a
          path from the rear of the transport towards BRIGHT LIGHT up a
          RAMP a short distance away.
          
          THE PRISONERS instinctively move away from the robots, moving
          to the front of the container... until ZZZAP! BLUE ENERGY
          crackles across the floor. THE PRISONERS CRY OUT in pain at
          the electrified surface, and dash toward the opening at the
          rear, leaping out of the container.
          
          LOW ANGLE, as the prisoners run by, we hold a moment on
          Kyle's graffiti-- it's the STICK FIGURE IMAGES of KYLE and
          STAR we saw before, they both hold hands with a LARGER STICK
          FIGURE who stands between them, meant to be MARCUS.
          
          
          INT.   UNDERGROUND GARAGE - NIGHT
          
          THE CONTAINER has stopped in a large subterranean space.
          There are numerous FUTURISTIC VEHICLES here-- hydrogen CARS,
          three-wheeled ATVs, electric BUSES. CONTROL `BOTS closest to
          the container start to close in on the huddling PRISONERS.
          
          A ROBOT BUMPS into BULL, sending another JOLT OF ELECTRICITY
          through his body, like a cattle prod. Everyone gets the
          picture, starts hurrying down the line, the ROBOTS closing
          around them.
          
          COW looks around nervously, clearly freaking out.   Spotting a
          gap between the robots, she bolts--
          
          --a ROBOT SWIVELS and CUTS HER DOWN with an ENERGY BLAST.
          She lies still, SMOKE rising from her body.
          
          The other PRISONERS pick up the pace.
          
                                 STAR
                       I'm scared.

                           (hugging her)
                       Whatever happens, we stick together.
          
          The LIGHT emanates from FROSTED WINDOWS at the top of the
          RAMP, through which we make out the SILHOUETTES of human
          figures.

          GLASS DOORS part ahead of the prisoners-- a stark white,
          sterile environment beyond. THE ROBOTS stop here. THE
          PRISONERS disappear inside... and the DOORS CLOSE.

          BARNES remains on guard duty with the RPG, propped up on some
          cushions, a LANTERN by his side-- it's pretty late, the
          generator's shut down. He's reading an old, yellowed COMIC
          BOOK, he has a small stack at his side.
          
          MARCUS' VOICE echoes up from below, startling him.
          
                                  MARCUS
                       Hello? Anyone there?

                       I need water.
          
                                   BARNES
                       Bullshit.    Machines don't drink.
          
                                 MARCUS

                       Shut up, robot!
          
          BARNES returns to his reading. He reacts to FOOTSTEPS from
          the long corridor into the living area behind him.
          
          BLAIR approaches with a FLASHLIGHT, her manner conciliatory.
          
                                 BLAIR
                       How's it going, Barnes? Thought
                       you might like a late-night snack.
          
          She pulls a crumpled plastic PACKAGE out of a pocket of her

          light up as he puts the RPG aside and grabs it.

                       Where in hell'd you get these?
          
                                 BLAIR
                       We got a stash back at the base.
          
          BARNES tears open the package hungrily, takes a bite.       He
          grins, but as he chews, his expression darkens.
          
                                 BARNES
                       Kinda stale.
          
                                 BLAIR
                       You need something to wash it down.
          
          From another pocket, she produces a plastic water bottle
          filled with a murky gray liquid.
          
                                 BARNES
                       I'm on duty, you know.
          
          So saying, he takes the bottle, unscrews the cap and takes a
          long pull. It's powerful hootch, he gasps for air, passes
          her the bottle as she sits beside him. She doesn't drink.
          
                                 BARNES (cont'd)
                       Twinkies and moonshine. You trying
                       to seduce me again?
          
                                 BLAIR
                       You know I always liked you, Barnes.   I
                       just didn't want to join the harem.
          
                                 BARNES
                       What can I say? It's our duty to
                       repopulate the planet.
          
                                 BLAIR
                       Noble of you to make the sacrifice.
          
                                 BARNES
                       C'mere.
          
          He pulls her close to him for a kiss. After a moment, she
          pulls away and moves to the corridor entrance. There's a
          large SLIDING STEEL DOOR here.
          
                                 BLAIR
                       I prefer a little privacy.
                                                                  (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED: (2)
          
          With some effort, she pulls the door CLOSED. BARNES rises
          with a grin, undoing his shirt, coming close to her. He's
          already unsteady on his feet.
          
                              BARNES
                    You're so twentieth century...
          
          He puts his arms around her for a full body embrace--
          
                              BARNES (cont'd)
                    Admit it, I'm the best you ever had...
          
          His words are slurring. He slides to the floor, slowly
          losing his grip. He rolls onto his back with a drugged-out
          expression of bliss on his unconscious face.
          
                               BLAIR
                    Men.   You're all talk.
          
          IN THE BOTTOM OF THE PIT
          
          MARCUS leans against the wall in the dark, rolls out of the
          way as the LADDER drops. BLAIR descends quickly, the
          FLASHLIGHT in her belt, a battery BLADE SAW in one hand. She
          sets the flashlight on the ground and moves to his side--
          
                              BLAIR (cont'd)
                    I used up the last of my Valium for
                    you... Hold out your arms.
          
          He does, she fires up the SAW, moves it carefully to the bolt
          joining his forearms. SPARKS fly from the BUZZING BLADE as
          it digs into the metal-- it's going to take some time.
          
                              MARCUS
                    Why are you doing this?
          
                              BLAIR
                    I don't believe you're a terminator.
          
                              MARCUS
                    So what am I...?
          
                              BLAIR
                    Whatever you are-- I owe you one.
                    Once you're free, I'll lie down
                    next to Barnes-- they'll assume you
                    escaped while we were passed out--

                     You think they'll buy that?
          
                               BLAIR
                     Worth a shot.
                         (looking at him)
                     Marcus, Command wants to take you
                     apart, cut open your head. One
                     thing I know, you're alive-- and
                     you've got a right to live.
          
          THE BUZZING SAW BLADE sound-bridges to:
          
          
          EXT.   FOREST CLEARING - NIGHT
          
          THE WHIR OF CHOPPER BLADES. A SPOTLIGHT shines over the low
          growth in the minefield as a BLACKHAWK HELICOPTER circles,
          coming in for a landing. WEAPONS RACKS are jury-rigged
          beside the spotlight, the chopper bristles with AUTOMATED
          CANNONS, MISSILES and NAPALM TANKS.
          
          THE SPOTLIGHT picks out the CONCRETE and STEEL CAP of the
          LAUNCH TUBE.
          
          
          INT.   OUTPOST/LAUNCH TUBE - NIGHT
          
          THE SAW finishes cutting the BOLT between Marcus' legs; his
          arms are already free. The BUZZING cuts out, but now they
          hear the CHOPPER LANDING directly overhead.
          
                               BLAIR
                     They're already here for you--
          
          MARCUS slides the BOLTS out of his legs, freeing himself from
          the chains.
          
                               BLAIR (cont'd)
                     Hide in the forest, then aim west
                     for open country--
          
                               MARCUS
                     I'm heading across the river.
          
                               BLAIR
                     No human being can survive there--

                                 BLAIR
                       You're gonna try and save those kids.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       It's the only thing I can think of
                       that makes any sense...
          
                                 BLAIR
                       Marcus, for all you know, they're
                       dead already--
          
                                 MARCUS
                       For all I know, they're the reason
                       I'm back from the dead.
          
          BLAIR studies him a moment, no changing his mind. But she
          admires him. She starts up the ladder, MARCUS following.
          
          BARNES is still passed out as BLAIR and MARCUS ascend to the
          platform around the pit. They move to the sliding door--
          
          BLAIR starts to open it, but sees a LIGHT and hears VOICES
          and FOOTSTEPS at the far end, SLIDES IT SHUT again.
          
                                 BLAIR
                       Damn it, we're too late--
          
                                 MARCUS
                       Where's that go?
          
          MARCUS points to a LARGE VENTILATION FAN behind STEEL
          GRATING, eight feet above them, on the far side of the pit.
          It's not running, but there's no way to get through it.
          
                                 BLAIR
                       Should lead out, but there's no way
                       past the fan--
          
          MARCUS is already picking up the RPG-- but he points it
          backwards, has no idea how to shoot it--
          
          BLAIR grins, grabs the RPG from him-- then braces herself,
          takes aim and FIRES--
          
          KABOOM!   The EXPLOSION rips OPEN the GRATE, destroys the FAN.
          
                                                                            65.
          
          
          INT.   OUTPOST/CORRIDOR - NIGHT
          
          MORRISON escorts a pair of powerful UNIFORMED SOLDIERS armed
          with HIGH-TECH RIFLES with explosive shells-- they react to
          the EXPLOSION beyond the closed door-- and break into a run,
          the soldiers readying their weapons.
          
          
          INT.   OUTPOST/LAUNCH TUBE - NIGHT
          
          MARCUS and BLAIR have moved around the narrow walkway to the
          far end of the pit, beneath the SMOKING HOLE. Blair thinks
          of something, pulls a small DEVICE from her flight suit, the
          size of a pack of cigarettes, holds it toward Marcus.
          
                               BLAIR
                     Here. My ELT-- emergency locator
                     transmitter. If you find the camp,
                     activate it like this. It could
                     really help the Resistance.
          
          She indicates a button.     MARCUS takes the device--
          
          --then grabs her, KISSES HER hard on the mouth-- she's
          startled-- it felt very human.
          
                                  MARCUS
                     Thank you.
          
          MARCUS grabs the sharp, still smoking STEEL projecting from
          the hole and pulls himself upward as--
          
          THE DOOR SLIDES OPEN and the SOLDIERS open FIRE at MARCUS--
          
          BLAIR hits the deck as EXPLOSIVE SHELLS tear HOLES in the
          CONCRETE--
          
          --SHRAPNEL hits MARCUS in the back, he's thrown into the
          ventilation shaft--
          
          
          INT.   VENTILATION SHAFT - NIGHT
          
          MARCUS has a CHUNK OF REBAR lodged in his left SHOULDER, but
          he doesn't even notice this yet. He picks himself up and
          moves quickly in the darkness, crouching in this cramped
          tube. There's a TURN up ahead, he just makes it as--
          
          An EXPLOSIVE SHELL rockets through the shaft behind him--
                                                                  (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          BOOM! THE BLAST TEARS through the metal tube, DIRT POURS IN,
          blocking the tunnel from his pursuers.
          
          
          EXT.   FOREST CLEARING - NIGHT
          
          Near the edge of the clearing, a low STEEL VENT with a peaked
          CAP. DENTS appear in it from within--
          
          MARCUS finally PUNCHES his way out, pulls himself up and
          rolls onto the dirt-- for a moment he seems safe, laying low
          in the grass. Then--
          
          --he registers the REBAR in his shoulder. It goes right
          through him, emerging from his chest. Marcus is stunned.
          With some effort, he YANKS OUT the REBAR and tosses it aside.
          TORN METAL of his steel endoskeleton is now exposed, along
          with a glimpse of circuitry. Marcus reels, puts a hand over
          the hole in his chest where a heart should be; he really
          isn't human. He doesn't have much time to deal with this as--
          
          --THE CHOPPER emerges from behind the treeline, the SPOTLIGHT
          picks him out and AUTOMATIC FIRE erupts--
          
          MARCUS runs a few yards and throws himself to the ground as--
          
          GUNFIRE STRAFES around and ahead of him-- setting off several
          MINES which send up clouds of dirt.
          
          MARCUS picks himself up and runs for the trees, leaping over
          the barbed wire.
          
          
          EXT.   FOREST - NIGHT
          
          MORE GUNFIRE rips apart the trees around Marcus as he sprints
          and weaves, making his way toward the river. The SPOTLIGHT
          picks him up and loses him again-- it's tough for the chopper
          to get a clear shot at him here.
          
          
          EXT.   RIVERBANK - NIGHT
          
          MARCUS has reached the edge of the trees, he can see the
          river just beyond. He starts to move for it, when--
          
          --FWOOM! The forest around him ERUPTS INTO FLAME, the
          chopper has laid NAPALM along the river's edge.

          CONTINUED:
          
          MARCUS reels from the intense heat, bats out FLAMES on his
          clothes, but his skin remains undamaged. Realizing he can
          keep on moving--
          
          --MARCUS DASHES through the dense FIRE to--
          
          
          EXT.   RIVER - DAWN
          
          --the RIVER, where the sky is just starting to LIGHTEN.
          MARCUS SPLASHES into the shallows, extinguishing the FLAMES.
          He fills his hands with water and sucks it down gratefully.
          
          ANGLE ON THE WATER - A GLIMMER of METAL below the surface,
          heading for the source of the splashing. Suddenly--
          
          --the BLACKHAWK CHOPPER drops down directly in front of
          Marcus, hovering a few feet above the water, the GUNNER
          pointing his weapon directly at Marcus (he's one of the two
          soldiers we saw before). The BLADE WASH swirls the water in
          a whirlpool and beats back the FIRE behind Marcus. As the
          GUNNER OPENS FIRE--
          
          --MARCUS DIVES below the surface, BULLETS ZINGING through the
          murky water.
          
          UNDERWATER - MARCUS is winged by a couple of shots, his
          thermoplastic flesh getting torn apart--
          
          WITH THE GUNNER - He pauses a moment, squinting into the
          WATER for a glimpse of Marcus, but failing to register that--
          
          --BELOW THE CHOPPER, right beneath him, the WATER ROILS as if
          teeming with piranha. Suddenly--
          
          --HYDROBOTS ERUPT from the RIVER with a hideous BUZZING
          SOUND. Hydrobots resemble segmented serpents, eyeless, but
          with razor-sharp heads that DRILL into their victims-- they
          respond to sound and vibrations. About a dozen of these four-
          foot long, glistening steel snakes shoot from the water to
          attack the chopper.
          
          INSIDE THE CHOPPER - HYDROBOTS PIERCE the aluminum FLOOR, and
          shoot into the cabin, the PILOT and the two SOLDIERS CRY OUT.
          
          The GUNNER tumbles out of the chopper and FALLS in the water.
          
          THE PILOT attempts to maintain control, but the hydraulics
          are damaged and the steel serpents thrash about in the cabin.
                                                            (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                          68.
          CONTINUED:
          
          THE GUNNER surfaces, trying frantically to swim to shore.
          But the hydrobots are upon him, he SHRIEKS and disappears
          beneath the bubbling surface, which now boils with BLOOD.
          
          IN THE CHOPPER - A WHIRRING HYDROBOT penetrates the other
          soldier's leg. He SCREAMS and wrenches the thing back out,
          tossing it from the chopper just before--
          
          --THE CHOPPER CRASHES INTO THE SHALLOWS.
          
          THE PILOT leaps from the cabin and makes it to shore, where
          he collapses. But the remaining, wounded SOLDIER can't get
          out of the hip-deep water before the HYDROBOTS are upon him.
          
          Suddenly, HANDS BURST from the water, grabbing the soldier.
          A second later, MARCUS SURFACES, slinging the man over his
          shoulder. He strides to shore, as if rescuing the man from
          enemy fire, hydrobots thrashing and bubbling at his waist.
          
          MARCUS reaches the amazed pilot, lays the wounded soldier
          down beside him, then tears a whirring, writhing HYDROBOT
          from the soldier's belly and WHIPS its head against a ROCK--
          it SPARKS, micro-machine parts fly. The pilot and wounded
          soldier stare at him, astonished.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       Don't mention it.
          
          He tosses the dead robo-snake aside, then turns and moves
          back into the water, quickly vanishing below the surface.
          
          UNDERWATER - MARCUS moves steadily across the silty river
          bottom. He doesn't need air. HYDROBOTS come at him, he
          swats them away as if they were mosquitoes, CRUSHING in his
          hand those that linger too long. Those which make contact
          with his artificial skin can't get far, turn and swim off.
          
          
          EXT.   FAR RIVERBANK - DAY
          
          MARCUS emerges, the FLAMES still visible on the other side of
          the river, behind him. He doesn't look back, as he moves
          into Skynet turf. This side of the river isn't wooded,
          everything has a concrete, industrial feel. Marcus is a
          mess, both clothing and skin are shredded and charred.
          
          He nearly bumps into a SKELETAL STEEL TERMINATOR, which
          emerges from behind a concrete wall. The terminator trains
          its PLASMA RIFLE on MARCUS, scans him, RED EYES glowing...
                                                            (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          TERMINATOR'S POV - RED FILTER, MARCUS' FORM is TARGETED.
          READ-OUTS on the side, the HIGHLIGHTED WORDS "NON-ORGANIC -
          DO NOT TERMINATE."
          
          THE TERMINATOR turns from MARCUS, no longer interested,
          moving off on its preprogrammed patrol.
          
          MARCUS moves up a sloping, CONCRETE EMBANKMENT.   At the top
          of the rise, he sees, spread out before him--
          
          
          EXT.   SKYNET TERRITORY - DAY
          
          --a hideous industrial sprawl, OPEN GAS FLAMES, SMOKING
          FACTORIES, rumbling VEHICLES, H-Ks, TERMINATOR TROOPS on
          patrol. Nothing green, a GREY HAZE hangs over the landscape.
          
          After a moment, MARCUS shakes his head and gamely soldiers
          on, moving along the edge of the elevated embankment.
          
          
          EXT.   SKYNET PERIPHERY - DAY
          
          MARCUS moves past banks of ANTI-AIRCRAFT guns and MISSILE
          LAUNCHERS, interspersed with slowly rotating RADAR TRACKING
          DISHES-- the first line of defense. From this fortress-like
          wall he descends into the nightmarish environment beyond.
          
          MARCUS reacts to a CAWING SOUND above, looks up to see--
          
          --A CROW perching on an overhead WIRE.   A second later--
          
          ZAP! A BLUE PLASMA PULSE blasts the thing to smithereens, a
          few BLACK FEATHERS drift down as--
          
          --a T-400 (same mask-like face we saw earlier) lowers its
          plasma weapon and strolls on. Target practice.
          
          MARCUS stays out of the way of the TERMINATOR LEGIONS
          patrolling near the riverside.
          
          
          EXT.   DEMOLITION SITE - DAY
          
          MARCUS heads inland, past the ruins of a CHURCH-- WALLS with
          the remains of stained glass WINDOWS, STATUES OF SAINTS.
          Hearing RUMBLING NOISES, Marcus hurries out of the way as--
          
          
                                                             (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          A WALL collapses, pushed down by an automated SKYNET
          BULLDOZER. This gigantic, self-operated construction machine
          has a swivelling CAMERA HEAD instead of a cab. Its giant
          TREADS roll over the STONE STATUES, crushing them to dust.
          
          
          EXT.   CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY
          
          MARCUS keeps moving into Skynet's turf. The demolition gives
          way to massive CONSTRUCTION, as the robots remake the human
          world in their own image.
          
          CONSTRUCTION ROBOTS erect a low-slung STEEL FRAME structure,
          automated CRANES and SUPPLY TRUCKS about. These robots are
          oversized versions of the steel terminators we know, but with
          multiple limbs bearing WELDING TOOLS, and TREADS instead of
          legs. Marcus watches as BEAMS are quickly welded into place
          by telescoping steel arms.
          
          
          EXT.   SKYNET STREET - DAY
          
          MARCUS continues into the completed robot city. Skynet's
          ARCHITECTURE is featureless, bland, purely practical: single-
          story, windowless CONCRETE or STEEL structures with massive
          open DOORWAYS to accommodate their largest machines. A RED
          GLOW emanates from the interiors, the robots' preferred
          lighting scheme. No sidewalks or signs, just thick GRIDS of
          POWER LINES and PIPES overhead. Constant NOISE of BUZZING
          POWER, RATTLING MACHINES, etc.
          
          MARCUS steps inside one of these buildings--
          
          
          INT.   TERMINATOR FACTORY - DAY
          
          This TERMINATOR ASSEMBLY PLANT is an intricate, multi-leveled
          clockwork maze of moving CONVEYORS and INDUSTRIAL ROBOTICS.
          
          ELECTRONICS and HYDRAULICS are ROBOTICALLY SOLDERED in place.
          STEEL PRESSES stamp out TERMINATOR PARTS-- TORSOS, FACE
          PLATES, SPINAL COLUMNS, LIMBS.
          
          Partially-completed PARTS are moved by CONVEYOR to ASSEMBLY
          STATIONS, where LIMBS and HEADS are JOINED to TORSOS,
          elaborate OPERATIONS carried out by INDUSTRIAL ROBOTS, like
          the ones in present-day factories.
          
          
                                                            (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                          71.
          CONTINUED:
          
          SYNTHETIC SKIN is SPRAYED OVER a METAL ENDOSKELETON in
          precise amounts, building up to create human features... this
          is a T-400.
          
          An INDUSTRIAL ROBOT ARM picks up a CPU from a DRY-ICE
          CONTAINER. The CPU features the distinctive, linked
          rectangles familiar from the earlier films. The arm lifts
          this gingerly to a TERMINATOR SKELETON and INSERTS IT into
          the STEEL SKULL, SCREWING A SEAL over the hole.
          
          THE RED EYES flicker to life, and THE ARMATURE releases the
          TERMINATOR, which moves away under its own power. It removes
          a PLASMA WEAPON from a WALL RACK, moving past--
          
          --the dumbfounded MARCUS.
          
          THE TERMINATOR joins a dozen identical robots, who ride on a
          treaded SKYNET TANK with a PLASMA CANNON and FLAMETHROWER.
          There are numerous TANKS here, awaiting deployment.
          
          
          EXT.   SKYNET STREET - DAY
          
          Rounding a corner on a straight, narrow street, MARCUS sees
          all the ROBOTS and SMALL VEHICLES clearing into small NICHES
          built into the walls on either side, as if clearing a path
          for him. It takes him a moment to realize it's not him
          they're responding to-- a RUMBLE BUILDS...
          
          A convoy of GIGANTIC SKYNET TRUCKS-- a half-dozen modified
          SEMIS now driven by CPUS-- bear down on MARCUS at extremely
          high speed. They carry construction supplies: massive STEEL
          BEAMS, CONCRETE PIPES, etc. And there's barely inches of
          clearance on either side.
          
          These things aren't slowing down. There's nowhere for Marcus
          to duck out of the way. He has no choice but to RUN, as fast
          as he can, the lead vehicle gaining on him rapidly.
          
          MARCUS THROWS HIMSELF to the concrete in the middle of the
          street, pressing his body flat as the LEAD TRUCK passes over
          him, the wheels missing him by inches.
          
          But he has only a moment's respite. THE NEXT TRUCK has a
          lower undercarriage, a steel CROSSMEMBER catches his back--
          
          --and DRAGS MARCUS beneath the vehicle, ripping off chunks of
          flesh.
          
                                                            (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          Marcus CRIES OUT, crawls ahead and clings to a forward
          portion of the undercarriage, keeping himself just above the
          pavement. His LEFT LEG, twisted and damaged, still drags on
          the asphalt, throwing up SPARKS.
          
          OVERHEAD ANGLE ON THE TRUCK - CAMERA PULLS BACK straight
          above the MOVING VEHICLE, amidst the convoy speeding down
          this sunken artery. CAMERA KEEPS MOVING UPWARD to reveal an
          AERIAL VIEW of Skynet's city. Seen from above, the
          rectilinear STRUCTURES, criss-crossing POWER LINES and
          SPEEDING VEHICLES strongly resemble a PULSING CIRCUIT BOARD.
          
                                                               CUT TO:
          
          
          INT.   COMMAND CENTER/CORRIDOR - DAY
          
          JOHN CONNOR moves grimly down a narrow, steel passageway,
          FOOTSTEPS ECHOING. He reaches the MP, outside the door.
          
                                 CONNOR
                       I need to talk to the prisoner.
          
          The MP looks a little surprised, but says nothing.    He undoes
          the LATCH on the door and opens it for Connor.
          
          
          INT.   COMMAND CENTER/INTERROGATION CELL - DAY
          
          A bare, windowless space with only a cot, a metal chair and a
          bedpan. BLAIR looks up, bleary-eyed, exhausted and scared.
          CONNOR gestures for the MP to close the door behind him.
          
                                 CONNOR
                       Lieutenant Williams. I'm sorry
                       about the way you've been treated,
                       but we're forced to take every
                       precaution. I'm John Connor.
          
          Blair's mighty impressed, in spite of the circumstances.       She
          leaps to her feet, stands at attention and salutes.
          
                                  BLAIR
                       Sir.
          
                                  CONNOR
                       At ease.   Please, sit.

          CONTINUED:
          
          CONNOR pulls up the chair, close to Blair, who sits on the
          bed. His tone is careful, controlled.
          
                                  CONNOR (cont'd)
                       I've gone over your record,
                       lieutenant. You're a good soldier,
                       flown a lot of missions...
                           (BEAT)
                       Why in God's name would you help a
                       terminator escape?
          
                                 BLAIR
                       Sir-- he isn't a terminator.     He's
                       human.
          
                                  CONNOR
                       We know he's crossed into Skynet
                       territory, why would he do that if
                       he isn't--
          
                                 BLAIR
                       He's trying to find his friends.
          
                                 CONNOR
                       What friends?
          
                                 BLAIR
                       A couple of kids. They were taken
                       in a Skynet transport, probably to
                       some kind of prison camp-- he said
                       their names were Star and Kyle.
          
          Connor blinks at this, alert.
          
                                    CONNOR
                       Kyle.
          
          Blair picks up on his interest, but doesn't understand it.
          
                                 BLAIR
                       Mm... Kyle something.    With an `R.'

          unlatches it to let him out--
          
          
          INT.   COMMAND CENTER/CORRIDOR - DAY
          
          Partway down the hallway, CONNOR encounters KATE, who walks
          with him, takes in his expression.
          
                               KATE
                     What is it, John?
          
                               CONNOR
                     I always knew I'd have to find him
                     someday. I just didn't know how.
          
                                KATE
                     What?   Find who?
          
                                  CONNOR
                     My father.

          INT.   LABORATORY - DAY
          
          START CLOSE on KYLE'S HAND, clutching STAR'S tightly.   We
          hear them SINGING faintly, together:
          
                               KYLE AND STAR
                     Twinkle, twinkle, little star...
          
          WIDER, their heads, feet and chests are clamped onto SLIDING
          TRAYS, a long row of these hold OTHER PRISONERS as well.
          Kyle and Star must reach across a gap between the trays to
          hold hands. (It's the first time we've seen her hatless.)
          
          The trays are all poised before panel-covered SEMI-CIRCULAR
          OPENINGS built into the wall, in a sterile, hospital-like
          environment. Above each opening is a MONITOR SCREEN. An
          ominous HUM is building.
          
          IN AN ADJACENT OPERATING THEATER, visible through GLASS
          WALLS, MEDICAL LASERS mounted on ROBOTIC ARMS work on
          anesthetized patients (we needn't see the grisly details).
          
          BEHIND STAR and KYLE, the PANELS OPEN, the trays slowly SLIDE
          into the OPENINGS. SCREAMS and SOBS from other prisoners.

                                 KYLE
                       Shh, keep singing.
          
          Kyle and Star hold hands for as long as possible, then
          release their grip as their bodies enter the chambers and the
          panels slide shut.
          
          
          INT.   STAR'S TESTING CHAMBER - DAY
          
          Immobilized in this small, tubular chamber, like an MRI, STAR
          closes her eyes as she's bathed in BRIGHT LIGHT, LASER GRIDS
          projecting over her skull. The HUMMING is LOUDER.
          
                                 STAR
                       Up above the world so high, like a
                       diamond in the sky...
          
          
          INT.   KYLE'S TESTING CHAMBER - DAY
          
          The same thing is happening to Kyle.    He's no longer singing.
          
                                 KYLE
                       Stop it stop it STOP IT!

          EXT.   SKYNET HIGHWAY - DAY
          
          WITH MARCUS beneath the truck. He's moved to the edge of the
          chassis, near a WHEEL, moving slowly, carefully. There's a
          bit more clearance at the sides of the sunken highway now,
          but they're still moving awfully fast.
          
          THE WHEEL TURNS, the vehicle suddenly SLOWS to negotiate a
          turn, braking downhill. Marcus seizes this opportunity.
          
          ANOTHER ANGLE as MARCUS LAUNCHES himself from below the
          vehicle, rolling into the GAP between the convoy and the
          concrete wall. The remaining vehicles RUMBLE PAST, as MARCUS
          presses himself against the wall.
          
          
          
                                                              (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          When they're gone, he gets to his feet, limping down the
          highway on foot for a short distance, dragging his damaged
          leg behind him. He hears ANOTHER CONVOY approaching.
          
          Just in time, he finds a SEAM in the poured concrete, it's
          enough to give him purchase-- he struggles to climb up the
          eight feet of freeway wall.
          
          MARCUS makes it over the top, TRUCKS RUMBLING past below.
          This is desolate, hilly country.
          
          ANGLE DOWN - among the vehicles below is a CONTAINER, like
          the one that held Kyle and Star. We glimpse the anguished
          FACES and REACHING HANDS of CAPTIVES within.
          
          MARCUS reacts, moves as fast as he can alongside the trucks
          for a short distance until--
          
          THE VEHICLES shoot ahead around a curve and out of sight.      In
          the distance is a COMPLEX OF BUILDINGS, clearly the
          destination.
          
          Marcus begins moving along the edge of the freeway, heading
          for the complex. He reaches the edge of a plateau, looks
          down, his expression changing. This is the last thing he
          expected to see. CAMERA MOVES to reveal--
          
          
          EXT.   COASTAL VALLEY - DAY
          
          --a panoramic view of a GORGEOUS COASTAL COMMUNITY. The
          place is lush, green, with well-maintained, lovely HOMES in
          the distance, a BLUE SEA beyond. The complex of buildings
          stands a few miles away, at the far end of the valley.
          
          MARCUS, amazed, limps down a gentle slope leading to this
          seeming paradise.
          
          
          EXT.   GOLF COURSE - DAY
          
          MARCUS emerges from a small stand of trees and finds himself
          looking at a groomed FAIRWAY. Marcus hears a NOISE nearby--
          
          --a GOLF BALL bouncing on the ground not far away.    MARCUS
          turns in the direction it came from.

          CONTINUED:
          
          An electric GOLF CART approaches, driven by a handsome,
          middle-aged golfer-- JEREMY-- who wears casual country club
          attire, eating from a clear BAG OF TRAIL MIX. Jeremy comes
          to a stop beside Marcus.
          
                                 JEREMY
                       Are you all right?
          
          Marcus slowly shakes his head, as Jeremy climbs out of the
          cart, looking him over carefully, taking in the exposed metal
          at his shoulder and leg.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       What the hell is this?
          
                                 JEREMY
                       You look like you've been hit by a truck--
          
                                 MARCUS
                       Among other things. Look, I'm
                       trying to find some friends-- a
                       couple of kids. They were taken
                       here, I saw some buildings--
          
          JEREMY eyes him, a little surprised at his ignorance.
          
                                 JEREMY
                       The facility, sure.   Hop in, I'll
                       take you there.
          
          Marcus hesitates a beat, can he trust this guy? But Jeremy
          simply seems eager to help, as he guides him to the passenger
          seat, then gets behind the wheel. With a smile:
          
                                 JEREMY (cont'd)
                       This round was gonna blow my
                       handicap anyway. I'm Jeremy.
          
          He extends a hand.     After a beat, Marcus reaches toward it--
          
                                 MARCUS
                       Marcus.
          
          Jeremy clutches Marcus' hand tightly.     Marcus blinks, Jeremy
          cocks his head, then lets go.

                     I can't connect with you at all...
                     your interface must've been
                     damaged. Don't worry, soon they'll
                     have you as good as new.
          
          With that, he hits the gas.
          
          
          EXT.   RESIDENTIAL STREET - EVENING
          
          JEREMY drives the cart down the road, past well-kept homes
          with generous lawns-- it's a beautiful, upscale community at
          MAGIC HOUR. BICYCLISTS and FUTURISTIC CARS pass, Jeremy
          waves to NEIGHBORS. Marcus takes it all in with disbelief.
          
                               MARCUS
                     I didn't think there was-- anything
                     like this left... anywhere.
          
                                JEREMY
                     Yes.   We're very lucky.   Want some?
          
          He holds the plastic bag out to Marcus, who obligingly takes
          a handful of trail mix, pops it in his mouth. After a beat,
          he spits it back out in his hand, stares at it.
          
                               MARCUS
                     This isn't food.
          
                               JEREMY
                     Well, of course not. Seems you got
                     a little memory loss going on.
          
          Marcus stares at him, confused. Jeremy is starting to
          realize just how out of it he is, speaks as if to a child.
          
                                JEREMY (cont'd)
                     It's a foam resin. It can taste like
                     anything you want it to-- but of
                     course, we don't really need to eat.
                         (BEAT)
                     Our brains are powered by fuel cells,
                     remember?
          
          Marcus just stares, Jeremy gestures at the world around them.

                       We're in a transitional phase.
                       Most of us need the comfort of the
                       familiar a little while longer--
                       food, shelter, sex. Until we
                       forget the old life.
          
          As he speaks, he notices his BAG is nearly empty. He
          casually lifts his sport shirt and CLICKS OPEN a PANEL
          beneath his rib cage. We glimpse CIRCUITS, FIBER-OPTICS.
          
                                 JEREMY (cont'd)
                       Eating-- well, chewing-- it's one of
                       the hardest habits to break... but
                       before long, none of this will be
                       necessary. We won't even need these
                       bodies.
          
          From within he removes an identical BAG FILLED with TRAIL MIX
          (the stuff he just ate), and replaces it with the empty bag.
          He clicks the panel shut again, pops a NUT in his mouth.
          
          Marcus stares at this, appalled, then blinks and looks away.
          He reacts to the sound of PIANO MUSIC, a difficult piece
          being played expertly-- PASSING a PICTURE WINDOW, he sees a
          PIANIST practicing.
          
          In front of this home, a GARDENER and WINDOW WASHER are hard
          at work. They're both T-400s, with the eerie mask-like
          faces. Marcus reacts.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       Terminators!
          
          Jeremy winces, as if at a racial epithet. He's starting to
          regret giving Marcus a lift, his manner is careful, as if
          he'd picked up some homeless guy.
          
                                 JEREMY
                       We don't call them that here.
          
          Marcus grabs Jeremy, who pulls back a bit, alarmed.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       What are you?
          
                                   JEREMY
                       A hybrid.    The same as you.

                     Of course. That's what this community
                     is for-- people like us.
          
                               MARCUS
                     Jesus... why?
          
                               JEREMY
                     You should be grateful to have been
                     chosen.

                     You mean like Janet and the kids.
          
          For a moment, Jeremy's expression darkens.     Then he shuts his
          eyes, and his features relax.
          
                               MARCUS
                     Your family. You lost them?
          
          Jeremy nods and SMILES, looking at him once more.
          
                               MARCUS (cont'd)
                     Why are you smiling?
          
                               JEREMY
                     `Cause I feel good. The interface
                     recognizes negative emotions-- rage,
                     grief, despair-- and stimulates
                     positive endorphins in response. Thank
                     God, life would be pretty unbearable
                     otherwise, don't you think?
          
          
          EXT.   PARK - DUSK
          
          They've left the main street now, driving down a WOODED PATH
          leading to the "facility." There are lawns, fountains, etc.
          Marcus SLAMS ON the brakes, then clutches Jeremy by the
          throat-- the man looks more annoyed than frightened.
          
          
          
                                                               (CONTINUED)

                       Tell me everything.   How did you
                       people get here?
          
                                 JEREMY
                       Most of us worked at NASA or DARPA.
                       I was an engineer on Project Angel--
          
          Marcus drags the man from the cart by his throat, squeezing
          harder.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       Angel-- what is it?
          
                                 JEREMY
                       Advanced Nexus of Genetic and
                       Electronic Life-forms... A-N-G-E-L.
                       You can stop choking me, it's not
                       like I need to breathe.
          
          Marcus releases him, but remains in his face.       Jeremy takes a
          moment to recover his composure.

                       We replaced the body's hydrocarbons
                       with plastinated compounds while
                       maintaining cellular structure--
                       analog neural impulses were converted
                       to wireless digital signals,
                       controlling the micro-tech chassis--

                       The goal was a superior support
                       system for the human brain-- to go
                       anywhere, do anything-- explore
                       deep space, the bottom of the sea.
                       I specialized in optics.
          
          He taps his own eye with an audible CLICK, not flinching.
          Marcus takes a couple steps away, looking at his own hands.
          
          Jeremy points to nearby BUILDINGS, a little peevish.

                     The facility is just ahead. I'll
                     let them know you're coming.
          
          So saying, he's back in the cart, pulling away in a hurry.   A
          moment later, Marcus moves off amongst the trees.
          
          Nearing the complex, Marcus reacts to BIRDSONG above.   He
          looks up, stops as he sees--
          
          --a TINY SPEAKER, concealed amongst the LEAVES.
          
          MARCUS moves to this tree, touches it-- the bark feels
          unnatural. He RAPS it with his FIST-- it sounds hollow, made
          of FIBERGLAS. He fingers a LEAF, tries to bend it-- PLASTIC.
          
          He crouches, studying the GRASS. After a moment, he finds a
          SEAM in the pristine lawn. He starts to peel it up... it's
          ASTROTURF. Beneath it is SANDY DIRT.
          
          Marcus KEEPS PEELING the plastic covering back... more dirt--
          and BITS OF BONE. As he continues to uncover the ground we
          see recognizable CHUNKS of SKULLS, LEGBONES, etc.
          
          By now he's rolled back a few square yards, numb with horror.
          Marcus moves on toward the complex with new determination,
          trying to stay out of sight.

          PET scans. DENSE DIGITAL READ-OUTS BELOW, as data is
          analyzed. (Levels of seratonin, endorphins, etc.) Beside
          these are BARCODES and small INSET PHOTOS taken within the
          chamber, the subjects looking frightened.
          
          IN THE OPERATING THEATER, the LASERS are still now, their
          grisly work done for the moment, awaiting the next batch.
          
          An ENGINEER, a nice-looking, well-built young man in loose
          black clothing, moves down the row of chambers, studying
          results. He speaks into a subtle HEAD-SET:

                       32580 - eh, this one shouldn't have
                       even been brought here...
          
          As he speaks, the BARCODES on the monitors in question turn
          either RED or GREEN in response to his judgments.
          
          He reaches KYLE'S CHAMBER, we see Kyle's anguished FACE on
          the monitor photograph.

          On STAR'S MONITOR-- RED BARCODE.
          
          The engineer KICKS something on the floor, bends down to pick
          it up-- STAR'S BASEBALL CAP. He flings it expertly into--
          
          --a nearby TRASH RECEPTACLE.

          He sets his jaw, removes something from his pocket, fiddles
          with it and places it carefully in the bushes. He moves on.
          
          Nearing an entrance, he hears a familiar voice from nearby.
          
                                 SERENA

          A BACKLIT FIGURE approaches-- as her face enters the light,

          stares at her coldly.

                       It's a graveyard.
          
          SERENA takes in his anger, adopts a regretful tone.
          
                                 SERENA
                       There was no choice-- the old
                       civilization had to be eliminated.
                       To make way for a new world... a
                       world without death or suffering.
          
          SERENA puts her arms around him. He doesn't return the
          embrace, but he doesn't resist her.
          
                                 SERENA (cont'd)
                       You were the first... I'm sorry.
          
          So saying, she presses a small, taser-like device at the base
          of his skull-- ZAP! MARCUS SPASMS and goes limp in her arms.
          SERENA lets him down gently on the ground.

          A pair of T-400s now approach from the shadows. They pick up
          Marcus and carry him toward the building. CAMERA MOVES to

          MARCUS twitches, freaking out, struggling in his bonds--
          
          THE DETACHED LEG twitches as well.
          
                                 SERENA
                       Calm down, Marcus.   It's all right.
          
          SERENA is on the other side of a GLASS PANEL, operating
          computer controls. This is an automated surgical
          environment, the work on Marcus carried out by various
          MACHINES and MICROTOOLS-- busy HYDRAULIC ARMS, LASERS, etc.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       Like fuck it is. I'm sick of being
                       your guinea pig, what are you doing
                       to me now?!

                       Please. Skynet works for us. It's only
                       a program-- a tool, a means to an end.

                       Listen to me. Skynet was designed to
                       detect threats, make projections and
                       implement solutions. As soon as it
                       came on line, it factored in war,
                       disease, environmental destruction--
                       and calculated a high probability of
                       total human extinction within two
                       hundred years. The human race was
                       doomed... unless we were transformed.
          
          THE SURGICAL TABLE swivels, bringing MARCUS into alignment
          with the repaired leg. In moments it's reattached, the
          plastic skin thermosealed at the joint.
          
                                 MARCUS

                       Skynet had access to the entire
                       defense web-- including Project
                       Angel. It determined hybrids were

          THE LASER TOOLS and HYDRAULIC ARMS now move on their ceiling

                     self-destruct. We would have taken
                     you with us, but we thought you
                     were in a permanent coma...
          
          THE LASERS start cutting into the back of Marcus' head,
          BURNING through the plastic SKIN. MARCUS lets out a CRY of

          MARCUS touches the screen, two fingers, one on each of the
          kid's faces. THEIR IMAGES expand to fill the screen, side by
          side, KYLE on the left.
          
                                                               (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          KYLE'S IMAGE, the date 10.16.18... the time, 22:19:23.      The
          word, in green: PROCESSED.
          
          SERENA smiles.
          
                                 SERENA
                       Good news. He'll soon be part of
                       the network-- you'll be able to
                       connect with him.
          
          Move to STAR'S IMAGE.       10.15.18... 22:20:49... and the word,
          in red: TERMINATED.
          
                                 SERENA (cont'd)
                       I'm sorry about the girl, Marcus.
                       She didn't suffer.
          
          Marcus takes this in, his face shows pain. Then SERENA
          grasps his hand-- in moments, he's smiling.
          
                                    MARCUS
                       Of course.     I... I understand.
          
          Suddenly the building SHAKES, the sound of a distant
          EXPLOSION. SERENA releases MARCUS, listens in her earpiece.
          
                                 MARCUS (cont'd)
                       What is it?
          
                                 SERENA
                       I don't know-- I have to go.    Will
                       you be all right?
                           (off his smile and nod)
                       Of course you will.
          
          She touches him once more and moves off, leaving him alone
          here. We'll hear other far off EXPLOSIONS from time to time
          during the following. MARCUS stares at--
          
          HIS FRIENDS' FACES, which slowly FADE TO BLACK, replaced by
          his own REFLECTION. Seeing his own face, his smile vanishes.
          
          MARCUS is going through a terrible internal struggle, the
          interface fighting his own natural emotions. He backs away
          from the machine, looks around at the brains, all the lives
          destroyed.
          
          Hurrying past the wall of brains, he moves a hand to the base
          of his skull... with an ANGRY CRY--
                                                                 (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                          94.
          CONTINUED: (2)
          
          --his FINGERS dig into the plastic skin at the back of his
          HEAD--
          
          MARCUS grits his teeth, this is incredibly hard to do, but--
          
          --he RIPS THE INTERFACE MODULE from his skull-- CONNECTIONS
          SPARK, we glimpse STEEL SKULL and the encased BRAIN beneath.
          
          MARCUS hurls the DEVICE to the floor, its elaborate CIRCUITRY
          SHATTERS. He reels with momentary anguish at what he's just
          given up-- then he moves out of there with determination.
          
          
          EXT.   OFFICE PARK FACILITY - NIGHT
          
          FIRE and SMOKE in the distance, VEHICLES MOVING fast amidst
          the destruction. It looks like the place is under attack.
          
          MARCUS moves purposefully across the campus-- suddenly
          HEADLIGHTS illuminate him. He dives out of the way as--
          
          A FUTURISTIC ATV roars past at high speed.   It's followed
          moments later by a massive SKYNET TANK.
          
          MARCUS scrambles to his feet, continues on his way.
          
          
          INT.   TIME DISPLACEMENT CHAMBER - NIGHT
          
          THE PHYSICIST is SLAMMED against a wall. He never loses his
          unperturbed expression as MARCUS manhandles him. THE CLOCK
          reads 01:05.
          
                               MARCUS
                     I need to go back!
          
                               PHYSICIST
                     The wormholing fluctuates, right
                     now it's oscillating between three
                     and six hours--
          
                               MARCUS
                     What do I do?
          
                               PHYSICIST
                     Just breach the sphere. But you
                     could materialize anywhere in a
                     mile radius--
          
                                                             (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          MARCUS tosses the man aside, regards the GLOWING, CRACKLING
          TIME SPHERE-- it doesn't look too inviting.
          
          THE DOOR bursts open. SKELETAL TERMINATORS storm in,
          wielding PLASMA RIFLES-- they mean business--
          
          THE PHYSICIST finally looks alarmed, getting in front of
          MARCUS as he yells--
          
                                 PHYSICIST (cont'd)
                       No, don't shoot in here--!
          
          A TERMINATOR FIRES anyway, BLOWING A HUGE HOLE through the
          center of the Physicist's chest and throwing him backward to
          the floor-- the man looks down and shakes his head at the
          damage to his plastinated body.
          
                                 PHYSICIST (cont'd)
                       Idiots.
          
          A SECOND TERMINATOR spins his weapon on--
          
          --MARCUS, who LEAPS into the center of the sphere just as THE
          ROBOT FIRES and HITS nearby MACHINERY which EXPLODES--
          
          ENERGY ERUPTS around MARCUS, the CRACKLING BLUE LIGHT of the
          time sphere surrounds him. We experience this from--
          
          --INSIDE THE SPHERE. Marcus instinctively crouches in a
          FETAL POSITION. An instant later, his CLOTHING BURNS OFF HIS
          FLESH. The HIGH TECH ENVIRONMENT around him TRANSFORMS into--
          
          
          EXT.   PARK - DUSK
          
          STAY WITH MARCUS-- FOLIAGE APPEARS around the SPHERE. The
          BLUE ENERGY fades, leaving him naked, 20 FEET IN THE AIR--
          
          MARCUS PLUNGES to the ground and rolls.     He looks up--
          
          THE PLASTIC TREE has been melted with the heat like a candle,
          DRIPPING down around him.
          
          MARCUS tries to get his bearings-- he's in the park area, the
          FACILITY not too far off. He moves in that direction.
          
                                                                          96.
          
          
          EXT.   OFFICE PARK FACILITY - NIGHT
          
          THE GATE to the garage OPENS, an empty HUMAN TRANSPORT
          emerges... FIND MARCUS, concealed, still unclothed. He dives
          under the GATE as it rolls shut.
          
          
          INT.   UNDERGROUND GARAGE - NIGHT
          
          MARCUS moves stealthily through the space where the prisoners
          were off-loaded, keeping out of sight behind parked vehicles.
          He starts at the sight of--
          
          THE CONTROL ROBOTS, hooked to CHARGING POSTS along one wall.
          
          MARCUS makes his way to the GLASS DOORS.   Using all his
          strength, he manages to PRY THEM OPEN.
          
          
          INT.   LABORATORY - NIGHT
          
          The ENGINEER as we saw him before, consulting the MONITORS
          above the CHAMBERS.
          
                               ENGINEER
                     32581 looks good... 32582... hm,
                     borderline. May not be emotionally
                     compatible. Pass.
          
          The engineer picks up STAR'S BASEBALL CAP and flings it into
          the TRASH...
          
          Just then he hears SHATTERING GLASS behind him.   He spins--
          
          MARCUS trains a ripped-off ROBOTIC LASER ARM at him like a
          weapon. The arm trails heavy CABLES and CIRCUITS, linking it
          to the operating theater we saw earlier. (These also
          artfully conceal Marcus' nakedness.)
          
                               MARCUS
                     Let them go.
          
                                ENGINEER
                     What?   Who are you?
          
          MARCUS takes a step closer.
          
                               MARCUS
                     I said, let them go!
                                                             (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          THE ENGINEER moves to a RED ALARM BUTTON on a COMMUNICATION
          PANEL mounted in the wall, extending a hand--
          
          MARCUS connects two wires to FIRE UP the LASER and--
          
          A RED BEAM neatly SEVERS the ENGINEER'S HAND at his WRIST.
          
          THE ENGINEER studies the metal STUMP of his severed hand with
          a blank expression.
          
                                 ENGINEER
                       You can't hurt me.
          
          The ENGINEER smirks and WHACKS the ALARM BUTTON with his
          other hand. An ELECTRONIC KLAXON sounds.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       Now you're pissing me off.
          
          MARCUS FIRES OFF THE LASER again--
          
          --THE ENGINEER stares at him-- we see a flaming STRIP in the
          wall behind his head. He takes a step toward Marcus and--
          
          --his HEAD TUMBLES OFF, bounces on the ground, and rolls to
          MARCUS' FEET. (There's no blood, just laser-severed
          electronic connections).
          
          MARCUS picks up the ENGINEER'S HEAD by the hair.   The man's
          brain is unharmed.
          
                                 MARCUS (cont'd)
                       How'd that feel?
          
          THE MAN'S MOUTH twists and grimaces, making ELECTRONIC STATIC
          from the FRIED VOICEBOX. MARCUS is taken by surprise when--
          
          --THE DECAPITATED BODY lunges at him, knocks the LASER from
          his grasp. After a brief STRUGGLE, MARCUS spins the
          engineer's HEAD to face his body. He grabs the INTERFACE at
          the base of his neck.
          
                                 MARCUS (cont'd)
                       I pull this off and you'll be in a
                       world of pain!
          
          THE ENGINEER'S FACE suddenly shows fear-- his body FREEZES.
          
          
                                                             (CONTINUED)

                    Last chance. Let them out.
          
          AT A CONTROL TERMINAL, the one-handed, headless BODY taps
          keys and controls. MARCUS holds the Engineer's HEAD so that
          he can see over his own shoulder. Moments later--
          
          --the MACHINE HUM winds down. THE MONITORS flash the word
          "ABORT," the PANELS begin to OPEN.
          
          MARCUS addresses the HEAD in his hand.
          
                              MARCUS (cont'd)
                    I'm gonna need your clothes.
          
          THE HEADLESS BODY begins to unbutton its shirt.
          
          MOMENTS LATER - CLOSE as KYLE'S TRAY slides out of his
          CHAMBER. The RESTRAINTS retract automatically. He sits up,
          looking toward--
          
          --STAR, on the next tray.   She hasn't moved, her eyes closed.
          
                              KYLE
                    No!
          
          He climbs off his tray, takes her in his arms.    She starts
          awake.
          
                              STAR
                    What?
          
          Around them, the dozen OTHER PRISONERS are getting to their
          feet, surprised at their sudden freedom.
          
          MARCUS approaches KYLE, buttoning his new shirt.
          
                              KYLE
                    Marcus!
          
          The two kids hurry to him, Marcus hands Star her BASEBALL
          CAP, rescued from the trash. As she puts it on:
          
                              STAR
                    I knew you'd come.
          
          THE PRISONERS are already on the move, frantically dashing
          out of the lab ahead of our heros.

          He leads the kids out the way he came, passing...
          
          THE ENGINEER, in underwear, sitting in a corner, cradling his
          head in his lap. His remaining hand strokes his interface,
          his eyes closed in a blissful expression.
          
          
          INT.   UNDERGROUND GARAGE - NIGHT
          
          THE PRISONERS smash the GLASS DOORS off their hinges, and
          charge past--
          
          THE CONTROL ROBOTS, which are now coming to life. ELECTRIC
          BURSTS drop a couple of slow-moving ESCAPEES as they dash
          into the garage and make for--
          
          --ANY AVAILABLE VEHICLE. Former PRISONERS hijack BUSES,
          HYDROGEN CARS. Pure chaos, it feels like a prison riot.
          
          MARCUS, STAR and KYLE weave amidst the robots and humans.
          
                                  MARCUS
                     Stay down!
          
          KYLE and STAR take cover behind a concrete post just as--
          
          --PLASMA BURSTS explode around them.
          
          SKELETAL TERMINATORS armed with PLASMA RIFLES are pouring in
          through the OPENING GARAGE GATE.
          
          A STOLEN BUS heads for the exit, KNOCKING a couple of
          TERMINATORS aside and SMASHING through the rising GATE,
          clearing a path for others to follow.
          
          A SKELETAL TERMINATOR sets its sights on a MOVING HYDROGEN
          CAR, which follows the bus--
          
          TERMINATOR POV - RED FILTER, HIGHLIGHTING BULL, the DRIVER.
          "TARGET ACQUIRED - TERMINATE."
          
          THE TERMINATOR SHOOTS HIS RIFLE through the car's windshield--
          it EXPLODES, close to KYLE and STAR, the building SHAKES.
          
          
          
                                                              (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                         100.
          CONTINUED:
          
          KYLE and STAR flee the flames, THE TERMINATOR'S HEAD swivels
          quickly, taking them in. It starts to pursue, but MARCUS
          gets in front of it. Before it can fire--
          
                                 MARCUS (cont'd)
                       It's OK, I'm not human!
          
          The Terminator pauses, looks him over.
          
          TERMINATOR POV - MARCUS is quickly scanned, comes up "NON-
          ORGANIC - DO NOT TERMINATE."
          
          THE   TERMINATOR starts to move past Marcus, who LEAPS on it
          and   WRENCHES THE RIFLE from its grasp. As the robot spins on
          him   he BLOWS ITS HEAD OFF, then looks around frantically for
          the   kids. A moment later--
          
          --KYLE ROARS up at the controls of a futuristic ATV, STAR
          clinging to him.
          
                                 MARCUS (cont'd)
                       You can't drive!
          
                                   KYLE
                       Watch me!
          
          No time to argue, MARCUS leaps into the back beside STAR and
          KYLE GUNS IT out of there, careening off walls and other
          vehicles, he's still not much of a driver. MARCUS meanwhile
          PICKS OFF potential threats with the PLASMA RIFLE.
          
          
          EXT.   OFFICE PARK FACILITY - NIGHT
          
          KYLE has to swerve to avoid the stolen BUS, which is now on
          its side, IN FLAMES. It was taken out by--
          
          --an automated SKYNET TANK, one of THREE TANKS here. They're
          positioned to take out escaping vehicles. But the ATV is a
          small, maneuverable target, swerving and speeding crazily. A
          TANK FIRES and MISSES, the BLAST taking out a chunk of wall.
          
          KYLE WHOOPS, heading across the campus--
          
          --ONE TANK pursues, it moves surprisingly fast, capable of
          flattening anything in its path. MARCUS FIRES at it, but the
          PLASMA RIFLE BLASTS don't have much effect on the ARMOR.
          
          THE TANK FIRES again, but--
                                                             (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          --KYLE ROARS around a corner, just in time.   However, in so
          doing, he nearly runs over--
          
          --MARCUS, from earlier, on his way to the time sphere,
          visible in the HEADLIGHTS for only an instant before he LEAPS
          OUT OF THE WAY.
          
          KYLE, focused on the pursuing tank, didn't even see this.
          But STAR did. She looks wide-eyed at MARCUS beside her.
          
                                 STAR
                       That looked like--
          
                                  MARCUS
                       I know.   Long story.
          
          PLAY THE CHASE, as the TANK pursues the ATV through the
          facility.
          
          KYLE takes his vehicle through a large FOUNTAIN, which the
          TANK SMASHES to bits.
          
          KYLE OVERSTEERS, putting them up on two wheels, then
          recovers, narrowly avoiding--
          
          --PLASMA BLASTS, which obliterate the FACADE of a building.
          
          SKELETAL TERMINATORS appear in their HEADLIGHTS, weapons
          raised.
          
          MARCUS stands and FIRES over KYLE'S HEAD, BLOWING them out of
          the way.
          
          NEAR THE PARK, MARCUS points.
          
                                 MARCUS (cont'd)
                       Take that path!
          
          
          EXT.   PARK/WOODS - NIGHT
          
          THE TANK is gaining on them, KYLE steers around a GAZEBO, the
          tank SMASHES right through it, turning it to splinters.
          
                                    MARCUS
                       The trees!

          CONTINUED:
          
          Kyle steers toward THE WOODS, dodging between the thick
          TREES. Too many obstacles for the TANK here, it SCREECHES TO
          A HALT and lets off a JET OF FLAME.
          
          THE TREES behind the ATV all IGNITE, turning to acrid pools
          of MELTING PLASTIC. KYLE barely stays ahead of the FIRE.
          
          THE TANK backs up and takes a new route, around the woods.
          
          IN THE WOODS, KYLE strikes a GLANCING BLOW against a tree
          trunk, and the ATV TOPPLES on its side, spilling its
          passengers. After a beat, they rise, shaken.
          
                                 MARCUS (cont'd)
                       You two all right?
          
                                 STAR
                           (NODDING)
                       Why don't you drive?
          
                                 KYLE
                       Come on I was doing good!
          
          MARCUS rights the vehicle, taking the wheel, the kids climb
          in back.
          
          
          EXT.   RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT
          
          THE ATV comes rocketing down the main street, MARCUS driving
          now. Suddenly, directly in front of them--
          
          --THE TANK APPEARS, moving swiftly around a corner, GUN
          TURRET SWIVELING at them.
          
          AS IT FIRES, MARCUS SWERVES onto a LAWN and--
          
          --CRASHES THROUGH a PICTURE WINDOW.
          
          
          INT.   LUXURY HOME - NIGHT
          
          A handsome HYBRID COUPLE, in pajamas in front of a BIG SCREEN
          TV. They turn and react as the ATV skitters through the room
          and down a hallway. The ATV is followed a moment later by--
          
          --THE TANK, which TAKES OUT THE ENTIRE WALL, BARRELLING
          through the living room and BURYING the HYBRIDS in RUBBLE.

          CONTINUED:
          
          MARCUS takes the ATV UP A FLIGHT OF STAIRS.
          
          THE TANK keeps SMASHING through the house, as its TURRET
          SWIVELS upward and BLASTS AWAY.
          
          UPSTAIRS - THE PLASMA BLAST COMES THROUGH the FLOOR, just
          missing the ATV as it rockets through a MASTER BEDROOM,
          toward a BALCONY.
          
          DOWNSTAIRS - THE TANK tears through an upscale RECREATION
          ROOM, splintering a POOL TABLE, smashing through PINBALL
          MACHINES.
          
          UPSTAIRS - MARCUS takes the ATV straight out onto the
          BALCONY, THROUGH THE RAILING and INTO THE AIR.
          
          DOWNSTAIRS - THE TANK BLASTS THROUGH a KITCHEN and BATHROOM
          on its way out the other side of the house.
          
          
          EXT.   LUXURY HOME/BACK YARD - NIGHT
          
          THE ATV JUST CLEARS an enormous SWIMMING POOL, landing hard
          on the far deck and moving on, fast.
          
          THE TANK SMASHES THROUGH THE BACK WALL and--
          
          --TAKES A NOSEDIVE into the pool, out of commission.
          
          
          INT.   LUXURY HOME - NIGHT
          
          THE RUBBLE in the living room shifts and the HYBRID COUPLE
          extract themselves, taking in their destroyed home with
          placid expressions.
          
          
          EXT.   RESIDENTIAL SIDESTREET - NIGHT
          
          A moment's breather. Marcus slows the vehicle, which WOBBLES
          and SMOKES from all it's been through. He looks around.
          
                                 KYLE
                       Where are we going?
          
                                 MARCUS
                       There.

          CONTINUED:
          
          He points toward the COAST, we see a MARINA in the distance,
          a BOAT moored at a DOCK.
          
          MARCUS steers the ATV down a slope toward the shoreline.
          
          
          EXT.   COASTLINE/DOCK - NIGHT/DAWN
          
          MARCUS, KYLE and STAR leap off the ATV and sprint for a
          MOTORBOAT. Kyle carries the rifle now.
          
          As they near the boat, MARCUS reacts to the sight of--
          
          --RED EYES FLICKERING in the darkness at the END OF THE DOCK,
          the BLUE GLOW of a RIFLE CHARGING.
          
          MARCUS leaps in front of KYLE and STAR shielding them with
          his BODY. The PLASMA BLAST envelops him, MARCUS is blown--
          
          --INTO THE WATER. KYLE and STAR are flattened by the force
          of the blast, lie motionless on the dock. Their PLASMA RIFLE
          lies a few feet away.
          
          THE SKELETAL TERMINATOR who shot Marcus moves swiftly down
          the dock, its PLASMA RIFLE trained on the water now. It
          moves past Kyle and Star, who remain motionless on the
          ground, and goes to the edge of the dock--
          
          --BLAM! STAR snatches up their own PLASMA WEAPON, and BLASTS
          the thing in the back, knocking it INTO THE WATER, which is
          only a few feet deep here. As it rises, SHE FIRES again,
          taking the Terminator's head off. It goes under.
          
          THE SKY is beginning to LIGHTEN now as, a moment later,
          MARCUS EMERGES. As he climbs from the shallow water back
          onto the dock, Kyle and Star stare at him with astonishment.
          
          Seeing their expressions, he checks himself for damage--
          there's METAL exposed at his shoulder, arm and hand, his FACE
          partially TORN AWAY, ONE EYE MISSING. He tries to speak, but
          can only manage an ELECTRONIC CROAK.
          
          Kyle and Star back away from him.
          
                                 KYLE
                       He's not real.
          
          Marcus shakes his head, starts to move toward them.   STAR
          raises the rifle, points it at him.
                                                            (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
                                 STAR
                       Don't come any closer!
          
          They hear a WHISTLING SOUND from shore, hit the deck as--
          
          --a MISSILE BLAST TAKES OUT THE BOAT and a large chunk of
          DOCK.
          
          Laying low, they look up to see--
          
          --a small army of TANKS and TERMINATORS approaching... even a
          HUNTER-KILLER moving in from the horizon, swinging its
          SPOTLIGHT in all directions. It looks like the last stand.
          
          MARCUS turns back to KYLE and STAR.   His voice is a distorted
          WHISPER.
          
                                    MARCUS
                       I'm sorry.
          
          Star puts the rifle aside, with an apologetic expression.
          She moves to Marcus, gingerly touches his exposed metal--
          then hugs him tightly.
          
          Kyle, more stoical, looks out to sea.   His expression
          changes, becomes almost hopeful as--
          
          --IN THE DISTANCE, a HUGE, BLACK SHAPE rises to the surface
          of the water, just visible against the dawn horizon.
          
          FIREWORKS! MISSILES blast the H-K... NAPALM erupts around
          the TANKS and TERMINATOR ARMY as--
          
          --A SQUAD OF A-10s SCREAM IN from over the land, FIRING
          CANNONS, launching AIR-TO GROUND MISSILES to take out the
          TANKS. ONE A-10 flies low overhead and WAGS ITS WINGS.

          huddled humans below.
          
          
          EXT.   COASTLINE - DAY
          
          KYLE points to the dark shape on the water-- now visible as a
          huge SUBMARINE with the RISING SUN behind it.

          HIGH ANGLE as ZODIAC BOATS reach land. HAZ-MAT SUITED
          SOLDIERS leap out and run to our heroes at what remains of
          the dock, others head inland to provide covering FIRE.
          
          MARCUS addresses a TEAM LEADER, who's taken aback at his
          frightening appearance and distorted voice:
          
                                 MARCUS
                       There are more prisoners, a complex
                       about a mile in--
          
          As MARCUS gives the man a few more directions--
          
          --ONE HAZ-MAT FIGURE, standing a few feet off, studies Kyle
          and approaches.
          
                                 HAZ-MAT MAN
                       What's your name, son?
          
                                 KYLE
                       Kyle Reese.
          
          The figure pulls off a glove and unzips his mask, extends a
          hand. It's JOHN CONNOR.
          
                                 CONNOR
                       John Connor. I'm glad you made it.
          
          KYLE is amazed to be meeting the man face-to-face. He shakes
          hands, wide-eyed and speechless. It's a strange moment for
          Connor, too, for different reasons.
          
          CONNOR turns away from his first meeting with his father to
          be, a bit dizzy at the experience. He addresses Marcus.
          
                                 CONNOR (cont'd)
                       Seems I owe you an apology.
          
          MARCUS smiles as best he can, given his ruined face.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       Yeah, well. Get in line.
          
          WIDER, as CONNOR replaces his mask, moves to direct his
          troops. MARCUS, KYLE and STAR stay close together.
          
                                                             DISSOLVE TO:
          
                                                                        107.
          
          
          INT.   SUBMARINE/HATCH AREA - DAY
          
          Near the ENGINE ROOM, a couple dozen RESCUED PRISONERS are
          being treated by unarmed MEDICAL PERSONNEL, others huddle
          under blankets with food and drink. KATE is among those
          helping the former prisoners.
          
          KYLE and STAR eat ravenously, he finishes one MRE and grabs
          up another. A few feet away, MARCUS leans against a wall,
          plasma RIFLE at his side. A DOCTOR examines him warily,
          prodding his injured face.
          
                               DOCTOR
                     Does this hurt?
          
                               MARCUS
                     I don't feel a thing.    Help
                     somebody else.
          
          The doctor moves on as a couple of HAZ-MAT SUITED FIGURES
          come down the ladder from the hatch, FACE-MASKS removed.
          Among them is CONNOR. KATE moves to his side as more dazed
          HUMANS come down. She speaks quietly, eying KYLE nearby.
          
                               KATE
                     Your dad-- he seems like a nice kid.
          
          Connor can't deal with that at the moment, speaks loudly.
          
                               CONNOR
                     The last boatload is right behind
                     me. Skynet's pouring in
                     reinforcements, we can't hold this
                     place. And the people in the
                     houses, they won't leave--
          
                               MARCUS
                     They're not people anymore...
          
          He trails off, reacting to the sight of--
          
          A FAMILIAR FIGURE descending the ladder, in a long coat, head
          down. She looks up to make eye contact... SERENA.
          
                               MARCUS (cont'd)
                     No!
          
          SLO-MO:   seeing Marcus, Serena reaches into her coat--
          
                                                             (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                         108.
          CONTINUED:
          
          MARCUS moves at the same time, to grab his PLASMA RIFLE--
          
          SERENA leaps off the ladder, aiming a small, powerful PLASMA
          WEAPON.
          
          SERENA fires first--
          
          BLAM! THE PLASMA BLAST catches MARCUS in the shoulder and
          BLOWS his GUN ARM clean off. His PLASMA RIFLE discharges,
          BLOWING a HOLE in the side of the sub, near the floor-- WATER
          gushes in like a FIREHOSE.
          
          LEAVE SLO-MO. Spun around by the force of the blast, MARCUS
          lands on his back, SPARKS and SEVERED CABLES protruding from
          his damaged shoulder. An ALARM KLAXON SOUNDS.
          
          PRISONERS and DOCTORS SCREAM and scramble for cover--
          
          CONNOR steps in front of KATE to shield her, they back away
          through the WATER BLAST, CONNOR FIRING at SERENA--
          
          SERENA takes numerous HITS from the EXPLOSIVE BULLETS, which
          take off PIECES of her, but she keeps coming, FIRES again--
          
          --HITTING CONNOR in the lower abdomen. He's thrown backward,
          KATE cries out and throws herself on top of him. His gun has
          gone flying.
          
          SERENA turns her attention to MARCUS, standing over him,
          plasma weapon aimed point-blank at his head.
          
                                 SERENA
                       Why, Marcus? You were immortal...
          
          MARCUS manages a smile as he shakes his head.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       No one lives forever.
          
          BLAM! MULTIPLE PLASMA BLASTS from behind RIDDLE SERENA'S
          TORSO, the BLUE PULSES burning right through her-- her HEAD
          takes a hit, the STEEL is RUPTURED.
          
          THE PLASMA WEAPON flies out of her arms, she COLLAPSES.
          
          TIGHT ON HER FACE, as she turns to see who got her--
          
          There's no one there.    But ON THE FLOOR lies--
          
                                                             (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED: (2)
          
          --MARCUS' SEVERED ARM, still holding his PLASMA RIFLE.     The
          hand RELEASES the weapon.
          
          SERENA'S HEAD tilts, her eyes go blank-- she's dead.
          
          MEDICAL PERSONNEL are doing what they can to help CONNOR,
          blood at his lips, KATE and KYLE at his side.
          
                               CONNOR
                     This... this can't happen...

          UNDERWATER - DAY
          
          THE SUBMARINE "LOS ANGELES" moves TOWARD CAMERA as it slowly
          SINKS deeper beneath the water's surface. We see a makeshift
          STEEL PATCH welded near the hatch.

          INT.   SUBMARINE/CORRIDOR - DAY
          
          MARCUS waits outside the entrance to the SICKBAY. He's
          cleaned up a bit, wears fresh clothes (one sleeve pinned up).
          He seems weary, wrung out, his systems damaged. He'll move
          stiffly through the following scene, like a stroke victim.
          
          STAR sits beside him, a hand on his arm.   BLAIR approaches
          from down the corridor.
          
                               BLAIR
                     Marcus... I need to head back to my
                     unit.
          
          MARCUS nods, keeps his head bowed.
          
                               BLAIR (cont'd)
                     What about you?
          
          His voice is still WEAK.
          
                               MARCUS
                     I have no idea. I should be dead...
          
                               STAR
                     But you're alive.

          CONTINUED:
          
                                 MARCUS
                           (a half-smile)
                       So to speak.
          
                                 BLAIR
                       We've been ordered not to talk
                       about it-- the hybrids, everything
                       about that place is top secret...
          
                                 MARCUS
                       Yeah, simpler to keep it man versus
                       machine.
          
          Star gingerly reaches up to touch the torn plastic at the
          back of Marcus' head, where the interface was.
          
                                  STAR
                           (BEAT)
                       What did it feel like?   To be...
                       one of them?
          
                                 MARCUS
                           (thoughtful beat)
                       Better than anything. Everything made
                       sense. For the first time in my life,
                       I felt... right. It was heaven.
          
                                 BLAIR
                       How could you give that up?
          
          He turns to her, exposing his mangled face, one eye gone.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       I never really believed in heaven.
          
          BLAIR takes this in, fishes in a pocket.
          
                                  BLAIR
                       Here.   You need these more than I do.
          
          She holds out a PAIR OF SUNGLASSES.     MARCUS, a bit amused,
          slips them on.
          
          THE DOOR opens nearby and an ashen-faced KATE emerges.
          
                                 KATE
                       He wants to see you.
          
          BLAIR gives MARCUS a farewell hug.
          
                                                                         111.
          
          
          INT.   SUBMARINE SICKBAY - DAY
          
          CONNOR has a PRIVATE MEDICAL AREA set aside. He's not
          looking good-- pale, weak, only semi-conscious. I.V.s and
          MONITORS, other LIFE-SUPPORT EQUIPMENT. KYLE is with Connor,
          staring at a small POLAROID PHOTO in his hand. CONNOR can
          barely speak above a whisper.
          
                                CONNOR
                     Her name was Sarah... she was...
                     amazing...
          
                               KYLE
                     I don't remember my mother.
          
          KYLE starts to hand the photo back, CONNOR waves it away.
          
                                CONNOR
                     Keep it.
          
          KYLE is a bit puzzled, but obediently keeps the snapshot.
          KATE enters with MARCUS, touches the boy's shoulder.
          
                               KATE
                     Kyle, could you give us a minute?
          
          KYLE reluctantly leaves, still looking at the photo, with a
          nod to MARCUS on the way out. He joins STAR in the doorway,
          they go off together.
          
          KATE, CONNOR and MARCUS are alone now. Throughout scene,
          Kate fights to maintain a steely control-- but she's clearly
          not far from tears.
          
                               KATE (cont'd)
                     Marcus... you're going to need to
                     be rebuilt. Your face, your body,
                     your voice...
                         (off his shrug)
                     We have people who can do it.
          
          She pulls some MEDICAL DIAGRAMS out of a drawer, lays them
          before Marcus. He examines--
          
          --a SCANNED IMAGE of his FACE, various elements HIGHLIGHTED.
          
                               KATE (cont'd)
                     But you won't be the same...
          
                                                            (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          MARCUS moves to the NEXT IMAGE-- it shows his features
          TRANSFORMED into another's-- something closer to JOHN
          CONNOR'S FACE, with a JAGGED SCAR over part of his features.
          
                                 KATE (cont'd)
                       The scar will help hide the change.
          
          Marcus lowers the papers, absorbing this.
          
                                  MARCUS
                       You're asking me to become...
                            (gesturing at Connor)
                       Him?
          
          Connor can barely speak above a whisper:
          
                                   CONNOR
                       You must.
          
                                 KATE
                           (QUIETLY)
                       We can't keep him alive much longer.
                           (shakes her head, swallows)
                       Very few people know what John
                       actually looks like. Only the
                       technicians and our closest advisors
                       need ever know the truth.
          
                                   MARCUS
                       Why me?
          
                                 KATE
                       Who else? Only you know the enemy
                       from the inside. You liberated a
                       Skynet camp... you're a hero.
          
          Connor gestures for Marcus to move closer, he speaks with
          great effort:
          
                                 CONNOR
                       I never knew how I was supposed to
                       win this war. But I finally
                       understand: the idea of John Connor
                       is more important than the person.
                           (sinks back, spent)
                       I can die. He cannot.
          
          Kate leans toward Marcus, who's lost in thought.

          MARCUS bows his head for a long beat, as if seeking an answer
          from within. Then he looks up again with resolve.
          
          He lifts his hand-- the SKIN TATTERED, METAL exposed at
          finger joints-- and moves to take CONNOR'S TREMBLING HAND.

          SLOW-MOTION, MOS - a SNOWY, MOUNTAINOUS ENVIRONMENT...
          
          STEEL TERMINATORS go down in HAILS OF BULLETS.   We hear
          Marcus' VO, his voice strong and assured:
          
                               MARCUS (V.O.)
                     Yea, though I walk through the
                     valley of the shadow of death...
          
          AN ARMY of HUMAN RESISTANCE FIGHTERS marches through the
          SNOW, GUNS BLAZING.

          AN H-K goes down IN FLAMES, SMASHES in the MOUNTAINSIDE.
          
          THE GOLDEN EXPLOSION silhouettes a single FIGURE, who stands
          on a PROMONTORY, surveying the battle below. AIDES and
          SOLDIERS surround him, but he towers over them, giving
          orders, in complete control. MOVE IN SLOWLY on him.
          
                               MARCUS (V.O.) (cont'd)
                     I died, and was reborn. I wear
                     another man's face, lead another
                     man's life... yet only now do I
                     have a reason for living. I once
                     was lost, but now I'm found...
          
          ANOTHER BLAST illuminates his face for an instant-- scarred,
          craggy, a blend of Marcus and Connor-- but fierce, determined
          and proud. [Perhaps shoot this with both actors.]
          
                               MARCUS (V.O.) (cont'd)

                                  Final shooting script

                                       JUNE 5, 1990

                

               FADE IN:

               INT.  RESTAURANT - MORNING (PRESENT DAY)

               LOUISE is a waitress in a coffee shop.  She is in her early-
               thirties, but too old to be doing this.  She is very pretty 
               and meticulously groomed, even at the end of her shift.  She 
               is slamming dirty coffee cups from the counter into a bus 
               tray underneath the counter.  It is making a lot of RACKET, 
               which she is oblivious to.  There is COUNTRY MUZAK in the 
               b.g., which she hums along with.

               INT.  THELMA'S KITCHEN - MORNING

               THELMA is a housewife.  It's morning and she is slamming 
               coffee cups from the breakfast table into the kitchen sink, 
               which is full of dirty breakfast dishes and some stuff left 
               from last night's dinner which had to "soak".  She is still 
               in her nightgown.  The TV is ON in the b.g.

               From the kitchen, we can see an incomplete wallpapering 
               project going on in the dining room, an obvious "do-it-
               yourself" attempt by Thelma.

               INT.  RESTAURANT - MORNING

               Louise goes to the pay phone and dials a number.

               INT.  THELMA'S KITCHEN - MORNING

               Phone RINGS.  Thelma goes over to answer it.

                                     THELMA
                              (hollering)
                         I got it!   Hello.

               INT.  RESTAURANT - MORNING

                                     LOUISE
                              (at pay phone)
                         I hope you're packed, little 
                         housewife, 'cause we are outta her 
                         tonight.

               INT.  THELMA'S KITCHEN - MORNING

                                     THELMA
                         Well, wait now.  I still have to ask 
                         Darryl if I can go.

                                     LOUISE (V.O.)
                         You mean you haven't asked him yet?  
                         For Christ sake, Thelma, is he your 
                         husband or your father?  It's just 
                         two days.  For God's sake, Thelma.  
                         Don't be a child.  Just tell him 
                         you're goin' with me, for cryin' out 
                         loud.  Tell him I'm havin' a nervous 
                         breakdown.

               Thelma has the phone tucked under her chin, as she cuts out 
               coupons from the newspaper and pins them on a bulletin board 
               already covered with them.  We see various recipes torn out 
               from women's magazines along the lines of "101 Ways to Cook 
               Pork."

                                     THELMA
                         He already thinks you're out of your 
                         mind, Louise, that don't carry much 
                         weight with Darryl.  Are you at work?

                                     LOUISE (V.O.)
                         No, I'm callin' from the Playboy 
                         Mansion.

                                     THELMA
                         I'll call you right back.

               Thelma goes through the living room to the bottom of the 
               stairs and leans on the banister.

                                     THELMA
                         Darryl!  Honey, you'd better hurry 
                         up.

               DARRYL comes trotting down the stairs.  Polyester was made 
               for this man, and he's dripping in "men's" jewelry.  He 
               manages a Carpeteria.

                                     DARRYL
                         Damnit, Thelma, don't holler like 
                         that!  Haven't I told you I can't 
                         stand it when you holler in the 
                         morning.

                                     THELMA
                         I'm sorry, Doll, I just didn't want 
                         you to be late.

               Darryl is checking himself out in the hall mirror, and

               it's obvious he likes what he sees.  He exudes over-confidence 
               for reasons that never become apparent.  He likes to think 
               of himself as a real lady killer.

               He is making imperceptible adjustments to his over-moussed 
               hair.  Thelma watches approvingly.

                                     THELMA
                         Hon.

                                     DARRYL
                         What.

                                     THELMA
                              (she decides not to 
                              tell him)
                         Have a good day at work today.

                                     DARRYL
                         Uh-huh.

                                     THELMA
                         Hon?

                                     DARRYL
                         What?!

                                     THELMA
                         You want anything special for dinner?

                                     DARRYL
                         No, Thelma, I don't give a shit what 
                         we have for dinner.  I may not even 
                         make it home for dinner.  You know 
                         how Fridays are.

                                     THELMA
                         Funny how so many people wanna buy 
                         carpet on a Friday night.  You'd 
                         almost think they's want to forget 
                         about it for the weekend.

                                     DARRYL
                         Well then, it's a good thing you're 
                         not regional manager and I am.

               He's finally ready.  He walks to the door and gives Thelma 
               the most perfunctory kiss on the cheek.

                                     THELMA
                         'Bye, honey.  I won't wait up.

                                     DARRYL
                         See ya.

               Darryl leaves.  We see his Corvette parked out front.  As he 
               closes the front door, Thelma leans against it.

                                     THELMA
                         He's gonna shit.

               Thelma laughs to herself.  She goes back into the kitchen 
               and picks up the phone and dials it.

               INT.  RESTAURANT - MORNING

               The pay phone on the wall RINGS.  ALBERT, a busboy in his 
               50's, answers.

                                     ALBERT
                         Good morning.  Why, yes, she is.  Is 
                         this Thelma?  Oh, Thelma, when you 
                         gonna run away with me?

               Louise comes over and takes the phone out of his hand.

                                     LOUISE
                              (to Albert)
                         Not this weekend, sweetie, she's 
                         runnin' away with me.
                              (into phone)
                         Hi.  What'd he say?

                                     THELMA (V.O.)
                         What time are you gonna pick me up?

                                     LOUISE
                         You're kiddin'!  Alright!  I'll be 
                         there around two or three.

                                     THELMA (V.O.)
                         What kind of stuff do I bring?

                                     LOUISE
                         I don't know.  Warm stuff, I guess.  
                         It's the mountains.  I guess it gets 
                         cold at night.  I'm just gonna bring 
                         everything.

                                     THELMA (V.O.)
                         Okay.  I will, too.

                                     LOUISE
                         And steal Darryl's fishin' stuff.

                                     THELMA (V.O.)
                         I don't know how to fish, Louise.

                                     LOUISE
                         Neither do I, Thelma, but Darryl 
                         does it, how hard can it be?  I'll 
                         see you later.  Be ready.

               They both hang up.

               EXT.  RESTAURANT - DAY

               Louise pulls out in a green '66 T-Bird in mint condition.

               INT.  THELMA'S BEDROOM - CLOSEUP - SUITCASE ON BED - DAY

               Going into the suitcase is bathing suits, wool socks, flannel 
               pajamas, jeans, sweaters, T-shirts, a couple of dresses, way 
               too much stuff for a two-day trip.  REVEAL Thelma, standing 
               in front of a closet, trying to decide what else to bring, 
               as if she's forgotten something.  The room looks like it was 
               decorated entirely from a Sears catalog.  It's really frilly.

               INT.  LOUISE'S BEDROOM - CLOSEUP - SUITCASE ON BED - DAY

               A perfectly ordered suitcase, everything neatly folded and 
               orderly.  Three pairs of underwear, one pair of long 
               underwear, two pairs of pants, two sweaters, one furry robe, 
               one nightgown.  She could be packing for camp.

               REVEAL Louise.  Her room is as orderly as the suitcase.

               Everything matches.  It's not quite as frilly as Thelma's, 
               but it is of the same ilk.  She is debating whether to take 
               an extra pair of socks.  She decides not to and closes the 
               suitcase.  She goes to the phone, picks it up and dials.  We 
               hear:

                                     ANSWERING MACHINE (V.O.)
                         Hi.  This is Jimmy.  I'm not here 
                         right now, but I'll probably be back 
                         'cause... all my stuff's here.  Leave 
                         a message.

               Louise slams down the phone.  A framed picture of Louise and 
               Jimmy sits on the table next to the phone.  She matter-of-
               factly slams that face down, too.

               Thelma is still throwing stuff in, randomly now.  She talks 
               to herself quietly the whole time.

               She is taking stuff off of her nightstand, a small clock, 
               fingernail scissors, etc.

               She opens the drawer of her nightstand.  Her attitude is 
               purposeful; she looks as if she knows exactly what she's 
               doing; although, frankly, she has no idea, and each decision 
               is completely arbitrary.  As she rifles through it, plucking 
               various items from among the jumbled contents, we see there 
               is a gun in there, one Darryl bought her for protection.  It 
               is unloaded, but there is a box of bullets.  She picks up 
               the gun like it's a rat by the tail and puts it in her purse.

                                     THELMA
                              (muttering to herself)
                         Psycho killers...

               She grabs the box of bullets and throws them in, too.  She 
               tries to close her suitcase, but there is stuff hanging out 
               all over the place.  She stuffs things back in the sides and 
               heaves all her weight against the top.

               EXT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - DAY

               Louise's green '66 T-Bird convertible pulls into the driveway 
               of Thelma's house.  The garage door goes up and Thelma is 
               standing in the garage with all her gear.  A suitcase that 
               looks like it might explode, fishing gear, a cooler, a 
               lantern.  Thelma's car, a beat-up gray Honda, is parked in 
               there, too.  Louise gets out of the driver's seat.

                                     LOUISE
                         We don't need the lantern.  The place 
                         has electricity.

                                     THELMA
                         I wanna take it anyway.  Just in 
                         case.

                                     LOUISE
                         In case of what?

                                     THELMA
                         In case there's some escaped psycho 
                         killer on the loose, who cuts the 
                         electricity off and tries to come in 
                         and kill us.

                                     LOUISE
                              (going along with her)
                         Oh yeah, sure, Thelma, that lantern 
                         will come in real handy.  Maybe we 
                         could tow your car behind, in case 
                         he steals the spark plugs.

                                     THELMA
                         We'd have to.  That thing barely 
                         makes it down the driveway.

               They load everything into the car.  The trunk barely closes.  
               Thelma heaves all her weight against it.  They get into the 
               car and pull out of the driveway.  As they drive down the 
               street, we hear Thelma let out a long howl.

               She is laughing and she sticks her arms straight up in the 
               air.

               EXT.  CAR - DAY

               They are driving down the interstate.  Thelma reaches for 
               her purse and finds the gun.

                                     THELMA
                         Louise, will you take care of the 
                         gun?

               Louise shrieks at the sight of it.

                                     LOUISE
                         Why in hell did you bring that?

               Thelma wonders if Louise is really that naive.

                                     THELMA
                         Oh, come on, Louise... psycho killers, 
                         bears... snakes!  I just don't know 
                         how to use it.  So will you take 
                         care of it?

               Louise reaches over and takes the gun out of Thelma's purse 
               and holds it in her hand.  She tests the weight of it, and 
               then puts it under the seat.  Thelma puts the bullets under 
               the seat.

               They are speeding off down the highway with the RADIO blaring.  
               Louise puts in a TAPE of wild R&B MUSIC.

                                     THELMA
                         Whose place is this again?

                                     LOUISE
                         It's Bob's, the day manager's.  He's 
                         gettin' a divorce, so his wife's 
                         gettin' this place, so he's just 
                         lettin' all his friends use it till 
                         he has to turn over the keys.

                                     THELMA
                         I've never had the chance to go out 
                         of town without Darryl.

                                     LOUISE
                         How come he let you go?

                                     THELMA
                         'Cause I didn't ask him.

                                     LOUISE
                         Aw, shit, Thelma, he's gonna kill 
                         you.

                                     THELMA
                         Well, he has never let me go.  He 
                         never lets me do one goddamn thing 
                         that's any fun.  All he wants me to 
                         do is hang around the house the whole 
                         time while he's out doing God only 
                         knows what.

               They are both silent for a minute.

                                     THELMA
                              (looking straight 
                              ahead)
                         I left him a note.  I left him stuff 
                         to microwave.

               After a pause.

                                     THELMA
                         I guess you haven't heard anything 
                         from Jimmy... yet?

               Louise's jaw tightens.  The car speeds up.

                                     THELMA
                         ...never mind.

               A huge semi-tanker carrying gas passes them on the highway 
               and HONKS.  The mud flaps are the shiny silhouettes of naked 
               women.  There is a bumper sticker on the back that says:  
               "Lick you all over -- ten cents."

                                     LOUISE
                         One of your friends?

               Thelma is watching herself in the side mirror, pretending to 
               smoke a cigarette.

               THELMA'S POV OF A SIGN alongside the road that reads "See 
               you in church on Sunday!"

               Thelma pushes in the lighter and waits for it to pop out.  
               Louise gives her a sidelong glance, but does not say anything.

               INT.  CAR - COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

                                     THELMA
                         How much longer is it gonna be?  I'm 
                         hungry.

                                     LOUISE
                         Another hour of so.  We've got enough 
                         food for a month.

                                     THELMA
                         I'll never make it... Can't we stop 
                         just for a few minutes...

                                     LOUISE
                         We've not gonna get to the cabin 
                         till after dark as it is, Thelma.

                                     THELMA
                         Then what difference does it make if 
                         we stop?  Come on.  I never get to 
                         do stuff like this.

               Louise realizes that Thelma is going to revert to a teenager 
               and continue whining unless she gives in.

                                     LOUISE
                         Alright, but it's gonna be a quick 
                         stop.

               EXT.  SILVER BULLET - NIGHT

               They pull off at a place down on the right all lit up with 
               neon.  It's called the SILVER BULLET.  The sign flashes 
               COCKTAILS -- BEER -- DANCING -- FOOD.  There is a huge gravel 
               parking lot with lots of pickup trucks and older cars.  Even 
               though it's early, you can tell this place is a real night 
               spot.  It's already pretty crowded.

               INT.  SILVER BULLET - NIGHT

               This place is jumpin'.  There are ten pool tables with crowds 
               all around.  The long bar is filled with customers.

               There are tables and booths.  The room is dense with smoke.  
               There is a dance floor, but no one is dancing yet because 
               the band is still setting up.  There are a lot of single 
               men.  Many heads turn and follow Thelma and Louise to an 
               empty table.

                                     LOUISE
                         I haven't seen a place like this 
                         since I left Texas.

                                     THELMA
                         Isn't this fun?

               A WAITRESS comes over and drops two menus on the table.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Y'all wanna drink?

                                     LOUISE
                         No thanks.

                                     THELMA
                         I'll have Wild Turkey straight up 
                         and a Coke back, please.

               As the Waitress leaves:

                                     LOUISE
                         Thelma!

                                     THELMA
                         Tell me somethin'.  Is this my 
                         vacation or isn't it?  I mean, God, 
                         you're as bad as Darryl.

                                     LOUISE
                         I just haven't seen you like this in 
                         a while.  I'm used to seeing you 
                         more sedate.

                                     THELMA
                         Well, I've had it up to my ass with 
                         sedate!  You said you and me was 
                         gonna get outta town and, for once, 
                         just really let our hair down.  Well, 
                         darlin,' look out 'cause my hair is 
                         comin' down!

               As the Waitress returns:

                                     LOUISE
                              (laughing)
                         Alright...
                              (to Waitress)
                         I changed my mind.  I'll have a 
                         margarita with and a shot of Cuervo 
                         on the side, please.

                                     THELMA
                         Yeah!

               As the Waitress leaves, a MAN comes over with a chair which 
               he pulls up to the table and straddles backwards.

               He is in his late-40's, heavyset, his face is shiny in the 
               neon light.

                                     MAN
                         Now what are a couple of Kewpie dolls 
                         like you doin' in a place like this?

                         LOUISE
                 Mindin' our own 
                 business, why don't 
                 you try it.

                                                       THELMA
                                               Well, we left town for the 
                                               weekend 'cause we wanted 
                                               to try and have a good 
                                               time.  And because Louise 
                                               here is mad because her 
                                               boyfriend won't call her 
                                               while he's out on the 
                                               road... 

               Louise kicks Thelma under the table.

                                     THELMA
                              (quieter)
                         We just wanted to get somethin' to 
                         eat.

                                     MAN
                         Well, you come to the right place.  
                         You like chili?  They got good chili.

               The Waitress returns with Louise's drink.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Harlan, are you botherin' these poor 
                         girls?

                                     HARLAN (MAN)
                         Hell, no.  I was just bein' friendly.

                                     WAITRESS
                              (making eye contact 
                              with Louise)
                         It's a good thing they're not all as 
                         friendly as you.

               Louise understands.

                                     THELMA
                         Your name's Harlan?  I got an uncle 
                         named Harlan!

                                     HARLAN
                         You do?  Is he a funny uncle? 'Cause 
                         if he is, then he and I got somethin' 
                         in common.

               Harlan laughs.  Thelma laughs, too, but doesn't really get 
               the joke.  Louise does not laugh.

                                     LOUISE
                              (to Harlan)
                         I don't mean to be rude, but I've 
                         got something I need to talk to my 
                         friend about.  In private.

                                     HARLAN
                         Aw, I understand.  I didn't mean to 
                         bother ya.  It's just hard not to 
                         notice two such pretty ladies as 
                         yourselves.
                              (standing, to Thelma)
                         You better dance with me before you 
                         leave, or I'll never forgive you.

                                     THELMA
                         Oh, sure.  That'd be fun.

               Harlan leaves, then:

                                     THELMA
                         Jeez, Louise, that wasn't very nice.

                                     LOUISE
                         Can't you tell when somebody's hittin' 
                         on you?

                                     THELMA
                         So what if he was?  It's all your 
                         years of waitin' tables has made you 
                         jaded, that's all.

                                     LOUISE
                         Maybe.

                                     THELMA
                         Well, just relax, will ya.  You're 
                         makin' me nervous.

               Thelma knocks back her shot of Wild Turkey and holds up her 
               glass to the Waitress to bring her another one.  The Waitress 
               sees her and nods.  She turns back to face her friend.

                                     THELMA
                         So, Jimmy still hasn't called yet?

                                     LOUISE
                         Givin' him a taste of his own 
                         medicine.  Asshole.

                                     THELMA
                         I'm sorry, Louise.  I know you're 
                         all upset.  It's just I'm so excited 
                         to be out of the house, I guess.
                              (pause)
                         I wonder if Darryl's home yet.

                                     LOUISE
                         I wonder if Jimmy's gotten back.

                                     THELMA
                         Why don't you tell him to just to 
                         get lost once and for all?

                                     LOUISE
                         Why don't you ditch that loser husband 
                         of yours?

               They both drift off momentarily, contemplating their domestic 
               problems, until the Waitress comes over:

                                     WAITRESS
                              (rolling her eyes)
                         This one's on Harlan.

               Thelma looks over at the bar where Harlan is grinning at 
               her, making dancing motions.  She smiles and waves at him.

               Her face becomes serious again as she turns back to Louise.

                                     THELMA
                         Jimmy'll come in off the road, you 
                         won't be there, he'll freak out and 
                         call you a hundred thousand times, 
                         and Sunday night you'll call him 
                         back and, by Monday.  He'll be kissin' 
                         the ground you walk on.

               Thelma's mind goes too fast for her mouth, and the speed at 
               which she speaks can be staggering.  Louise is used to it.  
               Louise smiles wistfully at Thelma's assessment of the 
               situation.

                                     LOUISE
                         Exactly.

                                     THELMA
                         In the meantime, you said we were 
                         gonna have some fun.  So let's have 
                         some!

               She again drinks her whole shot of Wild Turkey and holds up 
               her glass, as the BAND strikes up a lively tune.

               Practically the whole place "whoops" and heads for the dance 
               floor.  Louise drinks her shot of tequila and holds up her 
               glass, too.

               LATER

               Thelma is dancing with Harlan and has been for quite a while.  
               Louise has been dancing with a quiet guy named DAN.  Thelma 
               is breathless, drunk and giggly.  She holds a beer bottle in 
               one hand.  She is laughing a lot about nothing, and Harlan 
               is studying her closely.  Louise notices this.

                                     LOUISE
                              (over the noise)
                         Thelma, I'm gonna hit the little 
                         girls' room, and then we gotta hit 
                         the road.

                                     THELMA
                              (eyes closed, swaying 
                              with the music)
                         Ready when you are.

               Louise heads off to the bathroom.

                                     THELMA
                              (eyes still closed)
                         Louise, I'm gonna come with you.
                              (she gets a funny 
                              look on her face)
                         I don't feel so good.

               She stumbles a step and drops her beer bottle.

               Louise is heading towards the bathroom, where there is a 
               line of at least fifteen women in front of her.

                                     HARLAN
                              (catching Thelma, 
                              copping feels)
                         Oopsy-doopsy.  We need to get you 
                         some fresh air, little lady.

               He steers her towards the door.

               Louise leans against the wall, waiting in line.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT.  SILVER BULLET PARKING LOT - NIGHT

               Harlan is hauling Thelma out the door into the parking lot.  
               She is pretty limp.

                                     THELMA
                         Oh shit.

                                     HARLAN
                         What's wrong?

                                     THELMA
                         Stop.

                                     HARLAN
                         What for?

                                     THELMA
                         I'm spinning.

               INT.  SILVER BULLET - NIGHT

               The Waitress is going over to their table.  She picks up 
               Thelma's purse off the floor and puts it on her chair.

               She sets the check on the table, looks around to see if she 
               can see them and walks away.

               INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT

               Louise goes into the bathroom.  She stands in front of the 
               sink and looks at herself in the mirror.

               EXT.  PARKING LOT - NIGHT

               Thelma has been sick.  She has Harlan's handkerchief and is 
               wiping her mouth.  Harlan has backed off for this part, but 
               he's right back in there.

                                     HARLAN
                         How you feelin' now, darlin'?

               Harlan is leaning close to Thelma's head, and she pulls her 
               head away.

                                     THELMA
                         I guess I'm startin' to feel a little 
                         better.

                                     HARLAN
                         Yeah, you're startin' to feel pretty 
                         good to me, too.

               He pulls her to him and tries to put his arms around her.  
               Thelma pulls away.

                                     THELMA
                              (uncomfortable)
                         I think I need to keep walking.

               INT.  SILVER BULLET - NIGHT

               Louise comes out of the bathroom as the next woman goes in.  
               She scans the room looking for Thelma.  She doesn't see her.  
               She goes over to the table and sees Thelma's stuff there.  
               She picks up the check and looks at it.

               EXT.  SILVER BULLET PARKING LOT - NIGHT

               Harlan has led Thelma off to the far end of the parking lot.  
               He is trying to kiss her now.  He is pushing her arms down 
               and turning her head away.

                                     THELMA
                         Don't.  I'm married.  I don't feel 
                         good.  I've been sick.

                                     HARLAN
                         It's okay.  I'm married, too.

               Harlan is pushing himself on her now, and she is beginning 
               to push him away harder.

               INT.  SILVER BULLET - NIGHT

               Louise is paying the Waitress.  The Waitress is shaking her 
               head, indicating she hasn't seen Thelma either.

               Louise picks up Thelma's stuff and heads towards the door.

               EXT.  SILVER BULLET PARKING LOT - NIGHT

               Harlan has now pinned Thelma against the back of a car and 
               is kissing her neck.  He has her ass in his hands.  He is 
               beginning to hump her.  She is pushing him away as hard as 
               she can, but he is relentless.

                                     HARLAN
                              (breathing heavily)
                         You're beautiful.  It's okay.  I 
                         won't hurt you.  It's okay.

                                     THELMA
                              (struggling)
                         Stop it!  Goddamnit, I mean it!  
                         Louise is gonna wonder where I am.  
                         Let go!

                                     HARLAN
                         Louise is alright.

               LOUISE

               is now standing outside the door of the Silver Bullet.  She 
               is looking around.

               HARLAN

               is pulling at Thelma's clothes.  Thelma gets one of her arms 
               free and hits him hard in the face.  He hits her back and 
               grabs her face, squeezing it hard.

                                     HARLAN
                         Don't you hit me!  Don't you fucking 
                         hit me!

               There is no trace of friendliness in his face now.  He looks 
               mean and dangerous.  He lets go of her face and pins her 
               arms behind her.  He holds both of her arms with one hand.

                                     HARLAN
                         You just shut up.

               With his free hand, he reaches down and starts to pull her 
               dress up.  Thelma is still struggling and there are tears 
               running down her face.

                                     THELMA
                         Don't hurt me.  Harlan.  Please.

                                     HARLAN
                         Shut up.

               He turns her around, pushing her face down onto the back of 
               the car.  He holds both her arms in one hand and continues 
               pulling her dress up over her hips.  He starts to undo his 
               pants as we hear the CRUNCH of gravel.

                                     LOUISE (O.S.)
                         Let her go.

                                     HARLAN
                         Get lost.

                                     THELMA
                         Louise!

               TIGHT SHOT of the barrel of Thelma's gun being pressed into 
               the nape of Harlan's neck.  Louise's thumb pulls back the 
               hammer.

                                     LOUISE
                         You let her go, you fat fucking 
                         asshole, or I'm gonna splatter your 
                         ugly face all over this nice car.

               Harlan slowly raises his hands in the air, and Thelma darts 
               out, pulling her dress down.

                                     HARLAN
                         Now, calm down.  We were just havin' 
                         a little fun.

               Louise glances at Thelma.  Thelma shakes her head no.

                                     LOUISE
                         Looks like you've got a real fucked 
                         up idea of fun.  Now turn around.

               Louise starts to back away, but the gun is still close to 
               his face.  His pants are undone in the front.  She is still 
               backing away with the gun raised.  Thelma is inching away as 
               well.

                                     LOUISE
                         Just for the future, when a woman's 
                         crying like that, she's not having 
                         any fun!

               Louise lowers the gun and stares at him for a second.  Then 
               she turns and walks away.  Thelma does, too.

                                     HARLAN
                              (pulling up his pants)
                         Bitch.  I should have gone ahead and 
                         fucked her.

               Louise stops in her tracks.

                                     LOUISE
                         What did you say?

                                     HARLAN
                         I said suck my cock.

               Louise takes two long strides back towards him, raises the 
               gun and FIRES a bullet into his face.  We hear his body HIT 
               the gravel parking lot.  LOUISE'S POV.  The car behind him 
               is splattered with blood.  Thelma and Louise are both silent.  
               We hear the SOUND of the nightclub in the distance.  Louise 
               lowers the gun.

                                     THELMA
                         Oh my God.

                                     LOUISE
                         Get the car.

                                     THELMA
                         Jesus Christ!  Louise, you shot him.

                                     LOUISE
                         Get the car!

               Thelma runs to get the car.

                                     LOUISE
                              (quietly, to herself)
                         You watch your mouth, buddy.

               Thelma comes careening up in reverse.  Louise hops in and 
               Thelma PEELS OUT, spraying gravel.  As they speed out of the 
               parking lot back to the road, we hear MUSIC blaring from the 
               nightclub.  They hit the main road with tires SQUEALING.

                                     LOUISE
                         Get back to the interstate.

               Louise lifts her hand and notices she is still holding the 
               gun.

                                     THELMA
                         Shit!  I... I, which way?

                                     LOUISE
                         West.  Left.

               EXT.  CAR - DISTANCING SHOT - NIGHT

               They get onto the interstate going west.

               TRAVELING SHOT FROM BEHIND -- VARIOUS DRIVING SHOTS

               INT.  CAR - NIGHT

               Louise picks up the handkerchief from the car seat and wipes 
               the gun off.  Her movements are as if in slow motion.  She 
               puts the gun under the seat.  Thelma is watching her.

                                     THELMA
                         Louise.

               Louise does not answer.

                                     THELMA
                         Louise.  Where are we going?

                                     LOUISE
                              (shaking)
                         I don't know, Thelma!  I don't know!  
                         Just shut up a minute so I can think.

               Thelma starts to cry quietly.

                                     THELMA
                         Shouldn't we go to the cops?  I mean, 
                         I think we should tell the police.

                                     LOUISE
                         Tell them what?!  What, Thelma?  
                         What do you think we should tell 
                         them?

                                     THELMA
                         I don't know.  Just tell 'em what 
                         happened.

                                     LOUISE
                         Which part?

                                     THELMA
                         All of it.  That he tried to rape 
                         me.

                                     LOUISE
                         Only about a hundred people saw you 
                         cheek to goddamn cheek with him all 
                         night, Thelma!  Who's gonna believe 
                         that?!  We just don't live in that 
                         kind of world.  Pull over!

               EXT.  INTERSTATE - NIGHT

               Thelma pulls off to the side of the road.  Louise gets out 
               and starts to walk around the car.  She stops when she gets 
               to the back of the car, and she is sick.  Thelma waits in 
               the car and moves over to the passenger side.  Louise gets 
               in the driver's side.

                                     THELMA
                         Louise... Are you alright?

               Louise rests her head on the steering wheel.

                                     LOUISE
                         Oh Christ.
                              (to Thelma)
                         Thelma.

               Thelma doesn't hear.

                                     LOUISE
                         Thelma.

               Thelma looks at her blankly, without answering.

                                     LOUISE
                         I've gotta stop for a minute.  I've 
                         got to get it together.  I'm gonna 
                         find a place to get a cup of coffee 
                         and I'm gonna sit down for a second.  
                         Do you want to come?

               Thelma's head moves almost imperceptibly.  Louise studies 
               Thelma's face.

                                     LOUISE
                         Is that yes?  Are you up to this?

               Again, Thelma slightly moves her head in a nod.  Louise puts 
               the car in gear and pulls OUT OF SHOT.

               EXT.  TRUCK STOP - RESTAURANT - NIGHT

               The green '66 T-Bird pulls into a modern truck stop and parks.  
               Louise turns to Thelma.

                                     LOUISE
                         We gotta be inconspicuous.  Do you 
                         know what that means?

                                     THELMA
                         Yes.

                                     LOUISE
                         It means you don't talk to anybody.  
                         You don't draw attention to yourself 
                         in any way.  Do you understand that?

               Again, she twitches more than nods.

                                     LOUISE
                         Tell me you understand that.

               Thelma nods more firmly now.  She understands.

               VARIOUS POV SHOTS of truck drivers seeing Thelma and Louise 
               wind their way towards the restaurant portion of the coffee 
               shop.  They look small and incongruous with the surroundings.

               INT.  TRUCK STOP - TIGHT SHOT - WAITRESS' HANDS - 4 A.M.

               slamming dirty coffee cups from the counter into a bus tray 
               underneath the counter.  REVEAL Louise and Thelma sitting at 
               the counter.  Louise is looking at a map.  The car is parked 
               outside, near the door.

                                     LOUISE
                              (halfway to herself)
                         We have to think this through.  We 
                         have to be smart.  Now is not the 
                         time to panic.  If we panic now, 
                         we're done for.  Nobody saw it.  
                         Nobody knows it was us.  We're still 
                         okay.  Now all we have to do is just 
                         figure out our next move.

                                     THELMA
                         Our next move?  I'll say one thing, 
                         Louise.  This is some vacation.  I 
                         sure am having a good time.  This is 
                         real fun.

                                     LOUISE
                         If you weren't so concerned with 
                         having a good time, we wouldn't be 
                         here right now.

                                     THELMA
                         Just what is that supposed to mean?

                                     LOUISE
                         It means shut up, Thelma.

                                     THELMA
                         So this is all my fault, is it.

               Louise looks at Thelma for a long time.

                                     LOUISE
                         Just shut up.

               The Waitress comes and fills their coffee cups.

               Thelma stands up to go to the bathroom.  She grabs her purse 
               from the counter, and the strap catches on her coffee cup 
               and it falls to the floor with a CRASH.  All heads turn and 
               look at her.

                                     THELMA
                         I have to go to the bathroom.  I...  
                         Sorry.

               HOLD on Louise.

               EXT.  SILVER BULLET PARKING LOT - 4:00 A.M.

               Police cars are parked around.  The activity has died down.  
               Doors on the coroner's van SLAM shut.  In the back of a police 
               car sits the Waitress with the door open.  A DETECTIVE in a 
               suit leans over the car door with his note pad.

               INT.  PAY PHONE - NIGHT

               Outside the bathroom there is a pay phone.  Thelma picks it 
               up and dials.

                                     THELMA
                              (into phone)
                         Collect from Thelma.

               There is no answer.

               INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               Phone RINGS.

               VARIOUS SHOTS of the interior of the empty Dickinson house:

               THE BEDROOM

               exactly as Thelma left it.  The drawer of the nightstand 
               still open.

               THE NOTE TO DARRYL

               taped to the refrigerator.  The interior of the microwave 
               with a now completely thawed microwave dinner still in the 
               package in a little puddle.

               INT.  TRUCK STOP - NIGHT

                                     THELMA
                         Thanks.  I'll try later.

               She hangs up and goes into the bathroom.  As the door closes 
               behind her, Louise comes up with a handful of change and 
               starts putting it into the phone.  She dials a number.  It 
               RINGS for a long time.  She hangs up and goes into the 
               bathroom.  She looks at herself in the mirror.

               She notices a tiny speck on her cheek.  She takes a paper 
               towel and wets it and rubs the spot.  She looks at the towel 
               and there is a bright red streak.

                                     LOUISE
                         Thelma... Come on, Thelma!

               The door of the stall flies open and Thelma comes charging 
               out and heads straight for the door, without even looking at 
               Louise.  Louise charges out after her.  They head out of the 
               restaurant and, THROUGH THE WINDOW, we see them get into the 
               car and drive away.

               EXT.  CAR - DRIVING SHOT - DAWN

               The T-Bird barrels down a fairly empty four-lane highway.

               A truck passes going the other way.

               INT.  CAR - DAWN

               The top is down on the car, and Thelma is slouched on the 
               seat, her hair blowing wildly.

                                     LOUISE
                         We're gonna go to the next town and 
                         stop.  We'll get a motel room.  I 
                         can rest for a while and then figure 
                         out how to get some money.  We're 
                         gonna need money.  Thelma.  How much 
                         money do you have with you?

                                     THELMA
                         What?  Oh, I don't know.  Let me 
                         look.

               Thelma is rummaging through her purse.  She finds her wallet 
               and takes it out.  Thelma finds some bills stuffed in the 
               change compartment and takes them out.  She straightens the 
               money out.

                                     THELMA
                         Sixty-four dollars.

               As she is counting it, one of the bills flies out of her 
               hands.  Thelma's not that good at handling money.

                                     THELMA
                         Umm.  Shit.  Forty-four dollars.

               Louise has not noticed any of this.  She is so intent on her 
               driving.

                                     THELMA
                         I'm cash poor.

                                     LOUISE
                         Hmmm.  We gotta get some money.

               EXT.  MOTEL - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY

               The motel is near farms and agricultural areas with crops.

               INT.  MOTEL ROOM - DAY (6 A.M.)

               The curtains are open and we can see the car parked right 
               outside the room.  Thelma is lying on the bed staring up at 
               the ceiling.  Louise is bustling around the room, putting 
               things in drawers.

                                     THELMA
                         Why are you unpacking?  You said we 
                         were just gonna take a nap.

               Louise did not realize she was doing it.

                                     LOUISE
                         Oh, I don't know.  I'm just nervous.  
                         I gotta figure out what to do.

                                     THELMA
                         Well, when you figure it out, wake 
                         me up.

                                     LOUISE
                         Just what the hell is wrong with 
                         you?

               Louise slams the closet door.  Thelma jumps.

                                     THELMA
                         What do you mean?

                                     LOUISE
                         Why are you actin' like this?

                                     THELMA
                         Actin' like what?!  How am I supposed 
                         to act?  'Scuse me for not knowing 
                         what to do after you blow somebody's 
                         head off!

               They are silent for a moment.

                                     LOUISE
                         You could help me try and figure it 
                         out!  I gotta figure out what to do, 
                         and you could try and help me.

                                     THELMA
                         I suggested we go to the police, but 
                         you didn't like that; so, frankly, 
                         Louise, I'm all out of ideas.

                                     LOUISE
                         Well, what's the big rush, Thelma?  
                         If we just give 'em some time, they'll 
                         come to us...!  Oh Christ.  I'm just 
                         not ready to go to jail yet.  Why 
                         don't you go out to the pool or 
                         something and I'll figure it out...

                                     THELMA
                         Give me the keys.

                                     LOUISE
                         You're not touchin' that car.

                                     THELMA
                         My stuff's in the trunk!  God!  You 
                         care more about that car than you do 
                         about most people.

                                     LOUISE
                         Most people just cause me trouble, 
                         but that car always gets me out of 
                         it.

               INT.  POLICE GARAGE - DAY

               Hal is at the police station where they're dusting the car 
               with Harlan all over it for prints.  Hal looks closely at 
               the back of the car.  He holds his hands over two sets of 
               hand prints.  He moves his hands to the outside of the prints 
               so as not to smear them, and puts his hands on the car.  His 
               face is one inch away from the trunk.  He sees a very clear 
               drop of blood.  It's different than any of the other blood 
               splatters on the car.  He calls the identification technician 
               over and points it out.

                                     HAL
                              (pointing)
                         What's that?

               The I.D. TECH comes over and looks and shrugs his shoulders.

                                     I.D. TECH
                         Blood?

                                     HAL
                         Whose?

                                     I.D. TECH
                         His, I guess...

               Hal makes a face like he suddenly felt a slight toothache.

               He stares at the guy.

                                     HAL
                         You guess?

               Hal takes out a black sharpie and draws a circle around the 
               area of the black smudge and the drop of blood.  He shakes 
               his head slightly.

               EXT.  MOTEL - DAY

               Thelma comes out of the room and walks towards the pool.

               She stops, then decides to go on to the pool.  She lies down 
               in a lounge chair facing the road.

               INT.  MOTEL ROOM - DAY

               Louise in the motel room.  She's looking at the phone.  She 
               picks it up and dials it and watches herself in the mirror.  
               She stares as if she's trying to see into herself, see through 
               herself.

               EXT.  MOTEL POOL - DAY

               Thelma arranges herself in a lounge chair, trying desperately 
               to feel like she's on vacation.

               A VOICE interrupts the message:

                         Hello!  I'm here.  Hang on a minute!

               JIMMY, mid-30's, musician, is standing in the kitchen on the 
               phone.  He's not the type you'd expect Louise to like, not 
               quite straight-looking enough.

                         sound funny.

               Louise is still looking at herself in the mirror, as if she's 
               never seen herself before.

                         distance.

               Turkey and puts in on the counter.  The Old Man rings it up.  
               She takes another one and puts it on the counter.

               The Old Man is still ringing stuff up.

               She takes two more and puts them on the counter.  She takes 
               the rest of the little bottles of Wild Turkey out of the 
               display and puts them on the counter.  She takes one little 
               bottle of Cuervo and puts it down on the counter, too.  The 
               Old Man finally looks at her.  From the wall behind him, he 
               takes a pint of Wild Turkey down.

                                     OLD MAN
                         Ma'am, are you sure you wouldn't 
                         rather have the large economy size?

               Louise is hanging up the phone.  She walks away towards the 
               front of the store.

               EXT.  COUNTRY STORE - DAY

               Thelma comes out of the front of the store.  The store is at 
               a crossroads with a fair amount of vehicular traffic.

                                     LOUISE
                         Go call Darryl.

               Thelma is walking towards the car.  She puts her purse in 
               the front seat.  She looks at Louise.

                                     THELMA
                         Call him?

                                     LOUISE
                         Call him.  Don't tell him anything.  
                         Tell him you're having a wonderful 
                         time and you'll be home tomorrow 
                         night.

                                     THELMA
                         Will I be?

                                     LOUISE
                         I don't know.  I won't be.

               Thelma and Louise look at each other while this sinks in.

               THELMA

               walks around to the side of the building to the phone.  She 
               picks it up and dials.

                                     THELMA

               INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - DAY

               Darryl in the den of their house.  The room is a mess.

               There are beer cans everywhere.  The large screen TV is ON, 
               showing a FOOTBALL GAME.  Darryl is in a recliner.  He is 
               wearing loud shorts, a V-necked T-shirt, and a couple of 
               necklaces and bracelets.

                                     DARRYL
                         Goddamnit, Thelma, where in the Sam

                         What in the hell do you think you're 
                         doing?  Have you lost your goddamn 
                         mind?!  Is that it?  I leave for 
                         work and you take complete leave of

                         Darryl... baby... Darryl, calm down 
                         now, honey.  Please don't get so 
                         mad.  I can explain...

               INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - DAY

               Darryl is mad, but he's still watching the game.

                                     DARRYL
                         Hold on.  Hold on a minute, damnit.

               He covers the mouthpiece and watches a play where "his team" 
               fumbles the ball.  This only makes him madder.  He puts the 
               phone back to his ear in time to hear Thelma say:

                                     THELMA (V.O.)
                         ...only for one day and we'll be 
                         back tomorrow night.

                                     DARRYL
                         No you won't.  You'll be back today.  
                         Now!  You get your ass back here,

               Thelma is trying not to cry.  She's trying to be strong.

                                     THELMA
                         Darryl, please... You're my husband, 
                         not my father, Darryl.

                         That does it!  That Louise is nothin' 
                         but a bad influence.  If you're not 
                         back here tonight, Goddamnit, 
                         Thelma... well, I just don't wanna 
                         say...

               Neither one of them say anything for a moment.

                                     DARRYL
                         Thelma?

                         Darryl.

                                     DARRYL (V.O.)
                         What?

                                     THELMA
                         Go fuck yourself.

               She hangs up on him.

               EXT.  COUNTRY STORE - DAY

               Thelma has tears running down her face and she is watching 
               the ground as she storms back to the car.  So she makes a 
               loud grunt as she slams into someone that she did not see.

               Both people are knocked back a few steps from the force of 
               the collision.

                                     HITCHHIKER
                         Whoa!  Excuse me!  Miss, are you 
                         alright?

               Thelma nods her head "yes," but tears continue.  Her crying 
               is silent.

                                     HITCHHIKER
                         Is there anything I can do?

               Thelma shakes her head "no." She tries to control her tears.  
               She notices how blue his eyes are.

                                     THELMA
                         No.  Thanks.  Sorry.

               THELMA

               collects herself as she walks back to the car.  She gets in 
               and is drying her eyes, looking in the side mirror.  In the 
               mirror she sees the Hitchhiker come back around from the 
               side of the building.  He is several feet behind the car, 
               and she watches him as he removes his long-sleeved shirt and 
               stuffs it into his duffel bag.  Now he is just in T-shirt 
               and jeans.  He looks good.  Really good.  She watches in the 
               mirror as he picks up his stuff and heads towards the road.  
               She can see him as he's walking.  He stops.  He's thinking.  
               He heads over to the car.

                                     HITCHHIKER
                         Would you mind me asking which 
                         direction you and your friend are 
                         going?  I'm trying to get back to 
                         school and my ride fell through, so 
                         I'm kinda stuck.  Are you going my 
                         way?

               Thelma doesn't know what to do.

                                     THELMA
                         Umm.  I think we're going to Oklahoma 
                         City.  But I'm not sure.

                                     HITCHHIKER
                         Do you think you could... I mean, I 
                         could help pay for gas.

               Thelma knows Louise isn't going to like this.

                                     THELMA
                         Ummm.  Well, see, it's not really up 
                         to me.  It's not my car.  Umm, we'll 
                         have to ask my friend, but she'll 
                         probably say no.  She's a little 
                         uptight.

                                     HITCHHIKER
                         Well.  Maybe we better not ask her.  
                         But thank you anyway.

               Now she wants him to come.  He starts to walk away from the 
               car.

                                     THELMA
                         Well, we can ask her.  That won't 
                         hurt.

               Just then Louise comes out of the store.  She sees Thelma 
               talking to this guy and, for one moment, stops dead in her 
               tracks as she takes this in, then continues toward the car.  
               Although her face is basically expressionless, we see that 
               it's possible she might kill Thelma.

                                     THELMA
                         Louise, this young man is on his way 
                         back to school and needs a ride, and 
                         I thought since...

                                     LOUISE
                         It's probably not a good idea.

                                     THELMA
                         Louise.

               The Hitchhiker just nods and starts walking towards the road.

                                     HITCHHIKER
                         Y'all have a nice day.  Drive safe.

               The guy does seem really nice and Thelma is really frustrated 
               that Louise wouldn't give him a ride, but decides not to 
               confront her.

                                     THELMA
                         See how polite he is?  He was really 
                         nice.

               Louise lowers the top and backs the car out.  They watch him 
               walk away.

               Louise pulls out of the parking lot onto the road.  They 
               pass the Hitchhiker.  Thelma waves.

                                     HITCHHIKER
                              (to Thelma)
                         You cheer up now!

               She turns around in the seat to continue waving.  He smiles 
               and waves.  They drive down the road.  TIGHT SHOT of the 
               Hitchhiker as the smile fades from his face.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         us.

                         What did Darryl say?

                                     THELMA
                              (sarcastically)
                         He said "Okay, Thelma.  I just wanted 
                         to know you were alright.  I hope 
                         you're havin' a good time.  You sure 
                         deserve one after puttin' up with me 
                         all the time.  I love you, honey."

               Louise doesn't say anything.

               Names are scrolling by as Hal stares blankly at the screen.  
               We see the name LOUISE ELIZABETH SAWYER scroll past.  It 
               means nothing to Hal.

               It's twenty minutes later.  They are clear of the town.  
               Thelma is like a dog with a bone.  She just won't let it 
               drop.

                                     THELMA
                         I just don't see what it would hurt 
                         just to give somebody a ride.  Did 
                         you see his butt?  Darryl doesn't 
                         have a cute butt.  You could park a 
                         car in the shadow of his ass.

                                     LOUISE
                         I'm sorry.  I'm just not in the mood 
                         for company right now.  Here.  Take 
                         this map.  I need you to find all 
                         the secondary roads to Mexico from 
                         Oklahoma City.  I think we should 
                         stay off the interstates.  We're too 
                         conspicuous.

                                     THELMA
                              (taking map)
                         Well, it looks like we can get on 
                         this road 81 that heads down towards 
                         Dallas, then cut over to...

                                     LOUISE
                              (interrupting)
                         I don't want to go that way.  Find a 
                         way that we don't have to go through 
                         Texas.

                                     THELMA
                              (looking at map)
                         Wait.  What?  You want to go to Mexico 
                         from Oklahoma and you don't want to 
                         go through Texas?

                                     LOUISE
                         You know how I feel about Texas...  
                         We're not going that way.

                                     THELMA
                         I know, Louise, but we're running 
                         for our lives!  Don't you think you 
                         could make an exception just this 
                         once?!  I mean, look at the map.  
                         The only thing between Oklahoma and 
                         Mexico is Texas!

                                     LOUISE
                         Thelma!  I'm not gonna talk about 
                         this!  Now find another way or give 
                         me the goddamn map and I will!  You 
                         understand?

                                     THELMA
                         No, Louise.  How come you never said 
                         what happened?

               Louise is completely unreasonable on this subject and Thelma 
               is totally puzzled by Louise's reaction but is reluctant to 
               press her further.

                                     LOUISE
                         I... I just... I just don't think 
                         it's the place I wanna get caught 
                         for doin' something like... if you 
                         blow a guy's head off with his pants 
                         down, believe me, Texas is the last 
                         place you wanna get caught!  Trust 
                         me!  Now, I said, I don't wanna talk 
                         about it!!

               Louise looks very shaken up.  She keeps her eyes on the road 
               but she's holding the steering wheel so tightly, her knuckles 
               are white.  She does not look at Thelma.  Suddenly she reaches 
               over and locks her door.  Thelma flinches imperceptibly at 
               this gesture.

                                     THELMA
                         Okay.  We'll go around Texas to get 
                         to Mexico.  This is crazy.

               EXT.  ROAD - FARMLAND - DAY

               Two Harley-Davidson bikes tool past, driven by a couple of 
               ex-hippies from the 60's.  The Hitchhiker is on the back of 
               one, and he waves to them as they go by.  Thelma waves back 
               enthusiastically.

                                     THELMA
                         I'll tell you what.  He is gooood 
                         lookin'.

               Louise pops a TAPE into the cassette player.

               EXT.  LOUISE'S APARTMENT COMPLEX - DAY

               Hal walks up the sidewalk past a couple of elderly people 
               sitting outside, to the door of an apartment complex and 
               knocks.

               INT.  LOUISE'S APARTMENT - DAY

               VARIOUS SHOTS of Louise's empty apartment.

               There are pictures of Louise and Thelma in high school.

               The kitchen is spotless and nothing is out on the counters.

               HER BED

               is unwrinkled, perfect, and next to it on her nightstand is 
               a picture of Jimmy and her in a small heart shaped frame.

               Everything is extremely neat and orderly.

               EXT.  LOUISE'S APARTMENT COMPLEX - DAY

               Hal is walking back down the sidewalk past the old people.

               He stops, turns around and goes back to them.  We see him 
               stand and talk to them.

               OVER MUSIC:

               INT.  CAR - DAY

               Thelma and Louise are singing along with the MUSIC.

                                     THELMA/LOUISE
                              (pointing)
                         Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

               EXT.  CROSSROADS - DAY

               Hitchhiker standing on the side of the road.  Thelma looks 
               at Louise pleadingly.  Louise's car pulls over and he hops 
               in the back seat.  An animated Thelma turns around backwards 
               in the front seat to face him.

               INT./ EXT.  COFFEE SHOP - DAY

               Hal walks into the coffee shop where Louise works.  VARIOUS 
               SHOTS of him talking to other employees.  Albert, waitress, 
               etc.  Some cover their mouths as they recognize police 
               sketches of Louise and Thelma.  The Day Manager comes over, 
               looks at the pictures and talks to Hal.

               INT.  CAR

               Thelma passing out beef jerky and Wild Turkey to Hitchhiker 
               and Louise.

               EXT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - DAY

               Hal's unmarked detective car pulls up in front of Thelma's 
               house.  A Corvette, completely customized with everything, 
               sits in the driveway.

               INT.  CAR

               Hitchhiker leans over resting his chin on the back of the 
               front seat.

                                     THELMA
                         So J.D., what are you studying in 
                         school?

                                     J.D.
                         Human nature.  I'm majoring in 
                         behavioral science.

                                     LOUISE
                         And whaddya wanna be when ya grow 
                         up?

                                     J.D.
                         A waiter.

               Louise laughs.  He has charmed her too.

               EXT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - DAY

               Hal is walking up the sidewalk as the front door flies open 
               to reveal a drunk Darryl in Hawaiian shorts, necklaces and a 
               beer can in his hand.

               INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - DAY

               Hal and Darryl in den.  The TV DRONES in the b.g.

               Pictures and papers are on the table.  TIGHT SHOT of Darryl's 
               face.

                                     DARRYL
                         What?!

                                                                    CUT TO:

                                     DARRYL
                         What?!!

               EXT.  RURAL HIGHWAY - DAY

                                     J.D.
                              (to Thelma)
                         So how come you don't have any kids?

                                     THELMA
                         Darryl, that's my husband, he says 
                         he's not ready.  He's still too much 
                         of a kid himself.  He prides himself 
                         on being infantile.

                                     LOUISE
                         He's got a lot to be proud of.

                                     THELMA
                         Louise and Darryl don't get along.

                                     LOUISE
                         That's puttin' it mildly.

                                     THELMA
                         She thinks he's a pig.

                                     LOUISE
                         He's a real piece o' work.  I wish 
                         you could meet him.

                                     J.D.
                         Did you get married real young?

                                     THELMA
                         Twenty-four isn't young.  I'd already 
                         been goin' out with him ten years 
                         when we got married.  I've never 
                         been with anybody but Darryl.

                                     J.D.
                         Well, if you don't mind me sayin' 
                         so, he sounds like a real asshole.

                                     THELMA
                         It's okay.  He is an asshole.  Most 
                         of the time I just let it slide.

               J.D. is looking down the road, way off in the distance.

                                     J.D.
                         Better slow down.  That's a cop.

               Louise looks down the road and sees a highway patrol car 
               coming down the road towards them.  She does not look alarmed 
               but veers off the road into a "rest area" drive that has 
               trees and shrubs that obscure the view from the road.

               She glides along as the cop car passes on the other side 
               without seeing them.

               Louise glides right back onto the road as if nothing unusual 
               has happened at all.  They realize they have not been spotted.  
               J.D. and Louise look at each other.

                                     J.D.
                         Maybe you got a few too many parking 
                         tickets?

                                     LOUISE
                         We'll take you on to Oklahoma City, 
                         then you'd best be on your way.

               INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - DAY

               Hal is on the phone to the FBI man.  Darryl is sitting on a 
               chair looking dazed.  Other law enforcement types roam around 
               the house.

                                     HAL
                         The prints on the trunk of the car 
                         match those of Thelma Dickinson.

               INT.  FBI OFFICE - DAY

               MAX STRATTON, an FBI MAN in his early forties, is looking at 
               the ident-a-kit drawings of Louise and Thelma.

                                     MAX
                         Well I'll be damned.  Isn't that 
                         strange.

               INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - DAY

                                     HAL
                         And the husband says a gun is missing.  
                         She took a lot of stuff.  It looks 
                         like she maybe planned on being gone 
                         a while.  The strange thing is, her 
                         husband said she would never touch 
                         that gun.  He got it for her 'cause 
                         he's out late a lot, but he said 
                         she'd never touch it, wouldn't learn 
                         to shoot it, just left it in a drawer 
                         for years.

                         way to some guy's cabin and they 
                         never showed up.  We're lookin'.  We 
                         hope you're lookin' too.

               EXT.  FLATLANDS - ROAD - DUSK

               The T-Bird barrels down the road at high speed.

               EXT.  SHAW'S SIESTA MOTEL - DUSK

               Louise, Thelma, and J.D. pull into the motel parking lot.

                                     LOUISE
                         I just gotta run in for a minute.

               Louise looks at J.D. in the back seat and takes the keys out 
               of the ignition.

                                     LOUISE
                         You two better go on and say your 
                         goodbyes.

               Louise gets out of the car and goes inside.

               INT.  MOTEL OFFICE - NIGHT

               An older WOMAN behind the counter is looking at a computer 
               screen.

                                     LOUISE
                         Louise Elizabeth Sawyer.  Are you 
                         sure?

                         all.

               Louise turns and sees Thelma crawl over into the back seat 
               with J.D.

                                     LOUISE
                         Nothing under peaches?  Check again 
                         under peaches.

                         Naw, nothin' under peaches neither.

               A MAN comes up behind Louise and stands close behind her.

                                     MAN (JIMMY)
                         Did you say Peaches?!  Why that's 
                         the secret word!  Show her what she's 
                         won, Don.

               He drops an envelope in front of her.  Louise is startled 
               and turns around quickly.

                                     JIMMY
                         Hey, peaches.

                                     LOUISE
                         Oh my God!  Jimmy!  You... Oh my 
                         God!  What are you doin' here?

                                     JIMMY
                              (to Woman)
                         Can we get another room?  Just put 
                         it on my credit card.

               The Woman hands them a key.

                                     WOMAN
                         'Round to the back.

               EXT.  MOTEL PARKING LOT - NIGHT

               Louise and Jimmy walk outside and catch Thelma sitting very 
               close to J.D.  Thelma sees Jimmy and is so startled she 
               screams and involuntarily slams herself across the back seat 
               to the other side of the car.  She tries to look nonchalant.

                                     THELMA
                         Jimmy!  Hello, stranger.  What in 
                         the world are you doin' here?

                                     JIMMY
                         Ask me no questions, I'll tell you 
                         no lies.

                                     THELMA
                         Good answer.  Same goes double for 
                         me.

                                     JIMMY
                         Who's your friend?

               J.D. is climbing out of the car, looking very uncomfortable.

                                     THELMA
                         This is J.D.  He's a student.  We're 
                         just givin' him a ride to... to here.  
                         Louise said we could bring him here 
                         and then he'd have to go.  And that's 
                         what he's doin'.  He's goin'.  Aren't 
                         you, J.D.?

                                     J.D.
                         Yup.  Thanks for the ride.  You all 
                         take care.

               He quickly turns and walks away toward the road.

                                     THELMA
                              (watching him)
                         Yup.  That's him goin'.  I love to 
                         watch him go.

                                     LOUISE
                              (to Jimmy)
                         Thelma kinda took to him.

               Jimmy is smiling.

                                     JIMMY
                              (to Thelma)
                         Well, come on, gal, I got you a room.  
                         You can go on in and take a nice 
                         cold shower.

                                     THELMA
                         Don't mind me, Jimmy, I'm just a 
                         wild woman.

                                     JIMMY
                         I always knew that.

                                     THELMA
                         A regular outlaw.

               Louise shoots Thelma a look.  The three of them drive around 
               to the back of the motel.  Thelma turns and looks at the 
               road.  J.D. is standing there.  He blows her a kiss.

               EXT.  MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               They stop in front of the motel rooms and the three of them 
               climb out of the car.

                                     LOUISE
                         Let me just go in and freshen up for 
                         a minute.  I need to wash my face, 
                         you know.

               Thelma is taking their luggage out of the trunk.

                                     JIMMY
                         Okay, honey.  I don't want to rush 
                         you.  I just wanna talk to you and...
                              (whispering)
                         ...be alone with you.  I'll just be 
                         in my room, 115, you just come on 
                         down when you're ready.

               Jimmy helps carry the luggage to Thelma's room.  He stops at 
               the door.

                                     JIMMY
                         I'll be waiting.

               Louise smiles at him quizzically as if she can't believe 
               he's acting this way.  He turns on his heel and slinks away.

                                     THELMA
                         I don't care what you say about him.  
                         The boy has got it bad.

                                     LOUISE
                         He's always got it bad as long as 
                         I'm running in the other direction.  
                         Don't be fooled, he's no different 
                         than any other guy.  He knows how to 
                         chase and that's it.  Once he's caught 
                         you, he don't know what to do.  So 
                         he runs away.

                                     THELMA
                         I heard that.

               INT.  MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               They close the door to their room.  Louise sets the envelope 
               of money on the table.

                                     LOUISE
                              (indicating envelope)
                         Our future.

               Louise gets her purse and starts taking out her makeup.

               She stands very close to the mirror.  She is putting on lip 
               liner.  Thelma is watching.

                                     THELMA
                         So what are you gonna tell him?

                                     LOUISE
                         Nothing.  I'm not gonna tell him a 
                         thing.  The least I can do is not 
                         make him an accessory any more than 
                         he already is.

                                     THELMA
                         You are so sweet to that guy, you 
                         really are.  Imagine not wanting to 
                         drag him into this.  He is a lucky 
                         man.

               Louise is still putting on her makeup, making sure it's 
               perfect.

                                     LOUISE
                         I didn't ask him to come!  It's like 
                         I said, Thelma, he just loves the 
                         chase.

                                     THELMA
                         Well boy, he's got his work cut out 
                         for him now, don't he?

                                     LOUISE
                         Put a lid on it, Thelma!  It's hard 
                         enough as it is.  Just let me get 
                         this part over with.  Now stay here 
                         and guard the money.  If there's any 
                         problem I'm in room 115.

                                     THELMA
                         I won't wait up.

               Louise turns to face Thelma.

                                     LOUISE
                         How do I look?

                                     THELMA
                         You're a vision, Louise, a goddamn 
                         vision of loveliness, you always 
                         are.

                                     LOUISE
                         Have another drink, Thelma.

               Louise walks out the door.

                                     THELMA
                         Good idea.

               EXT.  MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               It's raining out.  Louise goes to Jimmy's room.

               Louise knocks on the door to room 115.  The door opens 
               slightly and one red rose pops out.

                                     LOUISE
                         Hello...

                                     JIMMY
                              (in a falsetto voice)
                         Who is it?

                                     LOUISE
                         It's me.

               The following eleven roses are held out the door, then Louise 
               is yanked inside and we hear her shriek with LAUGHTER.

               INT.  THELMA'S MOTEL ROOM - EVENING

               Thelma has taken a shower and is dressed in cut-offs and a T-
               shirt.  Her hair is still damp but she looks better than she 
               did when she arrived.  Thelma is fixing a drink of Wild Turkey 
               and Diet 7-Up in one of the motel room glasses.  There is a 
               KNOCK on the door.  She stops what she is doing and is 
               completely still.

                                     THELMA
                         Louise?

               Another KNOCK.

                                     THELMA
                         Louise, is that you?

                                     J.D. (O.S.)
                              (through the door)
                         Thelma?  It's me.

               Thelma opens the door and there stands J.D., soaking wet 
               from the rain pouring down behind him.

                                     J.D.
                         I just thought I... I know I'm 
                         supposed to be gone, but...

               He's kind of looking over towards the road.  He's still 
               slightly shy.

                                     J.D.
                         I'm not havin' much luck gettin' a 
                         ride.

               He notices looking past her into the room that Louise isn't 
               there.  Thelma just stands there looking at him.

                                     J.D.
                         Well, I guess I'd better...

                                     THELMA
                         Wait...!  Um, where ya going?

                                     J.D.
                         I don't know.  Nowhere.  What are 
                         you doin'?

                                     THELMA
                         I don't know.  Nothin'.  Took a 
                         shower.

                                     J.D.
                         That sounds nice.

                                     THELMA
                         Well, you wanna use the shower?

               You can tell he does want to but doesn't want to say so.

               So instead he just kind of stands there with a reticent grin 
               on his face.

                                     J.D.
                         Oh.  I... where's Louise?

                                     THELMA
                         She's off with Jimmy, that's her 
                         boyfriend.

                                     J.D.
                         That's lonely for you, I guess.  I 
                         always think of motel rooms as lonely.

               Thelma pretends like she's had a lot of experience with this 
               sort of thing.

                                     THELMA
                              (letting him in the 
                              door)
                         Oh, yes, well, they can be.

               INT.  JIMMY'S ROOM - NIGHT

               Jimmy is pouring champagne into Louise's glass.  There are a 
               dozen roses in a vase on the table.  He pours for himself as 
               he sits as close to Louise as possible.

                                     JIMMY
                         Now, my little coconut, what seems 
                         to be the trouble here?  Tell Daddy 
                         everything.

                                     LOUISE
                              (cringing)
                         Jimmy, my daddy's still alive and it 
                         kind of gives me the creeps when you 
                         do that...

                                     JIMMY
                         Okay, okay, just tell me what's the 
                         trouble.

               Louise just looks at him for a minute.

                                     LOUISE
                         Jimmy, I'm not gonna tell ya what 
                         the trouble is.  Someday soon you'll 
                         understand why I can't.  But I won't 
                         tell ya, so don't ask me.

               Jimmy is once again shocked by how serious she is.

                                     JIMMY
                              (almost at a loss for 
                              words)
                         Okay, peaches, okay.  But can I ask 
                         you one thing?

                                     LOUISE
                         Maybe.

                                     JIMMY
                         Does it have something to do with 
                         another guy?  Are you in love with 
                         him?

                                     LOUISE
                         It's nothin' like that.

                                     JIMMY
                              (exploding)
                         Then what?!  What, goddamnit, Louise!  
                         Where the fuck are you going?  Are 
                         you just leaving for fucking ever?  
                         What, did you fuckin' murder somebody 
                         or what?!

               Louise spills her champagne.

                                     LOUISE
                         Stop it!  Stop it, Jimmy, or I'll 
                         leave right now.  I'm not kiddin'!

                                     JIMMY
                              (calming down)
                         Alright, alright.  I'm sorry.

               They both take a second to regain their composure.

                                     JIMMY
                         Can I just ask you one other thing?

                                     LOUISE
                         Maybe.

               Jimmy pulls a little black box out of his pocket.

                                     JIMMY
                         Will you wear this?

               He hands Louise the box.  She opens it and it is a diamond 
               ring.  Louise is flabbergasted.

                                     JIMMY
                         Will you at least see how it fits?

                                     LOUISE
                         Jimmy... it's beautiful!

                                     JIMMY
                         You didn't see that one comin', did 
                         ya?

               INT.  THELMA'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               J.D. is out of the shower standing in front of the mirror 
               wearing only his jeans, the top button of which is still 
               undone and no shirt.  He has an incredible physique.  He 
               also has a tattoo on his shoulder of the homemade variety.  
               Thelma has gone and bought cheese crackers and peanuts from 
               a vending machine and is into her second Wild Turkey and 7-
               Up.  She sits on the bed, watching him in the mirror.  He 
               definitely looks better with his shirt off.

               She suddenly feels awkward and stands up.

                                     THELMA
                         You wanna drink?

               INT.  JIMMY'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Louise has the engagement ring on her finger.  It's really 
               beautiful.

                                     JIMMY
                         So whaddya think.  I mean... I 
                         could... uh... get a job.  Of some 
                         kind.  I mean you've been tellin' me 
                         that for years, right?

                                     LOUISE
                         Why now, Jimmy?

                                     JIMMY
                              (this is hard for him)
                         'Cause, Louise.  I don't want to 
                         lose you.  And for some reason I get 
                         the feelin' you're about to split.  
                         Permanently.

               Louise doesn't know how to respond.  She struggles for a 
               reply.

                                     LOUISE
                         Jimmy, we've gone all these years... 
                         we never made it work.  We're not 
                         gonna be able to just... I'm not...  
                         What kind of job, honey?  Can you 
                         see it.  I can't.

               Jimmy doesn't answer right away.  He's trying to see it.

                                     JIMMY
                         I'm the one... I never made it work.  
                         I just... It's not that I don't love 
                         you.  It's not that.  I just never 
                         thought I'd be thirty-six years old 
                         and I never thought... I don't know 
                         what I thought.  What do you want, 
                         darlin'.  What do you want me to do.

                                     LOUISE
                         I don't know.  It doesn't even matter 
                         anymore.  I just want you to be 
                         happy... It's not that I don't love 
                         you either.  But Jimmy, your timing 
                         couldn't be worse.

               Jimmy does not really understand why this is happening.

                                     JIMMY
                         Are you just doin' this to punish 
                         me?

                                     LOUISE
                         Believe me, the last thing I want is 
                         for you to get punished.

               INT.  THELMA'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Thelma has poured a drink for J.D. who's sitting on the edge 
               of the bed.  She walks over and hands it to him and as she 
               does, he takes the drink with one hand and her hand with the 
               other.  He sets the drink down on the nightstand and holds 
               her hand with both of his.  He closely studies her wedding 
               ring.  He suddenly looks up at her and gazes at her just as 
               intently.  He slowly shakes his head as he removes her ring 
               as if to say, "This is not right for you.  This isn't going 
               to work."  He looks at the ring as he moves it through space 
               finally stopping when the ring is directly over his drink.  
               He drops it in.  He looks back at Thelma and smiles as if to 
               say, "There.  Now don't you feel better?"  He smartly kisses 
               her hand.

               INT.  JIMMY'S ROOM - NIGHT

               Louise and Jimmy are sitting on the edge of the bed.

               Jimmy has put the ring on her finger and they both are looking 
               at it, as Jimmy holds her hand in his.  They both ponder it.

                                     JIMMY
                         It does look good.

               INT.  THELMA'S ROOM - NIGHT

               J.D. is standing on the dresser with a towel tied around his 
               neck like a cape.

                                     J.D.
                         Faster than a speeding green T-Bird, 
                         able to leap tall babes in a single 
                         bound...

               He leaps from the dresser and flies across the room landing 
               on the bed, straddling Thelma.

                                     J.D.
                              (in his deep man's 
                              voice)
                         Hi.  Could I interest you in some 
                         Fuller brushes?

               Thelma has not stopped laughing since he came in the room.

               He is the greatest guy she's ever seen.  He is sniffing her 
               neck like a dog.

                                     THELMA
                              (giggling)
                         Stop, stop, stop!

               Thelma tries to catch her breath.

                                     THELMA
                         Who are you?

               J.D. attacks her again.

                                     J.D.
                         I am the great and powerful Oz...

                                     THELMA
                         J.D.!  Just tell me.  I know you're 
                         not some schoolboy.  Now come on, 
                         nobody ever tells me shit.

                                     J.D.
                         I'm just some guy.  A guy whose parole 
                         officer is probably having a shit 
                         fit right about now.

               Thelma gasps.

                                     THELMA
                         What?!  Parole officer?  You mean 
                         you're a criminal?

                                     J.D.
                         Well, not anymore, Thelma, except 
                         for bustin' parole, I haven't done 
                         one wrong thing.

                                     THELMA
                         What did ya do?

                                     J.D.
                         I'm a robber.

                                     THELMA
                         You're a bank robber?

                                     J.D.
                         Nope.  I've never robbed a bank.

                                     THELMA
                         What?

                                     J.D.
                         Well, I robbed a gas station once, 
                         and I robbed a couple of liquor 
                         stores, and some convenience stores.  
                         And that's it.

                                     THELMA
                         How?

                                     J.D.
                         Well, I was just down on my luck and 
                         it seemed like somethin' I was good 
                         at so I...

                                     THELMA
                              (interrupting)
                         No, I mean how would you do it?  Do 
                         you just sneak in real fast or hide 
                         out till the store closes or what?

                                     J.D.
                         Naw, honey, that would be burglary.  
                         I never got arrested for burglary.  
                         Burglary's for chicken shits.  If 
                         you're gonna rob someone, ya just 
                         have to go right on up to 'em and do 
                         it.  Just take the money.  That's 
                         robbery.  That's a whole 'nother 
                         deal.

                                     THELMA
                         Tell me.

                                     J.D.
                         Well, first you pick your place, 
                         see, then I'd just sit back and watch 
                         it for awhile.  Ya gotta wait for 
                         just the right moment, which is 
                         something you know instinctively, 
                         that can't be taught.  Then I'd waltz 
                         on in...

               J.D. jumps up and picks up a hair dryer and holds it like a 
               gun.  He starts acting it out.

                                     J.D.
                         And I'd say, "Alright, ladies and 
                         gentlemen, let's see who'll win the 
                         prize for keepin' their cool.  Simon 
                         says everybody lie down on the floor.  
                         If nobody loses their head, then 
                         nobody loses their head.  You sir... 
                         You do the honors.  Just empty that 
                         cash into this bag and you'll have 
                         an amazing story to tell all your 
                         friends.  If not, you'll have a tag 
                         on your toe.  You decide." Then I'd 
                         split.  Simple.

                                     THELMA
                         My gosh, you sure gentlemanly about 
                         it.

                                     J.D.
                         I've always believed if done right, 
                         armed robbery doesn't have to be a 
                         totally unpleasant experience.

                                     THELMA
                         God.  You're a real live outlaw!

                                     J.D.
                         I may be the outlaw, but you're the 
                         one stealin' my heart.

                                     THELMA
                         And smooth, boy, you are smooth.

               They kiss passionately.

                                     THELMA
                         You're kinda the best thing that's 
                         happened to me in a long time.

                                     J.D.
                         You're a little angle, you are.

               J.D. turns out the light.

               INT.  JIMMY'S ROOM - NIGHT

               Louise and Jimmy are wrapped in each other's arms, quietly 
               making love.  Through this, Jimmy is ardent.

                                     JIMMY
                         Louise?  I think you are so damn 
                         beautiful.  I mean that.  I always 
                         have.

               She smiles.  Completely.

                                     LOUISE
                              (whispering)
                         I think you're beautiful too.

               EXT.  SIESTA MOTEL - DAWN

               MONTAGE of early morning staff, a truck driver climbing into 
               his cab with a silver thermos, squirrels hopping around on 
               the ground.

               INT.  SIESTA COFFEE SHOP - DAWN

               TIGHT SHOT of coffee beginning to drip into an empty coffee 
               pot.  Louise and Jimmy are sitting in a booth, both on the 
               same side.  They are both playing with their wedding rings.

                                     JIMMY
                         Don't worry darlin'.  I'll say I 
                         never found you.  I'll say anything 
                         you want.  We'll find a way to get 
                         you out of this, whatever it is.

                                     LOUISE
                         Damn, Jimmy, did you take a pill 
                         that makes you say all the right 
                         stuff?

                                     JIMMY
                         I'm choking on it.

               They sit for a minute.

                                     JIMMY
                         Honey?  Ummm... Do you want me to 
                         come with you?

               They look at each other, into each other and Jimmy can see 
               that Louise is already gone.  Louise is really touched that 
               he asked her that but she knows it's impossible.  She is 
               very kind to him.

                                     LOUISE
                         Oh... now... it's probably not such 
                         a good idea right now.  I'll... catch 
                         up with you later, on down the road.

               In her hand she's been holding the ring in the black box.  
               She puts it on the table and slides it back to him.  He stops 
               her, suddenly.  He covers her hand with his.

                                     JIMMY
                         You keep this!

               Jimmy is trying not to seem upset, so he's completely still.  
               A taxi pulls up outside.

                                     LOUISE
                         Your taxi's here.

               Jimmy pulls her to him and kisses her so passionately that 
               employees in the coffee shop look away.  A cook fans himself 
               with a spatula.  The taxi driver, who can see in, looks at 
               his watch.

                                     JIMMY
                         Are you happy, Louise?  I just want 
                         you to be happy.

               Louise looks at her hand and Jimmy's hand.

                                     LOUISE
                         I'm happy, sweetie.  Happy as I can 
                         be.

               Jimmy gets up and leaves the coffee shop.  Louise watches 
               him go.  A WAITRESS comes over and fills her coffee cup.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Good thing he left when he did.  We 
                         thought we were gonna have to put 
                         out a fire.

               The Waitress chuckles and the other waitresses do too.  Louise 
               waves to Jimmy in the back of the cab.  The cab driver winks 
               at her.  She smiles to herself.

               INT.  THELMA'S MOTEL ROOM - MORNING

               The room is totally trashed.  J.D. and Thelma are both asleep, 
               naked and hanging off either side of the bed.

               J.D. starts to stir...

               INT.  HAL'S BEDROOM - MORNING

               Hal is in bed with is WIFE.  He has to get up.  He is holding 
               his wife in his arms.

                                     HAL
                         Honey?

                                     SARAH
                         Yes, baby?

                                     HAL
                         Do you think you could ever shoot 
                         someone?

                                     SARAH
                         What?

                                     HAL
                         Do you think you could ever think of 
                         a set of circumstances that would 
                         just cause you to haul off and shoot 
                         someone?

                                     SARAH
                         I could shoot your cousin Eddie.

                                     HAL
                         Why?

                                     SARAH
                         Because he's an inconsiderate asshole.

                                     HAL
                         I'm asking you seriously, Sarah, a 
                         stranger?

                                     SARAH
                         I don't know, honey.  I guess it 
                         would depend.

                                     HAL
                         On what?

                                     SARAH
                              (trying to picture it)
                         Well, maybe if they were trying to 
                         hurt you or one of the kids.  I'm 
                         sure I could shoot someone if they 
                         tried to hurt one of the children.

                                     HAL
                         Yeah, I could too.  But... I don't 
                         know why I'm even asking you this.  
                         It's just... we can't place anybody 
                         at the scene but these two gals that 
                         everybody swears is sweet as pie.  I 
                         don't know.  I keep hearing words -- 
                         impossible -- inconceivable.  If 
                         just one person would say...

                                     SARAH
                         Honey.  Nothing's impossible.  You 
                         just don't shoot someone like that 
                         for no reason.  Maybe he was askin' 
                         for it.  Anyway, somebody's husband 
                         probably got ol' Harlan.

                                     HAL
                         That's what everybody says.  Only 
                         problem is nobody's husband was 
                         unaccounted for that night... Could 
                         you shoot Eddie in the face?  At 
                         point blank range?

                                     SARAH
                              (thinking)
                         In the leg.

                                     HAL
                              (getting up)
                         I gotta go to Little Rock.

               INT.  COFFEE SHOP - MORNING

               Louise is sitting in the booth by herself.  Thelma comes 
               hurrying by.  She looks disheveled but is grinning like an 
               idiot.  She sees Louise and charges into the coffee shop.

               Her energy and volume is several notches higher than the 
               rest of the people in the coffee shop.  There are a couple 
               more customers in there now.  Thelma slides into the booth 
               seated directly across from Louise.

                                     THELMA
                         Hi.

               She is shocked by Thelma's appearance.

                                     LOUISE
                         What happened to your hair?

                                     THELMA
                         Nothing.  It got messed up.

               Louise is studying Thelma closely as Thelma squirms in her 
               seat, barely able to contain herself.

                                     LOUISE
                         What's wrong with you?

                                     THELMA
                         Nothing.  Why?  Do I seem different?

                                     LOUISE
                         Yes, now that you mention it.  You 
                         seem crazy.  Like you're on drugs.

                                     THELMA
                         Well, I'm not on drugs.  But I might 
                         be crazy.

                                     LOUISE
                              (shaking her head)
                         I don't think I wanna hear what you're 
                         gonna tell me.

               Thelma is just about to shriek when the Waitress comes over 
               and puts a coffee cup on the table and pours some.

               Thelma gets a grip on herself for a moment then loses it as 
               the Waitress goes away.

                                     THELMA
                         Oh my God, Louise!!!  I can't believe 
                         it!  I just really can't believe it!  
                         I mean... whoa!

               Thelma is just laughing hysterically.  Louise suddenly 
               understands.

                                     LOUISE
                         Oh, Thelma.  Oh, no.

                                     THELMA
                         I mean I finally understand what all 
                         the fuss is about.   This is just a 
                         whole 'nother ball game!

                                     LOUISE
                         Thelma, please get a hold of yourself.  
                         You're making a spectacle.

                                     THELMA
                         You know, Louise, you're supposed to 
                         be my best friend.  You could at 
                         least be a little bit happy for me.  
                         You could at least pretend to be 
                         slightly happy that for once in my 
                         life I have a sexual experience that 
                         isn't completely disgusting.

                                     LOUISE
                         I'm sorry.  I am happy.  I'm very 
                         happy for you.  I'm glad you had a 
                         good time.  It's about time.  Where 
                         is he now?

                                     THELMA
                         Taking a shower.

                                     LOUISE
                         You left that guy alone in the room?

               Louise is getting a bad feeling.  She is already standing up 
               putting money on the table.

                                     LOUISE
                         Where's the money, Thelma?

               Thelma has forgotten all about the money.

                                     THELMA
                         Ummm... it's on the table.  It's 
                         okay.

               They are both leaving the restaurant now.  As they hit the 
               door they both break into a full run.

                                     THELMA
                         I don't remember.

               EXT.  MOTEL PARKING LOT - DAY

               They run across the parking lot around the back to the room.  
               The door is ajar and no one is in the room.  Louise goes in 
               and Thelma stays outside the door.

                                     THELMA
                         Goddamnit!  I've never been lucky!  
                         Not one time!

               Louise comes back outside.  She doesn't say anything.  She 
               is stoic, fighting tears.

                                     THELMA
                         Shit.  That little sonofabitch burgled 
                         me.  I don't believe it.

               Louise sits down on the sidewalk in front of the room.  Thelma 
               comes and sits beside her.  Neither one says anything for a 
               moment.

                                     THELMA
                         Louise?  Are you okay?

               Louise shakes her head no.

                                     THELMA
                         Louise... It's okay.  Louise?  I'm 
                         sorry.  I mean it.

               Louise has seen the end of the tunnel and there is no light.

                                     LOUISE
                         It's not okay, Thelma.  It's 
                         definitely not okay.  None of this 
                         is okay.  What are we going to do 
                         for money?  What are we gonna buy 
                         gas with?  Our good looks?  I mean... 
                         Goddamn, Thelma!

               Louise quietly starts to fall apart.  This causes Thelma to 
               leap into action.

                                     THELMA
                         Come on.  Stand up!  Don't you worry 
                         about it.  I'll take care of it.  
                         Just don't you worry about it.  Get 
                         your stuff.

               Louise is still sitting on the sidewalk.

                                     THELMA
                         Come on!  Damnit, get your stuff and 
                         let's get out of here!

               Louise slowly gets to her feet.

                                     THELMA
                         Move!
                              (to herself)
                         Jesus Christ, take your damn time.

               Thelma is hauling stuff out of the car.

               EXT.  MOTEL PARKING LOT - MORNING

               TIGHT SHOT of rear wheel of green T-Bird LAYING RUBBER out 
               of the motel parking lot.  Thelma and Louise, both looking a 
               little rougher than we've seen so far, drive away.

               EXT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - DAY

               Hal, FBI Man, various other police and detective types, pull 
               up in front of the house.  The front door swings open and 
               there stands Darryl looking like he's been shot out of a 
               cannon.

               EXT.  STREET - DAY

               Louise and Thelma pull into a convenience store.

               INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - DAY

               Police are tapping the phones, dusting for prints, etc., 
               while Darryl sits motionless in his recliner with a dull 
               expression on his face.

                                     HAL
                              (to Darryl)
                         As you know, we've tapped your phone.  
                         In the event that she calls in.

               Max comes up and joins them as they walk down the hallway.

                                     MAX
                         We're going to leave someone here at 
                         the house in the event that she calls 
                         in.  Someone will be here until we 
                         find them.

                                     HAL
                         The important thing is not to let on 
                         that you know anything.  We want to 
                         try and find out where they are.  
                         Now I don't want to get too personal, 
                         but do you have a good relationship 
                         with your wife?  Are you close with 
                         her?

                                     DARRYL
                         Yeah, I guess.  I mean, I'm about as 
                         close as I can be with a nut case 
                         like that.

                                     MAX
                         Well, if she calls, just be gentle.  
                         Like you're happy to hear from her.  
                         You know, like you really miss her.  
                         Women love that shit.

               EXT.  CONVENIENCE STORE - DAY

               Thelma and Louise are sitting in the car.  They've put all 
               their money together.

                                     LOUISE
                         Eighty-eight dollars ain't gonna 
                         make a dent, baby girl.

                                     THELMA
                              (getting out of the 
                              car)
                         Don't worry about it.  You want 
                         anything?

                                     LOUISE
                         No.

               Thelma marches off to the store.  Louise puts a tape in the 
               deck and is listening to loud R&B MUSIC.  She checks herself 
               in the rearview mirror.  She takes her lipstick out and is 
               about to put it on.  She makes eye contact with herself and, 
               instead, throws it out the window, closes her eyes and leans 
               her head back on the seat.  She's in a world of shit.

               Thelma comes trotting out of the store and jumps into the 
               car.

                                     THELMA
                              (breathless)
                         Drive!

               Louise looks at her.

                                     THELMA
                         Drive!  Drive away!

                                     LOUISE
                              (driving away)
                         What happened?

               Thelma opens her purse and exposes a bag full of bills.

                                     LOUISE
                         What?  You robbed the store?  You 
                         robbed the Goddamn store?!

               Thelma shrieks with excitement.  Louise is completely stunned.

                                     THELMA
                         Well!  We needed the money!  It's 
                         not like I killed anybody, for God's 
                         sake.

               Louise shoots her a look.  She puts the car in gear and FLOORS 
               it out of the parking lot.  She is still looking at Thelma 
               as if she has completely lost her mind.

                                     THELMA
                         I'm sorry.  Well, we need the money.  
                         Now we have it.

                                     LOUISE
                         Oh shit, Thelma!!  Shit!  Shit!  
                         Shit!

                                     THELMA
                              (sternly)
                         Now you get a grip, Louise!  Just 
                         drive us to Goddamn Mexico, will ya!

                                     LOUISE
                         Okay.  Shit, Thelma!  What'd you do?  
                         I mean, what did you say?

                                     THELMA
                         Well, I just...

               INT.  POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

               Hal, Max, various other cops, and Darryl all watch as TV 
               plays back VCR TAPE of Thelma in the convenience store pulling 
               a gun.  In perfect lip sync is:

                                     THELMA (V.O.)
                         Alright, ladies and gentleman, let's 
                         see who'll win the prize for keepin' 
                         their cool.  Everybody lie down on 
                         the floor.  If nobody loses their 
                         head, then nobody loses their head...

               TIGHT SHOT of Darryl's face going deeper and deeper into a 
               state of shock.  TIGHT SHOTS of Hal, Max, etc., all looking 
               intently at the screen.

               VIDEO IMAGE of Thelma boldly ordering cashier to fill her 
               purse with money.  As he's loading the purse with bills, 
               she's taking beef jerky from the display and putting it in 
               there, too, while she points the gun at the cashier.

                                     THELMA (V.O.)
                              (videotape playback)
                         You, sir... You do the honors.  Just 
                         empty that cash into this bag and 
                         you'll have an amazing story to tell 
                         all your friends.  If not, you'll 
                         have a tag on your toe.  You decide.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         Lemme see the map.

               Louise throws the map across the front seat at Thelma and 
               FLOORS it.

                                                              FADE TO BLACK

               FADE IN:

               INT.  JIMMY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

               Jimmy is entering the apartment building, carrying his 
               overnight bag.  Two men are sitting on the stairs.  They 
               stand as he comes in.  They are plainclothes police.  They 
               show their badges.  He leaves with them.

               EXT.  ROAD - TIGHT SHOT - J.D.'S BACKSIDE - DAY

               made only more prominent by the bulging wallet in his back 
               right pocket.

               J.D. is walking down the road and continues to walk as an 
               Oklahoma State Patrol car pulls up alongside him.  He smiles 
               and gives a friendly wave as they cruise along slowly beside 
               him.  We can see the cop nearest him talking, and then we 
               see J.D. stop walking and set down his duffel bag.  He reaches 
               for his wallet.  It's clear that they have asked for some 
               I.D.

               EXT.  RURAL ROAD - DAY

               Louise is driving.  They fly past a kid on his bike on a 
               long gravel driveway.  He watches them.  A huge cloud of 
               dust blows up as they pass him.  He turns and rides his bike 
               down the driveway towards the house.

               INT.  CAR - DAY

                                     THELMA
                         Louise, you'd better slow down.  
                         I'll just die if we get caught over 
                         a speeding ticket.

               Louise looks at the speedometer touching 80 mph and lets her 
               foot off the gas.  Louise is looking a little nervous.

                                     LOUISE
                         For the first time in my life, I 
                         wish this car wasn't green.

                                     THELMA
                         Are you sure we should be driving 
                         like this?  In broad daylight and 
                         everything?

                                     LOUISE
                         No we shouldn't, but I want to put 
                         some distance between us and the 
                         scene of our last Goddamn crime!

                                     THELMA
                         Oooooweee!!  You shoulda seen me!  
                         Like I'd been doin' it all my life!  
                         Nobody would ever believe it.

                                     LOUISE
                         You think you've found your calling?

                                     THELMA
                         Maybe.  Maybe.  The call of the wild!

               Thelma howls like a dog and drinks a little bottle of Wild 
               Turkey.

                                     LOUISE
                         You're disturbed.

                                     THELMA
                         Yes!  I believe I am!

               INT.  POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

               Jimmy is in a small room with Hal, Max, other cops, looking 
               stunned.

                                     JIMMY
                         I swear to God, she wouldn't tell me 
                         one thing!  Christ!  You oughta try 
                         to find that kid that was with 'em.

                                     HAL
                         Tell us about him.

                                     JIMMY
                         Just some young guy.  Around twenty 
                         years old.  Dark hair.

               Jimmy is really upset and has to really struggle to control 
               himself.

                                     JIMMY
                              (trying to remember 
                              him)
                         They said they'd picked him up along 
                         the way.  He was a student.  But he 
                         didn't look right.  But he left when 
                         they got to the motel.

                                     MAX
                         Do you understand that you may be 
                         facing an accessory charge?

                                     HAL
                         This is serious, son.  A man is dead.

                                     JIMMY
                         I know!  I'd tell you if I knew!  
                         Goddamn!  I know something happened, 
                         or she wouldn't have left.  I'm trying 
                         to remember everything!  Find that 
                         fucking kid.  He probably knows 
                         something.

               EXT.  DRIVING SHOT - DAY

               Thelma and Louise are in the car.  Thelma is taking empty 
               little Wild Turkey bottles out of her purse and throwing 
               them out the window.

                                     LOUISE
                         So what's the plan, Thelma?  You 
                         just gonna stay drunk?

                                     THELMA
                         Try to.

                                     LOUISE
                         Litterbug.

               They come ROARING up on a semi-tanker carrying gas.  We see 
               their FISH-EYE REFLECTIONS in the shiny tanker.

               The mud flaps are the shiny silhouettes of naked women that 
               Thelma and Louise saw earlier.  The truck is going slower 
               than they are.

                                     LOUISE
                         Aw, great.  This always happens.  
                         Whenever you're in a hurry.

               She noses out to see if she can pass, but there's a car 
               coming.  The car passes and the truck HONKS.  The truck 
               driver's arm comes out his window and waves them past.

                                     THELMA
                         Isn't that nice?  Truck drivers are 
                         always so nice.  The best drivers on 
                         the road.

               As they get next to the truck, the truck driver is smiling 
               and waving at them.  They smile and wave back.  He flicks 
               his tongue at them.  Louise screams.

                                     THELMA/LOUISE
                         Ugh!!  Gross!!  Oh my God!  Aw, God!

               Louise FLOORS it and speeds past him.

                                     THELMA
                         Ugh!!  Why do they have to do that?

                                     LOUISE
                         They think we like it.  Maybe they 
                         think it turns us on.

               Louise shivers with disgust.

               INT.  POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

               Jimmy is looking at police mug shots of a lot of young guys.  
               Hal shows Jimmy a mug shot of J.D.

                                     HAL
                         Is this the guy you saw them with?

                                     JIMMY
                              (looking closely)
                         It's him.

                                     MAX
                              (clapping his hands)
                         Oh, happy day.

                                     JIMMY
                         You gotta be kiddin' me.  They picked 
                         up a murderer?!

                                     HAL
                         Armed robber.

                                     JIMMY
                         Oh, great.

                                     MAX
                              (to Hal)
                         They're flying him here right now.  
                         He was picked up this morning for 
                         parole violation.  They also found 
                         about six grand on him, so he probably 
                         knocked over something while he was 
                         out there.  They can drop him by 
                         here for questioning.  I'm so happy.

                                     JIMMY
                              (overhearing)
                         How much cash did he have?

                         Thelma.

                                     THELMA
                         Yeah.

                                     LOUISE
                         I want you to call Darryl.

                                     THELMA
                         What for?

                                     LOUISE
                         To find out if he knows anything.  
                         If you think he does, you gotta hang 
                         up because it means the police have 
                         told him and the phone is probably 
                         tapped.

                                     THELMA
                         Jeez, Louise, tapped the phone?  You 
                         think so?

                         robbery, Thelma!

                                     THELMA
                         Murder one!  God, Louise, can't we 
                         even say it was self-defense?

                                     LOUISE
                         But it wasn't!  We got away!  We 
                         were walkin' away!

                                     THELMA
                         They don't know that!  It was just 
                         you and me there.  I'll say he raped 
                         me and you had to shoot him!  I mean, 
                         it's almost the truth!

                                     LOUISE
                         It won't work.

                                     THELMA
                         Why not?!

                                     LOUISE
                         No physical evidence.  We can't prove 
                         he did it.  We probably can't even 
                         prove he touched you by now.

               They both pause for a moment.

                                     THELMA
                         God.  The law is some tricky shit, 
                         isn't it?

               Then:

                                     THELMA
                         How do you know 'bout all this stuff 
                         anyway?

               Louise does not answer the question.

                                     LOUISE
                         Besides, what do we say about the 
                         robbery?  No excuse for that.  No 
                         such thing as justifiable robbery.

                                     THELMA

               and Hal make eye contact before Max closes the door.

                                     J.D.
                         What?!  What'd I do?

               Hal sits down across the table from J.D. and looks at him.

                                     HAL
                         Son, I gotta feelin' about somethin' 
                         and I just wanna ask your opinion.  
                         Do you think Thelma Dickinson would 
                         have committed armed robbery if you 
                         hadn't taken all their money?

               J.D. doesn't say anything.  They both just sit there for a 
               moment.

                                     HAL
                         Cat got your tongue?

               J.D. shifts in his chair.

                                     J.D.
                         How do you know I took it?  How do 
                         you know they didn't just give it to 
                         me?

                                     HAL
                         There's two girls out there that had 
                         a chance, they had a chance...!  And 
                         you blew it for 'em.  Now they've 
                         gotten in some serious trouble, some 
                         very serious trouble and for at least 
                         part of it, I'm gonna hold you 
                         personally responsible for anything 
                         that happens to them.  I've got no 
                         feelin' for you.  But I may be the 
                         only person in the world who gives a 
                         rat's ass what happens to them and 
                         you're either gonna tell me every 
                         damn thing you know, so there's a 
                         small chance I can actually do them 
                         some good, or I'm gonna be all over 
                         you like a fly on shit for the rest 
                         of your natural life.  Your misery 
                         is gonna be my goddamn mission in 
                         life.  That's a sincere promise.

               Hal walks over and opens the door and Max and the others 
               straggle back in.

                                     HAL
                         Now, for one thing, you violated 
                         your parole two days out.  And you 
                         know Judge Hainey.  He hates this 
                         sort of thing.  Once he gets wind of 
                         this, he's gonna blow sky high.  And 
                         then when he finds out that you're a 
                         possible accessory to murder and 
                         armed robbery, well, I think we can 
                         safely place your ass back in the 
                         slammer for at least the remaining 
                         eight, don't you?

                                     MAX
                         Oh, definitely.

                                     J.D.
                              (convinced)
                         Okay.  Is somebody gonna write this 
                         down?

               INT.  POLICE STATION - NIGHT

               Darryl is sitting in the hallway.  Hal comes out of the room 
               first.

                                     HAL
                         Mr. Dickinson, if you'll just hang 
                         on, I want a word with you and then 
                         we'll take you home.

               Police officers lead J.D. out of the interrogation room, 
               down the hallway.  Darryl is watching J.D. closely.  J.D. is 
               smirking at him. 

                                     J.D.
                              (slyly, to Darryl)
                         I like your wife.

                                     DARRYL
                              (going after him)
                         Come back here, you little shit!

               Hal and another police officer are restraining Darryl.

               J.D. is led off down the hall.

               EXT.  GAS STATION - NIGHT

               Louise and Thelma pull into a gas station.

               EXT.  GAS STATION - NIGHT

               A gas station attendant approaches as Louise and Thelma are 
               getting out of the car.

                                     LOUISE
                              (to attendant)
                         Fill her up.
                              (to Thelma)
                         There's a phone right over there.

                                     THELMA
                         Let's get it over with.

               Thelma and Louise walk to the phone.

                                     LOUISE
                         I'm not kidding, Thelma.  If you 
                         think he knows, even if you're not 
                         sure, hang up.

               INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               The TV is ON and the place is a mess.

               Darryl, Hal, Max, and other cops spring into action as the 
               phone RINGS, putting on headsets, turning on tape recorders.  
               Darryl picks up the phone.

                                     DARRYL
                         Hello.

               EXT.  PAY PHONE - NIGHT

                                     THELMA
                         Darryl.  It's me.

               INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               Hal, Max, etc., all are gesticulating wildly.

                                     DARRYL
                              (real friendly)
                         Thelma!  Hello!

               EXT.  PAY PHONE

               Thelma hangs up the phone.

                                     THELMA
                              (matter-of-factly)
                         He knows.

               INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               Everyone is very disappointed, taking off their headsets, 
               turning off tape recorders and looking at Darryl like he's 
               an idiot.

                                     HAL
                         Shit.

               Darryl still holds the phone in his hand.

                                     DARRYL
                         What?!  All I said was hello.

               EXT.  PAY PHONE - NIGHT

               Thelma and Louise are staring at each other intently.

               Louise steps up to the phone.

                                     LOUISE
                         You got any change?

               Thelma digs in her bag and hands Louise a roll of quarters.  
               Louise gets out of the car and goes to the pay phone.  Thelma 
               follows her.  She puts the money in and dials.  It RINGS.

                                     LOUISE
                         Darryl, this is Louise.  Are the 
                         police there?

               INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               Again everybody springs into action.  Darryl is fumbling 
               with the phone.

                                     DARRYL
                         Uh, no!  No, why would any police be 
                         here?  Hey, where are you girls, 
                         anyway?

               Darryl gives Hal and Max a look as if he's got it completely 
               under control.  Clever guy.

               EXT.  PHONE - NIGHT

                                     LOUISE
                         Let me talk to whoever's in charge 
                         there?

               INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

                                     DARRYL
                         What are you talking about, Louise?

               Hal comes over and takes the phone away from Darryl.  Hal 
               looks at Max who nods, "take it."

                                     HAL
                         Hello, Miss Sawyer.  I'm Hal Slocumbe, 
                         Chief Investigator, Homicide, Arkansas 
                         State Police.  How are you?

               EXT.  PHONE - NIGHT

                                     LOUISE
                              (chuckling)
                         I've been better.

                                     HAL (V.O.)
                         You girls are in some hot water.

                                     LOUISE
                         Yes, sir.  I know.

               INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

                                     HAL
                         You're both okay?  Neither one of 
                         you hurt?  You're bein' careful with 
                         that gun?

               EXT.  PHONE - NIGHT

                                     LOUISE
                         We're both fine.

                                     HAL (V.O.)
                         Good.  You wanna tell me what 
                         happened?

                                     LOUISE
                         Sure.  Maybe over coffee sometime.  
                         I'll buy.

               INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

                                     HAL
                         I just want you to know, neither one 
                         of you are charged with murder yet.  
                         You're still just wanted for 
                         questioning.  Although, now, Mrs.  
                         Dickinson's wanted in Oklahoma for 
                         armed robbery.

               EXT.  PHONE - NIGHT

                                     LOUISE
                         No kiddin'.  Listen, we gotta go.  
                         I'll call you back, all right?

               Louise looks at her watch.

                                     HAL (V.O.)
                         Miss Sawyer, I don't think y'all are 
                         gonna make it to Mexico.  We should 
                         talk.  Please.  I wanna to help you.

               On hearing this Louise mouths the word "shit" in a very 
               frustrated way.

               Louise hangs up the phone.

               INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               All are busy trying to see if the call was traced.  Darryl 
               is back in his recliner still in shock.

               EXT.  PAY PHONE - NIGHT

               She is stomping back to the car.  Thelma follows doggedly.  
               A moving van pulls in and parks in the b.g.

                                     LOUISE
                         That J.D. kid is a little shit.

                                     THELMA
                         What.

               Louise stops as she is about to get in and faces Thelma who's 
               standing on the other side of the car.

                                     LOUISE
                         How'd they find out we're going to 
                         Mexico, Thelma, how they know that?

                                     THELMA
                         I... I...

                                     LOUISE
                         You told that thievin' little shit 
                         where we were goin'?!

               Louise yanks open her car door, gets in and slams the door 
               and fires up the ENGINE.  Thelma hops in quickly.

                                     THELMA
                         I just told him if he ever gets to 
                         Mexico to look us up.  I asked him 
                         not to tell.  I didn't think he would 
                         tell anybody.

                                     LOUISE
                         Why not?!  What's he got to lose?  
                         Other than my life's savings, that 
                         is.  Shit!

               Louise careens back onto the road.

                                     THELMA
                         I'm sorry.  I mean I...

               Louise slams on the brakes.

                                     LOUISE
                         Goddamnit, Thelma!  Let me explain 
                         something to you.  Right now we have 
                         only two things goin' for us.  One, 
                         nobody knows where we are, and two, 
                         nobody knows where we're going.  
                         Now, one of our things that was going 
                         for us is gone!

               Louise stops yelling for a moment groping for self-control.  
               Thelma looks pitiful.

                         Just stop talkin' to people, Thelma!  
                         Stop bein' so open!  We're fugitives 
                         now.  Let's behave that way!

                                     THELMA
                         You're right.

               EXT.  LONELY ROAD - NIGHT (MUSCO LIGHT)

               The T-Bird flashes by on a road that looks a lot like Route 
               66.

                                     THELMA (V.O.)
                         Louise?  Where are we?

                         Just past Boise City.

                         Idaho?

                                     LOUISE (V.O.)
                         Oklahoma, Thelma.  We're crossing 
                         into New Mexico.

                                     THELMA (V.O.)
                         I always wanted to see New Mexico.

               The car goes streaking by.

               INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - NIGHT (MUSCO LIGHT)

               All's quiet.  The large screen TV is ON and the room is filled 
               with dense smoke.  Hal, Max, sit at a table going over 
               paperwork.  Other plainclothes and surveillance guys play 
               cards.  Darryl sits crumpled in his recliner staring blankly 
               at the TV.

               INT.  JIMMY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Jimmy sits on his couch with his guitar while two plainclothes 
               cops sit reading the paper, doing the crossword puzzle.

               INT.  CAR - NIGHT

               Over music from tape:

               Thelma is sipping on a little Wild Turkey.

                                     THELMA
                         Now what?

                                     LOUISE
                         Now what what?

                                     THELMA
                         Whaddo we do?

                                     LOUISE
                         Oh, I don't know, Thelma.  I guess 
                         maybe we could turn ourselves in and 
                         spend our lives trading cigarettes 
                         for mascara so we can look nice when 
                         our families come to visit us on 
                         Saturdays.  Maybe we could have 
                         children with the prison guards.

                                     THELMA
                         I'm not suggestin' that!  I'm not 
                         goin' back.  No matter what happens.  
                         So don't worry about me.

               Louise speeds up.

               Thelma hands Louise a little bottle of Wild Turkey and she 
               drinks it down.  Thelma has one too.

                                     THELMA
                         Can I ask you kind of a weird 
                         question?

                                     LOUISE
                         Yeah.

                                     THELMA
                         Of all the things in the world that 
                         scare you, what's the worst thing 
                         that scares you the most?

                         You mean now or before?

                                     THELMA
                         Before.

                                     LOUISE
                         I guess I always thought the worst 
                         thing that could happen would be to 
                         end up old and alone in some crummy 
                         apartment with one of those little 
                         dogs.

                                     THELMA
                         What little dogs?

                                     LOUISE
                         You know those little dogs you see 
                         people with?

                                     THELMA
                         Like a Chihuahua?

                                     LOUISE
                         Those, too, but you know those little 
                         hairy ones?  Those flat-faced little 
                         fuckers with those ugly goddamned 
                         teeth?

                                     THELMA
                         Oh yeah.  You mean Peek-a-poos.

                                     LOUISE
                         Yeah.  Those.  That always put the 
                         fear of God in me.  What about you?

                                     THELMA
                         Well, to be honest, the idea of 
                         getting old with Darryl was kinda 
                         startin' to get to me.

                                     LOUISE
                         I can see that.

                                     THELMA
                         I mean, look how different he looks 
                         just since high school.  It's bad 
                         enough I have to get old, but doin' 
                         it with Darryl around is only gonna 
                         make it worse.
                              (quieter)
                         I mean, I don't think he's gonna be 
                         very nice about it.

                                     LOUISE
                         Well, now, maybe you won't have to.

                                     THELMA
                         Always lookin' on the bright side, 
                         aren't ya?

               They are driving through Monument Valley.  The T-Bird speeds 
               through the beautifully moonlit desert.  It is almost like 
               daylight.

               MONTAGE of silhouettes of cacti, huge rock formations, desert 
               beauty SHOTS, etc.

               The sky is bright and expansive and the road goes on forever.

                         This is so beautiful.

                         I always wanted to travel.  I just 
                         never got the opportunity.

                                     LOUISE
                         Well, you got it now.

               They both look forward for another moment.  And then, at the 
               same time, they look at each other, each taking the other 
               one in completely, in this moment.

               They're saying everything to each other in this moment, but 
               their expressions don't change and they don't say a word.  
               MUSIC plays on the RADIO.

               EXT.  DESERT HIGHWAY - NIGHT

               A semi-gas tanker is up ahead on the road.  It looks like 
               the one they saw earlier.  It's got the same mud flaps...

                         be darned.  What's he doin' way out 
                         here.

                                     THELMA
                         Just ignore him.

               Louise passes him and, as she does, he HONKS.  They look up 
               and he is wildly pointing to his lap.

                                     LOUISE
                         Oh, Christ.  I hate this guy.

                                     THELMA
                         We should have just ignored him.

               They are quiet for a moment, then Thelma starts quietly 
               laughing to herself.  She is trying to stop but cannot.

                                     LOUISE
                         What?

                         Nothing.  It's not funny.

                         What?  What's not funny, Thelma!

               Thelma is trying to compose herself but cannot.

                                     THELMA
                         Okay, but...
                              (she can barely speak)
                         I can't say.

               Thelma isn't making a sound.  She is stuck in a convulsion 
               of laughter.

                                     LOUISE

                         Just the look on his face when you...
                              (she is falling apart 
                              again)
                         ...it's not funny.

                         Now, Thelma, that is not...

               Thelma is still trying to get a grip on herself.

                                     THELMA
                         Boy, he wasn't expectin' that!

                         Suck my dick... Boom!!

               Thelma is laughing wildly.

                              (quietly)
                         Thelma.  It's not funny.

               Thelma has just crossed the line from laughing to crying.

                                     THELMA
                              (trying to catch her 
                              breath)
                         I know!

               They both get quiet.

               Thelma leans back just watching Louise.  She studies her as 
               if she's never really seen her before.  All of a sudden a 
               look of shocked realization comes over Thelma's face.

               She jerks upright and startles Louise.

                                     THELMA
                              (carefully)
                         It happened to you... didn't it?

               Louise knows what she is talking about.  She becomes 
               immediately agitated.

                                     LOUISE
                         I don't want to talk about it!  
                         Thelma, I'm not kidding!  Don't you 
                         even...

                                     THELMA
                         ...in Texas... didn't it?  That's 
                         what happened... Oh my God.

               Louise looks as if she is looking for a way to flee.

                                     LOUISE
                              (fighting hysteria)
                         I'm warning you, Thelma.  You better 
                         drop it right now!  I don't want to 
                         talk about it!

                                     THELMA
                              (gently)
                         Okay, Louise... It's okay.

               Louise's eyes are wild, not seeing, while Thelma now seems 
               completely serene.

               EXT.  DESERT HIGHWAY - DAWN

               The car is SCREAMING down the road.  They drive through a

                         What!  What!  Oh shit!  Oh no!

               They are trying not to panic.  They are slowing down, but 
               still doing 70 mph.  The patrol car is right behind them.

                                     THELMA
                         What do we do?  What do you want to 
                         do?!

                                     LOUISE
                         I don't know!  Shit!  Let's just 
                         play it by ear.  He may not know.  
                         He may just give me a ticket.

                                     THELMA
                         Please, God, please don't let us get 
                         caught.  Please, please, please...

               Louise pulls the car off the road.  The patrol car pulls up 
               right behind them.  The lights shine brightly in through the 
               windows.

               EXT.  SIDE OF DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY

                                     PATROLMAN (O.S.)
                         Turn off your engine.

               Louise does.  The PATROLMAN gets out of his car and approaches 
               their car.  He comes to the driver's side window.  It is 
               rolled up.

               PATROLMAN'S POV OF LOUISE smiling up at him.  He gestures to 
               her to roll her window down.  She does.

                                     LOUISE
                         Hello, Officer.  Is there a problem?

                                     PATROLMAN
                         You wanna let me see your license, 
                         please?

               Louise fumbles in her purse for her wallet, opens it and 
               shows her license.

                                     PATROLMAN
                         You wanna take it out of your wallet, 
                         please?

                                     LOUISE
                         Oh yeah.

               She does and hands it to him.

                                     THELMA
                         I told you to slow down.  Hell, 
                         Officer, I told her to slow down.

                                     LOUISE
                         About how fast was I going?

                                     PATROLMAN
                         About a hundred and ten.  You wanna 
                         step out of the car, please?

               They walk to the back of the car.  He notes the license plate 
               number.

                                     PATROLMAN
                         Is this your car?

                                     LOUISE
                         Yes.

                                     PATROLMAN
                         You wanna come with me, please?  
                         Walk around and get in the car, 
                         please.

                                     LOUISE
                         In the back?

                                     PATROLMAN
                         Front.

                                     LOUISE
                         Am I in trouble?

                                     PATROLMAN
                         As far as I'm concerned, yes, ma'am, 
                         you are.

               Patrolman gets in the driver's side.  He picks up a clipboard 
               and clips Louise's driver's license to it.  He picks up the 
               hand mike for the radio and, as he does, a hand with a gun 
               comes in his car window.  It's Thelma and she puts the gun 
               to his head.

                                     THELMA
                         Officer, I am so sorry about this.  
                         Could you let go of that?

               He drops it.

                                     THELMA
                         I really, really apologize, but please 
                         put your hands on the steering wheel.  
                         See, if you get on that radio, you're 
                         gonna find out that we're wanted in 
                         two states and probably considered 
                         armed and dangerous, at least I am, 
                         then our whole plan would be shot to 
                         hell.  Louise, take his gun.

               Louise reaches over and takes his gun.

                                     LOUISE
                              (apologetic)
                         I am really sorry about this.

                                     THELMA
                         I swear, before yesterday, neither 
                         one of us would have ever pulled a 
                         stunt like this.  But if you ever 
                         met my husband, you'd know why I 
                         just can... You wanna step out of 
                         the car, please?
                              (she opens the door 
                              for him)
                         You wanna put your hands on your 
                         head, please?  Louise, shoot the 
                         radio.

                                     LOUISE
                         What?

                                     THELMA
                         Shoot the radio!

               Louise SHOOTS the car radio.  The cop flinches with each 
               shot.

                                     THELMA
                         The police radio, Louise!  Jesus!

               Louise fires TWO SHOTS into the police radio.  It BLASTS all 
               to hell.

                                     THELMA
                         You wanna step to the back of the 
                         car, please.  Louise, bring the keys.

               Louise reaches over and takes the keys.  She takes her license 
               off the clipboard.  She gets out and trots around to the 
               back of the car.

               Thelma is holding the gun on the Patrolman.  Suddenly Thelma 
               FIRES the gun, blowing two holes into the trunk cover.

                                     THELMA
                              (to Louise)
                         Open the trunk.

               Louise opens the trunk.

                                     THELMA
                              (to Patrolman)
                         You wanna step into the trunk, please?

                                     PATROLMAN
                         Ma'am, please... I got kids... a 
                         wife...

                                     THELMA
                         You do?  Well, you're lucky.  You be 
                         sweet to 'em.  Especially your wife.  
                         My husband wasn't sweet to me and 
                         look how I turned out.  Now go on, 
                         get in there.

               As he's climbing into the trunk, Thelma explains to Louise:

                                     THELMA
                         Air holes.

               He's all the way in and Louise closes the trunk.

               INT.  PATROL CAR - DAY

               Thelma opens the glove compartment.  She takes a box of spare 
               ammo and closes it.  Thelma takes the keys and gets out of 
               the car.  She walks around to the trunk.

               EXT.  PATROL CAR - DAY

                                     THELMA
                              (to trunk)
                         Sorry!

                                     LOUISE
                              (from her car)
                         Sorry!

               Thelma hops into the car with Louise.  They look at each 
               other.

                                     LOUISE
                         Ready?

                                     THELMA
                         Hit it.

               Louise pulls the car back onto the road and they drive away.

                         I know it's crazy, Louise, but I 
                         just feel like I've got a knack for 
                         this shit.

                                     LOUISE

               They are in really beautiful country now.

                         Drive like hell.

               INT.  THELMA'S KITCHEN - MORNING

               Hal and Max are alone in the kitchen.  Hal switches on the 
               Mr. Coffee.

                                     MAX
                         It's just not working like this.  We 
                         gotta do something.  It'd be one 
                         thing if these girls were hardened 
                         criminals, but Jesus, Hal, this is 
                         makin' us look bad.  I don't know... 
                         maybe they're not movin'.  Maybe 
                         that little creep lied.

                                     HAL
                         He's got nothin' to gain by lyin'.  
                         Nothin' at all.  He already got all 
                         their money.  I just don't know what 
                         we're dealin' with here.  Anyway, it 
                         went out again last night on 
                         Nationwide Teletype.  Let's just 
                         wait it out a little longer.  She 
                         said she was gonna call back.  Let's 
                         just sit tight.

                                     MAX
                         We don't have a whole lotta choice, 
                         do we?  I can't figure out if they're 
                         real smart or just really, really 
                         lucky.

                                     HAL
                         It don't matter.  Brains will only 
                         get you so far and luck always runs 
                         out.

               A cop walks into the kitchen and hands Hal a file that says 
               Louise Elizabeth Sawyer on the outside.  He opens it up and 
               starts looking through a personal history.  One piece of 
               paper is a case file from Texas containing an incident report 
               of a rape.  Stamped across it are the words "charges dropped."

                                     THELMA
                         Louise... are we still going to 
                         Mexico?

                                     LOUISE
                         Yes.

               Thelma pauses while she searches for the logic.

                                     THELMA
                         Then aren't we going in the wrong 
                         direction?

                                     LOUISE
                         Well, I figure if you take a state 
                         policeman, shoot up his car, take 
                         his gun and lock him in the trunk, 
                         it's best to just get on out of the 
                         state if you can.

                                     THELMA
                         Just asking.

               They are both quiet for a second.  Louise goes a little 
               faster.

               Thelma is digging through her bag.  She hands Louise a piece 
               of beef jerky.

                                     LOUISE
                         I don't want to see any more beef 
                         jerky.  I mean the next beef jerky 
                         you hand me is going out the window.  
                         It's drivin' me crazy.  The whole 
                         car smells like it.

                                     THELMA
                         It's good.  It's what the pioneers 
                         ate.

                                     LOUISE
                         I don't care what the damn pioneers 
                         ate.  You just keep that shit away 
                         from me, now I mean it.

               Thelma puts down her bag.

                                     LOUISE
                         And I don't want any more Wild Turkey, 
                         either.  It's burning a hole in my 
                         stomach.

                                     THELMA
                         Okay, okay... I've got some tequila.  
                         You want some tequila?

                                     LOUISE
                         You do?

                                     THELMA
                         Yeah, you want it?

                                     LOUISE
                         Yeah.

               Thelma starts to dig through her bag again.

                                     THELMA
                         It's in here somewhere.

               Louise is rubbing her face.  She looks pretty bad.  Her hands 
               are shaking.

                                     LOUISE
                         Shit.  I'm gettin' tired.

                                     THELMA
                         Are you alright?

               Louise does not really seem alright.

                                     LOUISE
                         I think I've really fucked up.  I 
                         think I've got us in a situation 
                         where we could both get killed.  Why 
                         didn't we just go straight to the 
                         police.

                                     THELMA
                         You know why.  You already said.

                                     LOUISE
                         What'd I say again?

                                     THELMA
                         Nobody would believe us.  We'd still 
                         get in trouble.  We'd still have our 
                         lives ruined.  And you know what 
                         else?

                                     LOUISE
                         What?

                                     THELMA
                         That guy was hurtin' me.  And if you 
                         hadn't come out when you did, he'd a 
                         hurt me a lot worse.  And probably 
                         nothin' woulda happened to him. 'Cause 
                         everybody did see me dancin' with 
                         him all night.  And they woulda made 
                         out like I asked for it.  And my 
                         life woulda been ruined a whole lot 
                         worse than it is now.  At least now 
                         I'm havin' fun.  And I'm not sorry 
                         the son of a bitch is dead.  I'm 
                         only sorry that it was you that did 
                         it and not me.  And if I haven't, I 
                         wanna take this time to thank you, 
                         Louise.  Thank you for savin' my 
                         ass.

                                     LOUISE
                         I said all that?

                                     THELMA
                         No, Louise, you said the first part.  
                         I said all the rest.

                                     LOUISE
                              (tired)
                         Whatever.

               EXT.  ROADSIDE REST STATION - MORNING

               Louise is at a pay phone as the sky is just starting to get 
               light.  Thelma is in the bathroom nearby.  Louise has already 
               dialed and the phone is RINGING.

               INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - MORNING

               The TV DRONES on in the b.g. as the phone RINGS there, 
               everyone leaps into action again.  Max picks up the phone.

                                     MAX
                         Hello.

                                     LOUISE (V.O.)
                         Let me speak to... Slocumbe.

                                     MAX
                              (to Hal)
                         She wants to talk to you.

                                     HAL
                         Hello, Louise.

               EXT.  PAY PHONE - MORNING

                                     LOUISE
                         Hey.

                                     HAL (V.O.)
                         How are things goin' out there?

                                     LOUISE
                         Weird.  Got some kind of snowball 
                         effect goin' here or somethin'.

                                     HAL (V.O.)
                         You're still with us though.  You're 
                         somewhere on the face of the earth?

                                     LOUISE
                         Well, we're not in the middle of 
                         nowhere, but we can see it from here.

               INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - MORNING

               Hal smiles.

                                     HAL
                         I swear.  Louise, I almost feel like 
                         I know you.

                                     LOUISE (V.O.)
                         Well.  You don't.

                                     HAL
                         You're gettin' in deeper every moment 
                         you're gone.

                                     LOUISE (V.O.)
                         Would you believe me if I told you 
                         this whole thing is an accident?

                                     HAL
                         I do believe you.  That's what I 
                         want everybody to believe.  Trouble 
                         is, it doesn't look like an accident 
                         and you're not here to tell me about 
                         it... I need you to help me here.

               EXT.  PAY PHONE - MORNING

               Louise does not answer.

                                     HAL (V.O.)
                         Did Harlan Puckett...

               Through clenched teeth, repulsed:

                                     LOUISE
                              (interrupting)
                         No!

                                     HAL (V.O.)
                         You want to come on in?

               Louise thinks for a minute.

                                     LOUISE
                         I don't think so.

               INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - DAY

                                     HAL
                         Then I'm sorry.  We're gonna have to 
                         charge you with murder.  Now, do you 
                         want to come out of this alive?

               The surveillance man motions to Hal to keep it going.

               Darryl comes in and immediately realizes Hal is talking to 
               Louise.  Darryl looks attentively at Hal.

               EXT.  PAY PHONE - DAY

                                     LOUISE
                         You know, certain words and phrases 
                         just keep floating through my mind, 
                         things like incarceration, cavity 
                         search, life imprisonment, death by 
                         electrocution, that sort of thing.  
                         So, come out alive?  I don't know.  
                         Let us think about that.

                                     HAL (V.O.)
                         Louise, I'll do anything.  I know 
                         what's makin' you run.  I know what 
                         happened to you in Texas.

               Louise's eyes get wide as she hears this.

               A FINGER reaches up and presses down the lever and hangs up 
               the phone.

               ANGLE OF THELMA

               She has her finger on the lever.

                                     THELMA
                         Come on, Louise.  Don't blow it.  
                         Let's go.

               She walks away towards the car.  Louise is still standing 
               there holding the phone.  Thelma stops and looks at her.

                                     THELMA
                         Come on.

               Louise doesn't move.

               INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - DAY

               Frustrated, Hal slams down the phone.  He looks over at the 
               surveillance man who nods to say "we got it."  The whole 
               room reacts excitedly.  Everyone in the room springs into 
               action.  Max immediately picks up the phone and Hal watches 
               him intently.  He mouths the words to Max -- "I wanna go" 
               emphatically.  Max slightly shakes his head, still of the 
               phone.  Hal goes charging over to Max.

                                     HAL
                         Max.  You gotta take me there!  I'm... 
                         I'm the only one she's ever talked 
                         to.  I don't want anybody losin' 
                         their heads.  You know what happens.  
                         The volume gets turned way up and 
                         the next thing you know those girls 
                         are gonna get shot.

               Max, still holding the phone, is surprised by this outburst.

                                     MAX
                              (calmly)
                         Okay, Hal, okay.

               Louise is still standing there.

                                     THELMA
                         Louise?

                         Yes, Thelma?

                                     THELMA
                         You're not gonna give up on me, are 
                         ya?

                         What do you mean?

                                     THELMA
                         You're not gonna make some deal with 
                         that guy, are you?  I mean, I just 
                         wanna know.

                                     LOUISE
                         No, Thelma.  I'm not gonna make any 
                         deals.

                                     THELMA
                         I can understand if you're thinkin' 
                         about it.  I mean, in a way, you've 
                         got something to go back for.  I 
                         mean Jimmy and everything.

               Louise is surprised to be hearing this from Thelma.

                                     LOUISE
                         Thelma, that is not an option.

                                     THELMA
                         But I don't know... something's 
                         crossed over in me and I can't go 
                         back.  I mean, I just couldn't live...

                                     LOUISE
                         I know.  I know what you mean.  I 
                         don't wanna end up on the damn Geraldo 
                         Show.

               They are both quiet for a moment.

                                     LOUISE
                         He said they're charging us with 
                         murder.

                                     THELMA
                              (making a face)
                         Eeuww.

                         And we have to decide whether we 
                         want to come out of this dead or 
                         alive.

                                     THELMA
                         Gosh, didn't he say anything positive 
                         at all?

               Louise STARTS the car.  They lurch into reverse then SCREECH 
               forward as they tear off down the road.

                         Louise, do you think we should change 
                         cars, get another car?

                         Well, let me know when you figure it 
                         out.

               EXT.  AIRSTRIP - DAY

               A car pulls up on an airstrip and stops next to a small jet.  
               Hal and Max get out of the car and board the plane.

               EXT.  DESERT - DAY

               MONTAGE of driving shots as Louise and Thelma drive through 
               the intense beauty of the Arizona desert.

               INT.  CAR - DAY

                                     THELMA
                         You awake?

                                     LOUISE
                         You could call it that.  My eyes are 
                         open.

                                     THELMA
                         Me too.  I feel awake.

                                     LOUISE
                         Good.

                                     THELMA
                         Wide awake.  I don't remember ever 
                         feelin' this awake.  Everything looks 
                         different.  You know what I mean.  I 
                         know you know what I mean.  Everything 
                         looks new.  Do you feel like that?  
                         Like you've got something to look 
                         forward to?

               Louise and Thelma both get quiet for a second.

                                     LOUISE
                         We'll be drinkin' margaritas by the 
                         sea, Mamasita.

                                     THELMA
                         We can change our names.

                                     LOUISE
                         We can live in a hacienda.

                                     THELMA
                         I wanna get a job.  I wanna work at 
                         Club Med.

                                     LOUISE
                         Yes!  Yes!  Now what kind of deal do 
                         you think that cop can come up with 
                         to beat that?

                                     THELMA
                         It'd have to be pretty good.

                                     LOUISE
                         It would have to be pretty damn good.

               They are both laughing.  The car is still flying down the 
               road.  The sun is coming higher in the sky now.  They come 
               to an intersection in the middle of nowhere.  Louise stops 
               and looks at the map.

                                     LOUISE
                         We should head a little further in.  
                         There's not that many roads in this 
                         state.  I want to try to hit Mexico 
                         somewhere not so close to New Mexico.  
                         They probably wanna kill us in New 
                         Mexico.

                                     THELMA
                         You're drivin'.

               Louise takes a right turn and speeds down the road.

               EXT.  DESERT ROAD - DAY

               Louise and Thelma are singing along to a wild R&B SONG.  
               They do the hand movements as if they are the Supremes.

               They come roaring up on the semi-tanker, the same one they 
               have seen three times before.

                                     THELMA
                              (screaming over music)
                         Oh my God!  Louise!  Look!  Look!  
                         See if that's him!

                                     LOUISE
                         It's him.  He's got California plates.  
                         It's the same guy.

                                     THELMA
                         Pass him!

               EXT.  DESERT ROAD - DAY

               Louise bears down really hard and passes him.  Again as they 
               get right next to him, he blows kisses down at them.

               He is leering at them and laughing.  Louise and Thelma drive 
               further down the road.

               Louise pulls the car off to the side of the road.  As the 
               truck gets close they start waving to him to stop.  He pulls 
               his truck off the side of the road and stops.  ANGLE ON Louise 
               and Thelma smiling up at him.  He chuckles to himself.  He 
               leans out the window.

                                     THELMA
                         Hi!

                                     TRUCKER
                         Hi there!  You alright?

                                     THELMA
                         We're fine!  How are you?

                                     TRUCKER
                         Grrrreat!

                         Follow us.

               They turn off onto a dirt road and pull to a stop.

               INT.  TRUCK CAB - DAY

               The Trucker reaches over and opens a glove compartment crammed 
               full of condoms.  He grabs a few and shoves them in his 
               pocket.  He turns off his engine and gets out of the truck.

               EXT.  SIDE OF ROAD - DAY

               He walks up to the car.

               Louise and Thelma get out of the car.

                                     THELMA
                         Where you goin'?

                                     LOUISE
                         We been seein' you all along the 
                         way.

                                     TRUCKER
                         Yeah.  I been seein' you, too.

                                     THELMA
                         We think you have really bad manners.

               Louise nods.

                                     LOUISE
                         We were just wonderin' where you 
                         think you get off behavin' like that 
                         to women you don't even know.

               This is not what is supposed to be happening.

                                     TRUCKER
                         What?  What are you talkin' about?

                                     LOUISE
                         You know good and damn well what I'm 
                         talkin' about.

                                     THELMA
                         I mean really!  That business with 
                         your tongue.  What is that?  That's 
                         disgusting!

                                     LOUISE
                         And, oh my God, that other thing, 
                         that pointing to your lap?  What's 
                         that supposed to mean exactly?  Does 
                         that mean pull over, I want to show 
                         you what a big fat slob I am or...

                                     THELMA
                         Does that mean suck my dick?

                                     TRUCKER
                         You women are crazy!

                                     LOUISE
                         You got that right.

                                     THELMA
                         We think you should apologize.

               He is getting a little panicky.

                                     TRUCKER
                         I'm not apologizing for shit!

                                     LOUISE
                         Say you're sorry.

                                     TRUCKER
                         Fuck that.

               Louise pulls the gun they stole from the State Patrolman.

                                     LOUISE
                         Say you're sorry or we'll make you 
                         fuckin' sorry.

               He looks at the gun.

                                     TRUCKER
                         Oh, Jesus!

                                     THELMA
                         You probably even called us beavers 
                         on your CB radio, didn't you?

                                     TRUCKER
                         Yeah... sure did.

                                     THELMA
                         Damn.  I hate that!  I hate bein' 
                         called a beaver, don't you?

                                     LOUISE
                         Are you going to apologize or not?

                                     TRUCKER
                         Fuck you.

               Louise looks at his truck off in the distance.  She points 
               the gun at it, takes a second to get a bead, then SHOOTS two 
               of the tires flat.  The truck slowly sinks as the air escapes 
               from the tires.

                                     TRUCKER
                         Oh goddamn!!  You bitch!!

               Louise and Thelma look at each other.  They both turn towards 
               the truck and FIRE rounds into the tankers until they EXPLODE 
               in a huge ball of fire.  The truck driver screams at the top 
               of his lungs.  Louise starts the car and starts driving in 
               circles around the truck driver.  Thelma and Louise are both 
               howling at the top of their lungs.  Thelma is sitting on the 
               back of the front seat with her legs on the dashboard.

                                     TRUCKER
                         You fucking bitch!  Aaaaaaarrrgghh!!!  
                         You're gonna have to pay for that!!!  
                         I'm gonna make you pay for that!!  
                         You hear me??!!

               Louise stops the car right next to him.

                                     THELMA
                         Shut up.

               Louise takes off again and Thelma falls into the back seat.  
               They drive off trailing a huge cloud of dust.

               EXT.  DESERT - DAY

               Louise drives through the desert back towards the road, past 
               the burning debris of the truck.  As she gets to the road 
               she stops.  Thelma climbs into the front seat.

               INT.  CAR - DAY

                                     THELMA
                         Hey.  Where'd you learn to shoot 
                         like that?

                                     LOUISE
                         Texas... You were right about what 
                         happened to me there.

               They pull away from the burning wreckage.

               INT.  CAR - DAY

               As Thelma and Louise talk, their voices are heard over the 
               following scene.

                                     LOUISE (V.O.)
                         You know what's happened, don't you?

                                     THELMA (V.O.)
                         What?

                                     LOUISE (V.O.)
                              (smiling)
                         We've gone insane.

                                     THELMA (V.O.)
                         Yup.

               EXT.  NEW MEXICO SIDE OF ROAD - DAY

               A battered old pickup truck is parked by the New Mexico State 
               Patrol.  An old man uses a crowbar to pry open the trunk.  
               The New Mexico State Patrolman hops out of the trunk.

               EXT.  DESERT ROAD - HELICOPTER SHOT - DAY

               Police Bulletin VOICE OVER BEGINS AND PLAYS OVER following 
               scenes:

               A police helicopter flies over the burning wreckage of the 
               fuel truck.  The truck driver is waving his arms as the 
               helicopter descends, blowing dirt all over him.

               INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - DAY

               Darryl sits practically comatose in a big chair.  His eyes 
               have a dull glaze as he stares first at one wall, then 
               another.

               INT.  CAR - DAY

               A TIGHT SHOT of a TAPE being shoved into the cassette deck.

               INT.  FBI JET - DAY

               Max and Hal sit next to each other in the jet.  Hal tries to 
               appear as if he's used to all this.  Max holds a cellular 
               phone to his ear.

               TIGHT SHOT of Max as we hear through the phone:

               Police VOICE OVER becomes part of scene.

                                     POLICE (V.O.)
                              (on phone)
                         ...Abducted... shot up the car... 
                         stole the officer's weapon... 
                         tanker... blown up... terrorized...

               Max's face becomes troubled and more serious than we've seen 
               so far.  He looks at Hal as he hangs up the phone.

                                     MAX
                         You're not even going to believe

               WIDE SHOT of car speeding through the desert on an empty 
               highway west.  DRIVING SHOT -- Thelma has her face to the 
               sun with her eyes closed.  Louise is driving with a fierce 
               intensity.  They hardly resemble the two women that started 
               out for a weekend in the mountains two days earlier.  Although 
               their faces are tanned and lined and their hair is blowing 
               wildly there is a sense of serenity that pervades.

               EXT.  HELIPORT - DAY

               Hal and Max are climbing out of the jet and running across 
               the tarmac to a waiting helicopter.  Max is carrying a walkie-
               talkie now.

               INT.  CAR - DAY

               Thelma sits up suddenly.  An Arizona police car passes them 
               going eastbound.

                                     THELMA
                         Oh shit.  Louise... Do you think he 
                         saw us?

                                     LOUISE
                         I don't know, but let's get off.

               LOUISE'S POV - REARVIEW MIRROR

               The police car cuts across the median to begin pursuit of 
               the girls.  The lights are flashing.

                         Is your seat belt on?

               Thelma puts her seat belt on.  Louise floors the car and it 
               streaks off, putting some distance between them and the police 
               car.  Thelma looks back at the police car.  She looks scared.

                                     THELMA
                         I guess we shoulda made some kinda 
                         plan for what to do if we get caught.

                                     LOUISE
                         Yeah, right.  We're not gonna get 
                         caught.

               A steady stream of state police cars pulls out of the parking 
               lot with lights flashing while other policemen are running 
               to their cars still parked in the lot.

                         About two hundred and fifty miles.

               EXT.  DESERT ROAD - DAY

               There are now two police cars behind them about half a mile 
               back.  They are going really fast.  A police helicopter 
               catches up to them and orders them to stop.  Thelma stands 
               and flips them off.

                                     THELMA
                         We're going to Mexico!

                         Uh oh.  There's another one.

               Louise and Thelma both are looking back at the two police 
               cars following them.  They turn back around just in time to 
               see a third Arizona State police car has pulled into the 
               middle of an intersection of the only road that crosses it 
               for miles.  They both scream.  Louise swerves just in time 
               to keep from hitting it broadside.  She goes off the road 
               and has to struggle to pull her car back onto the road, 
               leaving a huge cloud of dust.

                                     LOUISE
                         Shit!

                         Did you see that guy?!  He was right 
                         in the middle of the road!

               EXT.  DESERT ROAD - DAY

               The first two police cars are approaching the same 
               intersection.  They are driving side by side.  There is still 
               a huge cloud of dust that now covers the third car in the 
               middle of the intersection.

               INT.  POLICE CAR #1 - POV - DAY

               A huge cloud of dust blows across the road as he approaches 
               the intersection.  It clears to reveal the third police car 
               in the middle of the road, just as he and police car #2 reach 
               the intersection.  ANGLE ON POLICEMAN #1 as he screams and 
               swerves to the right.

               INT.  POLICE CAR #3 - DAY

               ANGLE ON POLICEMAN #3 AS HE SEES BOTH POLICE CARS HEADING

               right for him at 120 mph.  He screams and ducks down into 
               the seat.

               ANOTHER ANGLE - POLICE CAR #

               swerves to the right.  Police car #2 swerves to the left, 
               both barely missing police car #3.

               ANOTHER ANGLE as police car #1 and police car #2 both pull 
               back onto the road right next to each other.

               INT.  POLICE CAR #3 - DAY

               Policeman #3 sits up in the seat.  He can't believe he isn't 
               dead.  He puts his car in gear and takes off down the road 
               after them.

               EXT.  DESERT GHOST TOWN - DAY

               Louise and Thelma blow through a stand of buildings left 
               from when the train went through here.  There are two parallel 
               streets on either side of the one they're on and, as they 
               pass by buildings, they can see police cars ROARING down 
               these parallel streets trying to "head them off at the pass."  
               Louise FLOORS it and her car screams ahead.

                                     LOUISE
                         We probably shoulda filled up the 
                         car before we blew up that truck.

                                     THELMA
                         Why?

                                     LOUISE
                         They'll probably catch us when we 
                         have to stop for gas!

                                     THELMA
                         I know this whole thing was my fault.  
                         I know it is.

                         There's one thing you oughta 
                         understand by now, Thelma, it's not 
                         your fault.

                                     THELMA
                         Louise... no matter what happens, 
                         I'm glad I came with you.

               EXT.  DESERT ROAD - DAY

               Louise swerves off the road and begins driving across the 
               desert.  All the police cars take off across the desert after 
               them.  They are now being pursued by at least fifteen cars.

                         You too, sweetie, the best.

                                     THELMA
                         I guess I went a little crazy, huh?

                                     LOUISE
                         No... You've always been crazy.  
                         This is just the first chance you've 
                         had to really express yourself.

                                     THELMA
                         I guess everything from here on in 
                         is going to be pretty shitty.

                         Unbearable, I'd imagine.

                                     THELMA
                         I guess everything we've got to lose 
                         is already gone anyway.

                         How do you stay so positive?

               They smile.

               EXT.  DESERT - DAY

               It does look like an Army.  More police cars have joined, 
               and from every direction, police cars are swarming across 
               the desert, although none are in front of them.  Way off in 
               the distance, a helicopter joins the chase.

               INT.  CAR - DAY

               Thelma is looking way up ahead in the distance.

                         Way up ahead!

               Louise strains to see.  Whatever it is, Louise is barreling 
               towards it, the car leaving the ground as they fly through 
               the desert.

                                     LOUISE
                         Oh my God!!

               Louise starts to laugh and cry at the same time.

               Behind them is a huge wall of dust created by all the police 
               cars following them.  In front of them, looking larger every 
               moment, is the awesome splendor of the Grand Canyon.

                         It's grand!

               Louise has tears streaming down her face as she realizes 
               there is absolutely no escape.  She continues barreling 
               towards it without slowing down.

               EXT.  DESERT - DAY

               All the police cars are still following about a half a mile 
               behind.  The car is bouncing and flying across the desert.  
               Finally, they get about twenty yards from the edge and Louise 
               SLAMS on the brakes.

               Thelma and Louise are just waiting for the cars to catch up.  
               The police cars stop in a line about two hundred yards behind 
               them.  The dust from the cars is blowing across them.  They 
               just sit looking at the Grand Canyon.

               From the canyon, the FBI helicopter rises up in front of the 
               car.

               INT.  FBI HELICOPTER - DAY

               Hal sees Thelma and Louise for the first time.  They are 
               sitting in the car, oblivious in a way, to all the activity 
               around them.  He only takes his eyes off of them long enough 
               to look at Max.

                         All this for us?

               Thelma starts to laugh.  Louise is only concerned with missing 
               the cacti and other obstacles that lie before her.

               INT.  FBI HELICOPTER - DAY

               The helicopter lands behind the row of police cars.

               HAL'S POV

               He sees Thelma and Louise facing each other.  They look so 
               nice.  He can't stop looking.  He borrows the binoculars 
               from Max.  He sees Thelma and Louise in the car.  Some of 
               the police sharpshooters are sporting semi-automatic rifles.  
               Hal looks at Max.

                                     HAL
                         Hey!  Don't let them shoot those 
                         girls.  This is too much.  They got 
                         guns pointed at 'em!

                         The women are armed, Hal.  This is

                         These boys know what they're doin'.

               Max climbs out of the chopper.  Hal sits for a moment and 
               then leaps out and follows Max.

                                     THELMA
                         Now what?

                                     LOUISE
                         We're not giving up, Thelma.

                                     THELMA
                         Then let's not get caught.

                                     LOUISE
                         What are you talkin' about?

                                     THELMA
                              (indicating the Grand 
                              Canyon)

                         Go?

               Thelma is smiling at her.

                                     THELMA
                         Go.

               They look at each other, look back at the wall of police 
               cars, and then look back at each other.  They smile.

               TWO OF THE ARIZONA COPS by their cars, as they are loading 
               weapons, talk quietly.

                                     ARIZONA COP #1
                         ...heard they shot a cop.

                         With his own gun.  Put him in the 
                         trunk and blew him away...

               INT.  CAR - DAY

               Louise and Thelma are looking at each other.

                                     POLICE (O.S.)
                              (over loudspeaker)
                         Turn off the engine and place your 
                         hands in the air!

               EXT.  DESERT - DAY

               Hal is about to crawl out of his skin.  He can't believe 
               this thing is getting out of control.  He jumps in front of 
               Max.

                                     HAL
                         Max!  Let me talk to 'em!  I can't 
                         believe this!  You've gotta do 
                         something here!

               Max goes around Hal and continues walking.  Hal jumps in 
               front of Max again and blocks his way.

                                     HAL
                         I'm sorry to bother you, I know you're 
                         real busy right now, but how many 
                         times, Max?  How many times has that 
                         woman gotta be fucked over?  You 
                         could lift one finger and save her 
                         ass and you won't even do that?

                                     MAX
                              (grabbing Hal)
                         Get a hold of yourself!  You are way 
                         out of your jurisdiction, now come 
                         on!  Calm down!  Don't make me sorry 
                         I let you come!

               Max lets go of Hal's lapels.

                                     HAL
                              (under his breath)
                         Shit!  I can't fucking believe this!

               Hal walks along with a look of total disbelief on his face.  
               He's shaking his head.  Slowly he breaks into a trot and 
               starts heading toward the front line.

                                     MAX
                              (shouting)
                         Hey.  Hey!

               Hal is running now and clears the front row of cars.

               There is a lot of confusion among the officers on the front 
               row.  Some shout, some lower their guns to look.

                                     ARIZONA COP #1
                         What in the hell?!

                              (lowering his rifle)
                         The son of a bitch is in my way!

               INT.  CAR - DAY

               They are still looking at each other really hard.

                                     THELMA
                         You're a good friend.

                                     LOUISE
                         You, too, sweetie, the best.

               SHOOT WITH OR WITHOUT.

               MUSIC:  B.B. King song entitled "Better Not Look Down" begins.  
               It is very upbeat.

                                     LOUISE
                         Are you sure?

               Thelma nods.

                                     THELMA
                         Hit it.

               Louise puts the car in gear and FLOORS it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT.  DESERT - DAY

               Hal's eyes widen for a moment at what he sees, and then a 
               sense of calm overtakes him and he mouths the word "alright."

                                     B.B. KING SONG (V.O.)
                         I've been around, I've seem some 
                         things, People movin' faster than 
                         the speed of sound, faster than a 
                         speedin' bullet.  People livin' like 
                         Superman, all day and all night.  I 
                         won't say if it's wrong or I won't 
                         say if it's right.  I'm pretty fast 
                         myself.  But I do have some advice 
                         to pass along, right here in the 
                         words to this song...

               EXT.  DESERT - DAY

               The cops all lower their weapons as looks of shock and 
               disbelief cover their faces.  A cloud of dust blows THROUGH 
               THE FRAME as the speeding car sails over the edge of the 
               cliff.

                                     B.B. KING SONG (V.O.)
                         Better not look down, if you wanna 
                         keep on flyin'.  Put the hammer down, 
                         keep it full speed ahead.  Better 
                         not look back or you might just wind

                         if you don't look down...

               FADE IN:

               INT.  RESTAURANT - MORNING (PRESENT DAY)

               LOUISE is a waitress in a coffee shop.  She is in her early-
               thirties, but too old to be doing this.  She is very pretty 
               and meticulously groomed, even at the end of her shift.  She 
               is slamming dirty coffee cups from the counter into a bus 
               tray underneath the counter.  It is making a lot of RACKET, 
               which she is oblivious to.  There is COUNTRY MUZAK in the 
               b.g., which she hums along with.

               INT.  THELMA'S KITCHEN - MORNING

               THELMA is a housewife.  It's morning and she is slamming 
               coffee cups from the breakfast table into the kitchen sink, 
               which is full of dirty breakfast dishes and some stuff left 
               from last night's dinner which had to "soak".  She is still 
               in her nightgown.  The TV is ON in the b.g.

               From the kitchen, we can see an incomplete wallpapering 
               project going on in the dining room, an obvious "do-it-
               yourself" attempt by Thelma.

               INT.  RESTAURANT - MORNING

               Louise goes to the pay phone and dials a number.

               INT.  THELMA'S KITCHEN - MORNING

               Phone RINGS.  Thelma goes over to answer it.

                                     THELMA
                              (hollering)
                         I got it!   Hello.

               INT.  RESTAURANT - MORNING

                                     LOUISE
                              (at pay phone)
                         I hope you're packed, little 
                         housewife, 'cause we are outta her 
                         tonight.

               INT.  THELMA'S KITCHEN - MORNING

                                     THELMA
                         Well, wait now.  I still have to ask 
                         Darryl if I can go.

                                     LOUISE (V.O.)
                         You mean you haven't asked him yet?  
                         For Christ sake, Thelma, is he your 
                         husband or your father?  It's just 
                         two days.  For God's sake, Thelma.  
                         Don't be a child.  Just tell him 
                         you're goin' with me, for cryin' out 
                         loud.  Tell him I'm havin' a nervous 
                         breakdown.

               Thelma has the phone tucked under her chin, as she cuts out 
               coupons from the newspaper and pins them on a bulletin board 
               already covered with them.  We see various recipes torn out 
               from women's magazines along the lines of "101 Ways to Cook 
               Pork."

                                     THELMA
                         He already thinks you're out of your 
                         mind, Louise, that don't carry much 
                         weight with Darryl.  Are you at work?

                                     LOUISE (V.O.)
                         No, I'm callin' from the Playboy 
                         Mansion.

                                     THELMA
                         I'll call you right back.

               Thelma goes through the living room to the bottom of the 
               stairs and leans on the banister.

                                     THELMA
                         Darryl!  Honey, you'd better hurry 
                         up.

               DARRYL comes trotting down the stairs.  Polyester was made 
               for this man, and he's dripping in "men's" jewelry.  He 
               manages a Carpeteria.

                                     DARRYL
                         Damnit, Thelma, don't holler like 
                         that!  Haven't I told you I can't 
                         stand it when you holler in the 
                         morning.

                                     THELMA
                         I'm sorry, Doll, I just didn't want 
                         you to be late.

               Darryl is checking himself out in the hall mirror, and

               it's obvious he likes what he sees.  He exudes over-confidence 
               for reasons that never become apparent.  He likes to think 
               of himself as a real lady killer.

               He is making imperceptible adjustments to his over-moussed 
               hair.  Thelma watches approvingly.

                                     THELMA
                         Hon.

                                     DARRYL
                         What.

                                     THELMA
                              (she decides not to 
                              tell him)
                         Have a good day at work today.

                                     DARRYL
                         Uh-huh.

                                     THELMA
                         Hon?

                                     DARRYL
                         What?!

                                     THELMA
                         You want anything special for dinner?

                                     DARRYL
                         No, Thelma, I don't give a shit what 
                         we have for dinner.  I may not even 
                         make it home for dinner.  You know 
                         how Fridays are.

                                     THELMA
                         Funny how so many people wanna buy 
                         carpet on a Friday night.  You'd 
                         almost think they's want to forget 
                         about it for the weekend.

                                     DARRYL
                         Well then, it's a good thing you're 
                         not regional manager and I am.

               He's finally ready.  He walks to the door and gives Thelma 
               the most perfunctory kiss on the cheek.

                                     THELMA
                         'Bye, honey.  I won't wait up.

                                     DARRYL
                         See ya.

               Darryl leaves.  We see his Corvette parked out front.  As he 
               closes the front door, Thelma leans against it.

                                     THELMA
                         He's gonna shit.

               Thelma laughs to herself.  She goes back into the kitchen 
               and picks up the phone and dials it.

               INT.  RESTAURANT - MORNING

               The pay phone on the wall RINGS.  ALBERT, a busboy in his 
               50's, answers.

                                     ALBERT
                         Good morning.  Why, yes, she is.  Is 
                         this Thelma?  Oh, Thelma, when you 
                         gonna run away with me?

               Louise comes over and takes the phone out of his hand.

                                     LOUISE
                              (to Albert)
                         Not this weekend, sweetie, she's 
                         runnin' away with me.
                              (into phone)
                         Hi.  What'd he say?

                                     THELMA (V.O.)
                         What time are you gonna pick me up?

                                     LOUISE
                         You're kiddin'!  Alright!  I'll be 
                         there around two or three.

                                     THELMA (V.O.)
                         What kind of stuff do I bring?

                                     LOUISE
                         I don't know.  Warm stuff, I guess.  
                         It's the mountains.  I guess it gets 
                         cold at night.  I'm just gonna bring 
                         everything.

                                     THELMA (V.O.)
                         Okay.  I will, too.

                                     LOUISE
                         And steal Darryl's fishin' stuff.

                                     THELMA (V.O.)
                         I don't know how to fish, Louise.

                                     LOUISE
                         Neither do I, Thelma, but Darryl 
                         does it, how hard can it be?  I'll 
                         see you later.  Be ready.

               They both hang up.

               EXT.  RESTAURANT - DAY

               Louise pulls out in a green '66 T-Bird in mint condition.

               INT.  THELMA'S BEDROOM - CLOSEUP - SUITCASE ON BED - DAY

               Going into the suitcase is bathing suits, wool socks, flannel 
               pajamas, jeans, sweaters, T-shirts, a couple of dresses, way 
               too much stuff for a two-day trip.  REVEAL Thelma, standing 
               in front of a closet, trying to decide what else to bring, 
               as if she's forgotten something.  The room looks like it was 
               decorated entirely from a Sears catalog.  It's really frilly.

               INT.  LOUISE'S BEDROOM - CLOSEUP - SUITCASE ON BED - DAY

               A perfectly ordered suitcase, everything neatly folded and 
               orderly.  Three pairs of underwear, one pair of long 
               underwear, two pairs of pants, two sweaters, one furry robe, 
               one nightgown.  She could be packing for camp.

               REVEAL Louise.  Her room is as orderly as the suitcase.

               Everything matches.  It's not quite as frilly as Thelma's, 
               but it is of the same ilk.  She is debating whether to take 
               an extra pair of socks.  She decides not to and closes the 
               suitcase.  She goes to the phone, picks it up and dials.  We 
               hear:

                                     ANSWERING MACHINE (V.O.)
                         Hi.  This is Jimmy.  I'm not here 
                         right now, but I'll probably be back 
                         'cause... all my stuff's here.  Leave 
                         a message.

               Louise slams down the phone.  A framed picture of Louise and 
               Jimmy sits on the table next to the phone.  She matter-of-
               factly slams that face down, too.

               INT.  THELMA'S BEDROOM - DAY

               Thelma is still throwing stuff in, randomly now.  She talks 
               to herself quietly the whole time.

               She is taking stuff off of her nightstand, a small clock, 
               fingernail scissors, etc.

               She opens the drawer of her nightstand.  Her attitude is 
               purposeful; she looks as if she knows exactly what she's 
               doing; although, frankly, she has no idea, and each decision 
               is completely arbitrary.  As she rifles through it, plucking 
               various items from among the jumbled contents, we see there 
               is a gun in there, one Darryl bought her for protection.  It 
               is unloaded, but there is a box of bullets.  She picks up 
               the gun like it's a rat by the tail and puts it in her purse.

                                     THELMA
                              (muttering to herself)
                         Psycho killers...

               She grabs the box of bullets and throws them in, too.  She 
               tries to close her suitcase, but there is stuff hanging out 
               all over the place.  She stuffs things back in the sides and 
               heaves all her weight against the top.

               EXT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - DAY

               Louise's green '66 T-Bird convertible pulls into the driveway 
               of Thelma's house.  The garage door goes up and Thelma is 
               standing in the garage with all her gear.  A suitcase that 
               looks like it might explode, fishing gear, a cooler, a 
               lantern.  Thelma's car, a beat-up gray Honda, is parked in 
               there, too.  Louise gets out of the driver's seat.

                                     LOUISE
                         We don't need the lantern.  The place 
                         has electricity.

                                     THELMA
                         I wanna take it anyway.  Just in 
                         case.

                                     LOUISE
                         In case of what?

                                     THELMA
                         In case there's some escaped psycho 
                         killer on the loose, who cuts the 
                         electricity off and tries to come in 
                         and kill us.

                                     LOUISE
                              (going along with her)
                         Oh yeah, sure, Thelma, that lantern 
                         will come in real handy.  Maybe we 
                         could tow your car behind, in case 
                         he steals the spark plugs.

                                     THELMA
                         We'd have to.  That thing barely 
                         makes it down the driveway.

               They load everything into the car.  The trunk barely closes.  
               Thelma heaves all her weight against it.  They get into the 
               car and pull out of the driveway.  As they drive down the 
               street, we hear Thelma let out a long howl.

               She is laughing and she sticks her arms straight up in the 
               air.

               EXT.  CAR - DAY

               They are driving down the interstate.  Thelma reaches for 
               her purse and finds the gun.

                                     THELMA
                         Louise, will you take care of the 
                         gun?

               Louise shrieks at the sight of it.

                                     LOUISE
                         Why in hell did you bring that?

               Thelma wonders if Louise is really that naive.

                                     THELMA
                         Oh, come on, Louise... psycho killers, 
                         bears... snakes!  I just don't know 
                         how to use it.  So will you take 
                         care of it?

               Louise reaches over and takes the gun out of Thelma's purse 
               and holds it in her hand.  She tests the weight of it, and 
               then puts it under the seat.  Thelma puts the bullets under 
               the seat.

               They are speeding off down the highway with the RADIO blaring.  
               Louise puts in a TAPE of wild R&B MUSIC.

                                     THELMA
                         Whose place is this again?

                                     LOUISE
                         It's Bob's, the day manager's.  He's 
                         gettin' a divorce, so his wife's 
                         gettin' this place, so he's just 
                         lettin' all his friends use it till 
                         he has to turn over the keys.

                                     THELMA
                         I've never had the chance to go out 
                         of town without Darryl.

                                     LOUISE
                         How come he let you go?

                                     THELMA
                         'Cause I didn't ask him.

                                     LOUISE
                         Aw, shit, Thelma, he's gonna kill 
                         you.

                                     THELMA
                         Well, he has never let me go.  He 
                         never lets me do one goddamn thing 
                         that's any fun.  All he wants me to 
                         do is hang around the house the whole 
                         time while he's out doing God only 
                         knows what.

               They are both silent for a minute.

                                     THELMA
                              (looking straight 
                              ahead)
                         I left him a note.  I left him stuff 
                         to microwave.

               After a pause.

                                     THELMA
                         I guess you haven't heard anything 
                         from Jimmy... yet?

               Louise's jaw tightens.  The car speeds up.

                                     THELMA
                         ...never mind.

               A huge semi-tanker carrying gas passes them on the highway 
               and HONKS.  The mud flaps are the shiny silhouettes of naked 
               women.  There is a bumper sticker on the back that says:  
               "Lick you all over -- ten cents."

                                     LOUISE
                         One of your friends?

               Thelma is watching herself in the side mirror, pretending to 
               smoke a cigarette.

               THELMA'S POV OF A SIGN alongside the road that reads "See 
               you in church on Sunday!"

               Thelma pushes in the lighter and waits for it to pop out.  
               Louise gives her a sidelong glance, but does not say anything.

               INT.  CAR - COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

                                     THELMA
                         How much longer is it gonna be?  I'm 
                         hungry.

                                     LOUISE
                         Another hour of so.  We've got enough 
                         food for a month.

                                     THELMA
                         I'll never make it... Can't we stop 
                         just for a few minutes...

                                     LOUISE
                         We've not gonna get to the cabin 
                         till after dark as it is, Thelma.

                                     THELMA
                         Then what difference does it make if 
                         we stop?  Come on.  I never get to 
                         do stuff like this.

               Louise realizes that Thelma is going to revert to a teenager 
               and continue whining unless she gives in.

                                     LOUISE
                         Alright, but it's gonna be a quick 
                         stop.

               EXT.  SILVER BULLET - NIGHT

               They pull off at a place down on the right all lit up with 
               neon.  It's called the SILVER BULLET.  The sign flashes 
               COCKTAILS -- BEER -- DANCING -- FOOD.  There is a huge gravel 
               parking lot with lots of pickup trucks and older cars.  Even 
               though it's early, you can tell this place is a real night 
               spot.  It's already pretty crowded.

               INT.  SILVER BULLET - NIGHT

               This place is jumpin'.  There are ten pool tables with crowds 
               all around.  The long bar is filled with customers.

               There are tables and booths.  The room is dense with smoke.  
               There is a dance floor, but no one is dancing yet because 
               the band is still setting up.  There are a lot of single 
               men.  Many heads turn and follow Thelma and Louise to an 
               empty table.

                                     LOUISE
                         I haven't seen a place like this 
                         since I left Texas.

                                     THELMA
                         Isn't this fun?

               A WAITRESS comes over and drops two menus on the table.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Y'all wanna drink?

                         No thanks.

                                     THELMA
                         I'll have Wild Turkey straight up 
                         and a Coke back, please.

               As the Waitress leaves:

                                     LOUISE
                         Thelma!

                                     THELMA
                         Tell me somethin'.  Is this my 
                         vacation or isn't it?  I mean, God, 
                         you're as bad as Darryl.

                                     LOUISE
                         I just haven't seen you like this in 
                         a while.  I'm used to seeing you 
                         more sedate.

                                     THELMA
                         Well, I've had it up to my ass with 
                         sedate!  You said you and me was 
                         gonna get outta town and, for once, 
                         just really let our hair down.  Well, 
                         darlin,' look out 'cause my hair is 
                         comin' down!

               As the Waitress returns:

                                     LOUISE
                              (laughing)
                         Alright...
                              (to Waitress)
                         I changed my mind.  I'll have a 
                         margarita with and a shot of Cuervo 
                         on the side, please.

                                     THELMA
                         Yeah!

               As the Waitress leaves, a MAN comes over with a chair which 
               he pulls up to the table and straddles backwards.

               He is in his late-40's, heavyset, his face is shiny in the 
               neon light.

                                     MAN
                         Now what are a couple of Kewpie dolls 
                         like you doin' in a place like this?

                         LOUISE
                 Mindin' our own 
                 business, why don't 
                 you try it.

                                                       THELMA
                                               Well, we left town for the 
                                               weekend 'cause we wanted 
                                               to try and have a good 
                                               time.  And because Louise 
                                               here is mad because her 
                                               boyfriend won't call her 
                                               while he's out on the 
                                               road... 

               Louise kicks Thelma under the table.

                                     THELMA
                              (quieter)
                         We just wanted to get somethin' to 
                         eat.

                                     MAN
                         Well, you come to the right place.  
                         You like chili?  They got good chili.

               The Waitress returns with Louise's drink.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Harlan, are you botherin' these poor 
                         girls?

                                     HARLAN (MAN)
                         Hell, no.  I was just bein' friendly.

                                     WAITRESS
                              (making eye contact 
                              with Louise)
                         It's a good thing they're not all as 
                         friendly as you.

               Louise understands.

                                     THELMA
                         Your name's Harlan?  I got an uncle 
                         named Harlan!

                                     HARLAN
                         You do?  Is he a funny uncle? 'Cause 
                         if he is, then he and I got somethin' 
                         in common.

               Harlan laughs.  Thelma laughs, too, but doesn't really get 
               the joke.  Louise does not laugh.

                                     LOUISE
                              (to Harlan)
                         I don't mean to be rude, but I've 
                         got something I need to talk to my 
                         friend about.  In private.

                                     HARLAN
                         Aw, I understand.  I didn't mean to 
                         bother ya.  It's just hard not to 
                         notice two such pretty ladies as 
                         yourselves.
                              (standing, to Thelma)
                         You better dance with me before you 
                         leave, or I'll never forgive you.

                                     THELMA
                         Oh, sure.  That'd be fun.

               Harlan leaves, then:

                                     THELMA
                         Jeez, Louise, that wasn't very nice.

                                     LOUISE
                         Can't you tell when somebody's hittin' 
                         on you?

                                     THELMA
                         So what if he was?  It's all your 
                         years of waitin' tables has made you 
                         jaded, that's all.

                                     LOUISE
                         Maybe.

                                     THELMA
                         Well, just relax, will ya.  You're 
                         makin' me nervous.

               Thelma knocks back her shot of Wild Turkey and holds up her 
               glass to the Waitress to bring her another one.  The Waitress 
               sees her and nods.  She turns back to face her friend.

                                     THELMA
                         So, Jimmy still hasn't called yet?

                                     LOUISE
                         Givin' him a taste of his own 
                         medicine.  Asshole.

                                     THELMA
                         I'm sorry, Louise.  I know you're 
                         all upset.  It's just I'm so excited 
                         to be out of the house, I guess.
                              (pause)
                         I wonder if Darryl's home yet.

                                     LOUISE
                         I wonder if Jimmy's gotten back.

                                     THELMA
                         Why don't you tell him to just to 
                         get lost once and for all?

                                     LOUISE
                         Why don't you ditch that loser husband 
                         of yours?

               They both drift off momentarily, contemplating their domestic 
               problems, until the Waitress comes over:

                                     WAITRESS
                              (rolling her eyes)
                         This one's on Harlan.

               Thelma looks over at the bar where Harlan is grinning at 
               her, making dancing motions.  She smiles and waves at him.

               Her face becomes serious again as she turns back to Louise.

                                     THELMA
                         Jimmy'll come in off the road, you 
                         won't be there, he'll freak out and 
                         call you a hundred thousand times, 
                         and Sunday night you'll call him 
                         back and, by Monday.  He'll be kissin' 
                         the ground you walk on.

               Thelma's mind goes too fast for her mouth, and the speed at 
               which she speaks can be staggering.  Louise is used to it.  
               Louise smiles wistfully at Thelma's assessment of the 
               situation.

                                     LOUISE
                         Exactly.

                                     THELMA
                         In the meantime, you said we were 
                         gonna have some fun.  So let's have 
                         some!

               She again drinks her whole shot of Wild Turkey and holds up 
               her glass, as the BAND strikes up a lively tune.

               Practically the whole place "whoops" and heads for the dance 
               floor.  Louise drinks her shot of tequila and holds up her 
               glass, too.

               LATER

               Thelma is dancing with Harlan and has been for quite a while.  
               Louise has been dancing with a quiet guy named DAN.  Thelma 
               is breathless, drunk and giggly.  She holds a beer bottle in 
               one hand.  She is laughing a lot about nothing, and Harlan 
               is studying her closely.  Louise notices this.

                                     LOUISE
                              (over the noise)
                         Thelma, I'm gonna hit the little 
                         girls' room, and then we gotta hit 
                         the road.

                                     THELMA
                              (eyes closed, swaying 
                              with the music)
                         Ready when you are.

               Louise heads off to the bathroom.

                                     THELMA
                              (eyes still closed)
                         Louise, I'm gonna come with you.
                              (she gets a funny 
                              look on her face)
                         I don't feel so good.

               She stumbles a step and drops her beer bottle.

               Louise is heading towards the bathroom, where there is a 
               line of at least fifteen women in front of her.

                                     HARLAN
                              (catching Thelma, 
                              copping feels)
                         Oopsy-doopsy.  We need to get you 
                         some fresh air, little lady.

               He steers her towards the door.

               Louise leans against the wall, waiting in line.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT.  SILVER BULLET PARKING LOT - NIGHT

               Harlan is hauling Thelma out the door into the parking lot.  
               She is pretty limp.

                                     THELMA
                         Oh shit.

                                     HARLAN
                         What's wrong?

                                     THELMA
                         Stop.

                                     HARLAN
                         What for?

                                     THELMA
                         I'm spinning.

               INT.  SILVER BULLET - NIGHT

               The Waitress is going over to their table.  She picks up 
               Thelma's purse off the floor and puts it on her chair.

               She sets the check on the table, looks around to see if she 
               can see them and walks away.

               INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT

               Louise goes into the bathroom.  She stands in front of the 
               sink and looks at herself in the mirror.

               EXT.  PARKING LOT - NIGHT

               Thelma has been sick.  She has Harlan's handkerchief and is 
               wiping her mouth.  Harlan has backed off for this part, but 
               he's right back in there.

                                     HARLAN
                         How you feelin' now, darlin'?

               Harlan is leaning close to Thelma's head, and she pulls her 
               head away.

                                     THELMA
                         I guess I'm startin' to feel a little 
                         better.

                                     HARLAN
                         Yeah, you're startin' to feel pretty 
                         good to me, too.

               He pulls her to him and tries to put his arms around her.  
               Thelma pulls away.

                                     THELMA
                              (uncomfortable)
                         I think I need to keep walking.

               INT.  SILVER BULLET - NIGHT

               Louise comes out of the bathroom as the next woman goes in.  
               She scans the room looking for Thelma.  She doesn't see her.  
               She goes over to the table and sees Thelma's stuff there.  
               She picks up the check and looks at it.

               EXT.  SILVER BULLET PARKING LOT - NIGHT

               Harlan has led Thelma off to the far end of the parking lot.  
               He is trying to kiss her now.  He is pushing her arms down 
               and turning her head away.

                                     THELMA
                         Don't.  I'm married.  I don't feel 
                         good.  I've been sick.

                                     HARLAN
                         It's okay.  I'm married, too.

               Harlan is pushing himself on her now, and she is beginning 
               to push him away harder.

               INT.  SILVER BULLET - NIGHT

               Louise is paying the Waitress.  The Waitress is shaking her 
               head, indicating she hasn't seen Thelma either.

               Louise picks up Thelma's stuff and heads towards the door.

               EXT.  SILVER BULLET PARKING LOT - NIGHT

               Harlan has now pinned Thelma against the back of a car and 
               is kissing her neck.  He has her ass in his hands.  He is 
               beginning to hump her.  She is pushing him away as hard as 
               she can, but he is relentless.

                                     HARLAN
                              (breathing heavily)
                         You're beautiful.  It's okay.  I 
                         won't hurt you.  It's okay.

                                     THELMA
                              (struggling)
                         Stop it!  Goddamnit, I mean it!  
                         Louise is gonna wonder where I am.  
                         Let go!

                                     HARLAN
                         Louise is alright.

               LOUISE

               is now standing outside the door of the Silver Bullet.  She 
               is looking around.

               HARLAN

               is pulling at Thelma's clothes.  Thelma gets one of her arms 
               free and hits him hard in the face.  He hits her back and 
               grabs her face, squeezing it hard.

                                     HARLAN
                         Don't you hit me!  Don't you fucking 
                         hit me!

               There is no trace of friendliness in his face now.  He looks 
               mean and dangerous.  He lets go of her face and pins her 
               arms behind her.  He holds both of her arms with one hand.

                                     HARLAN
                         You just shut up.

               With his free hand, he reaches down and starts to pull her 
               dress up.  Thelma is still struggling and there are tears 
               running down her face.

                                     THELMA
                         Don't hurt me.  Harlan.  Please.

                                     HARLAN
                         Shut up.

               He turns her around, pushing her face down onto the back of 
               the car.  He holds both her arms in one hand and continues 
               pulling her dress up over her hips.  He starts to undo his 
               pants as we hear the CRUNCH of gravel.

                                     LOUISE (O.S.)
                         Let her go.

                                     HARLAN
                         Get lost.

                                     THELMA
                         Louise!

               TIGHT SHOT of the barrel of Thelma's gun being pressed into 
               the nape of Harlan's neck.  Louise's thumb pulls back the 
               hammer.

                                     LOUISE
                         You let her go, you fat fucking 
                         asshole, or I'm gonna splatter your 
                         ugly face all over this nice car.

               Harlan slowly raises his hands in the air, and Thelma darts 
               out, pulling her dress down.

                                     HARLAN
                         Now, calm down.  We were just havin' 
                         a little fun.

               Louise glances at Thelma.  Thelma shakes her head no.

                                     LOUISE
                         Looks like you've got a real fucked 
                         up idea of fun.  Now turn around.

               Louise starts to back away, but the gun is still close to 
               his face.  His pants are undone in the front.  She is still 
               backing away with the gun raised.  Thelma is inching away as 
               well.

                                     LOUISE
                         Just for the future, when a woman's 
                         crying like that, she's not having 
                         any fun!

               Louise lowers the gun and stares at him for a second.  Then 
               she turns and walks away.  Thelma does, too.

                                     HARLAN
                              (pulling up his pants)
                         Bitch.  I should have gone ahead and 
                         fucked her.

               Louise stops in her tracks.

                                     LOUISE
                         What did you say?

                                     HARLAN
                         I said suck my cock.

               Louise takes two long strides back towards him, raises the 
               gun and FIRES a bullet into his face.  We hear his body HIT 
               the gravel parking lot.  LOUISE'S POV.  The car behind him 
               is splattered with blood.  Thelma and Louise are both silent.  
               We hear the SOUND of the nightclub in the distance.  Louise 
               lowers the gun.

                                     THELMA
                         Oh my God.

                                     LOUISE
                         Get the car.

                                     THELMA
                         Jesus Christ!  Louise, you shot him.

                                     LOUISE
                         Get the car!

               Thelma runs to get the car.

                                     LOUISE
                              (quietly, to herself)
                         You watch your mouth, buddy.

               Thelma comes careening up in reverse.  Louise hops in and 
               Thelma PEELS OUT, spraying gravel.  As they speed out of the 
               parking lot back to the road, we hear MUSIC blaring from the 
               nightclub.  They hit the main road with tires SQUEALING.

                                     LOUISE
                         Get back to the interstate.

               Louise lifts her hand and notices she is still holding the 
               gun.

                                     THELMA
                         Shit!  I... I, which way?

                                     LOUISE
                         West.  Left.

               EXT.  CAR - DISTANCING SHOT - NIGHT

               They get onto the interstate going west.

               TRAVELING SHOT FROM BEHIND -- VARIOUS DRIVING SHOTS

               INT.  CAR - NIGHT

               Louise picks up the handkerchief from the car seat and wipes 
               the gun off.  Her movements are as if in slow motion.  She 
               puts the gun under the seat.  Thelma is watching her.

                                     THELMA
                         Louise.

               Louise does not answer.

                                     THELMA
                         Louise.  Where are we going?

                                     LOUISE
                              (shaking)
                         I don't know, Thelma!  I don't know!  
                         Just shut up a minute so I can think.

               Thelma starts to cry quietly.

                                     THELMA
                         Shouldn't we go to the cops?  I mean, 
                         I think we should tell the police.

                                     LOUISE
                         Tell them what?!  What, Thelma?  
                         What do you think we should tell 
                         them?

                                     THELMA
                         I don't know.  Just tell 'em what 
                         happened.

                                     LOUISE
                         Which part?

                                     THELMA
                         All of it.  That he tried to rape 
                         me.

                                     LOUISE
                         Only about a hundred people saw you 
                         cheek to goddamn cheek with him all 
                         night, Thelma!  Who's gonna believe 
                         that?!  We just don't live in that 
                         kind of world.  Pull over!

               EXT.  INTERSTATE - NIGHT

               Thelma pulls off to the side of the road.  Louise gets out 
               and starts to walk around the car.  She stops when she gets 
               to the back of the car, and she is sick.  Thelma waits in 
               the car and moves over to the passenger side.  Louise gets 
               in the driver's side.

                                     THELMA
                         Louise... Are you alright?

               Louise rests her head on the steering wheel.

                                     LOUISE
                         Oh Christ.
                              (to Thelma)
                         Thelma.

               Thelma doesn't hear.

                                     LOUISE
                         Thelma.

               Thelma looks at her blankly, without answering.

                                     LOUISE
                         I've gotta stop for a minute.  I've 
                         got to get it together.  I'm gonna 
                         find a place to get a cup of coffee 
                         and I'm gonna sit down for a second.  
                         Do you want to come?

               Thelma's head moves almost imperceptibly.  Louise studies 
               Thelma's face.

                                     LOUISE
                         Is that yes?  Are you up to this?

               Again, Thelma slightly moves her head in a nod.  Louise puts 
               the car in gear and pulls OUT OF SHOT.

               EXT.  TRUCK STOP - RESTAURANT - NIGHT

               The green '66 T-Bird pulls into a modern truck stop and parks.  
               Louise turns to Thelma.

                                     LOUISE
                         We gotta be inconspicuous.  Do you 
                         know what that means?

                                     THELMA
                         Yes.

                                     LOUISE
                         It means you don't talk to anybody.  
                         You don't draw attention to yourself 
                         in any way.  Do you understand that?

               Again, she twitches more than nods.

                                     LOUISE
                         Tell me you understand that.

               Thelma nods more firmly now.  She understands.

               VARIOUS POV SHOTS of truck drivers seeing Thelma and Louise 
               wind their way towards the restaurant portion of the coffee 
               shop.  They look small and incongruous with the surroundings.

               INT.  TRUCK STOP - TIGHT SHOT - WAITRESS' HANDS - 4 A.M.

               slamming dirty coffee cups from the counter into a bus tray 
               underneath the counter.  REVEAL Louise and Thelma sitting at 
               the counter.  Louise is looking at a map.  The car is parked 
               outside, near the door.

                                     LOUISE
                              (halfway to herself)
                         We have to think this through.  We 
                         have to be smart.  Now is not the 
                         time to panic.  If we panic now, 
                         we're done for.  Nobody saw it.  
                         Nobody knows it was us.  We're still 
                         okay.  Now all we have to do is just 
                         figure out our next move.

                                     THELMA
                         Our next move?  I'll say one thing, 
                         Louise.  This is some vacation.  I 
                         sure am having a good time.  This is 
                         real fun.

                                     LOUISE
                         If you weren't so concerned with 
                         having a good time, we wouldn't be 
                         here right now.

                                     THELMA
                         Just what is that supposed to mean?

                                     LOUISE
                         It means shut up, Thelma.

                                     THELMA
                         So this is all my fault, is it.

               Louise looks at Thelma for a long time.

                                     LOUISE
                         Just shut up.

               The Waitress comes and fills their coffee cups.

               Thelma stands up to go to the bathroom.  She grabs her purse 
               from the counter, and the strap catches on her coffee cup 
               and it falls to the floor with a CRASH.  All heads turn and 
               look at her.

                                     THELMA
                         I have to go to the bathroom.  I...  
                         Sorry.

               HOLD on Louise.

               EXT.  SILVER BULLET PARKING LOT - 4:00 A.M.

               Police cars are parked around.  The activity has died down.  
               Doors on the coroner's van SLAM shut.  In the back of a police 
               car sits the Waitress with the door open.  A DETECTIVE in a 
               suit leans over the car door with his note pad.

                                     HAL
                         Could you identify 'em, if ya saw 
                         'em again?

                                     LENA (WAITRESS)
                         Hal, I've told you about twenty times, 
                         yes, I could identify 'em, but neither 
                         one of them was the type to pull 
                         something like this.

                                     HAL
                         Well, you're not exactly an expert 
                         witness, but what makes you so sure?

                         If waitin' tables in a bar don't 
                         make you an expert on human nature, 
                         then nothin' will, and I could've 
                         told you that Harlan Puckett would 
                         end up buyin' it in a parkin' lot.  
                         I'm just surprised it didn't happen 
                         before now.

                                     HAL
                         Who do you think did it?

                         Has anybody asked his wife?  She's 
                         the one I hope did it.

                         Lena, just cut the bullshit, will 
                         ya?  Do have any ideas or don't ya?  
                         I been standin' in this stupid parkin' 
                         lot all goddamn night, and I still 
                         got to go file a report before I can 
                         go home in time to get back up again!

                                     LENA
                         Well, if I had to guess, I'd say it 
                         was some ol' gal, some ol' gal's 
                         husband.  But it wasn't either one 
                         of those two.  The tall one, the 
                         redhead, she left me a huge tip.

                                     HAL
                         You didn't happen to notice what 
                         kind of car they were driving?

                                     LENA
                         It's a nightclub, not a drive-in, 
                         Hal.  I don't follow the customers 
                         to the parking lot.

                                     HAL
                         Alright, Lena.  Go on home.  We might 
                         have to call you in for some more 
                         questioning.

               Lena gets out of the back of the car.

                                     LENA
                         Those girls are not the murderous

               INT.  PAY PHONE - NIGHT

               Outside the bathroom there is a pay phone.  Thelma picks it 
               up and dials.

                                     THELMA
                              (into phone)
                         Collect from Thelma.

               There is no answer.

               INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               Phone RINGS.

               VARIOUS SHOTS of the interior of the empty Dickinson house:

               THE BEDROOM

               exactly as Thelma left it.  The drawer of the nightstand 
               still open.

               THE NOTE TO DARRYL

               taped to the refrigerator.  The interior of the microwave 
               with a now completely thawed microwave dinner still in the 
               package in a little puddle.

               INT.  TRUCK STOP - NIGHT

                                     THELMA
                         Thanks.  I'll try later.

               She hangs up and goes into the bathroom.  As the door closes 
               behind her, Louise comes up with a handful of change and 
               starts putting it into the phone.  She dials a number.  It 
               RINGS for a long time.  She hangs up and goes into the 
               bathroom.  She looks at herself in the mirror.

               She notices a tiny speck on her cheek.  She takes a paper 
               towel and wets it and rubs the spot.  She looks at the towel 
               and there is a bright red streak.

                                     LOUISE
                         Thelma... Come on, Thelma!

               The door of the stall flies open and Thelma comes charging 
               out and heads straight for the door, without even looking at 
               Louise.  Louise charges out after her.  They head out of the 
               restaurant and, THROUGH THE WINDOW, we see them get into the 
               car and drive away.

               EXT.  CAR - DRIVING SHOT - DAWN

               The T-Bird barrels down a fairly empty four-lane highway.

               A truck passes going the other way.

               INT.  CAR - DAWN

               The top is down on the car, and Thelma is slouched on the 
               seat, her hair blowing wildly.

                                     LOUISE
                         We're gonna go to the next town and 
                         stop.  We'll get a motel room.  I 
                         can rest for a while and then figure 
                         out how to get some money.  We're 
                         gonna need money.  Thelma.  How much 
                         money do you have with you?

                                     THELMA
                         What?  Oh, I don't know.  Let me 
                         look.

               Thelma is rummaging through her purse.  She finds her wallet 
               and takes it out.  Thelma finds some bills stuffed in the 
               change compartment and takes them out.  She straightens the 
               money out.

                                     THELMA
                         Sixty-four dollars.

               As she is counting it, one of the bills flies out of her 
               hands.  Thelma's not that good at handling money.

                                     THELMA
                         Umm.  Shit.  Forty-four dollars.

               Louise has not noticed any of this.  She is so intent on her 
               driving.

                                     THELMA
                         I'm cash poor.

                                     LOUISE
                         Hmmm.  We gotta get some money.

               EXT.  MOTEL - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY

               The motel is near farms and agricultural areas with crops.

               INT.  MOTEL ROOM - DAY (6 A.M.)

               The curtains are open and we can see the car parked right 
               outside the room.  Thelma is lying on the bed staring up at 
               the ceiling.  Louise is bustling around the room, putting 
               things in drawers.

                                     THELMA
                         Why are you unpacking?  You said we 
                         were just gonna take a nap.

               Louise did not realize she was doing it.

                                     LOUISE
                         Oh, I don't know.  I'm just nervous.  
                         I gotta figure out what to do.

                                     THELMA
                         Well, when you figure it out, wake 
                         me up.

                                     LOUISE
                         Just what the hell is wrong with 
                         you?

               Louise slams the closet door.  Thelma jumps.

                                     THELMA
                         What do you mean?

                                     LOUISE
                         Why are you actin' like this?

                                     THELMA
                         Actin' like what?!  How am I supposed 
                         to act?  'Scuse me for not knowing 
                         what to do after you blow somebody's 
                         head off!

               They are silent for a moment.

                                     LOUISE
                         You could help me try and figure it 
                         out!  I gotta figure out what to do, 
                         and you could try and help me.

                                     THELMA
                         I suggested we go to the police, but 
                         you didn't like that; so, frankly, 
                         Louise, I'm all out of ideas.

                                     LOUISE
                         Well, what's the big rush, Thelma?  
                         If we just give 'em some time, they'll 
                         come to us...!  Oh Christ.  I'm just 
                         not ready to go to jail yet.  Why 
                         don't you go out to the pool or 
                         something and I'll figure it out...

                                     THELMA
                         Give me the keys.

                                     LOUISE
                         You're not touchin' that car.

                                     THELMA
                         My stuff's in the trunk!  God!  You 
                         care more about that car than you do 
                         about most people.

                                     LOUISE
                         Most people just cause me trouble, 
                         but that car always gets me out of 
                         it.

               INT.  POLICE GARAGE - DAY

               Hal is at the police station where they're dusting the car 
               with Harlan all over it for prints.  Hal looks closely at 
               the back of the car.  He holds his hands over two sets of 
               hand prints.  He moves his hands to the outside of the prints 
               so as not to smear them, and puts his hands on the car.  His 
               face is one inch away from the trunk.  He sees a very clear 
               drop of blood.  It's different than any of the other blood 
               splatters on the car.  He calls the identification technician 
               over and points it out.

                                     HAL
                              (pointing)
                         What's that?

               The I.D. TECH comes over and looks and shrugs his shoulders.

                                     I.D. TECH
                         Blood?

                                     HAL
                         Whose?

                                     I.D. TECH
                         His, I guess...

               Hal makes a face like he suddenly felt a slight toothache.

               He stares at the guy.

                                     HAL
                         You guess?

               Hal takes out a black sharpie and draws a circle around the 
               area of the black smudge and the drop of blood.  He shakes 
               his head slightly.

               EXT.  MOTEL - DAY

               Thelma comes out of the room and walks towards the pool.

               She stops, then decides to go on to the pool.  She lies down 
               in a lounge chair facing the road.

               INT.  MOTEL ROOM - DAY

               Louise in the motel room.  She's looking at the phone.  She 
               picks it up and dials it and watches herself in the mirror.  
               She stares as if she's trying to see into herself, see through 
               herself.

               EXT.  MOTEL POOL - DAY

               Thelma arranges herself in a lounge chair, trying desperately 
               to feel like she's on vacation.

                         right now...

               A VOICE interrupts the message:

                                     JIMMY (V.O.)
                         Hello!  I'm here.  Hang on a minute!

               The machine switches OFF.

               INT.  JIMMY'S APARTMENT - DAY

               JIMMY, mid-30's, musician, is standing in the kitchen on the

               never seen herself before.

                         is going on here!  I come back, nobody 
                         knows where you are.  Is Thelma with 
                         you?  Darryl's been callin' here 
                         every half-hour sayin' he's gonna 
                         kill you both when you get back,

               holds the indent-a-kit.  Hal picks up the drawing and studies 
               it closely.

               The T-Bird rolls into town.

               EXT.  COUNTRY STORE - DAY

               Louise and Thelma pull up in front of an old store, the kind 
               with a wooden front porch, the kind that sells bait and 
               flannel shirts.  They enter the store and see an OLD MAN 
               behind the counter.

                         'Round the side, by the restrooms.

               Louise gets change while Thelma strolls around looking at 
               rubber worms and pickled pigs' feet.  Louise goes out to the 
               phone.

               Thelma in store buying gum, beef jerky.  Next to the cash 
               register on the counter on display are those little tiny 
               bottles of liquor.  Thelma picks up a little bottle of Wild 
               Turkey and puts in on the counter.  The Old Man rings it up.  
               She takes another one and puts it on the counter.

               The Old Man is still ringing stuff up.

               She takes two more and puts them on the counter.  She takes 
               the rest of the little bottles of Wild Turkey out of the 
               display and puts them on the counter.  She takes one little 
               bottle of Cuervo and puts it down on the counter, too.  The 
               Old Man finally looks at her.  From the wall behind him, he 
               takes a pint of Wild Turkey down.

               Thelma comes out of the front of the store.  The store is at 
               a crossroads with a fair amount of vehicular traffic.

               Thelma is walking towards the car.  She puts her purse in 
               the front seat.  She looks at Louise.

               THELMA

               walks around to the side of the building to the phone.  She

               There are beer cans everywhere.  The large screen TV is ON, 
               showing a FOOTBALL GAME.  Darryl is in a recliner.  He is 
               wearing loud shorts, a V-necked T-shirt, and a couple of

                         Hold on.  Hold on a minute, damnit.

               He covers the mouthpiece and watches a play where "his team" 
               fumbles the ball.  This only makes him madder.  He puts the 
               phone back to his ear in time to hear Thelma say:

                         What?

                         Go fuck yourself.

               She hangs up on him.

               EXT.  COUNTRY STORE - DAY

               Thelma has tears running down her face and she is watching 
               the ground as she storms back to the car.  So she makes a 
               loud grunt as she slams into someone that she did not see.

               Both people are knocked back a few steps from the force of 
               the collision.

                                     HITCHHIKER
                         Whoa!  Excuse me!  Miss, are you 
                         alright?

               Thelma nods her head "yes," but tears continue.  Her crying 
               is silent.

                                     HITCHHIKER
                         Is there anything I can do?

               Thelma shakes her head "no." She tries to control her tears.  
               She notices how blue his eyes are.

                                     THELMA
                         No.  Thanks.  Sorry.

               THELMA

               collects herself as she walks back to the car.  She gets in 
               and is drying her eyes, looking in the side mirror.  In the 
               mirror she sees the Hitchhiker come back around from the 
               side of the building.  He is several feet behind the car, 
               and she watches him as he removes his long-sleeved shirt and 
               stuffs it into his duffel bag.  Now he is just in T-shirt 
               and jeans.  He looks good.  Really good.  She watches in the 
               mirror as he picks up his stuff and heads towards the road.  
               She can see him as he's walking.  He stops.  He's thinking.  
               He heads over to the car.

                                     HITCHHIKER
                         Would you mind me asking which 
                         direction you and your friend are 
                         going?  I'm trying to get back to 
                         school and my ride fell through, so 
                         I'm kinda stuck.  Are you going my 
                         way?

               Thelma doesn't know what to do.

                                     THELMA
                         Umm.  I think we're going to Oklahoma 
                         City.  But I'm not sure.

                                     HITCHHIKER
                         Do you think you could... I mean, I 
                         could help pay for gas.

               Thelma knows Louise isn't going to like this.

                                     THELMA
                         Ummm.  Well, see, it's not really up 
                         to me.  It's not my car.  Umm, we'll 
                         have to ask my friend, but she'll 
                         probably say no.  She's a little 
                         uptight.

                                     HITCHHIKER
                         Well.  Maybe we better not ask her.  
                         But thank you anyway.

               Now she wants him to come.  He starts to walk away from the 
               car.

                                     THELMA
                         Well, we can ask her.  That won't 
                         hurt.

               Just then Louise comes out of the store.  She sees Thelma 
               talking to this guy and, for one moment, stops dead in her 
               tracks as she takes this in, then continues toward the car.  
               Although her face is basically expressionless, we see that 
               it's possible she might kill Thelma.

                                     THELMA
                         Louise, this young man is on his way 
                         back to school and needs a ride, and 
                         I thought since...

                                     LOUISE
                         It's probably not a good idea.

                                     THELMA
                         Louise.

               The Hitchhiker just nods and starts walking towards the road.

                                     HITCHHIKER
                         Y'all have a nice day.  Drive safe.

               The guy does seem really nice and Thelma is really frustrated 
               that Louise wouldn't give him a ride, but decides not to 
               confront her.

                                     THELMA
                         See how polite he is?  He was really 
                         nice.

               Louise lowers the top and backs the car out.  They watch him 
               walk away.

               Louise pulls out of the parking lot onto the road.  They 
               pass the Hitchhiker.  Thelma waves.

                                     HITCHHIKER
                              (to Thelma)
                         You cheer up now!

               She turns around in the seat to continue waving.  He smiles 
               and waves.  They drive down the road.  TIGHT SHOT of the 
               Hitchhiker as the smile fades from his face.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT.  CAR - DRIVING - DAY

               Thelma looking sulky.

                                     THELMA
                         I wish we could've brought him with 
                         us.

                                     LOUISE
                         What did Darryl say?

                                     THELMA
                              (sarcastically)
                         He said "Okay, Thelma.  I just wanted 
                         to know you were alright.  I hope 
                         you're havin' a good time.  You sure 
                         deserve one after puttin' up with me 
                         all the time.  I love you, honey."

               Louise doesn't say anything.

                                     THELMA
                         How long before we're in Goddamn 
                         Mexico?

               INT.  POLICE STATION - DAY

               Hal goes over a list of every registered green T-Bird in the 
               state.

               INSERT - COMPUTER MONITOR

               Names are scrolling by as Hal stares blankly at the screen.  
               We see the name LOUISE ELIZABETH SAWYER scroll past.  It 
               means nothing to Hal.

               INT.  CAR - DAY

               It's twenty minutes later.  They are clear of the town.  
               Thelma is like a dog with a bone.  She just won't let it 
               drop.

                                     THELMA
                         I just don't see what it would hurt 
                         just to give somebody a ride.  Did 
                         you see his butt?  Darryl doesn't 
                         have a cute butt.  You could park a 
                         car in the shadow of his ass.

                                     LOUISE
                         I'm sorry.  I'm just not in the mood 
                         for company right now.  Here.  Take 
                         this map.  I need you to find all 
                         the secondary roads to Mexico from 
                         Oklahoma City.  I think we should 
                         stay off the interstates.  We're too 
                         conspicuous.

                                     THELMA
                              (taking map)
                         Well, it looks like we can get on 
                         this road 81 that heads down towards 
                         Dallas, then cut over to...

                                     LOUISE
                              (interrupting)
                         I don't want to go that way.  Find a 
                         way that we don't have to go through 
                         Texas.

                                     THELMA
                              (looking at map)
                         Wait.  What?  You want to go to Mexico 
                         from Oklahoma and you don't want to 
                         go through Texas?

                                     LOUISE
                         You know how I feel about Texas...  
                         We're not going that way.

                                     THELMA
                         I know, Louise, but we're running 
                         for our lives!  Don't you think you 
                         could make an exception just this 
                         once?!  I mean, look at the map.  
                         The only thing between Oklahoma and 
                         Mexico is Texas!

                                     LOUISE
                         Thelma!  I'm not gonna talk about 
                         this!  Now find another way or give 
                         me the goddamn map and I will!  You 
                         understand?

                                     THELMA
                         No, Louise.  How come you never said 
                         what happened?

               Louise is completely unreasonable on this subject and Thelma 
               is totally puzzled by Louise's reaction but is reluctant to 
               press her further.

                                     LOUISE
                         I... I just... I just don't think 
                         it's the place I wanna get caught 
                         for doin' something like... if you 
                         blow a guy's head off with his pants 
                         down, believe me, Texas is the last 
                         place you wanna get caught!  Trust 
                         me!  Now, I said, I don't wanna talk 
                         about it!!

               Louise looks very shaken up.  She keeps her eyes on the road 
               but she's holding the steering wheel so tightly, her knuckles 
               are white.  She does not look at Thelma.  Suddenly she reaches 
               over and locks her door.  Thelma flinches imperceptibly at 
               this gesture.

                                     THELMA
                         Okay.  We'll go around Texas to get 
                         to Mexico.  This is crazy.

               EXT.  ROAD - FARMLAND - DAY

               Two Harley-Davidson bikes tool past, driven by a couple of 
               ex-hippies from the 60's.  The Hitchhiker is on the back of 
               one, and he waves to them as they go by.  Thelma waves back 
               enthusiastically.

                                     THELMA
                         I'll tell you what.  He is gooood 
                         lookin'.

               Louise pops a TAPE into the cassette player.

               EXT.  LOUISE'S APARTMENT COMPLEX - DAY

               Hal walks up the sidewalk past a couple of elderly people 
               sitting outside, to the door of an apartment complex and 
               knocks.

               INT.  LOUISE'S APARTMENT - DAY

               VARIOUS SHOTS of Louise's empty apartment.

               There are pictures of Louise and Thelma in high school.

               The kitchen is spotless and nothing is out on the counters.

               HER BED

               is unwrinkled, perfect, and next to it on her nightstand is 
               a picture of Jimmy and her in a small heart shaped frame.

               Everything is extremely neat and orderly.

               EXT.  LOUISE'S APARTMENT COMPLEX - DAY

               Hal is walking back down the sidewalk past the old people.

               He stops, turns around and goes back to them.  We see him 
               stand and talk to them.

               OVER MUSIC:

               INT.  CAR - DAY

               Thelma and Louise are singing along with the MUSIC.

                                     THELMA/LOUISE
                              (pointing)
                         Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

               EXT.  CROSSROADS - DAY

               Hitchhiker standing on the side of the road.  Thelma looks 
               at Louise pleadingly.  Louise's car pulls over and he hops 
               in the back seat.  An animated Thelma turns around backwards 
               in the front seat to face him.

               INT./ EXT.  COFFEE SHOP - DAY

               Hal walks into the coffee shop where Louise works.  VARIOUS 
               SHOTS of him talking to other employees.  Albert, waitress, 
               etc.  Some cover their mouths as they recognize police 
               sketches of Louise and Thelma.  The Day Manager comes over, 
               looks at the pictures and talks to Hal.

               INT.  CAR

               Thelma passing out beef jerky and Wild Turkey to Hitchhiker 
               and Louise.

               EXT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - DAY

               Hal's unmarked detective car pulls up in front of Thelma's 
               house.  A Corvette, completely customized with everything, 
               sits in the driveway.

               INT.  CAR

               Hitchhiker leans over resting his chin on the back of the 
               front seat.

                                     THELMA
                         So J.D., what are you studying in 
                         school?

                                     J.D.
                         Human nature.  I'm majoring in 
                         behavioral science.

                                     LOUISE
                         And whaddya wanna be when ya grow 
                         up?

                                     J.D.
                         A waiter.

               Louise laughs.  He has charmed her too.

               EXT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - DAY

               Hal is walking up the sidewalk as the front door flies open 
               to reveal a drunk Darryl in Hawaiian shorts, necklaces and a 
               beer can in his hand.

               INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - DAY

               Hal and Darryl in den.  The TV DRONES in the b.g.

               Pictures and papers are on the table.  TIGHT SHOT of Darryl's 
               face.

                                     DARRYL
                         What?!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - DEN - DAY

               EXTREME CLOSEUP of Darryl's face.

                                     DARRYL
                         What?!!

               EXT.  RURAL HIGHWAY - DAY

                                     J.D.
                              (to Thelma)
                         So how come you don't have any kids?

                                     THELMA
                         Darryl, that's my husband, he says 
                         he's not ready.  He's still too much 
                         of a kid himself.  He prides himself 
                         on being infantile.

                                     LOUISE
                         He's got a lot to be proud of.

                                     THELMA
                         Louise and Darryl don't get along.

                                     LOUISE
                         That's puttin' it mildly.

                                     THELMA
                         She thinks he's a pig.

                                     LOUISE
                         He's a real piece o' work.  I wish 
                         you could meet him.

                                     J.D.
                         Did you get married real young?

                                     THELMA
                         Twenty-four isn't young.  I'd already 
                         been goin' out with him ten years 
                         when we got married.  I've never 
                         been with anybody but Darryl.

                                     J.D.
                         Well, if you don't mind me sayin' 
                         so, he sounds like a real asshole.

                                     THELMA
                         It's okay.  He is an asshole.  Most 
                         of the time I just let it slide.

               J.D. is looking down the road, way off in the distance.

                                     J.D.
                         Better slow down.  That's a cop.

               Louise looks down the road and sees a highway patrol car 
               coming down the road towards them.  She does not look alarmed 
               but veers off the road into a "rest area" drive that has 
               trees and shrubs that obscure the view from the road.

               She glides along as the cop car passes on the other side 
               without seeing them.

               Louise glides right back onto the road as if nothing unusual 
               has happened at all.  They realize they have not been spotted.  
               J.D. and Louise look at each other.

                                     J.D.
                         Maybe you got a few too many parking 
                         tickets?

                         We'll take you on to Oklahoma City, 
                         then you'd best be on your way.

               INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - DAY

               Hal is on the phone to the FBI man.  Darryl is sitting on a 
               chair looking dazed.  Other law enforcement types roam around 
               the house.

                                     HAL
                         The prints on the trunk of the car 
                         match those of Thelma Dickinson.

               INT.  FBI OFFICE - DAY

               MAX STRATTON, an FBI MAN in his early forties, is looking at 
               the ident-a-kit drawings of Louise and Thelma.

                                     MAX
                         Well I'll be damned.  Isn't that 
                         strange.

                         And the husband says a gun is missing.  
                         She took a lot of stuff.  It looks 
                         like she maybe planned on being gone 
                         a while.  The strange thing is, her 
                         husband said she would never touch 
                         that gun.  He got it for her 'cause 
                         he's out late a lot, but he said 
                         she'd never touch it, wouldn't learn 
                         to shoot it, just left it in a drawer 
                         for years.

                         We're lookin'.  They were on their 
                         way to some guy's cabin and they 
                         never showed up.  We're lookin'.  We 
                         hope you're lookin' too.

               EXT.  FLATLANDS - ROAD - DUSK

               The T-Bird barrels down the road at high speed.

               EXT.  SHAW'S SIESTA MOTEL - DUSK

               Louise, Thelma, and J.D. pull into the motel parking lot.

                                     LOUISE
                         I just gotta run in for a minute.

               Louise looks at J.D. in the back seat and takes the keys out 
               of the ignition.

                                     LOUISE
                         You two better go on and say your 
                         goodbyes.

               Louise gets out of the car and goes inside.

               INT.  MOTEL OFFICE - NIGHT

               An older WOMAN behind the counter is looking at a computer 
               screen.

                                     LOUISE
                         Louise Elizabeth Sawyer.  Are you 
                         sure?

                                     WOMAN
                         Nothin'.  Nothin' came in today at 
                         all.

               Louise turns and sees Thelma crawl over into the back seat 
               with J.D.

                                     LOUISE
                         Nothing under peaches?  Check again 
                         under peaches.

                                     WOMAN
                         Naw, nothin' under peaches neither.

               A MAN comes up behind Louise and stands close behind her.

                                     MAN (JIMMY)
                         Did you say Peaches?!  Why that's 
                         the secret word!  Show her what she's 
                         won, Don.

               He drops an envelope in front of her.  Louise is startled 
               and turns around quickly.

                                     JIMMY
                         Hey, peaches.

                                     LOUISE
                         Oh my God!  Jimmy!  You... Oh my 
                         God!  What are you doin' here?

                                     JIMMY
                              (to Woman)
                         Can we get another room?  Just put 
                         it on my credit card.

               The Woman hands them a key.

                                     WOMAN
                         'Round to the back.

               EXT.  MOTEL PARKING LOT - NIGHT

               Louise and Jimmy walk outside and catch Thelma sitting very 
               close to J.D.  Thelma sees Jimmy and is so startled she 
               screams and involuntarily slams herself across the back seat 
               to the other side of the car.  She tries to look nonchalant.

                                     THELMA
                         Jimmy!  Hello, stranger.  What in 
                         the world are you doin' here?

                                     JIMMY
                         Ask me no questions, I'll tell you 
                         no lies.

                                     THELMA
                         Good answer.  Same goes double for 
                         me.

                                     JIMMY
                         Who's your friend?

               J.D. is climbing out of the car, looking very uncomfortable.

                                     THELMA
                         This is J.D.  He's a student.  We're 
                         just givin' him a ride to... to here.  
                         Louise said we could bring him here 
                         and then he'd have to go.  And that's 
                         what he's doin'.  He's goin'.  Aren't 
                         you, J.D.?

                                     J.D.
                         Yup.  Thanks for the ride.  You all 
                         take care.

               He quickly turns and walks away toward the road.

                                     THELMA
                              (watching him)
                         Yup.  That's him goin'.  I love to 
                         watch him go.

                                     LOUISE
                              (to Jimmy)
                         Thelma kinda took to him.

               Jimmy is smiling.

                                     JIMMY
                              (to Thelma)
                         Well, come on, gal, I got you a room.  
                         You can go on in and take a nice 
                         cold shower.

                                     THELMA
                         Don't mind me, Jimmy, I'm just a 
                         wild woman.

                                     JIMMY
                         I always knew that.

                                     THELMA
                         A regular outlaw.

               Louise shoots Thelma a look.  The three of them drive around 
               to the back of the motel.  Thelma turns and looks at the 
               road.  J.D. is standing there.  He blows her a kiss.

               EXT.  MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               They stop in front of the motel rooms and the three of them 
               climb out of the car.

                                     LOUISE
                         Let me just go in and freshen up for 
                         a minute.  I need to wash my face, 
                         you know.

               Thelma is taking their luggage out of the trunk.

                                     JIMMY
                         Okay, honey.  I don't want to rush 
                         you.  I just wanna talk to you and...
                              (whispering)
                         ...be alone with you.  I'll just be 
                         in my room, 115, you just come on 
                         down when you're ready.

               Jimmy helps carry the luggage to Thelma's room.  He stops at 
               the door.

                                     JIMMY
                         I'll be waiting.

               Louise smiles at him quizzically as if she can't believe 
               he's acting this way.  He turns on his heel and slinks away.

                                     THELMA
                         I don't care what you say about him.  
                         The boy has got it bad.

                                     LOUISE
                         He's always got it bad as long as 
                         I'm running in the other direction.  
                         Don't be fooled, he's no different 
                         than any other guy.  He knows how to 
                         chase and that's it.  Once he's caught 
                         you, he don't know what to do.  So 
                         he runs away.

                                     THELMA
                         I heard that.

               INT.  MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               They close the door to their room.  Louise sets the envelope 
               of money on the table.

                                     LOUISE
                              (indicating envelope)
                         Our future.

               Louise gets her purse and starts taking out her makeup.

               She stands very close to the mirror.  She is putting on lip 
               liner.  Thelma is watching.

                                     THELMA
                         So what are you gonna tell him?

                                     LOUISE
                         Nothing.  I'm not gonna tell him a 
                         thing.  The least I can do is not 
                         make him an accessory any more than 
                         he already is.

                                     THELMA
                         You are so sweet to that guy, you 
                         really are.  Imagine not wanting to 
                         drag him into this.  He is a lucky 
                         man.

               Louise is still putting on her makeup, making sure it's 
               perfect.

                                     LOUISE
                         I didn't ask him to come!  It's like 
                         I said, Thelma, he just loves the 
                         chase.

                                     THELMA
                         Well boy, he's got his work cut out 
                         for him now, don't he?

                                     LOUISE
                         Put a lid on it, Thelma!  It's hard 
                         enough as it is.  Just let me get 
                         this part over with.  Now stay here 
                         and guard the money.  If there's any 
                         problem I'm in room 115.

                                     THELMA
                         I won't wait up.

               Louise turns to face Thelma.

                                     LOUISE
                         How do I look?

                                     THELMA
                         You're a vision, Louise, a goddamn 
                         vision of loveliness, you always 
                         are.

                                     LOUISE
                         Have another drink, Thelma.

               Louise walks out the door.

                                     THELMA
                         Good idea.

               EXT.  MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               It's raining out.  Louise goes to Jimmy's room.

               Louise knocks on the door to room 115.  The door opens 
               slightly and one red rose pops out.

                                     LOUISE
                         Hello...

                                     JIMMY
                              (in a falsetto voice)
                         Who is it?

                                     LOUISE
                         It's me.

               The following eleven roses are held out the door, then Louise 
               is yanked inside and we hear her shriek with LAUGHTER.

               INT.  THELMA'S MOTEL ROOM - EVENING

               Thelma has taken a shower and is dressed in cut-offs and a T-
               shirt.  Her hair is still damp but she looks better than she 
               did when she arrived.  Thelma is fixing a drink of Wild Turkey 
               and Diet 7-Up in one of the motel room glasses.  There is a 
               KNOCK on the door.  She stops what she is doing and is 
               completely still.

                                     THELMA
                         Louise?

               Another KNOCK.

                                     THELMA
                         Louise, is that you?

                                     J.D. (O.S.)
                              (through the door)
                         Thelma?  It's me.

               Thelma opens the door and there stands J.D., soaking wet 
               from the rain pouring down behind him.

                                     J.D.
                         I just thought I... I know I'm 
                         supposed to be gone, but...

               He's kind of looking over towards the road.  He's still 
               slightly shy.

                                     J.D.
                         I'm not havin' much luck gettin' a 
                         ride.

               He notices looking past her into the room that Louise isn't 
               there.  Thelma just stands there looking at him.

                                     J.D.
                         Well, I guess I'd better...

                                     THELMA
                         Wait...!  Um, where ya going?

                                     J.D.
                         I don't know.  Nowhere.  What are 
                         you doin'?

                                     THELMA
                         I don't know.  Nothin'.  Took a 
                         shower.

                                     J.D.
                         That sounds nice.

                                     THELMA
                         Well, you wanna use the shower?

               You can tell he does want to but doesn't want to say so.

               So instead he just kind of stands there with a reticent grin 
               on his face.

                                     J.D.
                         Oh.  I... where's Louise?

                                     THELMA
                         She's off with Jimmy, that's her 
                         boyfriend.

                                     J.D.
                         That's lonely for you, I guess.  I 
                         always think of motel rooms as lonely.

               Thelma pretends like she's had a lot of experience with this 
               sort of thing.

                                     THELMA
                              (letting him in the 
                              door)
                         Oh, yes, well, they can be.

               INT.  JIMMY'S ROOM - NIGHT

               Jimmy is pouring champagne into Louise's glass.  There are a 
               dozen roses in a vase on the table.  He pours for himself as 
               he sits as close to Louise as possible.

                                     JIMMY
                         Now, my little coconut, what seems 
                         to be the trouble here?  Tell Daddy 
                         everything.

                                     LOUISE
                              (cringing)
                         Jimmy, my daddy's still alive and it 
                         kind of gives me the creeps when you 
                         do that...

                                     JIMMY
                         Okay, okay, just tell me what's the 
                         trouble.

               Louise just looks at him for a minute.

                                     LOUISE
                         Jimmy, I'm not gonna tell ya what 
                         the trouble is.  Someday soon you'll 
                         understand why I can't.  But I won't 
                         tell ya, so don't ask me.

               Jimmy is once again shocked by how serious she is.

                                     JIMMY
                              (almost at a loss for 
                              words)
                         Okay, peaches, okay.  But can I ask 
                         you one thing?

                                     LOUISE
                         Maybe.

                                     JIMMY
                         Does it have something to do with 
                         another guy?  Are you in love with 
                         him?

                                     LOUISE
                         It's nothin' like that.

                                     JIMMY
                              (exploding)
                         Then what?!  What, goddamnit, Louise!  
                         Where the fuck are you going?  Are 
                         you just leaving for fucking ever?  
                         What, did you fuckin' murder somebody 
                         or what?!

               Louise spills her champagne.

                                     LOUISE
                         Stop it!  Stop it, Jimmy, or I'll 
                         leave right now.  I'm not kiddin'!

                                     JIMMY
                              (calming down)
                         Alright, alright.  I'm sorry.

               They both take a second to regain their composure.

                                     JIMMY
                         Can I just ask you one other thing?

                                     LOUISE
                         Maybe.

               Jimmy pulls a little black box out of his pocket.

                                     JIMMY
                         Will you wear this?

               He hands Louise the box.  She opens it and it is a diamond 
               ring.  Louise is flabbergasted.

                                     JIMMY
                         Will you at least see how it fits?

                                     LOUISE
                         Jimmy... it's beautiful!

                                     JIMMY
                         You didn't see that one comin', did 
                         ya?

               INT.  THELMA'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               J.D. is out of the shower standing in front of the mirror 
               wearing only his jeans, the top button of which is still 
               undone and no shirt.  He has an incredible physique.  He 
               also has a tattoo on his shoulder of the homemade variety.  
               Thelma has gone and bought cheese crackers and peanuts from 
               a vending machine and is into her second Wild Turkey and 7-
               Up.  She sits on the bed, watching him in the mirror.  He 
               definitely looks better with his shirt off.

               She suddenly feels awkward and stands up.

                                     THELMA
                         You wanna drink?

               INT.  JIMMY'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Louise has the engagement ring on her finger.  It's really 
               beautiful.

                                     JIMMY
                         So whaddya think.  I mean... I 
                         could... uh... get a job.  Of some 
                         kind.  I mean you've been tellin' me 
                         that for years, right?

                                     LOUISE
                         Why now, Jimmy?

                                     JIMMY
                              (this is hard for him)
                         'Cause, Louise.  I don't want to 
                         lose you.  And for some reason I get 
                         the feelin' you're about to split.  
                         Permanently.

               Louise doesn't know how to respond.  She struggles for a 
               reply.

                                     LOUISE
                         Jimmy, we've gone all these years... 
                         we never made it work.  We're not 
                         gonna be able to just... I'm not...  
                         What kind of job, honey?  Can you 
                         see it.  I can't.

               Jimmy doesn't answer right away.  He's trying to see it.

                                     JIMMY
                         I'm the one... I never made it work.  
                         I just... It's not that I don't love 
                         you.  It's not that.  I just never 
                         thought I'd be thirty-six years old 
                         and I never thought... I don't know 
                         what I thought.  What do you want, 
                         darlin'.  What do you want me to do.

                                     LOUISE
                         I don't know.  It doesn't even matter 
                         anymore.  I just want you to be 
                         happy... It's not that I don't love 
                         you either.  But Jimmy, your timing 
                         couldn't be worse.

               Jimmy does not really understand why this is happening.

                                     JIMMY
                         Are you just doin' this to punish 
                         me?

                                     LOUISE
                         Believe me, the last thing I want is 
                         for you to get punished.

               INT.  THELMA'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Thelma has poured a drink for J.D. who's sitting on the edge 
               of the bed.  She walks over and hands it to him and as she 
               does, he takes the drink with one hand and her hand with the 
               other.  He sets the drink down on the nightstand and holds 
               her hand with both of his.  He closely studies her wedding 
               ring.  He suddenly looks up at her and gazes at her just as 
               intently.  He slowly shakes his head as he removes her ring 
               as if to say, "This is not right for you.  This isn't going 
               to work."  He looks at the ring as he moves it through space 
               finally stopping when the ring is directly over his drink.  
               He drops it in.  He looks back at Thelma and smiles as if to 
               say, "There.  Now don't you feel better?"  He smartly kisses 
               her hand.

               INT.  JIMMY'S ROOM - NIGHT

               Louise and Jimmy are sitting on the edge of the bed.

               Jimmy has put the ring on her finger and they both are looking 
               at it, as Jimmy holds her hand in his.  They both ponder it.

                                     JIMMY
                         It does look good.

               INT.  THELMA'S ROOM - NIGHT

               J.D. is standing on the dresser with a towel tied around his 
               neck like a cape.

                                     J.D.
                         Faster than a speeding green T-Bird, 
                         able to leap tall babes in a single 
                         bound...

               He leaps from the dresser and flies across the room landing 
               on the bed, straddling Thelma.

                                     J.D.
                              (in his deep man's 
                              voice)
                         Hi.  Could I interest you in some 
                         Fuller brushes?

               Thelma has not stopped laughing since he came in the room.

               He is the greatest guy she's ever seen.  He is sniffing her 
               neck like a dog.

                                     THELMA
                              (giggling)
                         Stop, stop, stop!

               Thelma tries to catch her breath.

                                     THELMA
                         Who are you?

               J.D. attacks her again.

                                     J.D.
                         I am the great and powerful Oz...

                                     THELMA
                         J.D.!  Just tell me.  I know you're 
                         not some schoolboy.  Now come on, 
                         nobody ever tells me shit.

                                     J.D.
                         I'm just some guy.  A guy whose parole 
                         officer is probably having a shit 
                         fit right about now.

               Thelma gasps.

                                     THELMA
                         What?!  Parole officer?  You mean 
                         you're a criminal?

                                     J.D.
                         Well, not anymore, Thelma, except 
                         for bustin' parole, I haven't done 
                         one wrong thing.

                                     THELMA
                         What did ya do?

                                     J.D.
                         I'm a robber.

                                     THELMA
                         You're a bank robber?

                                     J.D.
                         Nope.  I've never robbed a bank.

                                     THELMA
                         What?

                                     J.D.
                         Well, I robbed a gas station once, 
                         and I robbed a couple of liquor 
                         stores, and some convenience stores.  
                         And that's it.

                                     THELMA
                         How?

                                     J.D.
                         Well, I was just down on my luck and 
                         it seemed like somethin' I was good 
                         at so I...

                                     THELMA
                              (interrupting)
                         No, I mean how would you do it?  Do 
                         you just sneak in real fast or hide 
                         out till the store closes or what?

                                     J.D.
                         Naw, honey, that would be burglary.  
                         I never got arrested for burglary.  
                         Burglary's for chicken shits.  If 
                         you're gonna rob someone, ya just 
                         have to go right on up to 'em and do 
                         it.  Just take the money.  That's 
                         robbery.  That's a whole 'nother 
                         deal.

                                     THELMA
                         Tell me.

                                     J.D.
                         Well, first you pick your place, 
                         see, then I'd just sit back and watch 
                         it for awhile.  Ya gotta wait for 
                         just the right moment, which is 
                         something you know instinctively, 
                         that can't be taught.  Then I'd waltz 
                         on in...

               J.D. jumps up and picks up a hair dryer and holds it like a 
               gun.  He starts acting it out.

                                     J.D.
                         And I'd say, "Alright, ladies and 
                         gentlemen, let's see who'll win the 
                         prize for keepin' their cool.  Simon 
                         says everybody lie down on the floor.  
                         If nobody loses their head, then 
                         nobody loses their head.  You sir... 
                         You do the honors.  Just empty that 
                         cash into this bag and you'll have 
                         an amazing story to tell all your 
                         friends.  If not, you'll have a tag 
                         on your toe.  You decide." Then I'd 
                         split.  Simple.

                                     THELMA
                         My gosh, you sure gentlemanly about 
                         it.

                                     J.D.
                         I've always believed if done right, 
                         armed robbery doesn't have to be a 
                         totally unpleasant experience.

                                     THELMA
                         God.  You're a real live outlaw!

                                     J.D.
                         I may be the outlaw, but you're the 
                         one stealin' my heart.

                                     THELMA
                         And smooth, boy, you are smooth.

               They kiss passionately.

                                     THELMA
                         You're kinda the best thing that's 
                         happened to me in a long time.

                                     J.D.
                         You're a little angle, you are.

               J.D. turns out the light.

               INT.  JIMMY'S ROOM - NIGHT

               Louise and Jimmy are wrapped in each other's arms, quietly 
               making love.  Through this, Jimmy is ardent.

                                     JIMMY
                         Louise?  I think you are so damn 
                         beautiful.  I mean that.  I always 
                         have.

               She smiles.  Completely.

                                     LOUISE
                              (whispering)
                         I think you're beautiful too.

               EXT.  SIESTA MOTEL - DAWN

               MONTAGE of early morning staff, a truck driver climbing into 
               his cab with a silver thermos, squirrels hopping around on 
               the ground.

               INT.  SIESTA COFFEE SHOP - DAWN

               TIGHT SHOT of coffee beginning to drip into an empty coffee 
               pot.  Louise and Jimmy are sitting in a booth, both on the 
               same side.  They are both playing with their wedding rings.

                                     JIMMY
                         Don't worry darlin'.  I'll say I 
                         never found you.  I'll say anything 
                         you want.  We'll find a way to get 
                         you out of this, whatever it is.

                                     LOUISE
                         Damn, Jimmy, did you take a pill 
                         that makes you say all the right 
                         stuff?

                                     JIMMY
                         I'm choking on it.

               They sit for a minute.

                                     JIMMY
                         Honey?  Ummm... Do you want me to 
                         come with you?

               They look at each other, into each other and Jimmy can see 
               that Louise is already gone.  Louise is really touched that 
               he asked her that but she knows it's impossible.  She is 
               very kind to him.

                                     LOUISE
                         Oh... now... it's probably not such 
                         a good idea right now.  I'll... catch 
                         up with you later, on down the road.

               In her hand she's been holding the ring in the black box.  
               She puts it on the table and slides it back to him.  He stops 
               her, suddenly.  He covers her hand with his.

                                     JIMMY
                         You keep this!

               Jimmy is trying not to seem upset, so he's completely still.  
               A taxi pulls up outside.

                                     LOUISE
                         Your taxi's here.

               Jimmy pulls her to him and kisses her so passionately that 
               employees in the coffee shop look away.  A cook fans himself 
               with a spatula.  The taxi driver, who can see in, looks at 
               his watch.

                                     JIMMY
                         Are you happy, Louise?  I just want 
                         you to be happy.

               Louise looks at her hand and Jimmy's hand.

                                     LOUISE
                         I'm happy, sweetie.  Happy as I can 
                         be.

               Jimmy gets up and leaves the coffee shop.  Louise watches 
               him go.  A WAITRESS comes over and fills her coffee cup.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Good thing he left when he did.  We 
                         thought we were gonna have to put 
                         out a fire.

               The Waitress chuckles and the other waitresses do too.  Louise 
               waves to Jimmy in the back of the cab.  The cab driver winks 
               at her.  She smiles to herself.

               INT.  THELMA'S MOTEL ROOM - MORNING

               The room is totally trashed.  J.D. and Thelma are both asleep, 
               naked and hanging off either side of the bed.

               J.D. starts to stir...

               INT.  HAL'S BEDROOM - MORNING

               Hal is in bed with is WIFE.  He has to get up.  He is holding 
               his wife in his arms.

                                     HAL
                         Honey?

                                     SARAH
                         Yes, baby?

                                     HAL
                         Do you think you could ever shoot 
                         someone?

                                     SARAH
                         What?

                                     HAL
                         Do you think you could ever think of 
                         a set of circumstances that would 
                         just cause you to haul off and shoot 
                         someone?

                                     SARAH
                         I could shoot your cousin Eddie.

                                     HAL
                         Why?

                                     SARAH
                         Because he's an inconsiderate asshole.

                                     HAL
                         I'm asking you seriously, Sarah, a 
                         stranger?

                                     SARAH
                         I don't know, honey.  I guess it 
                         would depend.

                                     HAL
                         On what?

                                     SARAH
                              (trying to picture it)
                         Well, maybe if they were trying to 
                         hurt you or one of the kids.  I'm 
                         sure I could shoot someone if they 
                         tried to hurt one of the children.

                                     HAL
                         Yeah, I could too.  But... I don't 
                         know why I'm even asking you this.  
                         It's just... we can't place anybody 
                         at the scene but these two gals that 
                         everybody swears is sweet as pie.  I 
                         don't know.  I keep hearing words -- 
                         impossible -- inconceivable.  If 
                         just one person would say...

                                     SARAH
                         Honey.  Nothing's impossible.  You 
                         just don't shoot someone like that 
                         for no reason.  Maybe he was askin' 
                         for it.  Anyway, somebody's husband 
                         probably got ol' Harlan.

                                     HAL
                         That's what everybody says.  Only 
                         problem is nobody's husband was 
                         unaccounted for that night... Could 
                         you shoot Eddie in the face?  At 
                         point blank range?

                                     SARAH
                              (thinking)
                         In the leg.

                                     HAL
                              (getting up)
                         I gotta go to Little Rock.

               INT.  COFFEE SHOP - MORNING

               Louise is sitting in the booth by herself.  Thelma comes 
               hurrying by.  She looks disheveled but is grinning like an 
               idiot.  She sees Louise and charges into the coffee shop.

               Her energy and volume is several notches higher than the 
               rest of the people in the coffee shop.  There are a couple 
               more customers in there now.  Thelma slides into the booth 
               seated directly across from Louise.

                                     THELMA
                         Hi.

               She is shocked by Thelma's appearance.

                                     LOUISE
                         What happened to your hair?

                                     THELMA
                         Nothing.  It got messed up.

               Louise is studying Thelma closely as Thelma squirms in her 
               seat, barely able to contain herself.

                                     LOUISE
                         What's wrong with you?

                                     THELMA
                         Nothing.  Why?  Do I seem different?

                                     LOUISE
                         Yes, now that you mention it.  You 
                         seem crazy.  Like you're on drugs.

                                     THELMA
                         Well, I'm not on drugs.  But I might 
                         be crazy.

                                     LOUISE
                              (shaking her head)
                         I don't think I wanna hear what you're 
                         gonna tell me.

               Thelma is just about to shriek when the Waitress comes over 
               and puts a coffee cup on the table and pours some.

               Thelma gets a grip on herself for a moment then loses it as 
               the Waitress goes away.

                                     THELMA
                         Oh my God, Louise!!!  I can't believe 
                         it!  I just really can't believe it!  
                         I mean... whoa!

               Thelma is just laughing hysterically.  Louise suddenly 
               understands.

                                     LOUISE
                         Oh, Thelma.  Oh, no.

                                     THELMA
                         I mean I finally understand what all 
                         the fuss is about.   This is just a 
                         whole 'nother ball game!

                                     LOUISE
                         Thelma, please get a hold of yourself.  
                         You're making a spectacle.

                                     THELMA
                         You know, Louise, you're supposed to 
                         be my best friend.  You could at 
                         least be a little bit happy for me.  
                         You could at least pretend to be 
                         slightly happy that for once in my 
                         life I have a sexual experience that 
                         isn't completely disgusting.

                                     LOUISE
                         I'm sorry.  I am happy.  I'm very 
                         happy for you.  I'm glad you had a 
                         good time.  It's about time.  Where 
                         is he now?

                                     THELMA
                         Taking a shower.

                                     LOUISE
                         You left that guy alone in the room?

               Louise is getting a bad feeling.  She is already standing up 
               putting money on the table.

                                     LOUISE
                         Where's the money, Thelma?

               Thelma has forgotten all about the money.

                                     THELMA
                         Ummm... it's on the table.  It's 
                         okay.

               They are both leaving the restaurant now.  As they hit the 
               door they both break into a full run.

                                     THELMA
                         I don't remember.

               EXT.  MOTEL PARKING LOT - DAY

               They run across the parking lot around the back to the room.  
               The door is ajar and no one is in the room.  Louise goes in 
               and Thelma stays outside the door.

                                     THELMA
                         Goddamnit!  I've never been lucky!  
                         Not one time!

               Louise comes back outside.  She doesn't say anything.  She 
               is stoic, fighting tears.

                                     THELMA
                         Shit.  That little sonofabitch burgled 
                         me.  I don't believe it.

               Louise sits down on the sidewalk in front of the room.  Thelma 
               comes and sits beside her.  Neither one says anything for a 
               moment.

                                     THELMA
                         Louise?  Are you okay?

               Louise shakes her head no.

                                     THELMA
                         Louise... It's okay.  Louise?  I'm 
                         sorry.  I mean it.

               Louise has seen the end of the tunnel and there is no light.

                                     LOUISE
                         It's not okay, Thelma.  It's 
                         definitely not okay.  None of this 
                         is okay.  What are we going to do 
                         for money?  What are we gonna buy 
                         gas with?  Our good looks?  I mean... 
                         Goddamn, Thelma!

               Louise quietly starts to fall apart.  This causes Thelma to 
               leap into action.

                                     THELMA
                         Come on.  Stand up!  Don't you worry 
                         about it.  I'll take care of it.  
                         Just don't you worry about it.  Get 
                         your stuff.

               Louise is still sitting on the sidewalk.

                                     THELMA
                         Come on!  Damnit, get your stuff and 
                         let's get out of here!

               Louise slowly gets to her feet.

                                     THELMA
                         Move!
                              (to herself)
                         Jesus Christ, take your damn time.

               Thelma is hauling stuff out of the car.

               EXT.  MOTEL PARKING LOT - MORNING

               TIGHT SHOT of rear wheel of green T-Bird LAYING RUBBER out 
               of the motel parking lot.  Thelma and Louise, both looking a 
               little rougher than we've seen so far, drive away.

               EXT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - DAY

               Hal, FBI Man, various other police and detective types, pull 
               up in front of the house.  The front door swings open and 
               there stands Darryl looking like he's been shot out of a 
               cannon.

               EXT.  STREET - DAY

               Louise and Thelma pull into a convenience store.

               INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - DAY

               Police are tapping the phones, dusting for prints, etc., 
               while Darryl sits motionless in his recliner with a dull 
               expression on his face.

                                     HAL
                              (to Darryl)
                         As you know, we've tapped your phone.  
                         In the event that she calls in.

               Max comes up and joins them as they walk down the hallway.

                                     MAX
                         We're going to leave someone here at 
                         the house in the event that she calls 
                         in.  Someone will be here until we 
                         find them.

                                     HAL
                         The important thing is not to let on 
                         that you know anything.  We want to 
                         try and find out where they are.  
                         Now I don't want to get too personal, 
                         but do you have a good relationship 
                         with your wife?  Are you close with 
                         her?

                                     DARRYL
                         Yeah, I guess.  I mean, I'm about as 
                         close as I can be with a nut case 
                         like that.

                                     MAX
                         Well, if she calls, just be gentle.  
                         Like you're happy to hear from her.  
                         You know, like you really miss her.  
                         Women love that shit.

               EXT.  CONVENIENCE STORE - DAY

               Thelma and Louise are sitting in the car.  They've put all 
               their money together.

                                     LOUISE
                         Eighty-eight dollars ain't gonna 
                         make a dent, baby girl.

                                     THELMA
                              (getting out of the 
                              car)
                         Don't worry about it.  You want 
                         anything?

                                     LOUISE
                         No.

               Thelma marches off to the store.  Louise puts a tape in the 
               deck and is listening to loud R&B MUSIC.  She checks herself 
               in the rearview mirror.  She takes her lipstick out and is 
               about to put it on.  She makes eye contact with herself and, 
               instead, throws it out the window, closes her eyes and leans 
               her head back on the seat.  She's in a world of shit.

               Thelma comes trotting out of the store and jumps into the 
               car.

                                     THELMA
                              (breathless)
                         Drive!

               Louise looks at her.

                                     THELMA
                         Drive!  Drive away!

                                     LOUISE
                              (driving away)
                         What happened?

               Thelma opens her purse and exposes a bag full of bills.

                                     LOUISE
                         What?  You robbed the store?  You 
                         robbed the Goddamn store?!

               Thelma shrieks with excitement.  Louise is completely stunned.

                                     THELMA
                         Well!  We needed the money!  It's 
                         not like I killed anybody, for God's 
                         sake.

               Louise shoots her a look.  She puts the car in gear and FLOORS 
               it out of the parking lot.  She is still looking at Thelma 
               as if she has completely lost her mind.

                                     THELMA
                         I'm sorry.  Well, we need the money.  
                         Now we have it.

                                     LOUISE
                         Oh shit, Thelma!!  Shit!  Shit!  
                         Shit!

                                     THELMA
                              (sternly)
                         Now you get a grip, Louise!  Just 
                         drive us to Goddamn Mexico, will ya!

                                     LOUISE
                         Okay.  Shit, Thelma!  What'd you do?  
                         I mean, what did you say?

                                     THELMA
                         Well, I just...

               INT.  POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

               Hal, Max, various other cops, and Darryl all watch as TV 
               plays back VCR TAPE of Thelma in the convenience store pulling 
               a gun.  In perfect lip sync is:

                                     THELMA (V.O.)
                         Alright, ladies and gentleman, let's 
                         see who'll win the prize for keepin' 
                         their cool.  Everybody lie down on 
                         the floor.  If nobody loses their 
                         head, then nobody loses their head...

               TIGHT SHOT of Darryl's face going deeper and deeper into a 
               state of shock.  TIGHT SHOTS of Hal, Max, etc., all looking 
               intently at the screen.

               VIDEO IMAGE of Thelma boldly ordering cashier to fill her 
               purse with money.  As he's loading the purse with bills, 
               she's taking beef jerky from the display and putting it in 
               there, too, while she points the gun at the cashier.

                                     THELMA (V.O.)
                              (videotape playback)
                         You, sir... You do the honors.  Just 
                         empty that cash into this bag and 
                         you'll have an amazing story to tell 
                         all your friends.  If not, you'll 
                         have a tag on your toe.  You decide.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         Lemme see the map.

               Louise throws the map across the front seat at Thelma and 
               FLOORS it.

               INT.  JIMMY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

               Jimmy is entering the apartment building, carrying his 
               overnight bag.  Two men are sitting on the stairs.  They 
               stand as he comes in.  They are plainclothes police.  They 
               show their badges.  He leaves with them.

               EXT.  ROAD - TIGHT SHOT - J.D.'S BACKSIDE - DAY

               made only more prominent by the bulging wallet in his back 
               right pocket.

               J.D. is walking down the road and continues to walk as an 
               Oklahoma State Patrol car pulls up alongside him.  He smiles 
               and gives a friendly wave as they cruise along slowly beside 
               him.  We can see the cop nearest him talking, and then we 
               see J.D. stop walking and set down his duffel bag.  He reaches 
               for his wallet.  It's clear that they have asked for some 
               I.D.

               EXT.  RURAL ROAD - DAY

               Louise is driving.  They fly past a kid on his bike on a 
               long gravel driveway.  He watches them.  A huge cloud of 
               dust blows up as they pass him.  He turns and rides his bike 
               down the driveway towards the house.

               INT.  CAR - DAY

                         Louise, you'd better slow down.  
                         I'll just die if we get caught over 
                         a speeding ticket.

               Louise looks at the speedometer touching 80 mph and lets her 
               foot off the gas.  Louise is looking a little nervous.

                                     LOUISE
                         For the first time in my life, I 
                         wish this car wasn't green.

                         Are you sure we should be driving 
                         like this?  In broad daylight and 
                         everything?

                                     LOUISE
                         No we shouldn't, but I want to put 
                         some distance between us and the 
                         scene of our last Goddamn crime!

                                     THELMA
                         Oooooweee!!  You shoulda seen me!  
                         Like I'd been doin' it all my life!  
                         Nobody would ever believe it.

                                     LOUISE
                         You think you've found your calling?

                         Maybe.  Maybe.  The call of the wild!

               Thelma howls like a dog and drinks a little bottle of Wild 
               Turkey.

                                     LOUISE
                         You're disturbed.

                         Yes!  I believe I am!

               INT.  POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

               Jimmy is in a small room with Hal, Max, other cops, looking 
               stunned.

                                     JIMMY
                         I swear to God, she wouldn't tell me 
                         one thing!  Christ!  You oughta try 
                         to find that kid that was with 'em.

                                     HAL
                         Tell us about him.

                                     JIMMY
                         Just some young guy.  Around twenty 
                         years old.  Dark hair.

               Jimmy is really upset and has to really struggle to control 
               himself.

                                     JIMMY
                              (trying to remember 
                              him)
                         They said they'd picked him up along 
                         the way.  He was a student.  But he 
                         didn't look right.  But he left when 
                         they got to the motel.

                                     MAX
                         Do you understand that you may be 
                         facing an accessory charge?

                                     HAL
                         This is serious, son.  A man is dead.

                                     JIMMY
                         I know!  I'd tell you if I knew!  
                         Goddamn!  I know something happened, 
                         or she wouldn't have left.  I'm trying 
                         to remember everything!  Find that 
                         fucking kid.  He probably knows 
                         something.

               EXT.  DRIVING SHOT - DAY

               Thelma and Louise are in the car.  Thelma is taking empty 
               little Wild Turkey bottles out of her purse and throwing 
               them out the window.

                                     LOUISE
                         So what's the plan, Thelma?  You 
                         just gonna stay drunk?

                                     THELMA
                         Try to.

                         Litterbug.

               They come ROARING up on a semi-tanker carrying gas.  We see 
               their FISH-EYE REFLECTIONS in the shiny tanker.

               The mud flaps are the shiny silhouettes of naked women that 
               Thelma and Louise saw earlier.  The truck is going slower 
               than they are.

                                     LOUISE
                         Aw, great.  This always happens.  
                         Whenever you're in a hurry.

               She noses out to see if she can pass, but there's a car 
               coming.  The car passes and the truck HONKS.  The truck 
               driver's arm comes out his window and waves them past.

                                     THELMA
                         Isn't that nice?  Truck drivers are 
                         always so nice.  The best drivers on 
                         the road.

               As they get next to the truck, the truck driver is smiling 
               and waving at them.  They smile and wave back.  He flicks 
               his tongue at them.  Louise screams.

                                     THELMA/LOUISE
                         Ugh!!  Gross!!  Oh my God!  Aw, God!

               Louise FLOORS it and speeds past him.

                                     THELMA
                         Ugh!!  Why do they have to do that?

                                     LOUISE
                         They think we like it.  Maybe they 
                         think it turns us on.

               Louise shivers with disgust.

               INT.  POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

               Jimmy is looking at police mug shots of a lot of young guys.  
               Hal shows Jimmy a mug shot of J.D.

                              (looking closely)
                         It's him.

                         You gotta be kiddin' me.  They picked 
                         up a murderer?!

                         Oh, great.

                                     MAX
                              (to Hal)
                         They're flying him here right now.  
                         He was picked up this morning for 
                         parole violation.  They also found 
                         about six grand on him, so he probably 
                         knocked over something while he was 
                         out there.  They can drop him by 
                         here for questioning.  I'm so happy.

                                     JIMMY
                              (overhearing)

                         What for?

                         To find out if he knows anything.  
                         If you think he does, you gotta hang 
                         up because it means the police have 
                         told him and the phone is probably 
                         tapped.

                                     THELMA
                         Jeez, Louise, tapped the phone?  You 
                         think so?

                         even say it was self-defense?

                         They don't know that!  It was just 
                         you and me there.  I'll say he raped 
                         me and you had to shoot him!  I mean, 
                         it's almost the truth!

                         he did it.  We probably can't even 
                         prove he touched you by now.

               They both pause for a moment.

                         Besides, what do we say about the

                         such thing as justifiable robbery.

               Hal, Max, other plainclothes officers follow.  Darryl looks 
               at Hal questioningly.  Hal doesn't respond and the entourage 
               quickly goes into a room.  Darryl stands and crosses the 
               hall to the room as the door shuts in his face.

                                     DARRYL
                              (yelling at the door)
                         Hey!  Hey!

                         Who's the nut?

                                     HAL
                         That's Thelma Dickinson's husband.

                                     J.D.
                         Aw, God.

               INT.  POLICE STATION - HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Darryl tries the doorknob, but the door is locked.

               INT.  POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

               Hal, Max, J.D., other officers.  There is a VCR and monitor 
               set up in the room and they view the videotape of Thelma in 
               the convenience store.

                                     J.D.
                              (pleased)
                         Alright!  She did good!  Didn't she?

                                     HAL
                         Well, son, she's doin' a damn sight 
                         better 'n you right now.

                                     MAX
                         Where did you get $6600.00 in cash?

                                     J.D.
                         A friend.

                                     HAL
                         We spoke with a gentlemen today who 
                         says he personally delivered very 
                         close to that same amount to a Miss 
                         Louise Sawyer.  Do you know her too?

                                     J.D.
                         Umm, yes.  She was driving.

                                     HAL
                         He said he took it to a motel in 
                         Oklahoma City.  He also says that at 
                         that time he met a man.  He identified 
                         you through a series of mug shots.  
                         He also told us that you and Mrs. 
                         Dickinson seemed "close." Is that 
                         true?

                                     J.D.
                         You might say we had a meeting of 
                         the minds, yes.

                                     MAX
                         Did you know that Mrs. Dickinson and 
                         Miss Sawyer are wanted in connection 
                         with a murder?

                                     J.D.
                         What?!

                                     HAL
                         Did either of them ever indicate 
                         that they might be running from the 
                         Law?

                                     J.D.
                              (surprised to hear 
                              this)
                         Now that you mention it, they might 
                         have been a little bit jumpy.

                                     HAL
                         You know what?  You're starting to 
                         irritate me.

                                     MAX
                         Yeah.  Me too.

               Hal thinks for a moment and then looks to Max.

                                     HAL
                         Do you mind if I have a word with 
                         him alone for a minute.

               Max agrees and opens the door for the others to leave.  He 
               and Hal make eye contact before Max closes the door.

                                     J.D.
                         What?!  What'd I do?

               Hal sits down across the table from J.D. and looks at him.

                                     HAL
                         Son, I gotta feelin' about somethin' 
                         and I just wanna ask your opinion.  
                         Do you think Thelma Dickinson would 
                         have committed armed robbery if you 
                         hadn't taken all their money?

               J.D. doesn't say anything.  They both just sit there for a 
               moment.

                                     HAL
                         Cat got your tongue?

               J.D. shifts in his chair.

                                     J.D.
                         How do you know I took it?  How do 
                         you know they didn't just give it to 
                         me?

                                     HAL
                         There's two girls out there that had 
                         a chance, they had a chance...!  And 
                         you blew it for 'em.  Now they've 
                         gotten in some serious trouble, some 
                         very serious trouble and for at least 
                         part of it, I'm gonna hold you 
                         personally responsible for anything 
                         that happens to them.  I've got no 
                         feelin' for you.  But I may be the 
                         only person in the world who gives a 
                         rat's ass what happens to them and 
                         you're either gonna tell me every 
                         damn thing you know, so there's a 
                         small chance I can actually do them 
                         some good, or I'm gonna be all over 
                         you like a fly on shit for the rest 
                         of your natural life.  Your misery 
                         is gonna be my goddamn mission in 
                         life.  That's a sincere promise.

               Hal walks over and opens the door and Max and the others 
               straggle back in.

                                     HAL
                         Now, for one thing, you violated 
                         your parole two days out.  And you 
                         know Judge Hainey.  He hates this 
                         sort of thing.  Once he gets wind of 
                         this, he's gonna blow sky high.  And 
                         then when he finds out that you're a 
                         possible accessory to murder and 
                         armed robbery, well, I think we can 
                         safely place your ass back in the 
                         slammer for at least the remaining 
                         eight, don't you?

                                     MAX
                         Oh, definitely.

                                     J.D.
                              (convinced)
                         Okay.  Is somebody gonna write this 
                         down?

               INT.  POLICE STATION - NIGHT

               Darryl is sitting in the hallway.  Hal comes out of the room 
               first.

                                     HAL
                         Mr. Dickinson, if you'll just hang 
                         on, I want a word with you and then 
                         we'll take you home.

               Police officers lead J.D. out of the interrogation room, 
               down the hallway.  Darryl is watching J.D. closely.  J.D. is 
               smirking at him. 

                                     J.D.
                              (slyly, to Darryl)
                         I like your wife.

                                     DARRYL
                              (going after him)
                         Come back here, you little shit!

               Hal and another police officer are restraining Darryl.

               J.D. is led off down the hall.

               EXT.  GAS STATION - NIGHT

               Louise and Thelma pull into a gas station.

               EXT.  GAS STATION - NIGHT

               A gas station attendant approaches as Louise and Thelma are 
               getting out of the car.

                                     LOUISE
                              (to attendant)
                         Fill her up.
                              (to Thelma)
                         There's a phone right over there.

                                     THELMA
                         Let's get it over with.

               Thelma and Louise walk to the phone.

                                     LOUISE
                         I'm not kidding, Thelma.  If you 
                         think he knows, even if you're not 
                         sure, hang up.

               INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               The TV is ON and the place is a mess.

               Darryl, Hal, Max, and other cops spring into action as the 
               phone RINGS, putting on headsets, turning on tape recorders.  
               Darryl picks up the phone.

                                     DARRYL
                         Hello.

               INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               Hal, Max, etc., all are gesticulating wildly.

                                     DARRYL
                              (real friendly)
                         Thelma!  Hello!

               EXT.  PAY PHONE

               Thelma hangs up the phone.

                                     THELMA
                              (matter-of-factly)
                         He knows.

               INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               Everyone is very disappointed, taking off their headsets, 
               turning off tape recorders and looking at Darryl like he's 
               an idiot.

                                     HAL
                         Shit.

               Darryl still holds the phone in his hand.

                                     DARRYL
                         What?!  All I said was hello.

               EXT.  PAY PHONE - NIGHT

               Thelma and Louise are staring at each other intently.

               Louise steps up to the phone.

                                     LOUISE
                         You got any change?

               Thelma digs in her bag and hands Louise a roll of quarters.  
               Louise gets out of the car and goes to the pay phone.  Thelma 
               follows her.  She puts the money in and dials.  It RINGS.

                                     LOUISE
                         Darryl, this is Louise.  Are the 
                         police there?

               INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               Again everybody springs into action.  Darryl is fumbling 
               with the phone.

                                     DARRYL
                         Uh, no!  No, why would any police be 
                         here?  Hey, where are you girls, 
                         anyway?

               Darryl gives Hal and Max a look as if he's got it completely 
               under control.  Clever guy.

                         What are you talking about, Louise?

               Hal comes over and takes the phone away from Darryl.  Hal 
               looks at Max who nods, "take it."

                         talk.  Please.  I wanna to help you.

               On hearing this Louise mouths the word "shit" in a very 
               frustrated way.

               Louise hangs up the phone.

               She is stomping back to the car.  Thelma follows doggedly.  
               A moving van pulls in and parks in the b.g.

                                     LOUISE

                         What.

               Louise stops as she is about to get in and faces Thelma who's 
               standing on the other side of the car.

                                     LOUISE
                         How'd they find out we're going to 
                         Mexico, Thelma, how they know that?

                                     THELMA
                         I... I...

                         where we were goin'?!

               Louise yanks open her car door, gets in and slams the door 
               and fires up the ENGINE.  Thelma hops in quickly.

                                     THELMA
                         I just told him if he ever gets to 
                         Mexico to look us up.  I asked him 
                         not to tell.  I didn't think he would 
                         tell anybody.

                                     LOUISE
                         Why not?!  What's he got to lose?  
                         Other than my life's savings, that 
                         is.  Shit!

               Louise careens back onto the road.

                                     THELMA
                         I'm sorry.  I mean I...

               Louise slams on the brakes.

                                     LOUISE
                         Goddamnit, Thelma!  Let me explain 
                         something to you.  Right now we have 
                         only two things goin' for us.  One, 
                         nobody knows where we are, and two, 
                         nobody knows where we're going.  
                         Now, one of our things that was going 
                         for us is gone!

               Louise stops yelling for a moment groping for self-control.  
               Thelma looks pitiful.

                                     LOUISE

                         now.  Let's behave that way!

                         spend our lives trading cigarettes 
                         for mascara so we can look nice when

               Thelma hands Louise a little bottle of Wild Turkey and she 
               drinks it down.  Thelma has one too.

               of laughter.

                                     LOUISE
                         What?!

                                     THELMA
                              (gasping for air)
                         Harlan.

                                     LOUISE
                         What?!  What about him?!

                                     THELMA
                         Just the look on his face when you...
                              (she is falling apart 
                              again)
                         ...it's not funny.

                                     LOUISE
                              (shocked)
                         Now, Thelma, that is not...

               Thelma is still trying to get a grip on herself.

                                     THELMA
                         Boy, he wasn't expectin' that!

                                     LOUISE
                              (scolding)
                         Thelma!

                                     THELMA
                              (impersonating Harlan)
                         Suck my dick... Boom!!

               Thelma is laughing wildly.

                                     LOUISE
                              (quietly)
                         Thelma.  It's not funny.

               Thelma has just crossed the line from laughing to crying.

                                     THELMA
                              (trying to catch her 
                              breath)
                         I know!

               They both get quiet.

               Thelma leans back just watching Louise.  She studies her as 
               if she's never really seen her before.  All of a sudden a 
               look of shocked realization comes over Thelma's face.

               She jerks upright and startles Louise.

                                     THELMA
                              (carefully)
                         It happened to you... didn't it?

               Louise knows what she is talking about.  She becomes 
               immediately agitated.

                                     LOUISE
                         I don't want to talk about it!  
                         Thelma, I'm not kidding!  Don't you 
                         even...

                                     THELMA
                         ...in Texas... didn't it?  That's 
                         what happened... Oh my God.

               Louise looks as if she is looking for a way to flee.

                                     LOUISE
                              (fighting hysteria)
                         I'm warning you, Thelma.  You better 
                         drop it right now!  I don't want to 
                         talk about it!

                                     THELMA
                              (gently)
                         Okay, Louise... It's okay.

               Louise's eyes are wild, not seeing, while Thelma now seems 
               completely serene.

               EXT.  DESERT HIGHWAY - DAWN

               The car is SCREAMING down the road.  They drive through a 
               little stand of buildings.

               EXT.  DESERT HIGHWAY - LONG LENS SHOT - DAWN

               A car speeds up to try and catch them... The red and blue 
               lights pop on.  It is a New Mexico State Patrol car.

               INT.  CAR - DAY

               Louise sees the lights in the rearview mirror.  LOUISE'S POV 
               OF THE SPEEDOMETER at 100 mph.  Thelma is asleep.

                                     LOUISE
                         Shit!  Thelma, wake up!  Shit!  We're 
                         gettin' pulled over!

               Thelma jumps awake.

                                     THELMA
                         What!  What!  Oh shit!  Oh no!

               They are trying not to panic.  They are slowing down, but 
               still doing 70 mph.  The patrol car is right behind them.

                                     THELMA
                         What do we do?  What do you want to 
                         do?!

                                     LOUISE
                         I don't know!  Shit!  Let's just 
                         play it by ear.  He may not know.  
                         He may just give me a ticket.

                                     THELMA
                         Please, God, please don't let us get 
                         caught.  Please, please, please...

               Louise pulls the car off the road.  The patrol car pulls up 
               right behind them.  The lights shine brightly in through the 
               windows.

               EXT.  SIDE OF DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY

                                     PATROLMAN (O.S.)
                         Turn off your engine.

               Louise does.  The PATROLMAN gets out of his car and approaches 
               their car.  He comes to the driver's side window.  It is 
               rolled up.

               PATROLMAN'S POV OF LOUISE smiling up at him.  He gestures to 
               her to roll her window down.  She does.

                                     LOUISE
                         Hello, Officer.  Is there a problem?

                                     PATROLMAN
                         You wanna let me see your license, 
                         please?

               Louise fumbles in her purse for her wallet, opens it and 
               shows her license.

                                     PATROLMAN
                         You wanna take it out of your wallet, 
                         please?

                                     LOUISE
                         Oh yeah.

               She does and hands it to him.

                                     THELMA
                         I told you to slow down.  Hell, 
                         Officer, I told her to slow down.

                                     LOUISE
                         About how fast was I going?

                                     PATROLMAN
                         About a hundred and ten.  You wanna 
                         step out of the car, please?

               They walk to the back of the car.  He notes the license plate 
               number.

                                     PATROLMAN
                         Is this your car?

                                     LOUISE
                         Yes.

                                     PATROLMAN
                         You wanna come with me, please?  
                         Walk around and get in the car, 
                         please.

                                     LOUISE
                         In the back?

                                     PATROLMAN
                         Front.

                                     LOUISE
                         Am I in trouble?

                                     PATROLMAN
                         As far as I'm concerned, yes, ma'am, 
                         you are.

               Patrolman gets in the driver's side.  He picks up a clipboard 
               and clips Louise's driver's license to it.  He picks up the 
               hand mike for the radio and, as he does, a hand with a gun 
               comes in his car window.  It's Thelma and she puts the gun 
               to his head.

                                     THELMA
                         Officer, I am so sorry about this.  
                         Could you let go of that?

               He drops it.

                                     THELMA
                         I really, really apologize, but please 
                         put your hands on the steering wheel.  
                         See, if you get on that radio, you're 
                         gonna find out that we're wanted in 
                         two states and probably considered 
                         armed and dangerous, at least I am, 
                         then our whole plan would be shot to 
                         hell.  Louise, take his gun.

               Louise reaches over and takes his gun.

                                     LOUISE
                              (apologetic)
                         I am really sorry about this.

                                     THELMA
                         I swear, before yesterday, neither 
                         one of us would have ever pulled a 
                         stunt like this.  But if you ever 
                         met my husband, you'd know why I 
                         just can... You wanna step out of 
                         the car, please?
                              (she opens the door 
                              for him)
                         You wanna put your hands on your 
                         head, please?  Louise, shoot the 
                         radio.

                                     LOUISE
                         What?

                                     THELMA
                         Shoot the radio!

               Louise SHOOTS the car radio.  The cop flinches with each 
               shot.

                                     THELMA
                         The police radio, Louise!  Jesus!

               Louise fires TWO SHOTS into the police radio.  It BLASTS all 
               to hell.

                                     THELMA
                         You wanna step to the back of the 
                         car, please.  Louise, bring the keys.

               Louise reaches over and takes the keys.  She takes her license 
               off the clipboard.  She gets out and trots around to the 
               back of the car.

               Thelma is holding the gun on the Patrolman.  Suddenly Thelma 
               FIRES the gun, blowing two holes into the trunk cover.

                                     THELMA
                              (to Louise)
                         Open the trunk.

               Louise opens the trunk.

                                     THELMA
                              (to Patrolman)
                         You wanna step into the trunk, please?

                                     PATROLMAN
                         Ma'am, please... I got kids... a 
                         wife...

                                     THELMA
                         You do?  Well, you're lucky.  You be 
                         sweet to 'em.  Especially your wife.  
                         My husband wasn't sweet to me and 
                         look how I turned out.  Now go on, 
                         get in there.

               As he's climbing into the trunk, Thelma explains to Louise:

                                     THELMA
                         Air holes.

               He's all the way in and Louise closes the trunk.

               INT.  PATROL CAR - DAY

               Thelma opens the glove compartment.  She takes a box of spare 
               ammo and closes it.  Thelma takes the keys and gets out of 
               the car.  She walks around to the trunk.

                         Sorry!

                              (from her car)
                         Sorry!

               Thelma hops into the car with Louise.  They look at each 
               other.

                                     LOUISE

                         Hit it.

               Louise pulls the car back onto the road and they drive away.

                         I know it's crazy, Louise, but I 
                         just feel like I've got a knack for 
                         this shit.

               Hal and Max are alone in the kitchen.  Hal switches on the 
               Mr. Coffee.

                                     MAX
                         It's just not working like this.  We 
                         gotta do something.  It'd be one 
                         thing if these girls were hardened 
                         criminals, but Jesus, Hal, this is 
                         makin' us look bad.  I don't know... 
                         maybe they're not movin'.  Maybe 
                         that little creep lied.

                                     HAL
                         He's got nothin' to gain by lyin'.  
                         Nothin' at all.  He already got all 
                         their money.  I just don't know what 
                         we're dealin' with here.  Anyway, it 
                         went out again last night on 
                         Nationwide Teletype.  Let's just 
                         wait it out a little longer.  She 
                         said she was gonna call back.  Let's 
                         just sit tight.

                                     MAX
                         We don't have a whole lotta choice, 
                         do we?  I can't figure out if they're 
                         real smart or just really, really 
                         lucky.

                                     HAL
                         It don't matter.  Brains will only 
                         get you so far and luck always runs 
                         out.

               A cop walks into the kitchen and hands Hal a file that says 
               Louise Elizabeth Sawyer on the outside.  He opens it up and 
               starts looking through a personal history.  One piece of 
               paper is a case file from Texas containing an incident report 
               of a rape.  Stamped across it are the words "charges dropped."

               INT.  CAR - DAY

                                     THELMA
                         Louise... are we still going to 
                         Mexico?

                                     LOUISE
                         Yes.

               Thelma pauses while she searches for the logic.

                                     THELMA
                         Then aren't we going in the wrong 
                         direction?

                                     LOUISE
                         Well, I figure if you take a state 
                         policeman, shoot up his car, take 
                         his gun and lock him in the trunk, 
                         it's best to just get on out of the 
                         state if you can.

                                     THELMA
                         Just asking.

               They are both quiet for a second.  Louise goes a little 
               faster.

               Thelma is digging through her bag.  She hands Louise a piece 
               of beef jerky.

                                     LOUISE
                         I don't want to see any more beef 
                         jerky.  I mean the next beef jerky 
                         you hand me is going out the window.  
                         It's drivin' me crazy.  The whole 
                         car smells like it.

                                     THELMA
                         It's good.  It's what the pioneers 
                         ate.

                                     LOUISE
                         I don't care what the damn pioneers 
                         ate.  You just keep that shit away 
                         from me, now I mean it.

               Thelma puts down her bag.

                                     LOUISE
                         And I don't want any more Wild Turkey, 
                         either.  It's burning a hole in my 
                         stomach.

                                     THELMA
                         Okay, okay... I've got some tequila.  
                         You want some tequila?

                                     LOUISE
                         You do?

                                     THELMA
                         Yeah, you want it?

                                     LOUISE
                         Yeah.

               Thelma starts to dig through her bag again.

                                     THELMA
                         It's in here somewhere.

               Louise is rubbing her face.  She looks pretty bad.  Her hands 
               are shaking.

                                     LOUISE
                         Shit.  I'm gettin' tired.

                                     THELMA
                         Are you alright?

               Louise does not really seem alright.

                                     LOUISE
                         I think I've really fucked up.  I 
                         think I've got us in a situation 
                         where we could both get killed.  Why 
                         didn't we just go straight to the 
                         police.

                                     THELMA
                         You know why.  You already said.

                                     LOUISE
                         What'd I say again?

                                     THELMA
                         Nobody would believe us.  We'd still 
                         get in trouble.  We'd still have our 
                         lives ruined.  And you know what 
                         else?

                                     LOUISE
                         What?

                                     THELMA
                         That guy was hurtin' me.  And if you 
                         hadn't come out when you did, he'd a 
                         hurt me a lot worse.  And probably 
                         nothin' woulda happened to him. 'Cause 
                         everybody did see me dancin' with 
                         him all night.  And they woulda made 
                         out like I asked for it.  And my 
                         life woulda been ruined a whole lot 
                         worse than it is now.  At least now 
                         I'm havin' fun.  And I'm not sorry 
                         the son of a bitch is dead.  I'm 
                         only sorry that it was you that did 
                         it and not me.  And if I haven't, I 
                         wanna take this time to thank you, 
                         Louise.  Thank you for savin' my 
                         ass.

                                     LOUISE
                         I said all that?

                                     THELMA
                         No, Louise, you said the first part.  
                         I said all the rest.

                                     LOUISE
                              (tired)
                         Whatever.

               EXT.  ROADSIDE REST STATION - MORNING

               Louise is at a pay phone as the sky is just starting to get 
               light.  Thelma is in the bathroom nearby.  Louise has already 
               dialed and the phone is RINGING.

               INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - MORNING

               The TV DRONES on in the b.g. as the phone RINGS there, 
               everyone leaps into action again.  Max picks up the phone.

                                     MAX
                         Hello.

                                     LOUISE (V.O.)
                         Let me speak to... Slocumbe.

                              (to Hal)
                         She wants to talk to you.

                                     HAL
                         Hello, Louise.

                         Hey.

                                     HAL (V.O.)
                         How are things goin' out there?

                                     LOUISE
                         Weird.  Got some kind of snowball 
                         effect goin' here or somethin'.

                                     HAL (V.O.)
                         You're still with us though.  You're 
                         somewhere on the face of the earth?

                                     LOUISE
                         Well, we're not in the middle of 
                         nowhere, but we can see it from here.

               INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - MORNING

               Hal smiles.

                                     HAL
                         I swear.  Louise, I almost feel like 
                         I know you.

                                     LOUISE (V.O.)
                         Well.  You don't.

                                     HAL
                         You're gettin' in deeper every moment 
                         you're gone.

                                     LOUISE (V.O.)
                         Would you believe me if I told you 
                         this whole thing is an accident?

                                     HAL
                         I do believe you.  That's what I 
                         want everybody to believe.  Trouble 
                         is, it doesn't look like an accident 
                         and you're not here to tell me about 
                         it... I need you to help me here.

               EXT.  PAY PHONE - MORNING

               Louise does not answer.

                                     HAL (V.O.)
                         Did Harlan Puckett...

               Through clenched teeth, repulsed:

                                     LOUISE
                              (interrupting)
                         No!

                                     HAL (V.O.)
                         You want to come on in?

               Louise thinks for a minute.

                                     LOUISE
                         I don't think so.

               INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - DAY

                                     HAL
                         Then I'm sorry.  We're gonna have to 
                         charge you with murder.  Now, do you 
                         want to come out of this alive?

               The surveillance man motions to Hal to keep it going.

               Darryl comes in and immediately realizes Hal is talking to 
               Louise.  Darryl looks attentively at Hal.

               EXT.  PAY PHONE - DAY

                                     LOUISE
                         You know, certain words and phrases 
                         just keep floating through my mind, 
                         things like incarceration, cavity 
                         search, life imprisonment, death by 
                         electrocution, that sort of thing.  
                         So, come out alive?  I don't know.  
                         Let us think about that.

                                     HAL (V.O.)
                         Louise, I'll do anything.  I know 
                         what's makin' you run.  I know what 
                         happened to you in Texas.

               Louise's eyes get wide as she hears this.

               A FINGER reaches up and presses down the lever and hangs up 
               the phone.

               ANGLE OF THELMA

               She has her finger on the lever.

                                     THELMA
                         Come on, Louise.  Don't blow it.  
                         Let's go.

               She walks away towards the car.  Louise is still standing 
               there holding the phone.  Thelma stops and looks at her.

                                     THELMA
                         Come on.

               Louise doesn't move.

               INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - DAY

               Frustrated, Hal slams down the phone.  He looks over at the 
               surveillance man who nods to say "we got it."  The whole 
               room reacts excitedly.  Everyone in the room springs into 
               action.  Max immediately picks up the phone and Hal watches 
               him intently.  He mouths the words to Max -- "I wanna go" 
               emphatically.  Max slightly shakes his head, still of the 
               phone.  Hal goes charging over to Max.

                                     HAL
                         Max.  You gotta take me there!  I'm... 
                         I'm the only one she's ever talked 
                         to.  I don't want anybody losin' 
                         their heads.  You know what happens.  
                         The volume gets turned way up and 
                         the next thing you know those girls 
                         are gonna get shot.

               Max, still holding the phone, is surprised by this outburst.

                                     MAX
                              (calmly)
                         Okay, Hal, okay.

               EXT.  PAY PHONE - DAY

               Louise is still standing there.

                                     THELMA
                         Louise?

                                     LOUISE
                         Yes, Thelma?

                                     THELMA
                         You're not gonna give up on me, are 
                         ya?

                                     LOUISE
                         What do you mean?

                                     THELMA
                         You're not gonna make some deal with 
                         that guy, are you?  I mean, I just 
                         wanna know.

                                     LOUISE
                         No, Thelma.  I'm not gonna make any 
                         deals.

                                     THELMA
                         I can understand if you're thinkin' 
                         about it.  I mean, in a way, you've 
                         got something to go back for.  I 
                         mean Jimmy and everything.

               Louise is surprised to be hearing this from Thelma.

                                     LOUISE
                         Thelma, that is not an option.

                                     THELMA
                         But I don't know... something's 
                         crossed over in me and I can't go 
                         back.  I mean, I just couldn't live...

                                     LOUISE
                         I know.  I know what you mean.  I 
                         don't wanna end up on the damn Geraldo 
                         Show.

               They are both quiet for a moment.

                                     LOUISE
                         He said they're charging us with 
                         murder.

                                     THELMA
                              (making a face)
                         Eeuww.

                                     LOUISE
                         And we have to decide whether we 
                         want to come out of this dead or 
                         alive.

                                     THELMA
                         Gosh, didn't he say anything positive 
                         at all?

               Louise STARTS the car.  They lurch into reverse then SCREECH 
               forward as they tear off down the road.

               WIDE SHOT OF CAR

               as they fly down the road.

                                     THELMA
                         Louise, do you think we should change 
                         cars, get another car?

                                     LOUISE
                         Sure... You know how to hotwire a 
                         car?

                                     THELMA
                         No.

                                     LOUISE
                         Well, let me know when you figure it 
                         out.

               EXT.  AIRSTRIP - DAY

               A car pulls up on an airstrip and stops next to a small jet.  
               Hal and Max get out of the car and board the plane.

               EXT.  DESERT - DAY

               MONTAGE of driving shots as Louise and Thelma drive through 
               the intense beauty of the Arizona desert.

               INT.  CAR - DAY

                                     THELMA
                         You awake?

                                     LOUISE
                         You could call it that.  My eyes are 
                         open.

                                     THELMA
                         Me too.  I feel awake.

                                     LOUISE
                         Good.

                                     THELMA
                         Wide awake.  I don't remember ever 
                         feelin' this awake.  Everything looks 
                         different.  You know what I mean.  I 
                         know you know what I mean.  Everything 
                         looks new.  Do you feel like that?  
                         Like you've got something to look 
                         forward to?

               Louise and Thelma both get quiet for a second.

                                     LOUISE
                         We'll be drinkin' margaritas by the 
                         sea, Mamasita.

                                     THELMA
                         We can change our names.

                                     LOUISE
                         We can live in a hacienda.

                                     THELMA
                         I wanna get a job.  I wanna work at 
                         Club Med.

                                     LOUISE
                         Yes!  Yes!  Now what kind of deal do 
                         you think that cop can come up with 
                         to beat that?

                                     THELMA
                         It'd have to be pretty good.

                                     LOUISE
                         It would have to be pretty damn good.

               They are both laughing.  The car is still flying down the 
               road.  The sun is coming higher in the sky now.  They come 
               to an intersection in the middle of nowhere.  Louise stops 
               and looks at the map.

                                     LOUISE
                         We should head a little further in.  
                         There's not that many roads in this 
                         state.  I want to try to hit Mexico 
                         somewhere not so close to New Mexico.  
                         They probably wanna kill us in New 
                         Mexico.

                                     THELMA
                         You're drivin'.

               Louise takes a right turn and speeds down the road.

               EXT.  DESERT ROAD - DAY

               Louise and Thelma are singing along to a wild R&B SONG.  
               They do the hand movements as if they are the Supremes.

               They come roaring up on the semi-tanker, the same one they 
               have seen three times before.

                                     THELMA
                              (screaming over music)
                         Oh my God!  Louise!  Look!  Look!  
                         See if that's him!

                                     LOUISE
                         It's him.  He's got California plates.  
                         It's the same guy.

                                     THELMA
                         Pass him!

               EXT.  DESERT ROAD - DAY

               Louise bears down really hard and passes him.  Again as they 
               get right next to him, he blows kisses down at them.

               He is leering at them and laughing.  Louise and Thelma drive 
               further down the road.

               Louise pulls the car off to the side of the road.  As the 
               truck gets close they start waving to him to stop.  He pulls 
               his truck off the side of the road and stops.  ANGLE ON Louise 
               and Thelma smiling up at him.  He chuckles to himself.  He 
               leans out the window.

                                     THELMA
                         Hi!

                                     TRUCKER
                         Hi there!  You alright?

                                     THELMA
                         We're fine!  How are you?

                                     TRUCKER
                         Grrrreat!

                         Follow us.

               They turn off onto a dirt road and pull to a stop.

               INT.  TRUCK CAB - DAY

               The Trucker reaches over and opens a glove compartment crammed 
               full of condoms.  He grabs a few and shoves them in his 
               pocket.  He turns off his engine and gets out of the truck.

               EXT.  SIDE OF ROAD - DAY

               He walks up to the car.

               Louise and Thelma get out of the car.

                                     THELMA
                         Where you goin'?

                         Fresno.

                         We been seein' you all along the 
                         way.

                                     TRUCKER
                         Yeah.  I been seein' you, too.

                                     THELMA
                         We think you have really bad manners.

               Louise nods.

                                     LOUISE
                         We were just wonderin' where you 
                         think you get off behavin' like that 
                         to women you don't even know.

               This is not what is supposed to be happening.

                                     TRUCKER
                         What?  What are you talkin' about?

                                     LOUISE
                         You know good and damn well what I'm 
                         talkin' about.

                                     THELMA
                         I mean really!  That business with 
                         your tongue.  What is that?  That's 
                         disgusting!

                                     LOUISE
                         And, oh my God, that other thing, 
                         that pointing to your lap?  What's 
                         that supposed to mean exactly?  Does 
                         that mean pull over, I want to show 
                         you what a big fat slob I am or...

                                     THELMA
                         Does that mean suck my dick?

                                     TRUCKER
                         You women are crazy!

                                     LOUISE
                         You got that right.

                                     THELMA
                         We think you should apologize.

               He is getting a little panicky.

                                     TRUCKER
                         I'm not apologizing for shit!

                                     LOUISE
                         Say you're sorry.

                                     TRUCKER
                         Fuck that.

               Louise pulls the gun they stole from the State Patrolman.

                                     LOUISE
                         Say you're sorry or we'll make you 
                         fuckin' sorry.

               He looks at the gun.

                                     TRUCKER
                         Oh, Jesus!

                                     THELMA
                         You probably even called us beavers 
                         on your CB radio, didn't you?

                                     TRUCKER
                         Yeah... sure did.

                                     THELMA
                         Damn.  I hate that!  I hate bein' 
                         called a beaver, don't you?

                                     LOUISE
                         Are you going to apologize or not?

                                     TRUCKER
                         Fuck you.

               Louise looks at his truck off in the distance.  She points 
               the gun at it, takes a second to get a bead, then SHOOTS two 
               of the tires flat.  The truck slowly sinks as the air escapes 
               from the tires.

                                     TRUCKER
                         Oh goddamn!!  You bitch!!

               Louise and Thelma look at each other.  They both turn towards 
               the truck and FIRE rounds into the tankers until they EXPLODE 
               in a huge ball of fire.  The truck driver screams at the top 
               of his lungs.  Louise starts the car and starts driving in 
               circles around the truck driver.  Thelma and Louise are both 
               howling at the top of their lungs.  Thelma is sitting on the 
               back of the front seat with her legs on the dashboard.

                                     TRUCKER
                         You fucking bitch!  Aaaaaaarrrgghh!!!  
                         You're gonna have to pay for that!!!  
                         I'm gonna make you pay for that!!  
                         You hear me??!!

               Louise stops the car right next to him.

                                     THELMA
                         Shut up.

               Louise takes off again and Thelma falls into the back seat.  
               They drive off trailing a huge cloud of dust.

               EXT.  DESERT - DAY

               Louise drives through the desert back towards the road, past 
               the burning debris of the truck.  As she gets to the road 
               she stops.  Thelma climbs into the front seat.

               INT.  CAR - DAY

                                     THELMA
                         Hey.  Where'd you learn to shoot 
                         like that?

                                     LOUISE
                         Texas... You were right about what 
                         happened to me there.

               They pull away from the burning wreckage.

               INT.  CAR - DAY

               As Thelma and Louise talk, their voices are heard over the

                                     THELMA (V.O.)
                         What?

                                     LOUISE (V.O.)
                              (smiling)
                         We've gone insane.

                                     THELMA (V.O.)

               A battered old pickup truck is parked by the New Mexico State 
               Patrol.  An old man uses a crowbar to pry open the trunk.  
               The New Mexico State Patrolman hops out of the trunk.

               EXT.  DESERT ROAD - HELICOPTER SHOT - DAY

               Police Bulletin VOICE OVER BEGINS AND PLAYS OVER following 
               scenes:

               A police helicopter flies over the burning wreckage of the 
               fuel truck.  The truck driver is waving his arms as the 
               helicopter descends, blowing dirt all over him.

               INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - DAY

               Darryl sits practically comatose in a big chair.  His eyes 
               have a dull glaze as he stares first at one wall, then 
               another.

               INT.  CAR - DAY

               A TIGHT SHOT of a TAPE being shoved into the cassette deck.

               INT.  FBI JET - DAY

               Max and Hal sit next to each other in the jet.  Hal tries to 
               appear as if he's used to all this.  Max holds a cellular 
               phone to his ear.

               TIGHT SHOT of Max as we hear through the phone:

               Police VOICE OVER becomes part of scene.

                                     POLICE (V.O.)
                              (on phone)

                         stole the officer's weapon... 
                         tanker... blown up... terrorized...

               Max's face becomes troubled and more serious than we've seen 
               so far.  He looks at Hal as he hangs up the phone.

                                     MAX
                         You're not even going to believe 
                         this.

               WIDE SHOT of car speeding through the desert on an empty 
               highway west.  DRIVING SHOT -- Thelma has her face to the 
               sun with her eyes closed.  Louise is driving with a fierce 
               intensity.  They hardly resemble the two women that started 
               out for a weekend in the mountains two days earlier.  Although 
               their faces are tanned and lined and their hair is blowing 
               wildly there is a sense of serenity that pervades.

               EXT.  HELIPORT - DAY

               Hal and Max are climbing out of the jet and running across 
               the tarmac to a waiting helicopter.  Max is carrying a walkie-
               talkie now.

               INT.  CAR - DAY

               Thelma sits up suddenly.  An Arizona police car passes them 
               going eastbound.

                                     THELMA
                         Oh shit.  Louise... Do you think he 
                         saw us?

                                     LOUISE
                         I don't know, but let's get off.

               LOUISE'S POV - REARVIEW MIRROR

               The police car cuts across the median to begin pursuit of 
               the girls.  The lights are flashing.

                         Is your seat belt on?

               Thelma puts her seat belt on.  Louise floors the car and it 
               streaks off, putting some distance between them and the police 
               car.  Thelma looks back at the police car.  She looks scared.

                                     THELMA
                         I guess we shoulda made some kinda 
                         plan for what to do if we get caught.

                                     LOUISE
                         Yeah, right.  We're not gonna get 
                         caught.

               A steady stream of state police cars pulls out of the parking 
               lot with lights flashing while other policemen are running 
               to their cars still parked in the lot.

                         About two hundred and fifty miles.

                         How long do you think that'll take?

               EXT.  DESERT ROAD - DAY

               There are now two police cars behind them about half a mile 
               back.  They are going really fast.  A police helicopter 
               catches up to them and orders them to stop.  Thelma stands 
               and flips them off.

                                     THELMA
                         We're going to Mexico!

                         Uh oh.  There's another one.

               Louise and Thelma both are looking back at the two police 
               cars following them.  They turn back around just in time to 
               see a third Arizona State police car has pulled into the 
               middle of an intersection of the only road that crosses it 
               for miles.  They both scream.  Louise swerves just in time 
               to keep from hitting it broadside.  She goes off the road 
               and has to struggle to pull her car back onto the road, 
               leaving a huge cloud of dust.

                                     LOUISE
                         Shit!

                         Did you see that guy?!  He was right 
                         in the middle of the road!

               EXT.  DESERT ROAD - DAY

               The first two police cars are approaching the same 
               intersection.  They are driving side by side.  There is still 
               a huge cloud of dust that now covers the third car in the 
               middle of the intersection.

               INT.  POLICE CAR #1 - POV - DAY

               A huge cloud of dust blows across the road as he approaches 
               the intersection.  It clears to reveal the third police car 
               in the middle of the road, just as he and police car #2 reach 
               the intersection.  ANGLE ON POLICEMAN #1 as he screams and 
               swerves to the right.

               INT.  POLICE CAR #3 - DAY

               ANGLE ON POLICEMAN #3 AS HE SEES BOTH POLICE CARS HEADING

               right for him at 120 mph.  He screams and ducks down into 
               the seat.

               ANOTHER ANGLE - POLICE CAR #

               swerves to the right.  Police car #2 swerves to the left, 
               both barely missing police car #3.

               ANOTHER ANGLE as police car #1 and police car #2 both pull 
               back onto the road right next to each other.

               INT.  POLICE CAR #3 - DAY

               Policeman #3 sits up in the seat.  He can't believe he isn't 
               dead.  He puts his car in gear and takes off down the road 
               after them.

               EXT.  DESERT GHOST TOWN - DAY

               Louise and Thelma blow through a stand of buildings left 
               from when the train went through here.  There are two parallel 
               streets on either side of the one they're on and, as they 
               pass by buildings, they can see police cars ROARING down 
               these parallel streets trying to "head them off at the pass."  
               Louise FLOORS it and her car screams ahead.

                                     LOUISE
                         We probably shoulda filled up the 
                         car before we blew up that truck.

                                     THELMA
                         Why?

                         They'll probably catch us when we 
                         have to stop for gas!

                                     THELMA
                         I know this whole thing was my fault.  
                         I know it is.

                         There's one thing you oughta 
                         understand by now, Thelma, it's not 
                         your fault.

                                     THELMA
                         Louise... no matter what happens,

               Louise swerves off the road and begins driving across the 
               desert.  All the police cars take off across the desert after 
               them.  They are now being pursued by at least fifteen cars.

                         I guess I went a little crazy, huh?

                                     LOUISE
                         No... You've always been crazy.  
                         This is just the first chance you've 
                         had to really express yourself.

                         I guess everything from here on in 
                         is going to be pretty shitty.

                         Unbearable, I'd imagine.

                         I guess everything we've got to lose 
                         is already gone anyway.

               They smile.

               EXT.  DESERT - DAY

               It does look like an Army.  More police cars have joined, 
               and from every direction, police cars are swarming across 
               the desert, although none are in front of them.  Way off in 
               the distance, a helicopter joins the chase.

               Thelma is looking way up ahead in the distance.

                                     THELMA
                         Louise!

                                     LOUISE
                         What?!

                                     THELMA
                         What in the hell is that up there?

                                     LOUISE
                         Where?!

                                     THELMA
                         Way up ahead!

               Louise strains to see.  Whatever it is, Louise is barreling 
               towards it, the car leaving the ground as they fly through 
               the desert.

                                     LOUISE
                         Oh my God!!

               Louise starts to laugh and cry at the same time.

                                     THELMA
                         What in the hell is it?!

                                     LOUISE
                         It's the Goddamn Grand Canyon!

               EXT.  DESERT - DAY

               Behind them is a huge wall of dust created by all the police 
               cars following them.  In front of them, looking larger every 
               moment, is the awesome splendor of the Grand Canyon.

               INT.  CAR - DAY

                                     THELMA
                         Isn't it beautiful?!!

                                     LOUISE
                         It's grand!

               Louise has tears streaming down her face as she realizes 
               there is absolutely no escape.  She continues barreling 
               towards it without slowing down.

               EXT.  DESERT - DAY

               All the police cars are still following about a half a mile 
               behind.  The car is bouncing and flying across the desert.  
               Finally, they get about twenty yards from the edge and Louise 
               SLAMS on the brakes.

               Thelma and Louise are just waiting for the cars to catch up.  
               The police cars stop in a line about two hundred yards behind 
               them.  The dust from the cars is blowing across them.  They 
               just sit looking at the Grand Canyon.

               From the canyon, the FBI helicopter rises up in front of the 
               car.

               INT.  FBI HELICOPTER - DAY

               Hal sees Thelma and Louise for the first time.  They are 
               sitting in the car, oblivious in a way, to all the activity 
               around them.  He only takes his eyes off of them long enough 
               to look at Max.

               INT.  CAR - DAY

                                     THELMA
                         God!  It looks like the Army!

                                     LOUISE
                         All this for us?

               Thelma starts to laugh.  Louise is only concerned with missing 
               the cacti and other obstacles that lie before her.

               INT.  FBI HELICOPTER - DAY

               The helicopter lands behind the row of police cars.

               HAL'S POV

               He sees Thelma and Louise facing each other.  They look so 
               nice.  He can't stop looking.  He borrows the binoculars 
               from Max.  He sees Thelma and Louise in the car.  Some of 
               the police sharpshooters are sporting semi-automatic rifles.  
               Hal looks at Max.

                                     HAL
                         Hey!  Don't let them shoot those 
                         girls.  This is too much.  They got 
                         guns pointed at 'em!

                                     MAX
                         The women are armed, Hal.  This is 
                         standard.  Now you stay calm here.  
                         These boys know what they're doin'.

               Max climbs out of the chopper.  Hal sits for a moment and 
               then leaps out and follows Max.

                                     POLICE (O.S.)
                              (over loudspeaker)

                         considered armed and dangerous.  Any

                         against us.

                                     THELMA
                         Now what?

                                     LOUISE
                         We're not giving up, Thelma.

                                     THELMA
                         Then let's not get caught.

                                     LOUISE
                         What are you talkin' about?

                                     THELMA
                              (indicating the Grand 
                              Canyon)
                         Go.

                         Go?

               Thelma is smiling at her.

                                     THELMA
                         Go.

               They look at each other, look back at the wall of police 
               cars, and then look back at each other.  They smile.

               TWO OF THE ARIZONA COPS by their cars, as they are loading 
               weapons, talk quietly.

                                     ARIZONA COP #1
                         ...heard they shot a cop.

                         With his own gun.  Put him in the 
                         trunk and blew him away...

               INT.  CAR - DAY

               Louise and Thelma are looking at each other.

                                     POLICE (O.S.)
                              (over loudspeaker)
                         Turn off the engine and place your 
                         hands in the air!

               EXT.  DESERT - DAY

               Hal is about to crawl out of his skin.  He can't believe 
               this thing is getting out of control.  He jumps in front of 
               Max.

                                     HAL
                         Max!  Let me talk to 'em!  I can't 
                         believe this!  You've gotta do 
                         something here!

               Max goes around Hal and continues walking.  Hal jumps in 
               front of Max again and blocks his way.

                                     HAL
                         I'm sorry to bother you, I know you're 
                         real busy right now, but how many 
                         times, Max?  How many times has that 
                         woman gotta be fucked over?  You 
                         could lift one finger and save her 
                         ass and you won't even do that?

                                     MAX
                              (grabbing Hal)
                         Get a hold of yourself!  You are way 
                         out of your jurisdiction, now come 
                         on!  Calm down!  Don't make me sorry 
                         I let you come!

               Max lets go of Hal's lapels.

                                     HAL
                              (under his breath)
                         Shit!  I can't fucking believe this!

               Hal walks along with a look of total disbelief on his face.  
               He's shaking his head.  Slowly he breaks into a trot and 
               starts heading toward the front line.

                                     MAX
                              (shouting)
                         Hey.  Hey!

               Hal is running now and clears the front row of cars.

               There is a lot of confusion among the officers on the front 
               row.  Some shout, some lower their guns to look.

                                     ARIZONA COP #1
                         What in the hell?!

                         The son of a bitch is in my way!

               INT.  CAR - DAY

               They are still looking at each other really hard.

                                     THELMA
                         You're a good friend.

                                     LOUISE
                         You, too, sweetie, the best.

               SHOOT WITH OR WITHOUT.

               MUSIC:  B.B. King song entitled "Better Not Look Down" begins.  
               It is very upbeat.

                                     LOUISE
                         Are you sure?

               Thelma nods.

                                     THELMA
                         Hit it.

               Louise puts the car in gear and FLOORS it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT.  DESERT - DAY

               Hal's eyes widen for a moment at what he sees, and then a 
               sense of calm overtakes him and he mouths the word "alright."

                                     B.B. KING SONG (V.O.)
                         I've been around, I've seem some 
                         things, People movin' faster than 
                         the speed of sound, faster than a

                         say if it's right.  I'm pretty fast

                         to pass along, right here in the

               EXT.  DESERT - DAY

               The cops all lower their weapons as looks of shock and 
               disbelief cover their faces.  A cloud of dust blows THROUGH 
               THE FRAME as the speeding car sails over the edge of the 
               cliff.

                                     B.B. KING SONG (V.O.)

                         keep on flyin'.  Put the hammer down, 
                         keep it full speed ahead.  Better

               In the winter of 1982 these men were commissioned by the 
               United States National Science Foundation to gather data 
               concerning the physical and natural sciences on the continent 
               of Antarctica.

                          THE MAIN COMPOUND OF U.S. OUTPOST #31

               The interior is a cramped and never ending maze of hallways, 
               passageways and doors which connect the many rooms and 
               compartments within the compound. Sturdy, but prefabricated 
               materials have been used in its construction.

               There is a laboratory. An infirmary. A kitchen and mess hall. 
               A communications room and sleeping quarters. Other cubicles 
               are for storage and supplies.

               The most spacious area of the building, and the main center 
               of activity, is the Rec Room. Of the many entrance ways to 
               this room can be seen the small work chambers with their 
               sophisticated computers and other scientific equipment.

               The below quarter houses the generator and still other 
               compartments for storage.

               A long underground tunnel connects the main compound to the 
               dog kennel.

               FADE IN:

               A STARRY BLACKNESS

               From out of the billions, the smallest of specks drives slowly 
               forward. It closes; getting larger; its features becoming 
               more identifiable: a vessel. Flip-flopping; out of control. 
               Its stern roaring with flame. It passes; its blue fire surging 
               into the screen.

                                       "THE THING"

               A thundering...

                                                                   FADE TO:

               BLIND AND FERAL WHITENESS

               ...Glacial desert... gusts of snow... superimpose:

                                  ANTARCTICA 1982 WINTER

               A SOUND

               Loud and strident. A helicopter streaks across frame. It 
               travels precariously close to the ground; its chassis battered 
               and swayed by the wind.

               INT. COPTER

               Red dials beam on the faces of two men. One carries a rifle 
               and searches the horizon with binoculars. The other pilots. 
               Their unkempt faces, their blazing eyes notate a wildness. 
               They bark at each other in some Scandinavian tongue. Two men 
               arguing like mad and desperate children.

               The man with the binoculars sights something.

               EXT. HORIZON - BINOCULARS' POV - A DOG

               It turns and snarls at the craft some fifteen hundred yards 
               to its rear. Then whirls and gallops off. A gun blast kicks 
               up snow at its heels.

               INT. COPTER

               Another blast of rifle fire as the man takes issue with his 
               prey. The pilot slams a fist into his gunman friend and 
               implores for better aim. The craft swoops lower and the engine 
               is put into full throttle.

               EXT. HILL - THE DOG

               running feverishly up and over a hill of ice. A weather- 
               beaten, wooden sign sticks up on the other side:

                     U.S. NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION -- OUTPOST #31

               A rifle blast kicks up more snow.

               EXT. COMPOUND OF U.S. OUTPOST #31

               A large, almost snow-covered building. Not far from that a 
               tall, meteorological balloon tower.

               A scattering of several small shacks at varying distances 
               from the main compound. The smaller hovels are connected by 
               wooden planked walkways and steadying ropes. Multicolored 
               pennants stick put of the snow marking pathways and directions 
               to outdoor experiments.

               A tractor and two helicopters sit idle, covered with mounds 
               of continuously mounting snow.

               TWO MEN, NORRIS AND BENNINGS

               standing some thirty yards from the main building are in the 
               process of letting up a large red balloon. Childs, a hefty 
               black man, is twenty yards away tinkering with a snowmobile. 
               Their beards are caked with ice. It is winter and it is harsh.

               The faint sound of the copter turns their attention.

               THE COPTER

               flying ever lower now. The man with the gun leans dangerously 
               outside and fires away at the dog as it nears the outpost.

               THE MEN

               outside the compound look to one another, incredulous.

               THE COPTER

               much too low now, and chastised by the wind, attempts a high-
               speed landing, directly on the heels of the sprinting dog.  
               It bounces violently on the hard-packed surface.

               Once. Twice. Passing the dog.

               A third bounce sends it skidding. It flips; its blades 
               snapping off like toothpicks. It lands belly-up, soundless 
               except for the whine of its engine.

               The man with the gun rolls out before the explosion.

               INT. MAIN COMPOUND

               The half a dozen men, playing cards, monitoring equipment, 
               listening to music -- spring to their feet, startled.

               EXT. COMPOUND

               The dog reaches Norris and Bennings, as they awkwardly wade 
               through the snow, toward the downed copter.

               THE SURVIVOR

               of the crash, his eyes crazed with determination, struggles 
               to his feet. Heedless of his companion, he double-times his 
               way to the men and the dog. He reloads his gun and bellows 
               in his Scandinavian tongue.

               Norris and Bennings have no idea what he is saying.

               The survivor waves his arms as if shooting them off, screaming 
               as he does so; his face now caked with blood.

               The two men are bewildered. The dog jumps up, licking and 
               pawing them, imploring for safety.

               Blam!! The visitor fires. The men jump back in disbelief.

                                     NORRIS
                         What the fu...

               Blam! Blam! The crazed visitor screams and fires as he stalks 
               after them. His countenance ablaze, mad. Ice and snow kick 
               up about the terrified Americans. A bullet smacks into the 
               dog's hip, sending it skidding and howling in pain.

               Childs, the black man by the snowmobile, takes cover, diving 
               behind his machine.

               Bennings is hit. Norris pulls, drags him back toward the 
               compound. The dog crawls along beside them.

               The intruder is relentless in his assail. He runs, screaming, 
               firing, screaming, reloading and firing.

               INT. COMPOUND

               Total confusion. Some watch helplessly through the small, 
               fogged-up and translucent windows. Others try to mobilize 
               grabbing for their heavy jackets.

               CLOSE ON A .357 MAGNUM

               as it efficiently breaks through a windowpane and into the 
               cold. A steady hand grips it firmly.

               THE SCANDINAVIAN

               getting closer. Kablam! Suddenly, his head jerks back. He 
               falls to his knees and then face down into the snow.

               NORRIS AND BENNINGS

               stare blankly, but relievedly at the fallen man. The dog 
               whimpers in pain.

               CHILDS

               pokes his head out from under the snowmobile.

               INT. MAIN COMPOUND - REC ROOM

               The rumbling of voices fades. The men adjust their eyes to 
               station manager Garry, as he extracts his gun from the broken 
               window, relieves it of its spent shell and puts it away.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BURNING COPTER

               Several men spray snow on the burning wreckage. There is no 
               hope for the pilot.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. COMPOUND

               CLOSE ON THE PALLID FACE OF THE SCANDINAVIAN INTRUDER

               A neat round hole is set in the middle of his forehead.

               Station manager Garry holds up something akin to an ID.

                                     GARRY
                         Norwegian... Jans Bolen.

               Fuchs, a young and sensitive-looking biologist, stands closest 
               to the large area map of Antarctica. Several men sit and 
               stand around viewing the body that lies on two brought-
               together card-tables.

                                     FUCHS
                         Gotta be from the Norwegian camp.

                                     GARRY
                         How far's that?

                                     FUCHS
                         'Bout eighty kilos southwest.

                                     GARRY
                              (surprised)
                         That far?

               Garry directs his attention to Childs, the large black man 
               who had been working on the snowmobile. Next to him sits 
               Norris, the rugged-looking, fortyish, geophysicist, who was 
               one of the men being shot at.

                                     GARRY
                         You catch anything he was saying?

                                     CHILDS
                         Am I starting to look Norwegian to 
                         you, Bwana?

               Garry motions inquiringly to Norris.

                                     NORRIS
                         Yeah. I caught that he wanted the 
                         better part of my ass to come apart.

               INT. INFIRMARY

               Dr. Cooper, mid-forties, works on the outstretched leg of 
               Bennings, the meteorologist. Clark, the dog handler, is 
               mending the hip of the wounded dog off in the corner.

               Bennings lets out with an ouch.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Don't "ouch" me. Two stitches. It 
                         just grazed you.

               He helps a shaken Bennings up off the table.

                                     BENNINGS
                         What in the hell were they doing...?  
                         Flying that low... shooting at a 
                         dog... at us...

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Stir crazy. Cabin fever... Who knows.

               The dog yelps and whimpers as Clark tries to calm him.

                                     CLARK
                         I'll be here a while. Shell's pretty 
                         deep.

               INT. RADIO ROOM

               Blair, senior biologist, fifty, balding, leans against the 
               entrance door.

               He looks on as the young, bored-looking radio operator, 
               Sanchez, attends to his equipment. Bursts of static.

                                     SANCHEZ
                         It's no go.

                                     BLAIR
                         Well, get to somebody. Anybody. We've 
                         got to report this mess.

                                     SANCHEZ
                         Look, I haven't been able to reach 
                         shit in two weeks. Doubt if anybody's 
                         talked to anybody on the whole 
                         continent.

               INT. HALLWAY

               Nauls, the cook, glides along on his roller stakes down one 
               of the many narrow hallways that connect the various 
               compartments of the main compound. He is black, a little 
               mischievous, about twenty-two.

               He comes to a flashy skidding stop at one of the entrances 
               to the rec room area, where the men are gathered with the 
               dead Norwegian.

                                     NAULS
                         Maybe we at war with Norway.

               Palmer, a spacy, twenty-seven year old, novice pilot and 
               mechanic, grins as he lights a joint. He directs a remark to 
               station manager Garry.

                                     PALMER
                         Was wondering when "El Capitan" was 
                         going to get a chance to use his pop 
                         gun.

               Garry rebukes him with a stern look and then turns to Fuchs.

                                     GARRY
                         How long have they been stationed 
                         there?

               Fuchs leafing through a pile of papers.

                                     FUCHS
                         Says here about eight weeks.

               Dr. Copper enters the room. Bennings limping after him 
               slightly.

                                     GARRY
                              (shaking his head)
                         That's not enough time for guys to 
                         go bonkers.

                                     NAULS
                         Bullshit, Bwana, sweetheart. Five 
                         minutes is enough to put a man over 
                         down here.

                                     PALMER
                         Damn straight.

                                     NAULS
                         I mean Palmer been the way he is 
                         since the first day.

               Palmer smiles and flips the cook the bird.

                                     GARRY
                         How many in their party?

                                     FUCHS
                              (referring)
                         Started with six. There'd be four 
                         others left.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         How do you know?

               The men's attention turn to Copper.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         ...Guys as crazy as that could have 
                         done a lot of damage to their own 
                         before they got to us.

                                     GARRY
                         Nothing we can do about that.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Yes, there is. I'd like to go up.

                                     GARRY
                         In this weather?

                                     DR. COPPER
                              (turns to)
                         Bennings?

                                     BENNINGS
                         Winds are going to let up a tad, 
                         next couple of hours.

                                     GARRY
                         A tad?

                                     BENNINGS
                         Can't condone it myself. But it is a 
                         short haul. Hour there, hour back.

               Garry still does not much like the idea. Palmer takes another 
               hit off his joint.

                                     PALMER
                         Shit, Doc, I'll give you the lift 
                         if...

                                     GARRY
                         Forget it, Palmer. Doc, you're a 
                         pain in the ass.

                                     GARRY
                              (turns)
                         Norris, go get MacReady.

               Slight laughter from some of the men.

                                     NORRIS
                              (grins)
                         MacReady ain't going nowhere. Bunkered 
                         in till spring.

                                     GARRY
                         Just go get him.

                                     NORRIS
                              (stands)
                         Anyway, he's probably ripped.

               EXT. U.S. OUTPOST #31

               Norris, bundled in his sixty-five pounds of clothing, exits 
               the main compound. He walks the prefab wooden planks up the 
               precipice; his destination is someone a hundred yards up the 
               slope -- to a shack. He grabs onto the steadying ropes and 
               pulls himself against the wind and blowing sleet.

               INT. MACREADY'S SHACK - CLOSE ON ICE CUBES

               being dumped into a glass, followed by the pouring of whiskey.  
               An electronic Voice is heard.

                                     VOICE
                         Bishop to knight four.

               MacReady takes a sip of his drink; makes his way over to his 
               electronic chess game. A large Mexican sombrero hangs on his 
               back. He is tall; about thirty-five. His shack is sparse but 
               unkempt. A few centerfolds on the wall are interspersed by 
               an occasional poster of some Mediterranean or South American 
               paradise.

               The chess game is of larger than normal size. The pieces 
               move automatically with the press of a button. He sits down 
               and chuckles over his opponent's bad move.

                                     MACREADY
                         Poor little son of a bitch. You're 
                         starting to lose it, aren't you?

               He confidently taps out his move. His companion's response 
               is immediate.

                                     VOICE
                         Pawn takes queen at knight four.

               MacReady's grin slowly fades as he examines the board. There 
               is a pounding at his door. MacReady broods for a bit, heedless 
               of his visitor and makes his next move.

                                     VOICE
                         Rook to knight six. Check.

               More impatient pounding. MacReady glares at his opponent for 
               a beat. He bends forward, opens up a flap containing the 
               chess game's circuitry and pours in his drink. There ensues 
               a snapping, popping sound as smoke and sparks rise from the 
               machine; followed by a flush of chess gibberish.

               MacReady gets up from his seat, mumbling on his way to the 
               door.

                                     MACREADY
                         ...Cheating bastard...

               He opens the door. Norris steps in followed by a flurry of 
               snow and wind.

                                     NORRIS
                         You jerking off or just pissed?

                                     MACREADY
                         We got any more of those electronic 
                         chess things down in supply?

                                     NORRIS
                         Get your gear on.

                                     MACREADY
                         What for?

               EXT. OUTPOST

               One of the grounded choppers is being readied for take-off. 
               Childs holds a huge industrial torch to the engine, warming 
               it up.

               INT. MAIN COMPOUND - CORRIDOR

               Garry, Bennings, Dr. Copper, Palmer and MacReady wind their 
               way through the slender corridors on their way to the chopper. 
               Dr. Copper carries a satchel of medicine supplies. MacReady, 
               going over his flight chart, looks mad as hell. Dialogue 
               overlaps.

                         MACREADY
                 ...Craziness... This 
                 is goddamn insane...

                                                       GARRY
                                               ...Quit the griping 
                                               MacReady. Sooner you're 
                                               there -- sooner you're 
                                               back.

                                     MACREADY
                         It's against regulations to go up 
                         this time of year!

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Screw regulations! Four guys could 
                         be crawling around on their bellies 
                         out there!

                                     MACREADY
                         So, I don't want to end up crawling 
                         around with them when we go down.

                                     GARRY
                         Look, if you're going to keep 
                         bitching, MacReady -- Palmer's offered 
                         to take him up...

                                     MACREADY
                         What are you talking?! He's had two 
                         months training in those choppers!

                                     PALMER
                              (defiant)
                         Four!

                                     MACREADY
                              (to Bennings)
                         What is it out there, anyway? Forty-
                         five knots?

                                     BENNINGS
                         Sixteen.

                                     MACREADY
                              (disgusted)
                         And the horse you rode in on. Sixteen 
                         for how long?! You can't predict 
                         this time of year...

               INT./ EXT. CHOPPER

               Dr. Copper sits next to MacReady, who is at the controls.

               MacReady tightens the string of his sombrero around his neck 
               and starts up its choking engine.

               MacReady fights violently with the controls as he struggles 
               to get the craft into the air. It finally rights itself and 
               moves up and off into the grey-white sky.

               INT. MAIN COMPOUND

               A couple of the men mingle in the area. Clark, the dog 
               handler, looks out the window.

                                     CLARK
                         Mac's really taking it up, huh?

               The dog, a large bandage on his hip, wades through the room. 
               Under tables. Past men's legs. It hobbles slightly. No one 
               takes notice.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE CHOPPER

               moves over a ridge of ice. Columns of smoke can be seen rising 
               ominously from a quarter mile off.

               INT. CHOPPER - POINT OF VIEW

               As they near, the smoke looms thicker. A black, tar-like 
               gush; billowing up into the grey sky from the whiteness below.

               EXT. NORWEGIAN CAMP

               Smoke climbs upward in the f.g. MacReady sets his craft down. 
               Pull back to reveal the camp itself: resembling the aftermath 
               of a western fort, sacked and ravaged by Indians.

               Small fires and debris are strewn everywhere. The prefab 
               Administration Building exposes gaping holes. Smoke rises 
               from the almost entirely snow-buried Quonset huts. Embers 
               swirl in every direction.

               INT. CHOPPER

               The two men look at each other in silence. They get out.

               CLOSE ON A LARGE, MAKESHIFT FUNERAL PYRE

               smoldering to a close. A hastily conceived crematorium. Wood, 
               books, furniture, tires, anything that will burn has been 
               mixed together with the charred remains of several dogs and 
               the body of a man.

               Curious mounds of a melted and blackened goo are heaped within 
               the mess.

               A small can of gasoline lies nearby. A large oil drum not 
               far off.

               MACREADY AND COPPER

               their faces ashen as they take in this grotesque sight.

               MacReady turns to view the Norwegian compound. He then 
               exchanges a look with Copper. MacReady heads back toward the 
               chopper.

               THE CHOPPER

               MacReady unhinges the shotgun that is latched to the panel 
               behind the seats.

               EXT. THE MAIN BUILDING - THE DOOR

               MacReady and Dr. Copper stand hesitantly amidst the wisps of 
               snow and embers. MacReady tries the door. It is unlocked. He 
               slowly pushes it open with his gun. A creaking. A long pitch-
               black corridor. Copper shines a flashlight.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Anybody there?!

               No answer. Just wind. They exchange a look and enter.

               INT. NARROW CORRIDOR

               The two men move slowly. It is dank and cold. Their breath, 
               bleating like exhaust. A soft, steady wind howls overhead.  
               The flashlight is not much help.

               Further down, they hear a faint hissing sound. As they get 
               closer it more resembles static. The flashlight finds a door 
               at the end of the corridor. The sputtering static comes from 
               within.

               The face of the door has been shredded. An ax sticks out 
               from its middle. MacReady wrenches out the ax. There is blood 
               on it. The men acknowledge this for a beat.

               MacReady tries the knob. It opens slightly. Something is 
               blocking it from the other side.

                                     MACREADY
                         Anybody in there?!

               Nothing.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         We're Americans!

               Nothing.

                                     MACREADY
                         Come to help you!!

               MacReady pushes against the door.

                                     MACREADY
                         Give me a hand.

               They push, shove, grunt. The door gives a bit. Finally more. 
               It widens enough for MacReady to see that a large computer-
               like machine is blocking their path. MacReady wedges in and 
               shines the flashlight.

               It is the communications room. Holes in its roof have allowed 
               in the freezing cold. The flashlight exposes the back of the 
               radio chair. One more nudge allows them into the room.

               A beat as they catch their breath. MacReady spots a Coleman 
               lantern. He lights it with a match. Holds it up. The brighter 
               light exposes the top of a man's head sitting in the radio 
               chair.

                                     MACREADY
                         Hey, Sweden...! You okay?

               The chair rocks slightly with the gentle breeze. They inch 
               closer. A yard from the chair, MacReady stops the Doctor.  
               He pokes his gun at the chair's back.

                                     MACREADY
                         Sweden?!

               Dr. Copper spots something. From the man's wrist on the 
               armrest, he follows a long, yarn-thick, red line, ending in 
               a pool of frozen blood on the floor.

               The two men step around the chair. The Norwegian stares up 
               in blanched death. A gaping black hole for a mouth.

               His throat and wrists slit. An old-fashioned straight razor 
               in his lap.

               MacReady turns off the hissing radio, and marches to the 
               other door. It is locked and barricaded.

                                     DR. COPPER
                              (more to himself)
                         My God, what in hell happened here?

                                     MACREADY
                         Come on, Copper.

               The two men free a machine-like obstacle from the other exit. 
               MacReady opens a lock and pushes the door open.

               More blackness. Stronger wind. Copper holds the lantern high 
               as they make their way down a row of wooden steps and into a 
               cavernous, underground causeway.

                                     MACREADY
                         Hey, Sweden!!!

                                     DR. COPPER
                              (irritated)
                         They're not Swedish, goddamn it, 
                         they're Norwegian, MacRe --

               Whap!! Something slaps into the Doctor's face from the 
               darkness. The lantern crashes to the ground. The Doctor 
               stumbles, falls. MacReady grabs the flashlight and whirls in 
               different directions. A panting beat. Silence.

               Dr. Copper holds up what hit him. A thick centerfold, buffeted 
               by the wind. MacReady takes it.

                                     MACREADY
                         Norwegian of the Month, Doc. Harmless.

               MacReady pockets it for further viewing.

               INT. THE NARROWEST OF CORRIDORS

               The supporting beams have long since buckled and cracked 
               from the constantly moving ice underneath. The evidence of 
               fire has further weakened the foundations. The wood creaks 
               overhead. Bits of ice and silt trickle down.

               The two men walk hunched, cautious. MacReady gingerly tries 
               to make his way around a broken and smoldering beam. He 
               brushes it gently sending a shower of debris from the yawning 
               roof.

               The two men wait until it subsides and then moves on.

               Further down. MacReady's knee bumps into something along the 
               wall, causing him to stumble slightly. He shines his light 
               on it.

               An arm is sticking out of a steel door about three feet off 
               the ground. The door has been slammed shut. The arm pinned, 
               its fist still gripping a small welding torch.

               The flame long since gone out.

                                     MACREADY
                              (wincing)
                         Holy shit...

               He tries the door. Unlocked. It opens. The arm drops to the 
               ground. It has been severed by the force of the slam.

               Its owner is nowhere to be seen.

               MacReady, sickened, coughs. Dr. Copper mumbles.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Christ...

               They step over the arm and into another slim passageway.

               Moving along they come to rest in front of a door with 
               Norwegian lettering on it.

               MacReady pushes it open with his foot. Dozens of papers fly 
               about, flailed by the holes in the Quonset hut-style roof. 
               The place is a wreck. They enter. MacReady surveying the 
               small room with his flashlight.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         ...Laboratory.

               Broken beakers, test tubes, a microscope are illuminated.

               MacReady notices a video camera.

                                     MACREADY
                         Portable video unit.

               Copper makes his way over to the main work table. He shuffles 
               through papers, glancing at the writing.

                                     MACREADY
                         Anything?

                                     DR. COPPER
                         All in Norwegian.

               Dr. Copper bends down and begins gathering the papers, strewn 
               about the room.

                                     MACREADY
                         What are you doing?

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Could be important work. Might as 
                         well bring it back.

                                     MACREADY
                         It's getting late. Hurry it. I'm 
                         going to check the last few rooms.

               He exits. Amongst the rubble, Dr. Copper finds a pocket tape 
               recorder and several cassettes. He selects a tape and is 
               about to pop it in when he senses something to his rear. He 
               turns. Looks. A beat. Nothing.

               INT. HALLWAY

               MacReady shoves himself into another room.

               INT. ROOM

               Debris and wood flush down on him. The receding ceiling had 
               been blocking the door from above. He brushes his coat and 
               shines the light upwards.

               The ceiling is a shambles. He then shines the light deeper 
               into the room.

               INT. NORWEGIAN LAB

               Dr. Copper is playing the small tape recorder. A casual 
               Norwegian voice drones on as if making notes. He fast 
               forwards. The same casual drone.

                                     MACREADY (O.S.)
                         Copper, come here!!

               INT. ROOM

               Dr. Copper enters, squeezing in, through the door. The wood 
               cracks overhead. More debris comes falling down.

                                     MACREADY
                         Careful. It's about to go.

               Copper dusts himself. MacReady stands before a huge block of 
               ice. Fifteen feet long. Six feet wide. Four feet tall.

               It has partially melted, but its thawing process has been 
               stopped by the now freezing temperatures within the outpost.

               Its one curious feature: the middle has been thawed and 
               scooped out. Giving it the appearance of a large bathtub. 
               The two men study it uncomprehendingly.

               MacReady's gaze turns to a large metal cabinet at his left. 
               He moves for a closer look. Several photographs are pasted 
               to its door. Small snapshots of the Norwegians at work and 
               play.

               He tries to open it. Stuck. The partially caved-in ceiling 
               is slightly blocking the top of the door. He tries again, 
               careful not to dislodge the wood and plaster above. Bits of 
               dust float down.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Watch it.

               His grip is too strong. It gives suddenly, unexpectedly. The 
               large metal door flies open.

               Large chunks splash from the ceiling. They come thumping to 
               the floor, behind and in front of the open cabinet door. 
               MacReady coughs and waves away the dust. He peers inside. 
               Nothing much. Some empty shelves. Some small scientific gear.

               His flashlight then locates a large photograph taped to the 
               inside of the cabinet door.

               It is a picture of five Norwegians, arm in arm, all smiles, 
               toasting each other. They are on either side of the frozen 
               block of ice, pridefully displaying it for the camera. The 
               block looks much thicker. Its interior opaque.

               MacReady looks to the block of ice and then back to the 
               photograph. He untapes it, pockets it and shuts the door.

               An armless corpse swings into his face from behind the closing 
               door. Dislodged from the ceiling, the body and MacReady go 
               crashing to the floor.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. U.S. OUTPOST - RECREATION ROOM

               The loud beat of Warren Zevon's song, "The Werewolves of 
               London," can be heard throughout the compound. The room is 
               empty. Close on a video pong game, its ball of light lazily 
               traveling back and forth. The dog, its tail wagging, its 
               bandage on, walks by.

               INT. KITCHEN

               Zevon's record is blasting from Nauls' stereo. He skates 
               from the big walk-in freezer and plunks down a large side of 
               beef on the wood-cutting table to thaw. He skates from pot 
               to pan keeping time with his sounds.

               He smells. Tastes. Adds a little something here, a touch 
               there. He clearly enjoys his work.

               Station Manager Garry stops past the open door.

                                     GARRY
                         Turn that crap down, Nauls. You can 
                         hear it all over the camp!

                                     NAULS
                         Oui, Bwana. Can do.

               He skates over and turns it down, but not much.

               INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM

               Garry enters and sees that Sanchez has nodded off in front 
               of his receiver. His headgear is still on. Garry walks over 
               and turns up the volume, the static jolting Sanchez awake.

                                     SANCHEZ
                         Hey, man...!

                                     GARRY
                         You reach anybody yet?

                                     SANCHEZ
                         We're a thousand miles from anybody 
                         else, man. It's going to get a hell 
                         of a lot worse before it gets better.

                                     GARRY
                         Well, stick to it.

               INT. COMPOUND CORRIDOR

               An empty hallway. Larger than most. Doors to several sleeping 
               quarters on either side. The dog slowly walks through.

               One of the doors is open up ahead of his left. The dog stops 
               in front of it and looks in. Someone is inside.

               Inside the small cubicle, a slight portion of a man's back 
               can be seen as he sits bent over a chair; his large shadow 
               displayed on the wall.

               Back in the corridor. The dog looks up the hall once and 
               casually to the other end. No one. He enters the room. The 
               sound of a man's voice, too indistinct to tell whose, mumbles:

                                     MAN'S VOICE
                         Hello boy.

               A beat.

               The sound of a glass breaking. A muffled scuffling. The door 
               is slammed shut from the inside. And then silence.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. COMPOUND

               Fuchs, the young biologist, is finishing up his daily jog 
               around the compound. He stops at the end of a long Quonset 
               hut almost completely buried in the snow. The hut is fifty 
               yards long and connects to the main compound. He enters a 
               tunnel from a latch door up top.

               INT. TUNNEL

               He jogs down the steps, passing the underground dog kennel 
               and trots toward the compound through the long narrow tunnel. 
               He passes and waves to Clark, who rolls along a wheelbarrow 
               of dog food.

               CLARK

               opens the door to the small kennel and serves up the dinner.  
               The dogs, about seven of them, yelp and bark eagerly.

               INT. UNDERGROUND PASSAGEWAY

               near the fuel supply bladders. Older and more rickety than 
               the quarters above.

               Childs waltzes through, humming, a big smile on his face.

               He stops at a door with six locks on it. Different kinds.

               Combination locks, key locks, etc. He opens each one 
               separately.

               INT. STORAGE ROOM

               Inside are several marijuana plants. Sun lamps beam down on 
               them. Childs inspects them with a wide grin.

                                     CHILDS
                         How my brothers and sister doing 
                         today? Doin' fine.

               He moves over to a tape deck, selects a cassette, grins back 
               at the plants and turns it on.

                                     CHILDS
                         What say to some nice Al Green for 
                         my babies, huh?

               He waters them carefully, as Al Green sings softly. He hears 
               a panting and turns around to see the dog. His bandage is 
               gone.

                                     CHILDS
                         What you...? You get the hell on out 
                         of here.

               The dog is shooed off. Childs turns back grumbling.

                                     CHILDS
                         ...Comin' in here... goin' to urinate 
                         on my babies.

               INT. MAIN COMPOUND - HALLWAY

               Blair passing through, holding a chart and carrying a rack 
               of test tubes, notices a large bandage on the floor. He picks 
               it up, inquiringly. It is mangled and shredded.

               INT. GENERATOR ROOM

               Palmer works on the generator. He hears the sound of 
               approaching propeller blades from outside. And then the sound 
               of his tool box crashing to the floor. He turns to see what 
               caused the ruckus.

               The dog, who has entered the shed, has jumped on the work 
               table and upended the tool box on its eagerness to look out 
               of the above window. Palmer curses under his breath and calls 
               out.

                                     PALMER
                         Clark! Will you kennel this goddamn 
                         dog?
                              (bangs wrench against 
                              pipe)
                         Hey, Clark?!

               THE DOG

               It paws at the window and watches as the chopper, carrying 
               MacReady and Dr. Copper, fights against the newly arrived 
               heavy winds and lands safely.

               INT. STATION MANAGER GARRY'S QUARTERS

               Garry, MacReady, Dr. Copper, Norris, Bennings, Blair and his 
               assistant, Fuchs, are present. The small Norwegian video 
               unit has been set up and its contents are being viewed on a 
               TV screen. Grainy, home movie-ish, no sound.

               The proceedings are grim.

               Shots of the Norwegian's at work. Others of them playing 
               soccer on ice. Generally the footage is a prosaic record of 
               their day-to-day life.

               Norris shuffles the bundle of notes Dr. Copper brought back 
               with him.

                                     NORRIS
                         ...Seems they were spending a lot of 
                         time at a place four miles northeast 
                         of their camp.

                                     GARRY
                         What were they involved in?

               MacReady, working on the video machine, answers.

                                     MACREADY
                         Little ice core drilling... some 
                         seismology... glaciology... same old 
                         shit we do.

               The present footage is a shot of them all naked and probably 
               drunk, holding a sign across their waists as they stand 
               outdoors in super-freezing weather.

                                     BENNINGS
                         How much more of this crap is there?

                                     DR. COPPER
                         About nine more hours.

                                     BENNINGS
                         We can't learn anything from this.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Probably right.

               MacReady turns on the light and shuts off the video machine. 
               He then slides the portable tape deck across the table to 
               Dr. Copper. They exchange a look.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         MacReady and I were listening to 
                         some of these cassettes on the way 
                         back.
                              (somberly)
                         Like you gentlemen to hear it.

               A Norwegian voice drones on calmly, making verbal notes.

               Norris shrugs.

                                     BENNINGS
                         What do you want from us?

                                     MACREADY
                              (flat)
                         Just listen.

               Dr. Copper fast forwards. The calm voice continues. And then 
               a loud blast, followed by pounding. The sounds of confusion. 
               Voices. Loud. Frenetic. Men's feet running up and down wooden 
               floorboards. A gurgling. A hissing.

               Screams. And then a screeching. More blasts mixed with the 
               din of wild, carnage-wrought cries. And then more screeching. 
               A screeching unlike anything these men have ever heard.

               The men look from one another in silence as they listen.

               Dr. Copper turns it off.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Goes on like that quite awhile.
                              (beat)
                         What do you gentlemen make of it?

                                     GARRY
                         Could be anything... Men in 
                         isolation... some beef that 
                         snowballed... got out of hand...

                                     NORRIS
                         Maybe the whole camp got bent...  
                         Something they ate. What about food 
                         poisoning, Doc?

               Dr. Copper taps the tape deck pensively.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Maybe.

               He glances at MacReady, and then back to the others.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         There's something else we want you 
                         to see.

               INT. INFIRMARY

               Dr. Copper and MacReady begin dumping the heavy contents of 
               a large plastic trash bag onto the slab.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         We found this.

               Displayed on the slab is what appears to be the corpse of a 
               man. Badly charred. What is left of the trousers and shoes 
               of the bottom torso are ripped and split, as if his legs and 
               feet had burst from the inside. His upper body is an almost 
               undecipherable gnarled mass of protoplasmic mush.

               The head is strangely disfigured and looks larger than normal. 
               It is situated not on its shoulders but near the abdomen. 
               Tendon-like appendages are wrapped around the carcass and 
               sticking up and out in odd postures. One is wrapped around 
               the body's left leg.

               The shirt has been ripped and lies shredded in the tar-like 
               mess.

               The men grimace.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         I know he's pretty badly burned... 
                         but could fire have done this?

               Blair, sickened but fascinated, pokes at the tendon-like 
               things and the tarry goo.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Blair, I'd like you and Fuchs to 
                         help me with autopsies on this one 
                         and the one Garry shot this morning.

               INT. REC ROOM - LATER - CLOSE ON A TABLE HOCKEY GAME

               Foosball. Nauls and Clark are going at it hot and heavy.

               Sanchez sits off in a corner thumbing through an old issue 
               of Photoplay.

               Bennings, Norris and Garry are engaged in a card game. 
               Bennings is about to play a card when he feels something 
               under the table. He looks. It is the dog.

                                     BENNINGS
                         Clark, will you put this mutt with 
                         the others where he belong?!

               INT. LAB

               larger than most of the other rooms and well-equipped.

               Dr. Copper is performing an autopsy on the Norwegian intruder, 
               killed early that morning.

               Blair sits over his microscope, while Fuchs prepares slides. 
               The other body is draped with a sheet, waiting its turn. Dr. 
               Copper pulls off his gloves.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Nothing wrong with this one.  
                         Physiologically, anyway.
                              (to Blair)
                         Find anything toxic?

                                     BLAIR
                         No drugs... alcohol. Nothing.

               INT. TUNNEL

               Clark leads the dog through the long, cold tunnel toward the 
               kennel. A new dressing has been placed on its hip.

               He unlatches the door to the kennel and leads him in.

               INT. KENNEL

               About twenty feet long, five feet wide. Poorly lit.

               Cramped with dogs. Some of them sleeping. Others pacing around 
               and curious, greet their new companion, sniffing, panting 
               and rubbing up against him. Clark pats the dog and several 
               others, then leaves, latching the door behind him.

               INT. SLEEPING CUBICLE

               Childs lies in his cot watching a small television. The show 
               is a tape of an American TV game show. He has seen this one 
               too many times, extracts the cassette and injects another 
               game show.

               Palmer is stretched out in the other cot, reading a comic 
               book and smoking a joint. Childs beckons for it and takes a 
               hit.

               INT. PUB

               A small area, just off the rec room. Set up like a bar.

               MacReady is alone looking over the rest of the videotapes 
               from the Norwegian outpost. Mundane to esoteric chores of 
               Antarctic camp life. He looks bored.

               INT. LAB

               Blair, hovering over the microscope, lays in a slide, focuses 
               and motions for Dr. Copper to take a look.

               Copper is confused as he examines. He shrugs.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         I don't understand.

               Fuchs takes the opportunity to look. Blair moves over to the 
               disfigured corpse and indicates one of the fibrous, tendon-
               like appendages.

                                     BLAIR
                         It's tissue from one of these sinewy 
                         rods.

               Fuchs is befuddled as he examines.

                                     FUCHS
                         What in the world kind of cell 
                         structure is this?

                                     BLAIR
                         That's the point.

                                     DR. COPPER
                              (tired)
                         I don't get you, Blair.

                                     BLAIR
                         I'm not sure it is any kind of cell 
                         structure. Biologically speaking.

                                     DR. COPPER
                              (sighing)
                         This really isn't my field, Blair. 
                         Let's wrap for the day.

               Dr. Copper undoes his lab coat and lays it over a chair as 
               he exits. Blair stares down ominously at the mutilated body.

               EXT. COMPOUND - NIGHT

               A steady stream of sleet pounds the compound and small 
               surrounding shacks.

               INT. REC ROOM

               Vacant. The wall clock reads four-thirty.

               INT. HALLWAY

               Sleeping cubicles on either side. The sound of snoring.

               INT. PUB

               Bleary-eyed, MacReady is in the process of blowing up some 
               strange inflatable object. As he puffs away, he still keeps 
               an eye on the Norwegian video tapes. His balloon begins to 
               take shape. It blossoms into a life-size replica of a full-
               breasted woman. Something on the tape catches his eye. He 
               rewinds, then starts it forward again.

               The screen shows the Norwegians on the surface of what appears 
               to be an enormous, flat glacier. They are spread out on the 
               ice around a large odd oval shape; their arms outstretched.

               It fades to black and then a Norwegian comes on mugging 
               childishly in front of the camera, apparently quite pleased 
               with something.

               The tape fades to black again and the picture reappears.

               This time they have marked off the large oval area with flag 
               sticks.

               Closer shots show three of the men digging a deep hole into 
               the ice. There is a small patch of something dark and metallic 
               at the bottom.

               MacReady leans forward, intrigued.

               The men are now sinking something deep into the ice at various 
               points around the markings. MacReady squints and mumbles to 
               himself.

                                     MACREADY
                         Decanite...? Thermite charges...?

               The tape jump cuts again showing a long shot of the markings. 
               No Norwegian in sight. An explosion kicks up the ice. A beat 
               as the ice sprays to the ground. Then the camera appears to 
               shake as the ground beneath it quivers.

               Another immense explosion follows. An earthquake-like force 
               throws the camera to the ground.

                                     MACREADY
                         What in...

               The tape continues, distorted, unviewable. A distinct crack 
               in the lens. MacReady lets go of his companion and quickly 
               rewinds. The deflating mannequin is sent sputtering around 
               the room.

               INT. KENNEL - NIGHT

               Most of the dogs are sleeping or lounging. The new dog watches 
               them calmly, silently.

               He takes several steps towards a group of about five dogs 
               and sits upright. Completely still. He stares at them. A 
               beat. The dogs are aware of something. They begin to seem a 
               bit confused, uncomfortable.

               The new dog continues to stare. Sitting rigidly, unnaturally 
               still. His eyes dead, lusterless black spheres.

               Bewildered, a few dogs start to pace. As if sensing something:  
               a portent. A danger. But so odd. They begin a soft, purring 
               growl.

               The new dog remains a statue. The growling builds. More dogs 
               begin to pace. Nervously. Faster, encircling.

               Emitting hisses, snarls. The lack of response driving them 
               into a frenzy.

               Barks. Growls. More frenetic pacing. The din escalating. 
               Three dogs start to close in on the stranger.

               They attack.

               THE SHADOW OF THE NEW DOG

               against the kennel wall. The shadow suddenly lurches upward, 
               seeming larger.

               The kennel roars.

               INT. PUB

               MacReady is still going over bits of the same footage, 
               fascinated. He hears the far-off clamor of the dogs.

               INT. NAULS' QUARTERS

               He, too, bothered by the noise, tosses and turns in his sleep.

               INT. CLARK'S QUARTERS

               Clark snores. MacReady has entered.

                                     MACREADY
                         Clark.

               No response. MacReady nudges him. Clark rolls away, annoyed.

               MacReady pinches his snoring nose, cutting off the air.

               Clark sits up, groggy.

                                     MACREADY
                         Dogtown's going nuts. Take care of 
                         it.

               INT. TUNNEL

               Clark, sleepy, irritated, makes his way down the freezing 
               corridor. The wind soughing loudly overhead.

               CLARK

               reaches the kennel door. The savage outpouring of noise from 
               within baffles and angers him. He unlatches the door.

                                     CLARK
                         What's got into...

               Smack! Just as he opens the door, two dogs, as if jettisoned 
               from a cannon, knock him off his feet. Growls, barks, snarls. 
               And a screeching from within.

               INT. KITCHEN

               MacReady is fetching himself a beer. The sound of the far-
               off screeching. He freezes. A beat. He turns and sprints.

               HIS BEER CAN

               as it smashes the glass of the fire alarm. He pulls the lever.

               INT. TUNNEL

               The alarm is blaring throughout the camp. MacReady, Garry, 
               Norris run through the narrow tunnel led by Clark.

               MacReady carries a shotgun. Garry, half-dressed, has his 
               .44. Clark, a fire ax.

                                     CLARK
                         I don't know what the hell's in there, 
                         but it's weird and pissed off, 
                         whatever it is.

               INT. HALLWAY

               Chaos. Men, half-naked, bounce from their cubicle.

               Pulling on their pants, digging into shoes.

               INT. CHILDS' CUBICLE

               Childs is grappling with his belt buckle.

                                     CHILDS
                         Mac wants the what?!

                                     BENNINGS
                              (at the doorway)
                         That's what he said. Now! Move!

               Bennings is off.

               INT. TUNNEL

               as the men approach the locked kennel door. The two dogs, 
               thrown into Clark, back ferociously and scratch at the door 
               trying to get back in. One is badly bloodied.

               The fight inside rages on. MacReady and Clark brace themselves 
               by the narrow door. Norris and Garry hold back the two 
               hysterical dogs. Clark undoes the latch and he and MacReady 
               enter the kennel.

               The light has been broken and it is pitch black. MacReady 
               snaps on his flashlight. Norris and Garry can't contain their 
               animals and the dogs burst into the room. They smash into 
               MacReady and send him sprawling. Total confusion: the dogs; 
               the men; the screeching; the blackness.

                                     CLARK
                         Mac, where are you?

               MacReady gropes for his flashlight and rights himself. He 
               finds Clark. Then shines it around the cramped room trying 
               to get his bearings.

               The light finds a mass of dogs in a wild melee in the corner.

               Barking mixed with hissing, a gurgling, a screeching.

               Dogs being hurled about and then charging back into the fray 
               with a vengeance.

               The flashlight illuminates parts of some "thing." A dog.

               But not quite. Impossible to tell. It struggles powerfully.  
               Garry pokes his head into the blackness.

                                     GARRY
                         What's going on, damn it?

               MacReady aims his shotgun at the entire pack.

                                     MACREADY
                         I'm going to shoot.

                                     CLARK
                         No! Wait!!

               Clark wades into the pack, grabs at dogs' hides and throws 
               them back. He then wields his ax into the fray, chopping and 
               hacking away at the gurgling, hissing silhouette.

               From out of nowhere, a large, bristly, arachnid-like leg 
               springs up and wraps around Clark's ax. It sends Clark 
               smashing violently into the wall.

               OUTSIDE

               More men running, nearing the kennel. Several squeezing in 
               with Garry, trying to get a look.

               INSIDE

               MacReady fires several rounds. A dog is flung at him, knocking 
               him and his flashlight once more to the ground.

               Garry squeezes in and begins blasting away in the direction 
               of the hissing and screeching. A dog is hit. MacReady crawls 
               for his flashlight.

                                     MACREADY
                         Clark? Where are you? Clark!

               Blam. Blam. Garry continues firing at the silhouette.

               INT. TUNNEL

               Childs, huffing and puffing, lugs the huge industrial torch 
               toward the crowded kennel doorway.

                                     CHILDS
                         What's happening?

                                     MACREADY (O.S.)
                         Childs, you got the torch? You get 
                         your ass in here!!

               INT. KENNEL

               Childs scrunches in, disoriented by the blackness, and bumps 
               into Garry, knocking him off balance.

                                     CHILDS
                         Where are you?

               MacReady signals with his flashlight and then points it at 
               the gathering of snarling dogs.

                                     MACREADY
                         Torch it over there!

                                     CHILDS
                         The dogs?

                                     MACREADY
                         Screw the dogs!! Torch it!!

               Childs lets loose with a burst of blue flame. A mewing, a 
               screeching.

               Part of the kennel starts to burn.

                                     GARRY
                              (panic)
                         We're on fire!

                                     MACREADY
                         Don't let up, Childs!

                                     GARRY
                              (to outside)
                         Extinguishers.

               Childs moves closer, continuing his assault on the hissing, 
               gurgling presence.

               Men charge into the room and begin spraying dogs and burning 
               walls. Dogs and men choke and cough amidst the smoke and 
               CO2.

               The screeching lessens. The hissing and gurgling fade. Childs 
               turns off his torch.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. REC ROOM - NEXT MORNING

               Those of the men that have gathered exhibit a pale and quiet 
               uneasiness.

               Blair, in silent awe, stands over the badly burned corpses 
               of two interlocking dogs, that lie before him on a table.

               They are connected as if they were one animal. Though, the 
               one wearing the remnants of Clark's bandage is much larger 
               and appears less dog-like. Its entire torso is cracked and 
               peeled, as if its innards were trying to burst out.

               Odd appendages, recoiled and withered by the flame, are 
               wrapped grotesquely about both bodies.

               Clark, his eyes set in glassy stare, sits in shock. Nauls 
               comforts him. Childs stands nearby smoking a joint and staring 
               at the floor.

               Blair, transfixed, continues hovering over the united 
               cadavers. Weighing. Thinking. A very worried look on his 
               face.

               The dead bodies of two other dogs from the kennel are not 
               far off.

               INT. INFIRMARY

               Fuchs is attending to the shredded bodies of three other 
               badly wounded dogs.

               INT. REC ROOM

               Nauls pats Clark on the shoulder and grins, trying to pick 
               up his spirits.

                                     NAULS
                         It's okay now, man. It's dead. It's 
                         over.
                              (beat)
                         You see.

               Clark turns to him with a childlike smile.

                                     CLARK
                         I know. Mr. Childs killed it. I saw.

                                     NAULS
                         Right, man. Right.

               INT. SMALL WORKROOM

               Norris is going through some maps. MacReady is bent over his 
               shoulder. Norris finds the one he's looking for.

                                     NORRIS
                         Here. This is where they were spending 
                         most of their time.

               Bennings pokes his head in the room.

                                     BENNINGS
                         Pretty nasty out, Mac. Thirty-five 
                         knots.

                                     MACREADY
                         Screw it, I'm going up anyway.

               INT. MAIN COMPOUND - MORNING

               Station Manager Garry has joined Blair by the stuck-together 
               bodies. Blair motions to the bandage.

                                     BLAIR
                         Was that dog, the Norwegian dog?

                                     GARRY
                         I just can't comprehend any of this. 
                         It was just a dog.

                                     CHILDS
                              (evenly)
                         "tweren't no dog, Bwana.

                                     BLAIR
                         That tape MacReady showed us this 
                         morning...

                                     GARRY
                         Couldn't make much of it myself.

                                     BLAIR
                         I've asked him to try and locate the 
                         site. Okay with you?

                                     GARRY
                         Sure. You think there's a connection?

                                     BLAIR
                         Maybe.

               EXT. CHOPPER

               high above the Antarctic expanse.

               INT. CHOPPER

               MacReady pilots. Young Palmer and Norris are with him.

               It is clear but the winds are troublesome. The ride is a 
               shaky one. Norris refers to their map. He points.

                                     NORRIS
                         One of their sites would be directly 
                         over here.

               They aim for a large mountainous wall. As they go up and 
               over... they see:

               FLAT, GLACIAL EXPANSE

               On the surface, an enormous blackened oval shape.

               INT. U.S. OUTPOST #31 - LAB

               All the bodies of the dogs have been brought in. Fuchs stands 
               by as Blair studies through his microscope.

               INSERT - A MICROSCOPIC SAMPLING

               of two cells. They appear to be much different from each 
               other. They are joined at the ends but are completing the 
               process of breaking off from each other.

               ON BLAIR

               A disturbed look on his face. He checks his watch, as if 
               timing the procedure.

               EXT. GLACIER - TRACKING WITH MACREADY, NORRIS AND PALMER

               as they walk along the ice. They come to a stop at the edge 
               of a sharp drop.

               Pull back to reveal -- the massive black hole about fifteen 
               feet beneath the ice. Charred, gnarled and mangled metal are 
               all that is left of what was once an enormous sphere.

               MacReady's and Norris' eyes meet each other in silence.

               Palmer is in awe.

                                     PALMER
                         Wow...

               MacReady finds a burst thermite canister. He and Norris climb 
               down.

               They move along amongst the wreck. Almost everything but the 
               skeletal superstructure has disintegrated into a fine ashy 
               powder.

               Norris digs for ice samples at the perimeter of the wreckage, 
               while MacReady browses through the center.

               Palmer continues to marvel, as he walks around the oval, 
               atop the ice.

               MacReady returns and kneels down next to Norris as the latter 
               examines a piece of metal.

                                     NORRIS
                         Magnesium of some type... or some 
                         kind of strange alloy.
                              (looks out at debris 
                              in disgust)
                         And those poor dumb bastards had to 
                         go and blow the hell out of it.

                                     MACREADY
                         So what do you make of it?

                                     NORRIS
                         You know damn well what we both make 
                         of it.

                                     MACREADY
                         No chance it could have been some 
                         new kind of test craft?

               Norris shakes his head no.

                                     NORRIS
                         Seismic activity has been pushing 
                         this are up from way down for a long 
                         time...
                              (holds up ice sample)
                         ...This ice it was buried in...  
                         It's over a hundred thousand years 
                         old.

               Palmer calls out, waving them over.

               EXT. GLACIER

               The two men join Palmer about fifty yards from the oval.

               A large rectangular chunk has been cut out of the ice. It is 
               fifteen feet long, six feet wide and eight feet deep.

               MacReady kneels down to observe. A beat.

               A gust of wind picks up the snow at their feet.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. REC ROOM - NIGHT

               Fascinated, a few of the men are reviewing the Norwegian 
               video tapes of the finding of the mysterious craft.

               MacReady sits quietly by his chess set contemplating a large 
               glass of Scotch. Clark, less interested than the others, is 
               flipping through the Norwegian nudie magazine.

               Blair, looking worried, sits off in a corner, pondering the 
               photo of the block of ice and fingering a piece of crumbled-
               up metal brought back from the site.

               Childs, viewing the tapes, can't quite believe it all.

                                     CHILDS
                         Okay now, Mac, run this by me again. 
                         Thousands of years ago this rocket 
                         ship crashes, right...? And the...

               MacReady is not listening.

                                     CHILDS
                         MacReady!

                                     MACREADY
                         Look, I'm just guessing...

                                     CHILDS
                         Well, go on.

               INT. KITCHEN

               Nauls, about to prepare dinner, scowls as he rummages through 
               his many cabinets.

                                     NAULS
                         Where's that big ol' steel pot of 
                         mine?! Damn!

               He turns to examine the cabinets above the large stove. He 
               spots something in the nearby kitchen trash can.

               Disgusted, he pulls out a torn and shredded pair of long 
               johns.

               INT. REC ROOM

               MacReady theorizes.

                                     MACREADY
                         ...So it crashes, and this guy, 
                         whoever he is, gets thrown out, or 
                         walks out, and ends up freezing.

                                     CHILDS
                         I just can't believe this voodoo 
                         bullshit. You believe this voodoo 
                         bullshit, Blair?

               Blair says nothing, lost in thought.

               Palmer, stoned, a joint dangling from his mouth, is searching 
               for information through stacks of old issues of The National 
               Enquirer and The Star.

                                     PALMER
                              (rambling)
                         Happens all the time, man. They're 
                         falling out of the skies like flies. 
                         Government knows all about it...  
                         Chariots of the Gods, man... They 
                         practically own South America. I

               Palmer shakes a magazine at him adamantly.

               Clark marvels at a particular photo.

                         Jesus, why would those guys ever 
                         want to leave Norway...?

               Nauls skates into the room. He shakes the crumpled-up pair 
               of long johns in his fist.

                                     NAULS
                         Which one you muthers been tossing 
                         his dirty underwear in the kitchen 
                         trash?!

               He flings it across the room. It lands on MacReady's chess 
               set.

                                     NAULS
                         I want my kitchen clean. Germ free!

               Nauls spins on his skates and storms off. MacReady fetches 
               the strangely shredded underwear and rolls it up, while Childs 
               paces.

                                     CHILDS
                         So, MacReady, come on now. These 
                         Norwegian dudes come by... find him 
                         and dig him up...

               MacReady tosses the ball of cloth across the room into a 
               trash bin.

                                     MACREADY
                         Yeah, they dig him up and cart him 
                         back. He gets thawed out, wakes up 
                         and scares the shit out of them. And 
                         they get into one hell of a brawl...

                                     CHILDS
                         Now how's this motherfucker wake up 
                         after thousands of years in the ice, 
                         huh?

                                     MACREADY
                              (annoyed)
                         I don't know how. Because he's 
                         different than we are. Because he's 
                         a space guy. What do you want from 
                         me, anyway. Go ask Blair.

                                     CHILDS
                         You buy any of this, Blair?

               A beat as Blair stares straight ahead, transfixed. He speaks 
               softly, to no one particular.

                                     BLAIR
                         It was here... got to that dog... It 
                         was here in this camp...

               The men take in his grave countenance.

                                     GARRY
                         So...? So what? It's over with.

               Blair turns to them. A pause. The men search his face.

                                     BENNINGS
                              (edgy)

               INT. LAB - CLOSE ON A SHEET

               as Blair rips it off exposing the tangled mess of interlocking 
               dogs.

               Pull back. All the men have gathered. Some of the men settle 
               into chairs, others stand.

                                     BLAIR
                         Whatever that Norwegian dog was...  
                         It... It was capable of changing its 
                         form...
                              (indicates their dog)
                         ...when it attacked our dog... it 
                         somehow was able to digest... or... 
                         absorb it... and in the process shaped 
                         its own cells to imitate our dog's 
                         cells exactly...

                         ...This for instance isn't dog at 
                         all -- it's imitation... We got to 
                         it before it had time to finish or...

                         Finish what?

                                     BLAIR
                         ...I think the whole process would 
                         have taken an hour... maybe more. 
                         And then I suppose both would have 
                         changed back to dog form.

                         weren't no dog.

                                     BLAIR
                              (impatient)
                         Of course not... But whatever it was 
                         revived, it... Well, The Thing was 
                         probably disoriented... and realized 
                         it couldn't survive for long in our 
                         atmosphere... But being the incredibly 
                         adaptable creature it was... it tried 
                         to become something that could... 
                         Before the Norwegians killed it... 
                         it somehow got to this dog.

                         What do you mean "got" to the dog?

                                     BLAIR
                         It was a life form that was able to 
                         imitate and reproduce, whatever it 
                         ate or absorbed, cell for cell.

               Silence.

                                     BLAIR
                         The concept is staggering. I know... 
                         I... I don't fully understand it 
                         myself.

                         You're saying... that big muther in 
                         the ice, became the dog.

                         I think we're talking about an 
                         organism... that could imitate other 
                         life forms... perfectly... It could 
                         have gone on and on... It could have 
                         become one dog... It could have become 
                         as many dogs as it wanted to -- and 
                         without losing any of its original 
                         mass...

                         You been into Childs' weed, Blair?

               Blair slams his fist on the slab.

                                     BLAIR
                         Look, I know it's hard to believe...

                                     GARRY
                              (breaking in)
                         So what's our problem?

                                     BLAIR
                         Well... there's still some cell 
                         activity... it's not entirely dead 
                         yet.

               Several of the men nearest the carcasses jump back knocking 
               over a chair.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. COMPOUND - NIGHT - CLOSE ON THE DOG CARCASSES

               lying on the snow. Splash. They are being soaked with 
               gasoline.

                         You can't do this! You can't burn 
                         these remains...

               Pull back. Fuchs is beside himself. Childs has the large 
               torch. MacReady empties another can on the bodies. Dr. Copper 
               stands nearby.

                                     MACREADY
                         And the horse you rode in on, Fuchs.
                              (to Childs)
                         Light it up.

               Childs lights the tip. Fuchs makes a determined move for the 
               torch.

                                     FUCHS
                         Well, I'm not going to let this 
                         happen...

               Childs struggles with him for a beat and then flings him to 
               the ground. Dr. Copper grabs him preventing him from getting 
               back up.

               Childs splays the remains with a jet of flame. Fuchs shakes 
               his head in frustration and disgust.

                                     FUCHS
                         I just can't believe it... We're 
                         going to go down as the biggest bunch 
                         of assholes in history...

                         Fuck history. At least we're going 
                         to live to be an old bunch of 
                         assholes.

               INT. KENNEL - NIGHT

               The night feeding. Clark dishes out the food. Blair is taking 
               blood samples from the remaining three dogs.

                                     BLAIR
                              (perplexed, bothered)
                         Clark, did you notice anything strange 
                         about that dog? Just anything at 
                         all? Any little thing?

                                     CLARK
                         No. Just that he recovered real 
                         quick... That night when I found him 
                         in the rec room, he had already 
                         scraped off his bandage. Before I 
                         put him with the others, I redressed 
                         his wound and noticed it had healed 
                         up real good...

               A beat as Blair stares at Clark.

                                     BLAIR
                         That night?

                                     CLARK
                              (pets dog vigorously)
                         Yeah.

                                     BLAIR
                         What was he doing in the rec room?

                                     CLARK
                         Well, after I worked on him -- thought 
                         I'd let him rest. Left the room for 
                         a bit. When I came back, he was gone.

                                     BLAIR
                         Well, where was he? Where did he go?

                                     CLARK
                         Don't know. Looked for him for a 
                         bit... couldn't find him.

                                     BLAIR
                              (a long beat)
                         You're saying he wasn't put into the 
                         kennel until the night?

               Clark seems uneasy under Blair's intense gaze.

                                     CLARK
                         Well... yeah.

               Blair stands, his eyes still glued to Clark.

                                     BLAIR
                         How long were you with the dog? Alone, 
                         I mean?

                                     CLARK
                         Ah... He was hurt bad. Bullet nicked 
                         an artery... I don't know... An 
                         hour... hour and a half...

               Blair's eyes glaze as if in revelation.

                                     CLARK
                         What the hell you looking at me like 
                         that for?

                                     BLAIR
                         Nothing. Nothing at all.

               He backs out of the kennel.

               INT. HALLWAY - COMPOUND

               Irritated, distressed, station manager Garry moves briskly 
               down the hall. Blair, worried and pale, tries to keep up 
               with him.

                                     BLAIR
                         ...It could have gotten to somebody...

                         Anybody sick?

                                     BLAIR
                         No, I... I don't mean infection... 
                         or disease...

               Garry stops at the entrance to the communications room.

                                     GARRY
                         Any luck yet?

               Sanchez shrugs.

                                     SANCHEZ
                         Couple seconds of an Argentine disco 
                         station.

                                     GARRY
                         Well, stick with it. I want you at 
                         it round the clock. We got to get 
                         help in here...

                                     BLAIR
                              (alarm)
                         No... No, you can't let anyone in 
                         here... That dog was all over this 
                         camp...

               Bennings interrupts, entering the hallway, referring to his 
               meteorological chart.

                                     BENNINGS
                              (to Garry)
                         Travel-wise, tomorrow may be okay. 
                         But after that some pretty nasty 
                         northeasterly shit's coming in.

                                     FUCHS
                         ...Goddamn fools...

               The men outside come stomping through the hallway.

                                     BLAIR
                              (pleading)
                         Listen to me, Garry. Please...

                                     GARRY
                              (to MacReady)
                         If the weather clears enough before 
                         we reach anybody -- I'm sending you 
                         and Doc up to MacMurdo...

                         BLAIR
                 No! You can't let people 
                 leave...

                                                       MACREADY
                                               I ain't going anywhere in 
                                               anything over forty knots, 
                                               Garry... 

                                     GARRY
                              (snapping)
                         The hell you won't, MacReady!

                                     BLAIR
                         Don't you understand?! That Thing 
                         didn't want to become a dog...

                                     GARRY
                              (fed up)
                         Damn you, Blair! You've already got 
                         everybody half-hysterical around 
                         here.

                                     BLAIR
                         You can't let anybody leave!

                                     GARRY
                         I've got six dead Norwegians on my 
                         hands, a burned up flying saucer, 
                         and we've just destroyed the 
                         scientific find of the century. Now 
                         fuck off!

               Close on Blair, ashen-faced, falling silent. As if in a daze, 
               he watches the men as they continue to converse. Suspicious, 
               frightened.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. COMPOUND - NIGHT

               Pitch black except for the barest of lighting which outlines 
               the building. Wind. The swirl of ice.

               INT. MACREADY'S CABIN - NIGHT

               Far away from the others, MacReady sits in his little hovel 
               putting the final screw into his mended chess set.

               On the other side of the set, his busty, inflatable companion 
               has been propped up in a chair. His sombrero hangs down her 
               back, keeping her in place. Hawaiian music plays from his 
               tape deck.

                                     MACREADY
                         All set.

               He puts down his screwdriver, holds up his glass and offers 
               a toast with a big grin.

                                     MACREADY
                         To us.

               He clinks the drink he has made for her that rests on her 
               side of the board. He sips. He turns on the machine and makes 
               his first move.

                                     MACREADY
                         Now go easy on me, Esperanza. I'm 
                         just a beginner.

               The set answers for Esperanza.

                                     CHESS VOICE
                         Rook takes bishop at Queen four -- 
                         Rook take pawn at Queen two -- Rook 
                         takes Queen at Queen one -- Checkmate.

                                     MACREADY
                         Aw shit.

               He flips open the circuitry panel in disgust. He tosses his 
               screwdriver on the board and grabs his drink, downing it.

                                     MACREADY
                         Sorry, hon.

               He reaches inside his ice bucket. Empty.

                                     MACREADY
                         Never any damn ice around here...

               EXT. MACREADY'S CABIN - NIGHT

               MacReady exits. He swacks at a nearby bank of ice with a 
               small ice pick.

                                     MACREADY
                         Now in Mexico... Tahiti... They got 
                         ice... They got ice coming out of 
                         their ears.

               The sound of a clanking. He turns his attention. Metal against 
               metal. Strange. MacReady listens. It appears to be coming 
               from far off below, near the camp.

               MACREADY

               as he makes his way down with the aid of the steadying ropes. 
               The clanking louder now. He senses the direction.

               MACREADY

               at the bottom near the main compound.  The sound has stopped.  
               He looks around in the near blackness.  A beat.

               THE CHOPPERS

               sitting idle in the dark. MacReady approaches. The door to 
               one of the cockpits is slightly ajar. He opens it cautiously.

               INT. CHOPPER

               MacReady slips in. He turns on a flashlight. The controls 
               have been mangled. Beaten with something heavy. Bang!! 
               MacReady, startled, turns. Like the sound of a gun. Coming 
               from the main compound.

               INT. COMPOUND - MAIN ENTRANCE

               Confusion. Shouts. MacReady enters. He grabs Palmer as he 
               and Bennings rush by.

                                     MACREADY
                         What's...

                                     PALMER
                         Blair. He's gone berserk.

                                     BENNINGS
                         He's in the radio room. Got a gun. 
                         Beat on Sanchez something fierce.

               HALLWAY - RADIO ROOM ENTRANCE

               The men are on either side of the open radio room doorway.

               Garry peeks his head in. A gunshot blast forces him back.

               RADIO ROOM

               Sanchez lies on the floor, groaning. Blair holds the gun on 
               the door. He wields a fire ax with the other hand and smashes 
               down on the radio.

                                     BLAIR
                         Anybody interferes, I'll kill! 
                         Nobody's getting in or out of this 
                         camp...

               HALLWAY

               MacReady has joined the others.

                                     MACREADY
                         He smashed one of the choppers up 
                         good. Childs, go check the other one 
                         and the tractor.

               Childs is off.

               RADIO ROOM

               Blair crunches the ax down once again, while keeping an eye 
               on the door.

                                     BLAIR
                         ...You think I'm crazy? Fine! Most 
                         of you don't know what's going on -- 
                         but I'm damn well sure some of you 
                         do!
                              (crunch)

               BACK TO HALLWAY

                                     NORRIS
                         The back window. A couple of us could 
                         maybe surprise him.

                                     MACREADY
                         Too damn dangerous.

               BACK TO RADIO ROOM

                                     BLAIR
                         ...You think this Thing wants to 
                         become an animal? Dogs can't make it 
                         1000 miles to the sea. No skua gulls 
                         to imitate this time of year... No 
                         penguins this far inland... Don't 
                         you understand?! It wanted to become 
                         us!

               He brings the ax down hard on the radio.

               BACK TO HALLWAY

               Childs runs up, out of breath.

                                     CHILDS
                         He got both choppers and the 
                         tractor... I don't know how bad yet.

               Garry readies his large .357 Magnum.

                                     MACREADY
                         No, wait a minute.
                              (to Norris)
                         The fuse box.

               Norris double-times down the hall.

               MacReady turns the corner and into the rec room. He grabs 
               one of the thick card tables.

               MacReady returns with the table to the hallway.

                                     BLAIR
                         ...Can't you see...? If one cell of 
                         this Thing got out it could imitate 
                         every living thing on Earth. Nothing 
                         could stop it! Nothing!

                                     MACREADY
                              (humoring)
                         Look Blair, maybe you're right about 
                         this. But we've got to be rational. 
                         We've got to talk this over. I'm 
                         unarmed and I'm coming in.

                                     BLAIR
                         No, you're not! I don't trust any of 
                         you!

               NORRIS

               reaches the fuse box. He opens it.

               HALLWAY

               MacReady readies the table like a shield.

                                     MACREADY
                         If you're right we've all got to 
                         stick together.

               The lights go out. MacReady charges into the black room.

               Blair fires. MacReady barrels into him, knocking him to the 
               ground. He pummels him with a right hand and manages to 
               control the gun.

               The others dive in and pile on.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. COMPOUND

               Heavily-clothed, MacReady, Fuchs and Dr. Copper help a dazed 
               Blair to a toolshed some seventy-five yards from the main 
               compound.

               INT. TOOLSHED

               More spacious than MacReady's. Very livable. Two windows. 
               Blair has been placed on the cot. Dr. Copper injects him 
               with a sedative.

                                     BLAIR
                         Why am I here?

                                     DR. COPPER
                         It's for your own protection, Blair.

                                     MACREADY
                         And mainly ours.

               EXT. SHACK

               Fuchs and MacReady nail boards over the windows.

                                     MACREADY
                         Leave a bit of an opening so he can 
                         see out.

               Blair's droopy-eyed, heavily drugged features loom up at 
               MacReady through the window.

                                     MACREADY
                         How you doin', old boy?

                                     BLAIR
                              (softly)
                         I don't know who to trust.

                                     MACREADY
                              (humoring)
                         Know what you mean, Blair. Trust is 
                         a tough thing to come by these days. 
                         Just trust in the Lord.

                                     BLAIR

                         Watch him close. Ask him why he didn't 
                         kennel the dog.

               Blair's face disappears from the window.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. COMPOUND - DAY

               Harsh and grey. Getting very dark as winter takes a stronger 
               hold. Bennings is dumping the trash in a large hole in the 
               snow which acts as the trash dump.

               Bennings finishes and drags the empty bins past Palmer and 
               Childs, who are fixing the wounded choppers.

               INT. RADIO ROOM

               The radio looks a mess. Norris and Sanchez, a bandage wrapped 
               around his head, examines the damage. He is in pain and still 
               looks a little groggy.

                                     SANCHEZ
                         I'll see what I can do. But they 
                         didn't teach me much about fixing 
                         these things.

               Norris smiles and pats him comfortingly.

                                     NORRIS
                         They didn't teach you much about 
                         working them either.

               INT. MESS HALL - MORNING

               CLOSE ON A BUFFET OF EGGS, BACON, TOAST, ETC.

               Pull back. The men help themselves. It is a cramped, elongated 
               room.

               Dr. Copper approaches Nauls and hands him a capsule.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Put this in Blair's juice before you 
                         take him his tray.

               Clark comes running into the room, pallid, out of breath.  
               The men turn to look.

                         No. Door was wide open. I know I 
                         latched it.

               EXT. COMPOUND ABOVE THE UNDERGROUND KENNEL

               CLOSE ON THE DOGS' TRACKS in the snow. They lead from the 
               kennel's open stairwell and out onto the ice. All the men 
               have gathered.

                                     CLARK
                         All three of them took off.

               MacReady is writing down what appears to be a list on a pad.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         How long do you suppose they've been 
                         gone?

                                     CLARK
                         I haven't seen them since their last 
                         feeding. Could be as much as twenty-
                         four hours.

                                     MACREADY
                         They couldn't have gotten that far 
                         in this weather.

               Garry and several others turn to MacReady quizzically.

                                     GARRY
                         You're not thinking of going after 
                         them, are you?

                                     MACREADY
                         I am going after them.

                                     NORRIS
                         What in the hell for? Even if Blair's 
                         right -- they'll just die out there. 
                         No food. They're over a thousand 
                         miles from anything.

                         Chopper aren't going to be ready for 
                         days.

               MacReady hands his list to Bennings.

                                     MACREADY
                         Get these things out of supply and 
                         meet me over by the snowmobiles.

                                     GARRY
                         You're not going to catch them in 
                         one of those with the start they 
                         got.

                         Palmer, how long would it take you 
                         to strap those big four-cylinder 
                         carburetors on?

                                     PALMER

                         Then get a move on. Childs, come 
                         with me.

               He puts his arm around Childs and pulls him along. The others 
               watch them walk off, a little bewildered.

                                     GARRY
                              (shouting after them)
                         Besides, what are you going to do 
                         when you catch up to them?

               Bennings is reading MacReady's list.

                                     BENNINGS
                         Holy shit.

                         Whatever he's going to do, he ain't 
                         fucking around.

               of the large torch. A fierce stream of flame bursts from its 
               nozzle.

               Pull back. The stream has shot out some fifteen feet.

               Childs has been modifying it.

                         I can get maybe another five or six

               Pull back. Bennings reads off the list of supplies.

               EXT. ANTARCTICA - ICESCAPE

               The two vehicles rip across the hard, flat ice, bolstered by 
               the added horsepower. They follow the still visible dog tracks 
               in the snow.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE SUN

               sliding across the horizon, signaling midday. The snowmobiles 
               whoosh past. Bennings drives the one loaded with supplies. 
               MacReady and Childs double up on the other.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               MACREADY

               steadying his binoculars, while Childs drives, spots something 
               up ahead. The vehicles slow down and come to a halt. Something 
               lies just ahead of them in the whiteness, in the middle of 
               the dog tracks.

               THE MEN

               kneel down by the "something." It is the half-eaten remains 
               of a dog. Its hind legs and lower stomach picked clean. Its 
               ripped hide, flapping in the wind. Its top half missing.

                                     CHILDS
                         What is it?

               MacReady follows the line of continuing dog tracks.

                                     MACREADY
                         Maybe dinner.

                         Dogs don't eat each other.

                              (beat)
                         I know.

                         Where's the other half?

                                     MACREADY
                         Probably the next meal.

               MacReady moves to the snowmobile and grabs a two-gallon can 
               of gasoline. He turns to Bennings.

                                     MACREADY
                         Where these tracks headed?

                                     BENNINGS
                         Nowhere... Just straight to the ocean.

               A beat as MacReady takes this in. He pours the gas over the 
               remains and sets it aflame.

                                     MACREADY
                         Let's move.

               Childs and Bennings are not that anxious to continue.

                                     CHILDS
                         They could be hours ahead of us, 
                         Mac.

                                     BENNINGS
                         Gonna get dark soon, too. Supposed 
                         to be fifty below tonight.

               MacReady gets on and revs up the engine.

                                     MACREADY
                         Turn back if you want.

               Childs and Bennings return shrugs.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE SUN

               making its last pass, rolling off the horizon. Only a slight 
               orange hue left.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE SNOWMOBILES

               move slower, positioned on either side of the tracks. The 
               tracks abruptly change direction. The men come to a stop.

               It is much colder now. Their beards, a mask of white powder.

               MacReady surveys the new direction. They are headed toward a 
               far-off ridge of bluffs. Large, windswept mounds of ice.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE SNOWMOBILES

               as they move through a valley of newly-formed dunes and tall 
               ice cliffs. The last of the sun obscured, the headlamps are 
               turned on and pointed at the tracks.

               The men look behind, in front, and from side to side, as 
               they proceed cautiously through the maze. Up ahead MacReady 
               spots:

               A DOG

               It sits, its back to them, unconcerned, heedless of their 
               arrival. It is munching on the other half of the dog carcass.

               The men stop their machines some twenty yards from it. They 
               are hemmed in at the valley's narrowest point.

               Childs, carrying the torch, and MacReady, armed with a 
               thermite bomb, wade awkwardly but carefully toward the animal 
               in their snowshoes. Bennings stands back by the snowmobiles.

               Childs and MacReady spread out some dozen feet from the dog. 
               It continues to pay them no mind, content to chew its food.

                                     CHILDS
                         Where's the other one?

               Bennings surveys the tops of the snow bluffs that encircle 
               them with his flashlight.

                                     MACREADY
                              (to dog)
                         Where's your buddy, boy? Huh?

               No response. MacReady searches the near vicinity with his 
               light. All three are growing uneasy.

                                     MACREADY
                         Let that thing fly, Childs. Don't 
                         let up until he's ash.

               Childs turns on the gas and lights the tip.

               Bennings is still watching the bluffs. Something from beneath 
               the snow reaches up and grabs his feet. He is ripped back 
               down through the hard snow in one incredibly powerful motion. 
               He screams, his head the only thing sticking out of the ice.

               Childs and MacReady turn, confused, unable to see anything 
               be Bennings' screaming head. They rush toward him.

               MacReady stumbles.

               The sound of a snapping, a crackling to MacReady's rear.

               He freezes; turns back to the dog. Its back is still to him; 
               its coat of hair sticking up like that of a porcupine. It 
               snarls; its face turns slowly toward him.

               Its skin splitting; its mouth ripping open wildly.

                                     MACREADY
                         Childs!!

               Childs stops, confused as to who to help first. He notices 
               the dog hunched and ready to spring. He steps back toward 
               MacReady. The dog/Thing leaps for MacReady; an incredible 
               jump of some twenty feet.

               Childs lets loose a blast, hitting the dog in midair; the 
               force of the spray knocking it back and tumbling to the ice 
               in flames.

               MacReady throws his thermite canister. It discharges and 
               engulfs the screeching animal in fire.

               BENNINGS

               howling in pain. The ice underneath him thrashes violently. 
               Childs and MacReady stand by helplessly, unable to see what 
               has him or what action to take. Childs moves closer to help.

                                     MACREADY
                              (pulls him back)
                         Stay back!!

               Bennings' head disappears with a sudden jerk through the 
               ice. The ice continues to rumble like boiling water, moving 
               in different directions. Part of Bennings' body pops up in a 
               different area and is just as quickly pulled back down.

               MacReady and Childs watch on in frustration and anger.

                                     CHILDS
                         What we going to do?!

                                     MACREADY
                         How the fuck do I know?!

               Bennings' head and shoulders then surface near one of the 
               snowmobiles. Something has him. Unclear as to what. The jowls 
               of a dog. But huge. Bennings' heavy clothing begins to rip, 
               tear, as if his skin underneath was bulging out. The jowls 
               seem to be absorbing his head.

               MacReady runs for the snowmobile.

                                     MACREADY
                         Torch them!!

                                     CHILDS
                         But...

                                     MACREADY
                         He's gone already! Do it!

               Childs blasts away. The ice begins to melt as Bennings and 
               whatever has him catch fire. A screeching.

               MacReady grabs cans of gas from the snowmobiles. Suddenly a 
               steel-like, arachnid-shaped arm shoots out in pain and with 
               incredible force pierces the fiberglass chassis of the 
               snowmobile. MacReady is knocked back. He recovers and dumps 
               cans of gasoline on the writhing mess.

               He dives and rolls away from the lunging appendage.

               He and Childs watch on as Bennings and The Thing roar in 
               flame. Behind them, the other dog/Thing continues to burn. 
               The screeching, mewing and gurgling wails on, all about them.

               They look to each other in disbelief, their faces illuminated 
               by the flickering flames. The strident sounds beginning to 
               subside.

               THE SUN

               Its slim, orange arc sets, signaling the start of the Vernal 
               Equinox. And the beginning of six months of darkness.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. COMPOUND - REC ROOM

               The men are interrogating Clark. He is frazzled and defensive.

                                     CLARK
                         ...I'm telling you I don't remember 
                         leaving the kennel unlatched...

               Childs is holding the industrial torch directly in his face.

                                     CHILDS
                         Bullshit! You left it open so they 
                         could get out!

               EXT. TRASH DUMP

               MacReady, waist-deep in trash and snow, searches for 
               something.

               INT. REC ROOM

               The interrogation continues.

                                     CLARK
                         ...Would I even have told you they 
                         were gone if I had anything to hide?

                                     GARRY
                         But why didn't you kennel that dog 
                         right away?

                                     CLARK
                         I told you I couldn't find...
                              (pushes torch away)
                         ...get that out of my face.

               Childs grabs him by the collar and rips him off his chair.

                                     CHILDS
                         Don't you be telling me...

               Nauls steps between them.

                                     NAULS
                              (to Childs)
                         Lighten your load, sucker. You ain't 
                         the judge and executioner around 
                         here!

                                     CHILDS
                         Who you trying to protect, 
                         mutherfucker? I'm telling you this 
                         S.O.B. could be one of them.

               Garry breaks it up, pulling them apart. MacReady enters from 
               the outside. A bundle is tucked under his arm.

                                     GARRY
                         Hold on, damn it. We're getting 
                         nowhere... If this bit of Blair's 
                         about absorbing and imitating is 
                         true... then that dog could have 
                         gotten to anybody.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         And if it got to Clark... Clark could 
                         have gotten to anybody.

               MacReady moves over to the table.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Theoretically any of us could be 
                         whatever the hell this thing is.

               Norris shakes his head, rubbing his chest in slight 
               discomfort.

                                     NORRIS
                         It's just too damn wild -- I can't 
                         believe it.

               MacReady pushes his sombrero back over his head.

                                     MACREADY
                         Well, you can believe it now.

               He drops the bundle he had been holding on the table between 
               the men. It is the shredded pair of long johns.

                                     MACREADY
                         Nauls found this yesterday. It's 
                         ripped just like the clothing on the 
                         Norwegian we brought back. The same 
                         thing was happening to Bennings' 
                         clothes when it got to him. Seems 
                         these Things don't imitate clothes. 
                         Just flesh and bone.

               The men look from one another. Silence. MacReady picks it up 
               and examines the label.

                                     MACREADY
                         Size large.
                              (grins)
                         What do you wear, Clark?

               Clark stews.

                                     CLARK
                         So what?

                                     NORRIS
                         I wear a size large, too.

                                     MACREADY
                         So do I. So do most of us.

               The uneasiness in the room grows.

                                     MACREADY
                         Doubt if it got to more than one or 
                         two of us. But it got to someone.
                              (beat)
                         Somebody in this room ain't what he 
                         appears to be.

               A pause as all eyes travel from man to man.

                                     SANCHEZ
                              (scared)
                         Well, what we going to do?

               Norris turns to Dr. Copper and Fuchs.

                                     NORRIS
                         Can there be... some kind of test? 
                         To find out who's what?

                                     DR. COPPER
                         A serum test possibly.

                                     FUCHS
                         Right. Why not?

                                     GARRY
                         What's that?

                                     DR. COPPER
                         It's a simple blood typing test. 
                         This Thing's blood chemistry is 
                         different than ours. Basically we 
                         mix someone's blood with 
                         uncontaminated human blood. If we 
                         don't get the proper serum reaction -- 
                         then that person isn't human.

                                     CHILDS
                         Whose uncontaminated blood we going 
                         to use?

                                     DR. COPPER
                         We've got blood plasma in storage.

                                     GARRY
                         How long will it take you to prepare 
                         this?

                                     DR. COPPER
                         A couple of hours.

                                     GARRY
                         Well, get to it.

               Garry unhinges a key from his belt and hands it to Dr.  
               Copper. Dr. Copper and Fuchs head for the infirmary.

                                     PALMER
                         How's that Thing get to the dogs? I 
                         though we stopped it in time.

                                     MACREADY
                         Copper thinks they swallowed pieces 
                         of it during the fight.

                                     PALMER
                         And that was enough?

                                     DR. COPPER (O.S.)
                         Garry. The rest of you! Come here!

               INT. INFIRMARY

               The men rush in. Fuchs and Copper stand by the open plasma 
               storage refrigerator. The inside is a mess of dried blood. 
               The bladders have been ripped open. Copper is ghastly pale.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Somebody got to the blood... sabotaged 
                         it.

                                     NAULS
                         Oh, my God.

               A horrified silence.

                                     MACREADY
                         Was it broken into?

                                     FUCHS
                         No. Somebody opened it. Closed it. 
                         And then locked it.

               Sanchez twitches, terrified.

                                     MACREADY
                         Well, who's got access to it?

                                     DR. COPPER
                         I guess I'm the only one.

                                     GARRY
                         And I've got the only key.

               Several pairs of eyes turn to Garry.

                                     MACREADY
                         Would that test have worked?

                                     DR. COPPER
                         I think so.

                                     NORRIS
                         Somebody else sure as hell thought 
                         so.

                                     MACREADY
                         Who else could have used that key?

                                     GARRY
                         Ah... no one... I give it to Copper 
                         when he needs it...

                                     MACREADY
                         Could anyone have gotten it from 
                         you?

                                     DR. COPPER
                         I don't see how... when I'm finished 
                         I return it right away.

                                     NORRIS
                         When was the last time you used it?

                                     DR. COPPER
                              (uneasy)
                         A day or so ago... I guess.

               Garry senses the nervous and inquiring eyes on him.

                                     GARRY
                         I suppose... well, it's possible 
                         someone might have lifted it from 
                         me. But...

                                     CHILDS
                         That key ring of yours is always 
                         hooked to your belt. Now how could 
                         somebody get to it without you 
                         knowing?

                                     GARRY
                              (upset, flustered)
                         Look, I haven't been near that... 
                         that refrigerator.

               Silence as the men continue to stare. Sanchez is perspiring.

                                     GARRY
                         Copper's the only one who has any 
                         business with it.

               The eyes shift from Garry to Copper.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Now... wait a second, Garry, you've 
                         been in here on several occasions...

                                     FUCHS
                         And the Doc thought of the test.

                                     CHILDS
                              (anger)
                         So what?! Is that supposed to leave 
                         him in the clear?! Bullshit!

               Sanchez bolts out the door. Stunned for a beat, the others 
               chase after him.

                                     GARRY
                         Hey, Sanchez!

               SANCHEZ

               in terror, runs at top speed through the narrow corridors.

               Opening and shutting doors. The others are in pursuit.

               They shout for him to stop.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               SANCHEZ

               as he reaches a small armory. A glass case set into the wall. 
               A half dozen rarely used guns are inside. He tries the handle. 
               Locked.

               He hears the clamor of feet and voices as the others are 
               nearing. He breaks the glass and grabs a shotgun. Then a box 
               of shells. He frantically tries to load, but is too nervous.

               The others arrive at the end of the hallway. Garry pulls his 
               handgun and points.

                                     GARRY
                         Put that down!

                                     SANCHEZ
                              (trembling)
                         No.

                                     GARRY
                         I'll put this right through your 
                         head.

               No one doubts Garry's sincerity.

                                     SANCHEZ
                         You guys going to let him give orders? 
                         I mean he could be one of those 
                         Things.

               The other regard Garry tensely. No one oblivious to the fact, 
               that Sanchez just might be right.

                                     MACREADY
                              (calm)
                         Put it away, Sanchez. Just put it 
                         away.

               Still trembling, he tosses the shells back into the broken 
               case, leans the gun against the wall and begins to sob.

               Nauls skates over to comfort him.

               The men watch as Garry lowers his gun. He turns to them.

                                     GARRY
                         I don't know about Copper. But I 
                         didn't go near that plasma...
                              (beat)
                         But I guess you'll all rest easier 
                         if someone else is in charge.

               He hands his gun to Norris.

                                     GARRY
                         Can't see anyone objecting to you, 
                         Norris.

                                     NORRIS
                         Sorry, gentlemen...
                              (rubs chest)
                         ...Don't think I'd be up to it. 
                         Haven't been feeling well lately.

               Childs goes for the gun.

                                     CHILDS
                         I'll take it...

               MacReady beats him to it.

                                     MACREADY
                         Maybe it should be someone a bit 
                         more even-tempered, Childs.

               Childs glares.

                                     MACREADY
                              (to others)
                         ...Any objections?

               Roving eyes pass about the hallway. Nobody is sure who to 
               trust. MacReady seems as good as any.

               INT. REC ROOM

               The men have gathered to discuss plans. Furtive and 
               untrustworthy glances are passed around the room.

                                     MACREADY
                         ...From what we know this Thing likes 
                         to go one on one. So we stick together 
                         as much as possible. In two's and 
                         three's.

               Childs points to Garry, Dr. Copper and Clark.

                                     CHILDS
                         What do we do about those three?

                                     MACREADY
                         We got morphine, don't we.

               Fuchs nods.

                                     MACREADY
                         Well, we keep them loaded. Stash 
                         them here in the rec room and watch 
                         'em twenty-four hours.

                                     PALMER
                              (ears perk up)
                         Morphine? You know I was pretty close 
                         to that dog, too.

               Palmer is ignored.

                                     NORRIS
                         We should sleep in shifts.

                                     MACREADY
                         Right. Half of us awake at all times.

                                     SANCHEZ
                         How we going to try and find out 
                         who's... you know, who's who?

                                     MACREADY
                              (to Fuchs)
                         Can you think of any other tests?

                                     FUCHS
                         I'll try.  I could sure use Copper's 
                         help though.

                                     CHILDS
                         You can eighty-six that thought right 
                         now, man.

               Dr. Copper eyes his accuser solemnly.

                                     MACREADY
                         Also... When this Thing turns... it 
                         turns slowly at first. I think we 
                         can handle it in that state. But if 
                         it ever got to full power... from 
                         what I saw of that Norwegian camp... 
                         well, I just don't know... It would 
                         probably take it an hour or more to 
                         get like that. So no matter what 
                         anybody's doing, we all return to 
                         this room every twenty minutes. 
                         Anybody gone longer than that... 
                         anybody trying to leave... we kill 
                         'em.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. COMPOUND - DARKNESS

               It is the dead of winter. Six months of darkness ahead. Palmer 
               fights the cold as he works dismantling the engine of the 
               helicopter.

               He frowns, searching for something.

                                     PALMER
                              (mumbles)
                         Where's that magneto? Can't find a 
                         darn thing around here any more.

               INT. REC ROOM

               Copper, Clark and Garry sit moodily together on a couch.

               Norris awkwardly prepares to give them their injections.

               He is new at this. Childs stands guard with his torch.

               Dr. Copper offers to help.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         I'll do it. You're going to break 
                         the needle in my arm.

                                     CHILDS
                         No, Doc. He's doing a real fine job.

               EXT. COMPOUND

               MacReady and Sanchez are foraging through the trash dump.

                                     MACREADY
                         Look for shoes, too. And burned cloth.

               INT. RADIO ROOM

               Norris has begun dismantling the radio. He rubs at his chest 
               as he disengages the headset.

               INT. HALLWAY

               Following Nauls as he skates through the labyrinth.

               Checking waste bins. Pausing to look behind shelves and any 
               obscure hiding place.

               MacReady passes him coming the other way.

                                     NAULS
                         That thing's too smart to be hiding 
                         any more of its clothes, MacReady.

                                     MACREADY
                         Just keep looking.

               INT. LAB

               Fuchs is poring over a book. Several others lie open on his 
               desk.

               MacReady pokes his head in the lab.

                                     MACREADY
                         How's it going?

                                     FUCHS
                         Nothing yet. But, MacReady, I've 
                         been thinking... If our dogs changed 
                         by swallowing parts of that other 
                         one... We better see to it that 
                         everyone prepares their own food and 
                         we eat out of cans.

                                     MACREADY
                         Gotchya.

               EXT. COMPOUND

               A siren goes off, signaling the end of a twenty-minute period. 
               Sanchez pulls himself out of the trash dump.

               Palmer carries a large part of a helicopter engine toward 
               the compound.

               INT. COMPOUND

               The hallway near the supply storage cubicle. MacReady holds 
               the door open as Palmer makes his way to him lugging the 
               heavy helicopter part.

               Childs passes by from the other direction.

                                     PALMER
                         Childs, where's that magneto from 
                         Chopper One?

                                     CHILDS
                         Ain't it there?

               He passes by.

                                     PALMER
                         No it ain't there. Would I be asking 
                         if it were there?

                                     MACREADY
                         Move it, Palmer.

               INT. SUPPLY STORAGE ROOM

               Palmer sets down the heavy part. Norris follows him inside 
               with a bundle of radio gear. They move back out into the 
               hallway. MacReady locks the door behind them.

               HALLWAY

               The three move down the hall toward their appointed rendezvous 
               at the rec room.

                                     MACREADY
                              (to Palmer)
                         Start taking apart those snowmobiles 
                         next, huh?

               INT. KITCHEN

               Cramped. Several of the men are preparing their food.

               Opening cans. Heating them in pots.

               EXT. COMPOUND

               Nauls wearily approaches Blair's tool shed with a tray of 
               food. He hears a pounding from within.

                                     NAULS
                         I got your goodies, superdude.

               He peeks in through the opening in the boarded-up window.

               Blair is nailing himself in from the inside. He looks pretty 
               crazed.

                                     NAULS
                         What you doin'?

                                     BLAIR
                         Nobody's getting in here. You can 
                         tell them all that!

                                     NAULS
                         Well, who the hell you think wants 
                         to get in there with you?

               Nauls slides the tray in the slot. It is immediately shoved 
               back out and topples onto the ice. Some of the food has 
               splashed on Nauls' heavy coat.

                                     NAULS
                         Now why'd you go and...

                                     BLAIR
                         And I don't want any more food with 
                         sedatives in it. I know what you're 
                         up to. Don't think I don't. And if 
                         anyone tries to get in here -- I've 
                         got rope. I'll hang myself before it 
                         gets to me.

                                     NAULS
                         You promise?

               Nauls picks up the tray, heads back mumbling.

                                     NAULS
                         Crazy white scientist motherfucker...

               EXT. COMPOUND

               Palmer works on the snowmobile. Sanchez resumes searching 
               through the trash.

               INT. BALLOON TOWER

               MacReady slashes into the huge uninflated weather balloons, 
               rendering them useless. Tanks of helium and hydrogen are 
               stacked nearby.

               INT. KITCHEN

               Nauls does the dishes. His cassette plays in the b.g.

               INT. REC ROOM

               Childs continues guarding the three men.

                                     CLARK
                         Gotta go to the can, Childs.

               Childs follows him to the other end of the room.

                                     CHILDS
                         Be quick.

               Clark walks to the head. Childs moves back to the middle of 
               the room. As the guard he is much more vulnerable in this 
               position. Being split between his prisoners.

               The lights begin to flicker. The soft purr of the generator 
               begins to fade.

                                     CHILDS
                         Oh, no.

               The lights go out. Nauls calls from the kitchen.

                                     NAULS (O.S.)
                         Childs! That a fuse?

                                     CHILDS
                         No. The generator. You got the 
                         auxiliary box just off the kitchen. 
                         Get to it.
                              (fumbling around)
                         Where's the damn flashlight?
                              (calling out)
                         You fellas okay over there?

               Dr. Copper giggles in the dark.

                                     CHILDS
                         Cut that out, Copper.
                              (beat)
                         Nauls? What's taking you?!

                                     NAULS (O.S.)
                         I'm working it! Nothing's happening!

                                     CHILDS
                         That's impossible, man! Okay, Clark, 
                         out of the john where I can see you!

                                     NAULS (O.S.)
                         It's shorted out or something!

                                     CHILDS
                              (shouting)
                         Clark, you come on out here!!

               Childs lights the tip of his torch, allowing him a strong 
               candlelight. Garry is no longer in the room.

                                     CHILDS
                         Where's... Where's Garry?

               Dr. Copper looks numbly at the empty seat next to him. Childs 
               finds the portable siren and blares it.

               EXT. COMPOUND

               MacReady, Palmer and Sanchez heed the call and head for the 
               compound.

               INT. REC ROOM

               Childs jerks his head around in different directions.

                                     CHILDS
                         Where are you, Garry? Don't you move 
                         an inch, Copper.
                              (shouts)
                         Nauls, bring me a goddamn flashlight!

               INT. KITCHEN

               Pitch black.

                                     NAULS
                         Somebody's taken it. I can't find 
                         it!

                                     CHILDS (O.S.)
                         Clark, you want me to come in after 
                         you?!

               INT. HALLWAY

               MacReady, Sanchez and Palmer come in from the outside.

               They bump into each other trying to get their bearings from 
               the lack of light. Palmer, the only one who seems to have 
               one, turns on his flashlight.

                                     MACREADY
                              (shouting)
                         What's happened?!

                                     NORRIS (O.S.)
                         MacReady, that you?

                                     MACREADY
                         Yeah!

                                     NORRIS (O.S.)
                         It's the generator I think! No power.

                                     MACREADY
                              (to Palmer)
                         Well, let's get down there.

                                     CHILDS (O.S.)
                         MacReady!

                                     MACREADY
                         What?

                                     CHILDS (O.S.)
                         Garry's missing!

                                     MACREADY
                              (to self)
                         Oh, shit!
                              (shouts)
                         Well, hang on!

                                     CHILDS (O.S.)
                         Gee, thanks!

               INT. GENERATOR ROOM

               Palmer and MacReady stumbling down the stairs. MacReady turns 
               around, looks.

                                     MACREADY
                         Where's Sanchez?

               Both look around. Sanchez is gone. Palmer's light finds the 
               motionless generator. He examines it.

                                     PALMER
                         The fuel pump... it's gone...
                              (frantic)
                         You've got to get up to supply, Mca. 
                         If we don't get this thing started 
                         soon, it'll freeze on us and we'll 
                         never get it going.

               MacReady dashes upstairs into the darkness.

               INT. HALLWAY

               The lab door is opened. Fuchs holding a small candle walks 
               out. As he passes, the shoulder of a man springs into frame.

               INT. GENERATOR ROOM

               Palmer is feverishly working underneath the generator on his 
               back.

               INT. REC ROOM

               The temperature continues to drop rapidly. Childs swats 
               himself to keep warm, while still keeping an eye on Dr. Copper 
               and the rest of the room.

               INT. HALLWAY

               MacReady rushes out of the supply room, with a fuel pump, 
               bumps into somebody.

                                     MACREADY
                         Who... Who is that?

               The silhouette moves on down the hallway.

                                     MACREADY
                         Sanchez...?  Hey, who...

                                     PALMER (O.S.)
                         Mac, where the hell is that pump!!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. GENERATOR ROOM

               MacReady holds the flashlight for Palmer. Their breath, puffs 
               of white smoke.

                                     PALMER
                         Somebody definitely messed with it.

                                     MACREADY
                         We going to make it?

                                     PALMER
                         Hope so. Another ten, fifteen minutes. 
                         What I don't get is...

               The sound of a screeching. From somewhere in the compound. 
               The two men's faces, locked in fear.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. REC ROOM

               The generator has been repaired; the lights within the 
               compound are back on.

               Grim and tense. Everyone is present but Fuchs. Eyes flit 
               from man to man. Palmer, Nauls and Sanchez are spread out 
               about the room, keeping as much distance as possible from 
               the rest.

               Norris and Childs are tying the Doctor, Clark and Garry to 
               the couch. MacReady prepares several makeshift blowtorches 
               as he kneels on the ground.

                                     SANCHEZ
                         Where were the flashlights?

                                     MACREADY
                         Screw the flashlights. Where the 
                         hell were you?

                                     PALMER
                         Tons of stuff's been missing around 
                         here. Magnetos, cables, wire...

                                     NAULS
                         Kitchen things, too...

                                     MACREADY
                         Anybody see Fuchs... or hear him...? 
                         Huh?

               No answer as the men's faces roam the room. Childs glares at 
               Garry as he begins to tie him in.

                                     CHILDS
                         Where'd you go?

               Garry's groggy features stare blankly.

                                     CHILDS
                         I said where? Where'd you go?!

                                     GARRY
                         Was dark... find a light...

                                     CHILDS
                         You lying bastard...

               Garry struggles to his feet, affronted.

                                     GARRY
                              (slurring)
                         I rather don't like your tone...

               He grabs Childs by the collar.

                                     CHILDS
                         You sit back down...

               Childs whales on him with a right hand. Both go tumbling 
               over the couch. MacReady and Norris dive in breaking it up.

                                     NORRIS
                         Enough...

               MacReady, furious, pulls Childs away.

               Norris breathing heavily from the activity, massages his 
               chest. The strong, stormy winds overhead batter the roofing. 
               MacReady glances up. He and Childs release each other.

                                     MACREADY
                         That storm's going to start ripping 
                         any minute -- so we don't have much 
                         time.

               He thrusts one of the blowtorches hard into Childs' stomach.

                                     MACREADY
                         We've got to find Fuchs. When we 
                         find him -- we kill him.

                                     SANCHEZ
                         Why?

                                     MACREADY
                         If he's one of those Things, we've 
                         got to get to him before he changes... 
                         Nauls, you and Childs and I'll check 
                         the outside shacks...

               He tosses torches to Sanchez and Palmer.

                                     MACREADY
                         Sanchez, you and Palmer search the 
                         inside...

                                     PALMER
                         I ain't going with Sanchez.

               Sanchez snaps his head toward Palmer. Palmer looks at the 
               others.

                                     PALMER
                         I ain't going with him. I'll go with 
                         Childs...

                                     SANCHEZ
                         Well, screw you, man!

                                     PALMER
                         I ain't going with you!

                                     CHILDS
                         Well, who says I want you going with 
                         me?!

                                     MACREADY
                         Cut the bullshit... Okay, Sanchez, 
                         you come with us. Norris... you stay 
                         here...
                              (refers to tied-up 
                              men)
                         Any of them move -- you fry 'em. And 
                         if you hear anything, anything at 
                         all you let loose the siren. We all 
                         meet back here in twenty minutes 
                         regardless.
                              (a beat)
                         And everybody watch whoever you're 
                         with. Real close.

               The men survey each other.

                                     MACREADY
                         Let's move.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. COMPOUND - NIGHT

               MacReady and Nauls, wearing their snowshoes and using flares 
               for light, pull themselves along the steadying rope that 
               leads to Blair's shed. They are careful to keep an eye on 
               each other as they move along.

               Sanchez heads off in the direction of another shack.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. COMPOUND - HALLWAY

               One of the many doors creak open. Childs and Palmer stealthily 
               move into the next corridor. Palmer falls a few steps behind.

                                     PALMER
                         What'd we ever do to these Things 
                         anyway...

               Childs freezes and snaps his head around facing Palmer. A 
               beat.

                                     PALMER
                         What?

                                     CHILDS
                         Don't walk behind me.

               Another beat.

                                     PALMER
                         Right.

               He moves to the other side of the wall, parallel with Childs. 
               They continue on, skimming along the sides of the corridor 
               in plain view of one another.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. COMPOUND

               Nauls and MacReady arrive at Blair's shack. They peer in 
               through the spaces between the boards.

               A weak light burns as Blair is seated eating out of a can. A 
               hangman's noose dangles from the ceiling nearby.

                                     MACREADY
                         Hey, Blair!!

               Blair jumps in fear, spilling his can.

                                     MACREADY
                         Has Fuchs been out here?

               Blair approaches the boarded-up window. He looks haggard and 
               afraid.

                                     BLAIR
                         I've changed my mind... I'd... I'd 
                         like to come back inside... I don't 
                         want to stay out here any more...  
                         Funny things... I hear funny things 
                         out here.

                                     MACREADY
                         Have you come across Fuchs?

                                     BLAIR
                         Fuchs...? No, it's not Fuchs... You 
                         must let me back in... I won't harm 
                         anyone... I promise...

                                     MACREADY
                         We'll see...

               He and Nauls trudges off. Blair shouts after them.

                                     BLAIR
                         I promise! I'm much better now! I'll 
                         be good!! I'm all better!! Don't 
                         leave me here!!

               INT. REC ROOM

               Norris continues his watch on the sedated trio. He anxiously 
               tries to keep an eye on the various entrances behind and in 
               front of him. He rubs his chest in pain.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         I'm getting worried about you. You 
                         ought to have a checkup.

                                     NORRIS
                         Let's just not get worried about 
                         anything just now.

                                     DR. COPPER
                              (yawning)
                         After all this mess then.

                                     NORRIS
                              (nodding)
                         After all this mess.

               EXT. COMPOUND - THE SLOPE TO MACREADY'S SHACK

               The winds are thick and vicious now. MacReady and Nauls pull 
               themselves along the rope fighting their way up the slope. A 
               violent gust sends MacReady's body horizontal, but still 
               hanging onto the rope. The wind slaps him back down. His 
               flare and torch tumble back toward Nauls.

               Nauls saves the torch from rolling down the hill.

               MacReady, lying vulnerable, watches Nauls pull his way toward 
               him. He tenses. Nauls reaches him. A beat. He hands back his 
               torch. Relieved, MacReady pulls himself upright.

               INT. COMPOUND - KITCHEN - CLOSE ON THICK POWER CABLES

               that line the wall. They have been torn apart. Childs and 
               Palmer examine.

                                     PALMER
                         Auxiliary light cables...? Been cut.

                                     CHILDS
                         Cut, bullshit. Been pulled apart.

               EXT. MACREADY'S SHACK

               as they reach the top. The remaining flare their only light. 
               Very dark. They stand on either side of the door. MacReady 
               shoves it open. Pitch black inside. MacReady flips the light 
               switch. Doesn't work.

               INT. SHACK

               They enter. Hunched. Torches ready. The place is a mess. The 
               winds as strong as on the outside.

               The single flare illuminating the ceiling. Almost all of the 
               corrugated, steel roofing is gone. As if ripped off.

                                     NAULS
                              (shouting to be heard)
                         Where's the roof?!

               MacReady stares up incredulous, as they advance through the 
               room.

                                     NAULS
                         This storm do that?

                                     MACREADY
                              (shouting)
                         Couldn't be possible. Must have 
                         weighted a ton and a half...

               Nauls kicks over a chair. A naked, fleshy object bounds high 
               into the air. Nauls thrusts out his torch, catching the 
               breasts of the inflatable woman. She pops and is sucked out 
               through the hole in the roof.

               Nauls tries to catch his breath.

                                     NAULS
                         Goddamn white women.

               INT. COMPOUND

               Underground, rickety corridor. Palmer stands by as Childs 
               undoes the many locks to the room that houses his plants.

               One by one. Palmer twists his head in every which direction. 
               Nervous.

               Childs pulls open the heavy door. A flush of snow and wind 
               push them back. They wedge their bodies at the entrance to 
               the lightless room.

                                     CHILDS
                         My babies.

               They enter. The light from the hall exposes the completely 
               smashed-in window high above the plants. The plants look 
               frozen.

                                     PALMER
                         Somebody broke in.

                                     CHILDS
                         Now who'd go and do...

               Saddened, angry, Childs goes to check the damage to his 
               plants. Palmer, his face set in horror, yanks him back.

                                     PALMER
                         Childs!!

                                     CHILDS
                         Let go of me...

                                     PALMER
                         Don't get near 'em. The plants! 
                         They're alive. Those things can 
                         imitate anything...

                                     CHILDS
                         What's it going to do, being a plant?

               Palmer readies his small torch.

                                     PALMER
                         We got to burn 'em.

                                     CHILDS
                         Now hold on, you dumb...

               Palmer sprays them with flame. Childs pushes him to the 
               ground, and tries to swat out the fire.

                                     CHILDS
                         You stupid, sonofa...

               Palmer, his mouth agape with terror, screams and points to 
               the closing door to their rear. Childs whirls.

               FUCHS

               One arm outstretched, swings into view. An ax, embedded deep 
               into his chest, pins his frozen body to the inside of the 
               door.

               INT. REC ROOM

               Norris startled by the scream, turns on the siren.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. PLANT ROOM

               Sanchez has joined Childs and Palmer. The body of Fuchs is 
               still pinned to the door. Sanchez tries to wrench the ax 
               loose. It is too deeply embedded and won't budge.

                                     SANCHEZ
                         Whoever put this through him...

               Sanchez observes Childs' hulking frame and adds pointedly:

                                     SANCHEZ
                         ...is one bad-ass and strong muther.

                                     CHILDS
                         No one's that strong, boy!

               INT. PASSAGEWAY

               Tracking with the three men. Opening and closing doors, as 
               they make their way back to the rec room. They keep their 
               distance from each other, watching each other while they 
               walk.

                                     PALMER
                         Why didn't it imitate Fuchs? Isn't 
                         that its number -- to get more 
                         recruits.

                                     CHILDS
                         Wasn't enough time. Generator was 
                         out, what...? Thirty minutes. Takes 
                         the bastards an hour, maybe two to 
                         absorb somebody.

                                     SANCHEZ
                         Why Fuchs?

                                     CHILDS
                         He was working on a test. Fuchs must 
                         have been onto something. These 
                         bastards got scared and got rid of 
                         him.
                              (suddenly realizing)
                         ...Hey... Where's...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. COMPOUND - CLOSE ON PALMER'S FACE

               shouting down a passageway.

                         Nauls!! MacReady!!

               EXT. COMPOUND

               A strong driftwind streams snow across the ground obscuring 
               everything but the very top of the buildings.

               The siren screams.

               INT. REC ROOM

               Rigid, immobile faces. Listening to the storm overhead.

                                     CHILDS
                         How long they been out now?

                         Forty... Forty-five minutes.

               Silence, as the uneasy eyes measure one another.

                                     CHILDS
                         We better start closing off the 
                         outside hatchways.

               VARIOUS ANGLES OF THE COMPOUND

               Childs, Sanchez and Palmer -- closing off and bolting the 
               entrances to the camp.

                                     NORRIS (O.S.)
                         All of you! Come here!

               INT. COMPOUND MAIN HALLWAY - POINT OF VIEW - THE MEN

               Through the fogged-up windows, a figure can be seen 
               approaching the main compound. It pulls and drags its way 
               along the guide rope, fighting the gale force winds.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE MEN

               weapons in hand, huddle at the main doorway. They unbolt it. 
               Sleet and hail send Nauls rolling in from the outside. The 
               men force the door back and lock it.

               The weary Nauls kneels on the floor and gasps for air.

               The others surround him.

                                     PALMER
                         Where's MacReady?

               Nauls weighs each of them ominously, while digging down 
               underneath his heavy jacket.

                                     NAULS
                         Cut him loose of the line up by his 
                         shack.

                                     CHILDS
                         Cut him loose?

                                     NAULS
                         When we were up poking around his 
                         place... I found this...

               He pulls out a thick bundle of heavy clothing. It is mutilated 
               and partially burned. He holds out the jacket to show the 
               inside collar.

               Close on name tag -- it reads: R.J. MACREADY The men, as 
               they examine in a hush.

                                     NAULS
                         ...It was stashed in his old coal 
                         furnace... wind must have dislodged 
                         it... I don't think he saw me find 
                         it.

               The men continue to examine in various states of disbelief.

                                     NAULS
                         ...Made sure I got ahead of him on 
                         the towline on the way back... cut 
                         him loose.

                                     SANCHEZ
                              (incredulous)
                         MacReady...?

                                     NAULS
                         He's one of them.

                                     SANCHEZ
                              (scared)
                         When do you think it got to him?

                                     PALMER
                         Could have been anytime. Anywhere.

                                     CHILDS
                              (to Nauls, suspicious)
                         If it did get to him.

                                     NAULS
                         Look, man...

                                     PALMER
                         When the lights went out...

                                     NORRIS
                         Would have been a perfect time...

                                     PALMER
                         Right. Garry was missing...
                              (pointedly)
                         ...And Sanchez...

                                     SANCHEZ
                              (goes for him)
                         Fuck you, Palmer.

               Childs and Norris separate them.

                                     NORRIS
                         This is just what it wants... to pit 
                         us against each other.

               A pounding at the door sends the men jerking backward.

               Nauls scampers to his feet. They tense.

                                     MACREADY (O.S.)
                         Open up!

               No answer as the men surround the door, their weapons ready.  
               Fear.

                                     MACREADY (O.S.)
                         ...Hey, somebody! Open up, it's me, 
                         MacReady...
                              (still nothing)
                         ...Come on, damn it... The towline 
                         snapped. Been crawling around like a 
                         seal out here...

                                     NAULS
                              (harsh whisper)
                         Bullshit! He's got to know damn well 
                         I cut it!

               The men keep their voices low.

                                     PALMER
                         Let's open it.

                                     CHILDS
                         Hell no.

               More pounding.

                                     SANCHEZ
                              (shaking)
                         You think he's changed into one of 
                         those Things?

                                     NORRIS
                         He hasn't had enough time.

                                     CHILDS
                         ...Nothing human could have made it 
                         back here in this weather without a 
                         guideline...

                                     MACREADY (O.S.)
                         ...Where is everybody?! I'm half 
                         frostbit!

                                     PALMER
                         Let's open it. Now...

                                     CHILDS
                              (edgy, hostile)
                         Why you so damn anxious to let him 
                         in here...

                                     PALMER
                              (slightly trembling)
                         He's so close. Maybe our best chance 
                         to blow him away.

                                     CHILDS
                         No. Just let him freeze out there.

                                     SANCHEZ
                              (voice cracking)
                         What if we're wrong about him?

                                     CHILDS
                         Then we're wrong.

               The muffled breaking of a window down the hall. The men turn.

                                     PALMER
                         The supply window!

                                     SANCHEZ
                              (terror)
                         What we going to...

                                     NORRIS
                         All right... all right... we've got 
                         no choice now...

               INT. SUPPLY ROOM

               Pitch black. MacReady's voice is heard cursing as he appears 
               to be stumbling around, looking for a light switch. He 
               responds to the muffled voices at the door.

                                     MACREADY
                         What's going on out there?

               HALLWAY

               Palmer stands by as Childs tries the knob. Locked.

                                     CHILDS
                         Damn it, he's got the keys.

               Childs rips a nearby fire ax off the wall and begins hacking 
               away at the door.

               INT. SUPPLY ROOM

                                     MACREADY
                         What are you doing?

                                     CHILDS (O.S.)
                         You're a dead man, MacReady -- or a 
                         dead whatever the hell you are!

               MacReady begins to rummage through the supplies in the 
               darkness.

                                     CHILDS (O.S.)
                         We found your clothes -- the ones 
                         you tried to burn.

                                     MACREADY
                         What clothes?

                                     CHILDS (O.S.)
                         You been made, MacReady.

               Childs chops away. MacReady desperately continues rummaging 
               through the supplies.

                                     MACREADY
                         Someone's trying to mark me, you 
                         bastard... trying to frame me.

               HALLWAY

               Childs cautions to Palmer as he prepares for one last blow.

                                     CHILDS
                         Move in slow now.

               Crunch. The door gives. The men move in. Their blow torches 
               ready. They freeze.

               MacReady stands before them holding a lighted flare. His 
               hair and clothing are covered with snow; his cheeks and nose 
               blackened by frostbite. Tucked under his arm is an entire 
               box of dynamite. He holds the flare dangerously close to the 
               open box.

                                     MACREADY
                         Anyone messes with me -- the whole 
                         camp goes.

               He appears to mean it. They don't seem anxious to test him.

                                     MACREADY
                         Put those torches on the floor and 
                         back off.

               They do. He follows them out into the hall.

               HALLWAY

               The men step backwards carefully.

                                     MACREADY
                         ...back way off.

               They heed, retreating further down the hall. MacReady glances 
               behind him.

                                     MACREADY
                         ...Where's the rest...

               Nauls and Norris, who have silently crept in through the 
               supply window, come flying through the hacked-up door and 
               barrel into MacReady. Both going straight for the flare.

               MacReady spins Nauls off and rips into Norris, sending him 
               crashing violently into the wall. Nauls tackles MacReady's 
               legs, pulling him to the floor.

               The others rush him. MacReady, still in control of the 
               dynamite and flare, bellow:

                                     MACREADY
                         So help me I mean it!!

               They skid to a halt. Nauls crawls away, quickly.

                                     NAULS
                         It's cool, man. We ain't near you, 
                         man... Stay cool...

                                     PALMER
                         Yeah, man, really. Just relax.

                                     MACREADY
                         Anybody touches me... we go.

               Norris, lying on the floor, coughs as if gasping for breath. 
               He quivers for a moment and then is still. Nauls crawls over 
               to him and shakes him. A beat.

                                     NAULS
                         I don't think he's breathing.

               Nauls listens to Norris' chest. MacReady stands.

                                     MACREADY
                         Go untie the Doc. Get him in here. 
                         Bring the others, too...
                              (grins menacingly)
                         From now on no one gets out of my 
                         sight.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. INFIRMARY

               Norris' body is plopped on the examination table. Copper 
               stumbles and is steadied by some of the men. MacReady 
               continues to keep his distance.

               Copper places an oxygen mask over Norris' face. He then rips 
               open his shirt.

                                     MACREADY
                         So you sweethearts had yourselves a 
                         little trial. I just may have to 
                         kill you on general principle, Nauls.

               Copper begins swathing Norris' chest with a gelatin substance.

                                     MACREADY
                         ...Ever occur to the jury that anybody 
                         could have gotten to some of my 
                         clothes and stuck them up...

                                     CHILDS
                         We ain't buying that.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Damn it, quit the bickering and give 
                         me a hand. Wheel that fibrillator 
                         over here.

               Sanchez pushes over the portable fibrillator. Copper climbs 
               up on the table and straddles Norris' chest.

               Unnoticed, Clark paws the contents of the instrument tray 
               behind his back.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Palmer, turn on that oxygen and hold 
                         the mask over his face... Childs, 
                         grab his shoulders.

               They do so. Copper holds electrical prongs over Norris' chest.

                                     CHILDS
                              (to MacReady, 
                              threatening)
                         You're going to have to sleep 
                         sometime.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Quiet down...
                              (to Sanchez)
                         ...turn that thing on.

               Sanchez depresses the "on" button.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Now hold him.

                                     MACREADY
                         I'm a real light sleeper, Childs...

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Enough, MacReady!

               Dr. Copper presses the prongs onto Norris' chest and shoots 
               a bolt of current. Norris' body heaves upward. A slight 
               crackling sound and an odd chirp through the oxygen mask.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Again... More current this time, 
                         Sanchez...

               Buzzz. Several more jolts from the prongs. Clark's hand has 
               found a scalpel. He gently lifts it out, bringing it to his 
               side.

                                     MACREADY
                         And if anyone tries to wake me...

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Damn you, MacReady!

               Norris' body begins bounding up. More crackling and popping. 
               His chest begins to break up and spread. The mask pops off -- 
               a hideous mewing escaping from Norris' distorted mouth.

               The men jump back, incredulous. Dr. Copper scrambles off his 
               chest and flops to the floor.

                                     SANCHEZ
                         God... what...?

               They watch on in stunned horror as The Thing that was Norris 
               begins to change, to spread awkwardly on the slab.

               Its clothes tearing. A shoe splits in half and falls to the 
               floor, exposing the beginnings of a talon.

               MacReady charges toward it, shooing the men off.

                                     MACREADY
                         Get out of the way!!

               He unloads with a stream of flame. The body writhes in pain, 
               belching and hissing. The slab catches fire. It struggles, 
               lunges for the floor, straightens up, and moves a few feet.

               A black and yellow substance rips through its trousers and 
               squirts to the floor. Norris' body collapses on the 
               fibrillating machine in flames. Extinguishers are ripped 
               from the walls and put to work.

               MacReady watches the smoking particles of ooze in fascination, 
               as they twitch and mew on the floor.

               Within seconds the fire is out. The men stand around in awe 
               as they look upon The Thing that was once Norris.

               MacReady continues to observe the small particles. Their 
               tiny squeals abating into silence.

               INT. REC ROOM

               MacReady, still carrying the industrial torch, has maneuvered 
               all the men into the room. He holds Garry's .44. He has 
               untaped the explosives from his chest and laid them on the 
               nearby table next to two more boxes of dynamite.

                                     CLARK
                         What you got in mind, MacReady?

                                     MACREADY
                         A little test.

                                     PALMER
                         What kind of test?

                                     MACREADY
                         I'm sure a lot of you already know.

               He tosses a ream of steel cable and some rope to Palmer.

                                     MACREADY
                         Palmer, you and Copper tie everyone 
                         down. Real tight.

                                     CHILDS
                         What for?

                                     MACREADY
                         For your health.

                                     GARRY
                              (to others)
                         Let's rush him. He's not going to 
                         blow us all up.

                                     MACREADY
                         Damn if I won't.

                                     CHILDS
                              (a beat)
                         You ain't tying me up.

                                     MACREADY
                         Then I'll have to kill you.

                                     CHILDS
                         Then kill me.

               MacReady points the .44 at Childs' head.

                                     MACREADY
                         I mean it.

               MacReady cocks his gun. Childs holds his ground.

                                     CHILDS
                         I guess you do.

               A beat. Clark springs for MacReady. Scalpel raised.

               MacReady spins and fires three shots, point-blank, the forces 
               of the charges sending Clark flying backwards. The others, 
               themselves about to pounce, stop -- as MacReady whirls the 
               torch and gun back toward them.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE MEN

               being tied securely to couches and chairs.

                                     MACREADY
                         Tie up Clark, too.

                                     PALMER
                              (bemused)
                         He's dead.

                                     MACREADY
                         Norris looked pretty dead, himself. 
                         Bullets don't kill these Things.

               MacReady turns on a Bunsen burner while he cuts the rubber 
               covering off an electrical cord, exposing the copper wire.

               All the while, he keeps his eye on the men.

                                     CHILDS
                              (muttering)
                         We should have jumped his ass.

                                     MACREADY
                         Now Copper, you tie Palmer up.

               Copper starts to tie Palmer to the small couch next to Childs 
               and Garry.

                                     MACREADY
                         We're going to draw a little bit of 
                         everybody's blood.

                                     NAULS
                         What are you going to do? Drink it?

                                     MACREADY
                         Watching Norris in there... gave me 
                         the idea that maybe every part of 
                         you bastards is a whole. Every piece 
                         of you is self-sufficient, an animal 
                         unto itself. When a man bleeds it's 
                         just tissue. But blood from one of 
                         you Things won't obey. It's a newly 
                         formed individual with a built-in 
                         desire to protect its own life. When 
                         attacked, your blood will try and 
                         survive -- and crawl away from a hot 
                         needle say.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               SANCHEZ

               grimacing as Dr. Copper pinches a scalpel to his thumb and 
               collects a small portion of his blood in a dish.

               All the men have been tied up. Palmer, Childs and Garry on 
               the small couch. The others, including the lifeless corpse 
               of Clark, in chairs.

               Copper returns the plate to the table and sets it down in 
               line with the other plates of blood that he has collected.

               The names of each man have been scribbled onto the plates.

               MacReady slides the Doctor a fresh plate.

                                     MACREADY
                         Now you.

               Copper cuts his thumb, his blood dribbles onto the plate.

               He stands nervously for a beat.

                                     MACREADY
                         Slide it back here.

               Copper pushes it toward MacReady.

                                     MACREADY
                         Now step way back.

               Copper steps backward, moisture beginning to collect on his 
               brow. MacReady begins to heat the copper wire over the Bunsen 
               burner.

               The men watch intently. The wire begins to glow. MacReady 
               points the torch directly at the Doctor. Both of them 
               perspiring. MacReady lifts the glowing wire from the flame. 
               The Doctor is dead still. MacReady slowly touches the wire 
               to the Doctor's plate. A soft hiss.

               MacReady heats it again and tries once more. The same soft 
               hiss. MacReady and the Doctor both let out a sigh.

                                     MACREADY
                         I guess you're okay.

                                     DR. COPPER
                              (shaken, facetious)
                         Thank you.

                                     MACREADY
                         I didn't think you'd use that 
                         fibrillator on Norris if you were 
                         one of them.

               He hands Copper the torch.

                                     MACREADY
                         Watch them.

               He cuts himself with the scalpel and begins collecting his 
               own blood.

                                     MACREADY
                         Now I'll show you what I already 
                         know.

               He heats the wire and puts it to his plate. The same harmless 
               hissing. All eyes continue to watch as he tries again. The 
               same result. Childs mumbles.

                                     CHILDS
                         Load of bullshit.

                                     MACREADY
                         We'll see. Let's try Clark.

               He heats the wire and lays it in Clark's dish. The hissing.

                                     CHILDS
                         So Clark was human, huh?

               MacReady nods.

                                     CHILDS
                         So that make you a murderer.

               MacReady glances over the group.

                                     MACREADY
                         Palmer now.

               He sets Palmer's plate in front of him and heats the wire.

                                     GARRY
                         Pure nonsense. This won't prove a 
                         damn thing.

                                     MACREADY
                         Thought you'd feel that way, Garry. 
                         You were the only one who could have 
                         gotten to that blood plasma...
                              (placing the wire in 
                              Palmer's dish)
                         ...we'll do you last...

               Screech!!! The blood howls, trying to crawl off the plate.

               Palmer bolts forward with incredible force, racing for 
               MacReady; his face splitting; his mouth roaring -- dragging 
               the couch, Childs and Garry with him. He smashes into MacReady 
               knocking him over the table.

                                     MACREADY
                         Copper!!

               It's all happened too fast. Copper tries to get off a burst 
               of flame. The ever-changing Palmer breaks his bonds and leaps 
               on the Doctor.

               The others sit helpless, struggling at their bindings.

               MacReady dives on Palmer's back and the three go rolling to 
               the floor. Screeching. Crackling. MacReady pounds viciously 
               at Palmer's head. A powerful, shirt-splitting arm sends him 
               skidding across the floor.

               Copper momentarily has control of the torch. Just as he 
               positions it, Palmer's mouth splits from his chin to his 
               forehead and engulfs the entirety of the Doctor's head.

               The big torch slaps against the wall. Palmer bounds to his 
               feet, wrapping his arms around the dangling, struggling body 
               of Dr. Copper.

               The men are screaming hysterically. MacReady tries to fire 
               up the bruised torch. Busted. Won't work.

               Frustrated, he charges up behind Palmer and begins hammering 
               the thick steel instrument over his head.

               The shirt of Palmer's back erupts in MacReady's face.

               Splitting and ripping wildly, exposing the beginnings of yet 
               another orifice. A blackened, iron-strong tongue lunges 
               outward. Stunned, MacReady manages to elude it, diving for 
               the top of the table by the boxes of dynamite.

               MacReady lights the fuse of a thick roll and bounds from the 
               table. Palmer awkwardly spins in circles, swinging the 
               Doctor's body like a propeller blade, struggling to keep on 
               balance, as he advances on MacReady. The second orifice, 
               spitting and snarling as it continues to take form.

               MacReady waits until Palmer's back spins around, facing him. 
               Only two yards away, MacReady flings his lit roll into the 
               ever-evolving second mouth and leaps onto the couch covering 
               Childs and Garry with his body.

               A muffled boom, as the swallowed explosive ignites from deep 
               within Palmer and sends his flesh splattering all over the 
               room. MacReady rolls away from Childs and Garry as fast as 
               he can.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               MACREADY

               perspiring profusely, his hand trembling slightly, prepares 
               to continue the test. He heats the wire.

               The men are pouring sweat, white-knuckled.

               One of the smaller torches is pointed at Nauls. He closes 
               his eyes. MacReady places the heated wire into his plate. 
               Hiss. MacReady exhales. Nauls opens his eyes.

               MacReady unties Nauls with one hand, while the torch stays 
               glued to the others.

               MacReady heats the wire once again. Both he and Nauls have 
               torches aimed at Sanchez. Sanchez is near tears.

               The wire is dipped into the plate... Hisssss.

               Sanchez breaks down and sobs.

               CHILDS

               sits stoicly, while he watches the preparations for his turn.

                                     CHILDS
                         Let's do it, Bwana.

               Nauls and Sanchez take aim five yards away. Fierce, 
               determined. The wire comes off the flame into the plate... 
               the harmless hissing.

               The muscles in Childs' face melt into a sigh.

                                     CHILDS
                         Muthafu...

               ALL EYES

               snap towards station manager Garry. Childs, suddenly realizing 
               who he is sitting next to, squirms.

                                     CHILDS
                         Get me... get me the hell away from... 
                         cut me loose, damn it!

               Nauls rips away his bindings. The other two stand guard.

               Childs scrambles off the couch and onto the floor.

               GARRY

               stares grimly ahead. Childs soaks his clothing with a can of 
               gasoline. He is then surrounded. The room tenses, adrenalin 
               pumps, breathing halts.

               The burner. The torches. The wire. The plate. Garry's face.

               Hisssss.

               MacReady tries again. Hiss. The men breathe. Their torches 
               are lowered. Nauls throws his on the floor.

               Sanchez and Childs flop down in chairs. MacReady wipes his 
               face.

               A long silence. Sanchez weeps quietly with relief.

                                     GARRY
                         I know you gentlemen have been through 
                         a lot. But when you find the time... 
                         I'd rather not spend the rest of the 
                         winter tied to this couch.

               A beat. Childs starts to giggle. The strain on MacReady's 
               jaw begins to lessen. Garry sits catatonic. Nauls scowls at 
               Childs' uncontrollable laughter.

               The infectious rasping causes MacReady a slight smile as he 
               looks up, taking comfort in the sound of the raging Antarctic 
               wind vibrating the roof. Nauls, untying Garry, grumbles, at 
               Childs.

                                     NAULS
                         Shut the damn hell up.

               Childs wipes his eyes and grins over toward MacReady. His 
               smile fades, MacReady is now stone-faced. Childs' grin goes 
               stale, in sudden realization.

                                     MACREADY
                              (almost a whisper)
                         Blair...

               EXT. COMPOUND - NIGHT

               The wind rumbles. The storm is at its peak. MacReady, Childs 
               and Nauls, guided by their flares, pull themselves along the 
               steadying rope, headed, for Blair's shack.

               BLAIR'S SHACK

               The door is wide open. They pause by the entrance, trying to 
               balance against the wind. They enter.

               INT. BLAIR'S SHACK

               Empty. A few of the floorboards are loosened. They pull them 
               up. They stare down into a large hole beneath the planking. 
               Something is down there. They pull up more boards.

               The hole is some fifteen feet deep. Its dimensions are the 
               same as the shack. Its space is almost completely taken up 
               by some strange metallic object.

               Crudely fashioned, a patchwork job, but streamlined.

               Sheets of corrugated steel are visible; but cut apart and 
               welded into the desired shapes. The object appears to be 
               unfinished.

                                     NAULS
                         What is it?

                                     MACREADY
                         Everything that's been missing.

                                     CHILDS
                         Spaceship of some kind.

                                     MACREADY
                         Smart S.O.B. He put it together piece 
                         by piece.

                                     NAULS
                         Where was he trying to go?

                                     MACREADY
                         Anyplace but here.

               MacReady pulls out a dozen tightly wrapped sticks of dynamite.

                                     MACREADY
                         But he ain't going to make it.

               Far off, amidst the howling gale -- the screeching. The men 
               jump. MacReady lights the fuse, as they make it to the exit. 
               He tosses it in.

               EXT. COMPOUND ALONG THE ROPE

               The explosion echoes behind them. The men pull along. Their 
               heads jerk in circles, searching into the blackness.

               Some twenty yards to their rear something swooshes down, 
               severing the line. The wind sends the men tumbling along the 
               ice. Childs loosens the line and is blown away, rolling out 
               of sight.

               MacReady and Nauls have lost their torches. They pull 
               feverishly along the ground trying to make it to the compound.

               The screeching closes in behind them. MacReady loses his 
               grip on the rope and is blown toward the main building.

               He crawls along looking for an opening.

               Nauls slides near the outside entrance to the dog kennel.

               He climbs down through the open stairwell.

               INT. PLANT ROOM

               MacReady has found the broken window. He rolls through it, 
               landing on the frozen plants below. Something smashes at the 
               glass above his head, trying to get in. He sprints for the 
               door. Fuchs' frozen body is still pinned to it with the ax. 
               MacReady grapples with the stiff torso which blocks the knob.

               He finally gets it open and lets himself out, slamming and 
               locking the door from the hall. Fuchs' body swings eerily, 
               back and forth.

               INT. HALLWAY

               MacReady charges up the stairs from the plant room. He zooms 
               down the twisting corridors, opening and closing doors. He 
               rounds a bend and crashes into Nauls coming the other way.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. REC ROOM - CLOSE ON SANCHEZ

               pouring gasoline into empty bottles, preparing Molotov 
               cocktails.

               Garry is connecting an electrical device: wires attached to 
               two portable generators. MacReady appears to be injecting 
               something into empty contact capsules. The men work 
               feverishly.

               Nauls rushes in with another box of dynamite.

                                     NAULS
                         What about Childs?

                                     MACREADY
                         Forget about Childs. He's over.

               Nauls begins cutting the wicks off the dynamite.

                                     GARRY
                         Make 'em short. They'll go off quicker 
                         if we need to use them.

               The wind belts into the roofing overhead. Garry sets the 
               wiring to the main doorway. MacReady begins blocking off one 
               of the other entrances with a large computer.

                                     SANCHEZ
                         What if it doesn't come?

                                     MACREADY
                         It'll come. It needs us. We're the 
                         only thing left to imitate...
                              (to Sanchez)
                         Give me a hand.

               They block off a door with two heavy electrical games.

                                     MACREADY
                              (to Sanchez)
                         You and Nauls got to block off the 
                         west side bunks, the mess hall and 
                         the kitchen.

                                     NAULS
                              (protest)
                         You crazy? He might be inside already?

                                     MACREADY
                         Chance we got to take. We got to 
                         force him to come down the east side 
                         to the door we got rigged.

               Nauls starts lacing his skates.

                                     SANCHEZ
                         He might just wait us out.

                                     MACREADY
                         I'm going to blow the generator when 
                         you get back. He'll have to come for 
                         us -- or freeze.

               MacReady further barricades the door with small couch.

                                     MACREADY
                         We've got portable heaters -- we'll 
                         last longer.

               Sanchez and Nauls start to leave.

                                     MACREADY
                         ...Hold it.

               He dispenses the capsules.

                                     MACREADY
                         Sodium cyanide. We place them between 
                         our cheeks and gums... This Thing 
                         can't imitate anything that's dead.

               A grim silence.

                                     MACREADY
                         If it gets a hold of you -- bite 
                         down... They're supposed to be fast 
                         and painless... Now move.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CORRIDOR

               Sanchez and Nauls inch their way through.

               INT. REC ROOM

               MacReady rips linen, soaks the strips in gas, and stuffs 
               them in the Molotov bottles. Garry tests the current on the 
               door. Popping, sparks, smoke.

                                     MACREADY
                         Looks good.

                                     GARRY
                         One thousand volts. Should be enough.

               INT. KITCHEN

               Nauls pushes a stove, reinforcing a locked door. Five yards 
               away, Sanchez maneuvers the refrigerator in front of another 
               outlet.

               Sanchez hears a quiet purring, bubbling sound. He turns to 
               Nauls.

                                     SANCHEZ
                         You hear that?

                                     NAULS
                         Hear what?

               A blaring. They whip their attention to stereo speakers on 
               either side of the kitchen. Rock music screams out. Top 
               volume.

               INT. REC ROOM

               The same loud music. MacReady and Garry look to the three 
               speakers attached to the walls. MacReady yells his 
               incomprehension to Garry. Garry tries to respond. Their voices 
               drowned out.

               INT. HALLWAY

               Empty. Another of the stereo speakers that line the walls, 
               thunders.

               INT. KITCHEN

               Nauls, in sudden realization, screams over the din and points 
               back in the direction they came.

                                     NAULS
                         It's got into the pub! It's turned 
                         on the stereo!

                                     SANCHEZ
                         What?!

                                     NAULS
                         It's in between us and them!! How we 
                         going to get back?!

                                     SANCHEZ
                         I can't hear you.

               INT. REC ROOM

               MacReady, cursing, rips the speakers off the wall.

                                     MACREADY
                         What are they doing out there?!

               The music is now subdued within the room, but continues 
               booming throughout the camp. Nauls' scream can be barely 
               heard.

                                     GARRY
                         What's he saying?

               INT. KITCHEN - NAULS

               at the top of his lungs...

                                     NAULS
                         MacReady! We been cut off!!

               A sharp, red, talon-like fingernail, pierces the top of the 
               door above Nauls' head. It saws downward, quickly.

               Black goo drips through the slit. The sawing obscured by the 
               music.

               Sanchez, eyes bulging, points. Nauls turns. A claw rips 
               through the wood. Nauls dives to the floor.

               In the opposite direction, behind Sanchez, another arm splits 
               through the door and the refrigerator, extends itself five 
               feet and yanks Sanchez back as if he were a puppet.

               Sanchez struggles, looking imploringly at Nauls. He bites 
               down on his capsule. Nauls takes off like a speed skater.

               INT. REC ROOM

               The sound of the screeching over the music.

                                     MACREADY
                         Got to get to the generator.

               He opens the door. Looks down the hall. No one. The speakers -- 
               blaring music.

               NAULS

               full speed down the maze. Left. Right. Totally reckless. He 
               hits a straightaway.

               SANCHEZ'S BODY

               from out of nowhere, blasts through the hallway wall, directly 
               in Nauls' path. A thick arm pins the body to the other side. 
               Unable to stop, Nauls skids out of control, banging into the 
               sides of the wall, his cyanide capsule flying out of his 
               mouth.

               Whatever the rest of it is, it starts to crumble through the 
               wall. Nauls dives over the arm, somersaults to his feet and 
               takes off.

               INT. MAIN HALL

               MacReady, running, spots Nauls careening out of a turn, 
               heading toward him.

                                     NAULS
                         Get back!!

                                     MACREADY
                         The generator!

                                     NAULS
                         Screw the generator!!

               Nauls blazes by him. MacReady hears the snarls and screeches 
               heading his way. He streaks after Nauls.

               INT. REC ROOM

               They make it in. Lock the door... MacReady tries to catch 
               his breath. Nauls shakes, pants.

                                     NAULS
                         Got Sanchez... World War Three 
                         wouldn't mess with this fucker...  
                         Can go through walls... And it's 
                         like all over the place...

                                     MACREADY
                         Calm down and get in your position.

                                     NAULS
                         Position, my ass...

               Garry fiddles with the two generators.

                                     GARRY
                         I'm going to bump this up, much as I 
                         can.

                                     NAULS
                         Boulder Dam might do it.

               The loud music in the compound is turned off. MacReady shuts 
               off the lights. The men spread out. Silence.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. REC ROOM

               The men watch all the doors. Dead silence. Dark. Whispers.

                                     GARRY
                         How long's it been?

                                     MACREADY
                         Little over two hours.

                                     NAULS
                         Maybe it ain't coming.

                                     MACREADY
                         Then we go after him.

                                     NAULS
                         Bet the last place you ever go.

               The sound of a door opening and closing. Far off.

               Another creaking door is opened. A rustling. Still far off. 
               MacReady and Nauls spread further apart.

               The soft bubbling, cooling sound. A slight scratch at the 
               door. Garry's hand tightens around the generator switches. 
               The scratching gets more pronounced. MacReady cautions Garry 
               with a whisper.

                                     MACREADY
                         Wait...

               The door begins to pound from the outside. Nauls and MacReady 
               light two cocktails each.

               The door booms. The room's foundations shake. The ceiling 
               quivers. The gas bombs are cocked.

               From the roof The Thing roars down into their midst.

               Stunned, the men stumble back. MacReady throws his gas bomb. 
               Nauls the same.

               For a moment it stands silhouetted in flame. Enormous.

               Grotesque.

               Garry bolts for the main door. The Thing's tongue spirals 
               from his mouth and spears him. The good two-thirds of its 
               body follows its tongue and engulfs Garry by the door.

               Another leg slaps Nauls to the ground. MacReady dodges still 
               another appendage, dives on the generators and throws the 
               switch.

               The current rips through the door. Garry dies instantly.

               One of The Thing's talons, still caught in the door, sends 
               it writhing in pain. It literally rips the door from its 
               latchings and pounds it to the ground, trying to shake it 
               loose. Nauls, hobbles, scrambles, out of the opening.

               MacReady dives through the window and out into the storm.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. COMPOUND - HALL

               The distant sound of a motor. Nauls, battered and bloodied, 
               his leg apparently broken, crawls along the ground. Another 
               sound, a bubbling and gurgling is heard well to his rear. 
               But closing.

               The terror forces him to drag faster, oblivious to the pain.

               He reaches the bathroom stall. Crawls in. Locks it. The 
               gurgling nears. Leaning on the toilet seat, he looks about 
               himself, frantically.

               The Presence pauses at the door. A scratching. Nauls paws, 
               rips at a cracked and weathered slab of wood, cutting his 
               fingers as he tries to break it off the siding.

               A strong blow begins to breach the stall door. Nauls finally 
               unhinges the piece of wood, brings the jagged end to one 
               side of his throat and rips...

               INT. LAB WALL

               The motorized rumbling nears. The wall seems to explode. The 
               tractor barrels into the lab. Its enormous shovel scooper 
               tearing half the room to shreds.

               MacReady drives. His eyes glint like a wild man's; he looks 
               stark raving mad.

               His frostbite, now in an advanced stage, resembles black war 
               paint. He clenches a stick of dynamite between his teeth, 
               like a buccaneer's cutlass. Two large, compressed air tanks 
               have been tied together at the top and are draped around his 
               neck. They are marked -- HYDROGEN.

               They are used for the weather balloons.

               He pulls the tractor to a stop, yanks the stick from his 
               mouth, grins and bellows.

                                     MACREADY
                         Okay, creep! Just you and me now! Be 
                         on your toes! We're going to do a 
                         little remodeling!

               MacReady guns it through the next wall and into the infirmary. 
               Medical equipment goes flying. The machine is powerful; the 
               prefabricated walls buckling under its force.

               INT. COMPOUND

               A trail of viscous yellow ooze leads around a bend.

               Boom.

               MacReady rams into the mess hall, sweeping away tables, 
               chairs. He sings out loud the lyrics of some Mexican song. 
               All the while he keeps his eyes on everything.

               Through the kitchen. The foundation is crumbling. He sings 
               on.

               NARROW PASSAGEWAY

               Gurgling and hissing. A taloned arm slinks around a corner 
               in retreat.

                                     MACREADY (O.S.)
                         Chime in if you know that words, old 
                         boy.

               MACREADY

               plows through several more rooms before ending up in the pub 
               area. He backs it up and retrieves a bottle of liquor from 
               the bar.

                                     MACREADY
                         You like whiskey? Come on, join me 
                         for a drink. Be good for you. Grow 
                         fangs on your chest.

               He takes a drink and rams through another wall.

               INT. REC ROOM

               The tractor blazes into the rec room. MacReady parks it 
               directly in front of the hole in the roof, created by The 
               Thing when it surprised them earlier.

                                     MACREADY
                         Damn it, ran out of gas.

               He pulls off the heavy hydrogen tanks and drapes them over 
               the tractor. As he talks his eyes move like a hawk passing 
               from roof, to doorways, to rubble.

               Wind and ice bristle through the gaping holes, stinging 
               MacReady with the cold. He winces at his mittenless, blackened 
               fingers.

                                     MACREADY
                         Sweetheart, it's going to get mighty 
                         cold in here soon... You better make 
                         your move... I mean, hell, I'm only 
                         one person...

               He takes a swig from his bottle.

                                     MACREADY
                         I know you're bugged because we ruined 
                         your trip, right? Spiffy little toy 
                         you had there.

               A slight tremor perks his eyes and ears. He looks up through 
               the hole, then around. He lights a lighter and cups it in 
               his hand near the stick of dynamite in his lap.

                                     MACREADY
                         But your real hang up is your looks...

               A stronger tremor. The adrenalin pumps.

                                     MACREADY
                              (wants him bad)
                         Atta boy. I know you're around.

               The floor shakes. MacReady stands, his head whirling around 
               the room.

                                     MACREADY
                         Come on, sucker.

               The tractor inches up off the ground. MacReady falls forward 
               and looks straight down through the chassis and into the 
               vile and grinning face below. A claw flashes up, splitting 
               the steering wheel but missing his face.

               He depresses the ignition, bolting the tractor ten feet.

               He jumps, hanging onto the edge of the hole in the ceiling. 
               The Thing's face and arms burst through the metal plating of 
               the tractor. The reaching claws just miss him as he pulls 
               himself through.

               EXT. ROOF

               He lights his fuse, drops in the stick, turns and runs.

               Half of The Thing's grotesque and angular torso bolts up 
               through the hole, howling in fury. An appendage springs 
               outward and winds around MacReady's jacket, hissing like 
               acid into the fabric.

               An immense explosion. The hydrogen tanks send a white fireball 
               fifty feet into the sky. The Thing's body disintegrating 
               almost immediately.

               The force of the blast sweeps MacReady off the roof. He and 
               the severed appendage crash to the hard ice in flames. He 
               rolls over and over trying to smother the fire and tear off 
               the insidious limb.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CAMP

               A ruin. One half of it burnt almost to the ground.

               MacReady wears a thick blanket which covers him like a shroud, 
               from his shoulders to the floor.

               He walks bent over and in much pain, trying to blunt patches 
               of fire with an extinguisher. It is futile. He gives up.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. PUB AREA

               Mostly untouched by the fire, but like most of the rest of 
               the camp, exposed to the outside. The storm has settled 
               considerably.

               CLOSE ON MACREADY

               lighting a cigar. His hands are heavily wrapped. He pours 
               himself a drink.

               A puffy white hand, missing two fingers, enters the frame 
               and whirls a startled MacReady around. It is Childs.

               White and black blotches cover his frostbitten face.

                                     CHILDS
                         Did you kill it?

               He looks as weak as MacReady. A beat.

                                     MACREADY
                         I think so.

                                     CHILDS
                         What do you mean "you think so?"

               Both men speak guardedly and stare at each other suspiciously.

                                     MACREADY
                         Yeah. I got it.
                              (refers to Childs' 
                              condition)
                         Pretty mean frostbite.

               Childs steps back, keeping his distance. He indicates his 
               puffy white hand.

                                     CHILDS
                         It'll turn black again soon enough. 
                         Then I guess I'll be losing the whole 
                         thing...
                              (refers to feet)
                         ...Think my toes are already gone.

               MacReady, carrying the bottle and glass, limps over and sits 
               down behind a gaming table. There is a chess set and several 
               decks of cards. The two men continue to eye each other.

                                     CHILDS
                         So you're the only one who made it.

               MacReady begins setting up a non-electronic chessboard.

                                     MACREADY
                         Not the only one.

                                     CHILDS
                         The fire's got the temperature way 
                         up all over camp... won't last long 
                         though.

                                     MACREADY
                         Neither will we.

                                     CHILDS
                         Maybe we should try and fix the 
                         radio... try and get some help.

                                     MACREADY
                         Maybe we shouldn't.

                                     CHILDS
                         Then we'll never make it.

               MacReady puffs on his cigar. He reveals a small blowtorch 
               from under the table and places it beside him on top.

                                     MACREADY
                         Maybe we shouldn't make it.

                                     CHILDS
                              (beat)
                         If you're worried about anything, 
                         let's take that blood test of yours.

                                     MACREADY
                         If we've got any surprises for each 
                         other -- we shouldn't be in any 
                         condition to do anything about it.
                              (beat)
                         You play chess?

               They regard each other for a moment. Childs painfully sits 
               down across from MacReady.

                                     CHILDS
                         I guess I'll be learning.

               MacReady grins and hands the bottle to Childs. Childs smiles 
               back and takes a healthy swig.

               EXT. COMPOUND - NIGHT

               The fires smolder on. Bright embers dance in the blackness -- 
               pushed by the soughing wind.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

          FADE IN:

          On the blackness of SPACE, beautiful and mysterious, strewn
          with a billion stars.
          Atop a building, a wrought-iron sign -- a HAMMER-WIELDING
          BLACKSMITH -- spins listlessly in the wind as a swirling
          breeze kicks up. A hint of what's to come.

          1 EXT. PUENTE ANTIGUO, NEW MEXICO - NIGHT 1

          A main street extends before us in this one-horse town, set
          amid endless flat, arid scrubland. A large SUV slowly moves
          down the street and heads out of town.

          2 EXT. SUV - NIGHT 2

          The SUV sits parked in the desert. Suddenly, the roof panels
          of the SUV FOLD OPEN. The underside of the panels house a
          variety of hand-built ASTRONOMICAL DEVICES, which now point
          at the sky.
          JANE FOSTER (late 20's) pops her head through the roof. She
          positions a MAGNETOMETER, so its monitor calibrates with the
          constellations above. It appears to be cobbled together from
          spare parts of other devices.

                         JANE
          Hurry!
          We hear a loud BANG followed by muffled CURSING from below.
          Jane offers a hand down to ERIK SELVIG (60) who emerges as
          well, rubbing his head.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          Oh-- watch your head.

                         SELVIG
          Thanks. So what's this "anomaly"
          of yours supposed to look like?

                         JANE
          It's a little different each time.
          Once it looked like, I don't know,
          melted stars, pooling in a corner
          of the sky. But last week it was a
          rolling rainbow ribbon--

                         SELVIG

                         (GENTLY TEASING)
          "Racing "round Orion?" I've always
          said you should have been a poet.
          Jane reigns in her excitement. She tries for dignity.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 1A.

                         JANE
          Hey, Darcy. Pass up the bubbly and
          my gloves, will you?
          Intern DARCY LEWIS (20) hands Jane a bottle of Champagne and
          a pair of gloves through the window. Jane passes it to
          Selvig to hold while she pulls on the old gloves -- too large
          and masculine for her small hands. He starts to unwrap the
          foil, and she stops his hand with an excited grin.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          Not until you see it!

                         SELVIG
          (re: the gloves)
          I recognize those. Think how proud
          he'd be to see you now.
          Jane's grin fades to a sad smile.

                         JANE
          Thank you.

                         SELVIG
          For what?

                         JANE
          The benefit of the doubt.
          The two stare out at the sky expectantly. A long beat while
          they scan the skies. Nothing. Jane's worried.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 2.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          It's never taken this long before.
          Darcy calls up from the front seat.

          DARCY (O.S.)
          Can I turn on the radio?

                         JANE
          (an edge to her voice)
          Sure, if you like rocking out to
          KFRM, "All agriculture, all the
          time."
          Worried, Jane heads back down into the vehicle.

          3 INT. SUV - NIGHT 3

          The SUV is bathed in the glow of high-tech monitoring
          equipment and laptops, some looking like they're held
          together with duct tape. Jane opens a well-worn NOTEBOOK of
          handwritten notes and calculations. Selvig watches the
          frustrated Jane with sympathy.

                         JANE
          The anomalies are always
          precipitated by geomagnetic storms.
          She shows him a complicated CHART she's drawn in the book,
          tracking occurrences and patterns.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          The last seventeen occurrences have
          been predictable to the minute... I
          just don't understand.
          Something catches Darcy's eye out the driver's side mirror.
          She adjusts it. In the distance, ODD GLOWING CLOUDS form in
          the skies over the Northeastern end of the desert.

                         DARCY
          Jane?
          Jane SHUSHES her, leafs through her notes. The bottle of
          champagne begins to vibrate.

                         JANE
          There's got to be some new
          variable... Or an equipment
          malfunction...
          The lights and equipment in the SUV begin to FLICKER around
          them. The computer monitors SQUELCH with static.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 2A.

                         DARCY
          I don't think there's anything
          wrong with your equipment...
          The champagne bottle starts to RATTLE noisily now as it
          shakes more violently. Jane and Selvig notice.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 3.
          They watch it curiously, pressure building up inside it, when
          the cork EXPLODES out of it. Champagne goes spewing
          everywhere -- over equipment, over Jane.

          DARCY (CONT'D)
          Jane?

                         JANE
          What?!

                         DARCY
          I think you want to see this.
          Darcy points out the window. Jane and Selvig look out. Over
          the desert --

          MASSIVE CLOUDS OF RAINBOW LIGHT
          Churn in the sky. The three stare, dumbfounded.

                         JANE
          Holy. Shatner.

                         SELVIG
          That's your "subtle" aurora?!

                         JANE
          No-- yes! Let's go!

          4 EXT. DESERT - MOMENTS LATER 4

          The roof panels still open, the SUV races towards the strange
          event, Jane, amazed by the sight, stands with half her body
          out the roof, taking video of the light storm before them.
          The SUV hits a bump. Jane nearly flies out. Selvig grabs
          her, yanks her back in.

          5 INT. SUV 5

          Jane grins, thrilled, pumped with adrenaline.

                         JANE
          Isn't this great?!
          A thought strikes her.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          You're seeing it too, right? I'm
          not crazy?

                         SELVIG
          That's debateable. Put your seat
          belt on!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 3A.
          The SUV lurches.

          6 EXT. DESERT 6

          Winds HOWL around the SUV now. Up ahead, spiraling down from
          out of the clouds comes --

          AN ENORMOUS TORNADO
          Suffuse with the strange rainbow light, ROARING like a
          thousand freight trains as it touches down.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 4.

          7 INT. SUV 7

          Selvig looks up through the still-open sunroof at the
          enormous glowing funnel cloud with wonder. Jane clambers
          into the front seat, beside Darcy. She leans way out the
          window, TAPING the storm.

                         JANE
          You've gotta get us closer so I can
          take a magnetic reading.
          Darcy laughs.

                         DARCY
          Yeah, right! Good one!
          (then, realizing)
          Oh God, you're serious...

                         JANE
          You want those college credits or
          not?

          8 EXT. SUV 8

          The SUV tears across a field towards the tornado, Jane
          leaning out the window, taping the event. The SUV disturbs
          two RAVENS perched on a cactus as they race past. The birds
          take flight, when -- KRAKABOOM! A huge BOLT OF LIGHTNING
          strikes down through the center of the funnel cloud before
          them with a terrifying intensity.

          9 INT. SUV 9

          The SUV rocks from the blast. Darcy's had enough. She turns
          the wheel, starts to head away.

                         DARCY
          Keep the credits. I'll intern at
          Burger King.

                         JANE
          What are you doing?!

                         DARCY
          Saving our lives!
          Jane grabs the wheel, jerks it hard the other way. They
          struggle for control, when the headlights fall on --

                         A MAN

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 5.
          Directly in their path, stumbling through the winds. Darcy
          slams on the brakes, Jane turns the wheel hard to avoid him.
          The SUV swerves -- but too late.

          10 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) 10

          The side of the SUV slams into the man with a THUD, sending
          him flying. The car SKIDS to a stop.

          11 INT. SUV 11

          Jane, Darcy, and Selvig trade shocked looks, breathing hard.
          They peer through the dust clouds, unable to see through.
          A paralyzed moment, then they all leap out of the car.

          12 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) 12

          The three race from the SUV with flashlights. Jane spots the
          man lying on the ground. He's dressed in tattered clothing,
          charred and blackened.

                         DARCY
          I think that was legally your
          fault.

                         JANE
          Get the first aid kit.
          Darcy heads back inside the SUV as Jane, concerned, kneels
          next to the man. Selvig hovers, protectively.
          She gently turns his head to the light, and we see him
          clearly for the first time. He is magnificently handsome,
          long blonde hair flowing around his classically sculpted
          features. She cups her hands around his face, as if willing
          the life back into him.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          Come on, big guy. Do me a favor
          and don't be dead, okay? Open your
          eyes and look at me.
          Suddenly, he GROANS, and she's startled, then relieved, as
          his eyes flutter open. She looks deep into his confused,
          azure eyes, which at last focus on her own. Locking onto
          them.
          For a moment, they each forget to breathe.
          The connection is broken as Darcy returns with the kit. She
          freezes when she sees how gorgeous the man is.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 5A.

                         DARCY
          Wow. Does he need CPR? Because I
          know CPR.
          A flustered Jane smooths her hair and sits back on her heels.
          She looks up at Selvig. Back to being a scientist.

                         JANE

                         HIS EYES--

                         DARCY

                         (DREAMILY)
          --are beautiful.

                         JANE
          --are dilating. That's a good
          sign.

                         SELVIG
          We still have to get him to a
          hospital.

                         JANE

                         (HOPEFULLY)
          After we get a reading on the
          storm?

                         SELVIG
          Immediately, Jane.
          Jane sighs and nods, regretfully watching the storm EVAPORATE
          above their heads. A thought strikes her.

                         JANE
          Where did he come from?
          They exchange puzzled looks, as we move up through the last
          glowing remnants of the storm, and into:

          13 EXT. SPACE 13

          EARTH spins slowly before us as we hear a voice, deep and
          resonant -- the voice of HEIMDALL, Gatekeeper of Asgard.

          HEIMDALL (V.O.)
          Questions, they've always asked
          questions -- this race called man,
          on this planet they call earth.
          Passionately longing to know how
          they are connected to the heavens.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 6.
          We pull away from the planet, widening, past other worlds,
          cosmic debris -- leaving first our solar system, then our
          galaxy.

          HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          In ages past, they looked to us as
          gods, for indeed so many times we
          saved them from calamity. We tried
          to show them how their world was
          but one of the Nine Realms of the
          Cosmos, linked to all others by the
          branches of Yggdrasil...
          We pull back until we see it -- YGGDRASIL. Immense,
          sprawling, like a quasar or a nebula twisted into the vague
          shape of a TREE, its branches of glowing energy stretching
          out into the black void of space.

          HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          ...the Worlds Tree. Nine Realms in
          a universe of wonder, beauty, and
          terror that they barely
          comprehended.
          We move in through Yggdrasil, until we reach what looks like
          a galaxy, slowly spinning before us.

          HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          But for all their thirst for
          knowledge, they let our lessons
          fall into myth and dreams.
          Where did he come from? He came
          from us, the proudest race of
          warriors the Worlds have ever seen.
          He came from this -- the greatest
          Realm the universe has ever known.
          We move through the galaxy's mists and astral matter, then
          over and up, through a band of prismatic color to reveal
          what's on the other side:

          HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          He came... from Asgard!

          14 EXT. ASGARD - DAY 14

          Beautiful beyond imagination. We fly over the magnificent
          landscape of the Realm, through the gleaming capital city,
          modern yet timeless.

          15 EXT. ODIN'S PALACE - DAY 15

          The palace rises countless stories tall, gleaming with an
          other-worldly majesty, towering high above the Realm sprawled
          out before it.
          We move towards a large window of the palace, where a FIGURE

                         STANDS --

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 7.

                         ODIN ALLFATHER
          Stares out at his kingdom. The ravens fly up to the balcony,
          land at his side.

          16 INT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 16

          Odin turns away from the window. His wife FRIGGA sits at a
          vanity and tries different earrings before the mirror.

                         ODIN
          Do you think he's ready?

                         FRIGGA
          He thinks he is. He has his
          father's confidence.

                         ODIN
          He'll need his father's wisdom.

                         FRIGGA
          And his humility?
          Odin reacts.

          FRIGGA (CONT'D)
          Thor won't be alone. Loki will be
          at his side to give him counsel.
          Have faith in your sons.

                         ODIN
          Yes, but Thor's still a boy. He
          could be a great King...
          Odin stops, notices HIS HAND SHAKING. It seems to be out of
          synch temporally with the rest of the world, leaving a trail
          as it moves. He stares at it determinedly, concentrating,
          trying to stop the strange event through the force of his
          sheer will.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 8.
          Finally, the occurrence subsides, his hand normal once more.
          A worried Frigga covers his hand with her own.

          ODIN (CONT'D)

                         (QUIETLY)
          ...if we only had more time.

                         FRIGGA
          For once, our son needs something
          we cannot provide.

                         ODIN
          I can fight it a little longer...

                         FRIGGA
          No. You've put it off too long! I
          worry for you.
          He touches her cheek.

                         ODIN
          I've destroyed demons and monsters,
          devastated whole worlds, laid waste
          to mighty kingdoms, and still you
          worry for me?

                         FRIGGA
          Always.

                         ODIN
          Not today. Now come kiss your
          king... while I'm still king.
          He pulls her close, and they kiss.

          17 INT. PALACE ANTEROOM - DAY 17

          Directly under the throne room, a gloomily lit hall. Banners
          hang on either side to form a corridor down the middle of the
          fire lit room.
          Giant doors open at one end. A huge figure silhouetted
          against the bright light beyond walks forward. In slo-mo, we
          recognize the unmistakable shape of the God of Thunder.
          Hammer in hand, he reaches the end of a raised platform.
          An ATTENDANT hands the figure a goblet of wine.
          He downs it quickly, hurls it towards the fire directly
          below.

                         THOR
          Another!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 8A.
          The cup smashes, the alcohol causes the fire to glow
          intensely -- and, for a moment, brightly lit, and seen full
          length, like a King to be, is THE MIGHTY THOR.
          He proceeds down stops, past camera, and down the center of
          the Hall.
          We follow from behind and see at the other end, massively
          shadowed on one of the great banners, the shape of two great
          horns. As Thor approaches, the horn shapes move, and then,
          from the shadows at the side, emerges LOKI, wearing his
          horned headpiece.
          Like Thor, he is dressed for a great ceremony. They stand by
          a brazier at the foot of steps that lead up to the crowded
          throne room.

                         LOKI

                         (TO THOR)
          Nervous, brother?

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 9.

                         THOR
          Have you ever known me to be
          nervous?

                         LOKI
          There was the time in Nornheim...

                         THOR
          That wasn't nerves, brother. It
          was the rage of battle. How else
          could I have fought my way through
          a hundred warriors and pulled us
          out alive?
          The Attendant approaches with another goblet of wine for
          Thor.

                         LOKI
          As I recall, I was the one who
          veiled us in smoke to ease our
          escape.

                         THOR
          Some do battle, others just do
          tricks.
          The Attendant stifles a laugh. Loki notices, doesn't like
          it. He gestures towards the goblet in the Attendant's hand.
          EELS pour over the sides of the goblet, slithering out and
          across the terrified Attendant's hand. He SCREAMS, hurls the
          goblet to the ground. Loki chuckles.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Loki...
          Loki gestures to the writhing eels on the ground. They turn
          back to spilled wine, the illusion shattered.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Now that was just a waste of good
          wine.

                         LOKI
          Just a bit of fun.
          (to the Attendant)
          Right, my friend?
          The Attendant isn't so sure. Thor dons his EAGLE-WINGED

          HELMET.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          (re: Thor's helmet)
          Nice feathers.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 9A.

                         THOR
          You don't really want to start this
          again, do you, Cow?

                         LOKI
          I was being sincere!

                         THOR
          You're incapable of sincerity.

                         LOKI
          Am I?
          He looks his brother in the eye, all pretense lost.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          I've looked forward to this day as
          long as you have. You're my
          brother and my friend. Sometimes
          I'm envious, but never doubt that I
          love you.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 10.
          Thor searches his brother's face, sees no trace of irony.
          He's either speaking from his heart or he's a very, very good
          liar. Maybe both. Thor puts an appreciative hand on his
          brother's shoulder.

                         THOR
          Thank you.
          The two brothers take in the moment a beat, then:

                         LOKI
          Give us a kiss.

                         THOR
          Stop.
          Thor makes the final adjustments to his ceremonial wear.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          How do I look?

                         LOKI
          Like a king.
          They hear the blast of a CEREMONIAL HORN.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          It's time.

                         THOR
          You go ahead.
          Loki casts him a wary look.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          I'll be along. Go on.
          Loki heads inside the palace without his brother.

          17A INT. ANTECHAMBER - NIGHT 17A

          VOLSTAGG combs his great beard in preparation for the big
          event. As he does, he's surprised to find a stray GRAPE
          stuck in the beard. He pulls it out, looks around, then
          eagerly pops it into his mouth and gobbles it down.
          FANDRAL checks his reflection in a mirror, smooths out his
          moustache, gives himself a dashing smile. A PRETTY MAIDEN
          holds the mirror before him, as other MAIDENS look on
          dreamily.

                         FANDRAL
          Thank you, love.
          (to the Maidens)

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 10A.

                         FANDRAL (CONT'D)
          Now who'd like to polish my sword
          for me?
          The giddy Maidens eagerly raise their hands.
          HOGUN stands staring ahead grimly, his hands folded in front
          of him, amidst the hustle and bustle of the ATTENDANTS and
          the ceremony preparations going on around him. A HELPFUL
          ATTENDANT approaches him and starts to polish his armor.
          Hogun turns his head, gives him a look. Intimidated, the
          Attendant quickly backs away.
          From behind, we see a WOMAN IN CEREMONIAL ARMOR take off her
          SWORD and set it on a table, then her SHIELD, then several
          HIDDEN DAGGERS and small, yet intimidating WEAPONS. We
          reveal that it's SIF, looking radiant. She eyes the weapons
          on the table.

                         SIF
          (to the weapons)
          I'll miss you.

          18 INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 18

          Colorful CEREMONIAL BANNERS of the Nine Realms adorn the
          room, crowded with AESIR and REPRESENTATIVES from across
          Yggdrasil, all BUZZING with excitement.
          Thor's COMRADES enter and stride to their place of honor at
          the front of the hall. They are:

          THE WARRIORS THREE
          VOLSTAGG has the girth and strength of a Sumo wrestler, with
          oversized passions to match. FANDRAL, the consummate
          swashbuckler, is agile, charismatic, and nattily dressed.
          HOGUN -- dark, sullen, brooding -- a large MACE slung at his
          side.
          With them walks the warrior maiden SIF. She's clad in armor,
          a shield and sword at her side -- a beauty not to be trifled
          with.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 11.

                         VOLSTAGG
          I hope this goes quickly. I'm
          famished.

                         FANDRAL

                         (FEIGNED DISBELIEF)
          Noooo!

                         VOLSTAGG
          Are you attached to that pretty
          face of yours? Because one more
          word, and you won't be.

                         FANDRAL
          (to the others)
          My, we are hungry, aren't we?
          The others laugh, save Hogun. Fandral turns to him.

          FANDRAL (CONT'D)
          Go on, Hogun. Smile. You can do
          it. Even you, Hogun the Grim.
          Just one smile.
          Hogun stares at him grimly.

          FANDRAL (CONT'D)
          All right, half a smile. Look,
          forget the smile, just show some
          teeth.

                         SIF
          Fandral, is it true the famous
          Warriors Three are ready to meet
          any challenge?

                         FANDRAL
          Name it, Lady Sif.

                         SIF
          Keep your mouth shut.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 12.

          19 INT. VAULT - DAY 19

          Imposing EINHERJAR GUARDS clad in armor, swords at the ready,
          stand watch inside the massive underground structure beneath
          the palace.
          A cold BREEZE blows past them.

          19A INT. PALACE ANTEROOM - DAY 19A

          Thor stands, his fingers nervously drumming the handle of his
          hammer. Frigga approaches behind him, sees his anxiety.

                         FRIGGA
          It's all right to be nervous.

                         THOR
          Why does everyone keep saying that?
          I'm not nervous!

                         FRIGGA
          You may be able to fool the rest of

                         ASGARD --

                         THOR
          ...but never you. I know.

                         FRIGGA
          Thor, just remember that you have
          something even the great Allfather
          never had.

                         THOR
          And what is that?

                         FRIGGA
          Me for a mother.
          She smiles.

          FRIGGA (CONT'D)
          Now don't keep your father waiting.
          Frigga leaves.

          20 INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 20

          Sif and the Warriors Three still wait before the crowd. Loki
          and Frigga enter. Loki takes his place at the front of the
          hall alongside the others. With another blast of the horn,
          the crowd goes silent as the EINHERJAR HONOR GUARD moves into
          formation. They part to reveal --

                         ODIN

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 12A.
          Sitting atop his throne, clad in full ceremonial armor. He
          holds his spear GUNGNIR before him. Any trace of weakness in
          him is gone now. He exudes all the power and majesty of a
          Ruler of Asgard.
          Frigga joins him at his side. He looks around the hall,
          casts a glance over to the Warriors. Thor is nowhere to be
          seen. Odin looks to Loki. Loki shrugs. Odin isn't pleased.
          A murmur spreads through the crowd.

                         VOLSTAGG
          (sotto, to Loki)
          Where is he?

                         LOKI
          He said he'd be along.
          Sif realizes the truth, shakes her head in disapproval.

                         VOLSTAGG
          What?

                         SIF
          He wants to make an entrance.

                         FANDRAL
          Well, if he doesn't show up soon,
          he shouldn't bother. Odin looks
          like he's ready to feed him to his
          ravens.

                         LOKI
          I wouldn't worry. Father will
          forgive him. He always does.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 13.
          Just then, at the back of the hall, up the steps from the
          lower level --

                         MJOLNIR
          Roars up into the hall, Thor strides cockily into the hall
          behind it, catching it behind his back. The CROWD erupts in
          CHEERS. Thor spins his hammer with a flourish, holds it up
          before the crowd, basking in the moment, relishing the
          adoration, whipping his audience up into a frenzy.

                         SIF
          Oh, please.
          Odin watches from the front, not liking this showy display.

          21 INT. VAULT - DAY 21

          As the sound of the cheers echo from above, the odd, cold
          breeze picks up in the Vault. The Guards rub their limbs to
          warm themselves. They grow increasingly uneasy, sensing
          something's not right.
          They exchange a look, then walk the length of the Vault's
          hallway to its end, where a CASKET sits undisturbed upon a
          pedestal.
          LARGE SHADOWS suddenly loom over them. They look up and
          SHOUT in terror as they raise their weapons.

          22 INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 22

          Thor finishes stirring up the crowd, then reaches the front
          of the room, kneels on one knee before his mother and father.
          Frigga casts him an admonishing glance. Thor winks up at
          her. She can't help but smile.
          Odin strikes Gungnir upon the ground with a deafening BOOM.
          The crowd falls silent. Odin speaks with quiet, effortless
          authority.
          He raises Gungnir before him.

                         ODIN
          Gungnir. Its aim is true, its
          power strong. With it I have
          defended Asgard and the lives of
          the innocent across the Nine Realms
          since the time of the Great
          Beginning. And though the day has
          come for a new King to wield his
          own weapon -- that duty remains the
          same. Thor Odinson, my heir, my
          first-born.

                         ODIN (CONT'D)
          So long entrusted with this mighty
          hammer, Mjolnir. Forged in the
          heart of a dying star, from the
          sacred metal of Uru. Only one may
          lift it. Only one is worthy. Who
          wields this hammer commands the
          lightning and the storm. Its power
          has no equal -- as a weapon, to
          destroy, or as a tool, to build.
          It is a fit companion for a King.

          23 INT. VAULT - DAY 23

          The bodies of the Guards are flung to the Vault's floor, now
          strewn with ice. We don't see their attackers clearly, just
          catch glimpses of them in the shadows -- but they are large
          and BLUE-SKINNED.
          One of the creatures lifts the Casket off its stand and turns
          to go. But, as they do, the intricate latticework behind the
          Casket starts to separate and retract, revealing something
          standing in the shadows behind it.
          As the creatures walk away, a fiery glow rises behind them.
          They turn back around.
          Now it's their turn to SCREAM.

          24 INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 24

          The Ceremony continues.

                         ODIN
          Today I entrust you with the
          greatest honor in all the Nine
          Realms. The sacred throne of
          Asgard. I have sacrificed much to
          achieve peace. So, too, must a new
          generation sacrifice to maintain
          that peace. Responsibility, duty,
          honor. These are not merely
          virtues to which we must aspire.
          They are essential to every soldier
          and to every King.
          The Crowd and the Warriors Three start to shiver and rub
          their limbs for warmth in the increasingly cold air of the
          hall.
          Thor turns back to face his father. Odin looks upon his son
          with pride.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 15.

          ODIN (CONT'D)
          Thor Odinson, do you swear to guard
          the Nine Realms?

                         THOR
          I swear.

                         ODIN
          Do you swear to preserve the peace?

                         THOR
          I swear.

                         ODIN
          Do you swear to cast aside all
          selfish ambition and pledge
          yourself only to the good of all
          the Realms?
          Beat.

                         THOR
          I swear.

                         ODIN
          Then on this day, I, Odin
          Allfather, proclaim you--
          Odin hesitates, noticing a strange sight before him. ICE
          creeps across the surface of the large banners around the
          hall, making an eerie CRACKING sound. Thor, his comrades,
          and the crowd see it too.

          ODIN (CONT'D)

                         (REALIZING)
          Frost giants...
          The far-off sounds of a BATTLE echo in the depths of the
          palace below. Sif and the Warriors Three reach for their
          weapons, as Thor races from the hall.

          25B INT. VAULT - DAY 25B

          Thor enters, then stares shocked at the sight before him.
          Sif, the Warriors Three, and Loki hurry in behind Thor and
          stop short.
          Shattered and melting ICE is strewn about the floor.
          We don't see the blue-skinned bodies of the Frost Giants
          clearly, just catch glimpses of their twisted and smoldering
          remains on the floor.
          They've just lost a savage battle. Badly.
          Amidst them, shrouded in shadow, stands the black metal
          creature, a fiery glow coming from within it.
          It is THE DESTROYER. It holds the Casket in its hands.

                         SIF
          The Destroyer.

                         VOLSTAGG

                         (AWED)
          I thought it was but a legend.
          Odin steps in behind the Asgardians, as the Destroyer sets
          the Casket back on its pedestal. It moves back to its post,
          the faint, FIERY GLOW extinguishes within it.
          Fandral looks around the Vault, ill at ease.

                         FANDRAL
          I've never been inside the Vault
          before. It's said the Tesseract
          was once held here.

                         VOLSTAGG

                         (AWED)
          The Tesseract? I thought that was
          but a legend too!

                         SIF
          Shush!
          Odin surveys the destruction.

                         THOR
          The Jotuns must pay for what
          they've done!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 16A.

                         ODIN
          They have paid with their lives.
          The Destroyer did its job, and the
          Casket is safe. All is well.

                         THOR
          "All is well?!" They broke into
          the Weapons Vault! If the Frost
          Giants had stolen even one of these

                         RELICS--

                         ODIN
          But they didn't.

                         THOR
          I want to know why they--

                         ODIN

                         (INTERRUPTING)
          The Casket of Ancient Winters
          belonged to the Jotuns. They
          believe it's their birthright.

                         THOR
          And if you hadn't taken it from
          them they would have laid waste to
          all the Nine Realms!

                         ODIN
          I have a truce with Laufey, the
          Jotun King.

                         THOR
          He just broke your truce! We must
          act!
          Odin turns to Sif and the Warriors Three.

                         ODIN
          Leave us.
          Thor's comrades exit. Odin eyes Thor, as Loki watches.

          ODIN (CONT'D)
          And what action would you take?

                         THOR
          March into Jotunheim as you once
          did, teach them a lesson, break
          their spirits so they'll never dare
          try to cross our borders again!

                         ODIN
          You're thinking only as a warrior!

                         THOR
          This was an act of war!

                         ODIN
          It was the act of but a few, doomed
          to fail.

                         THOR
          They got this far!

                         ODIN
          We will find the breach in our
          defenses. It will be found, and it
          will be sealed.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 17.

                         THOR
          As King of Asgard, I would--

                         ODIN
          You are not King. Not yet.
          Thor sees in his father's face that he's pushed this as far
          as he can. He backs away, then leaves, pushing through the
          doors so hard that they SLAM backwards behind him. Odin
          watches him go.

          26 INT. BANQUET HALL - DAY 26

          Thor stands in the empty hall, bearing the signs of the
          festivities cancelled due to the events of the day. Anger
          and frustration rising within him, Thor upends one of the
          massive tables.
          From across the room, Loki watches him.

          AT THE BANQUET HALL ENTRANCE
          Sif, Fandral, and Hogun follow Volstagg as he enters in
          search of his dinner.

                         SIF
          Redecorating, are we?
          Volstagg surveys the overturned tables and food, aghast.

                         VOLSTAGG
          What's this -- ?!

                         HOGUN
          I told you they'd cancel it.

                         FANDRAL
          We thought that was just you being
          your normal cheery self.
          Volstagg looks about the floor, despairing.

                         VOLSTAGG
          All this food -- so innocent, cast
          to the ground. It breaks the
          heart!
          Thor strides away from them to the far end of the hall. Loki
          calmly moves towards him.

                         THOR
          It's unwise to be in my company
          right now, brother.

                         LOKI
          Who said I was wise?

                         THOR
          (re: the empty hall)
          This was to be my day of triumph.

                         LOKI
          It will come. In time.

                         (ADMITS)
          If it's any consolation, I think
          you're right. About the Frost
          Giants, about Laufey, everything.
          If a few of them could penetrate
          the defenses of Asgard once, who's
          to say they won't try again. Next
          time with an army?

                         THOR
          Yes, exactly!

                         LOKI
          But there's nothing we can do
          without defying Father.
          Thor considers this, looks at his hammer, a gleam in his eye.
          Loki can guess what he's thinking, grows concerned.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          No... stop there! I know that
          look!

                         THOR
          It's the only way to ensure the
          safety of our borders.

                         LOKI
          It's madness!

                         VOLSTAGG
          Madness? What sort of madness?

                         LOKI
          Nothing! Thor was making a jest!

                         THOR
          The safety of our Realm is no jest.
          We're going to Jotunheim.

          What?!

                          SIF
          Thor, of all the laws of Asgard,
          this is one you must not break.
          Loki looks on, intrigued by the proceedings.

                         FANDRAL
          This isn't like a journey to Earth,
          where you summon a little lightning
          and thunder and the mortals worship
          you as a god. This is Jotunheim.

                         VOLSTAGG
          And if the Frost Giants don't kill
          you, your Father will!

                         THOR
          My father fought his way into
          Jotunheim, defeated their armies,
          and took their Casket! We'd just
          be looking for answers.

                         SIF
          It is forbidden!
          Thor sizes up his friends, smiles. He proceeds to make his
          case with enthusiasm and charismatic conviction.

                         THOR
          My friends, have you forgotten all
          that we've done together?
          He turns to Fandral.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Who brought you into the sweet
          embrace of the most exotic maidens
          in all of Yggdrasil?

                         FANDRAL
          You did.

                         THOR

                         (TO HOGUN)
          Who led you into the most glorious
          of battles...

                         (TO VOLSTAGG)
          ...and to delicacies so succulent,
          you thought you'd died and gone to
          Valhalla?

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 19A.

                         VOLSTAGG/HOGUN
          You did. / You did.
          He turns to Sif.

                         THOR
          And who proved wrong all who
          scoffed at the idea that a young
          maiden could be one of the fiercest
          warriors this Realm has ever known?

                         SIF
          I did.

                         THOR

                         (QUICKLY)
          True. But I supported you...
          (then, to the others)
          My friends, trust me now. We must
          do this.
          The others exchange concerned looks, realize there's no
          convincing him.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Come on. You're not going to let
          my brother and me take all the
          glory, are you?
          Loki looks startled.

                         LOKI
          What?

                         THOR
          You are coming with me...

                         LOKI
          Yes, of course! I won't let my
          brother march into Jotunheim alone.
          I will be at his side.

                         VOLSTAGG
          And I.

                         FANDRAL
          And I.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 20.

                         HOGUN
          And I. The Warriors Three fight
          together.

                         SIF
          I fear we'll live to regret this.

                         VOLSTAGG
          If we're lucky.

          27 EXT. ODIN'S PALACE - DAY 27

          Thor, Sif, Loki, and the Warriors Three walk from the Palace,
          across the grounds. They reach a group of ATTENDANTS who
          ready their battle gear for their journey.
          Loki slips away from the group, speaks to a nearby GUARD.
          Hogun notices.

                         THOR
          We must first find a way to get
          past Heimdall.

                         VOLSTAGG
          That will be no easy task. It's
          said the Gatekeeper can see a
          single dew drop fall from a blade
          of grass a thousand worlds away.

                         FANDRAL
          And he can hear a cricket passing
          gas in Niffelheim.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Jest not! He heareth all!

                         FANDRAL
          Please. Getting past him should be
          simple enough now, since he seems
          to be letting Frost Giants sneak by
          under his nose.
          Volstagg, terrified, calls out to the sky.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Forgive him! He meaneth no
          offense!
          Loki rejoins the group as Thor leads them onward.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 20A.

          28 EXT. GATE OF ASGARD - DAY 28

          Thor and his band of adventurers, on horseback, pass through
          the massive Gate, leaving Asgard behind. They ride along the
          most astounding path in this Realm or any other --

          THE RAINBOW BRIDGE.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 21.
          Wide and flat, it runs straight out from Odin's palace to the
          mists and black void of space beyond. In the distance far
          ahead, the Bridge continues on until it reaches Heimdall's
          Observatory.

          29 EXT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 29

          The band draws near the Observatory, where HEIMDALL himself,
          Gatekeeper of Asgard, stands at his post on the Bridge before
          them, blocking their way, staring them down.
          There is something other-worldly about him, even for this
          Realm. He holds a massive sword in front of him, his stern,
          intimidating face virtually concealed by armor. Something
          glints beneath his visor, like twinkling stars.

                         LOKI
          Keep your weapons sheathed and your
          mouths closed. This is going to
          take subtlety and sincerity, not
          brute strength. Leave it to me.
          Loki dismounts and steps forward.

          LOKI (CONT'D)

                         GOOD HEIMDALL--

                         HEIMDALL
          You're not dressed warmly enough.
          Thor, Loki, and the others trade looks.

                         LOKI
          I'm sorry?

                         HEIMDALL
          The freezing cold of Jotunheim. It
          will kill you all in time, even
          Thor.

                         (THEN)
          You think you can deceive me? I,
          who watch all? I, who can sense
          the flapping of a butterfly's wings
          a thousand worlds away?
          He fixes his eyes pointedly at Fandral.

          HEIMDALL (CONT'D)
          Or can hear a cricket passing gas
          in Niffelheim?
          Fandral looks gob-smacked.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 22.

                         FANDRAL
          That was just a bit of a jest,
          really...
          Loki goes into damage control.

                         LOKI
          You must be mistaken. We're not--

                         THOR

                         (STEPPING FORWARD)
          Enough.

                         (TO HEIMDALL)
          Heimdall, may we pass?
          Heimdall stares him down.

                         HEIMDALL
          For ages have I guarded Asgard and
          kept it safe from those who would
          do it harm. In all that time,
          never has an enemy slipped by my
          watch -- until this day. I wish to
          know how that happened.

                         THOR
          Then tell no one where we've gone
          until we've returned.
          Thor walks past Heimdall as the Gatekeeper lets the group
          pass. Volstagg walks beside the frustrated Loki, needles
          him.

                         VOLSTAGG
          What happened? Your silver tongue
          turn to lead?

                         LOKI
          Get me off this bridge before it
          cracks under your girth.
          Volstagg and Fandral share a laugh.

          30 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 30

          Thor and the others enter the Observatory, step onto a
          platform. Heimdall climbs into the large control apparatus
          at the center of the room and readies the Observatory.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 23.

                         HEIMDALL
          Be warned. I will honor my sworn
          oath to protect this Realm as its
          Gatekeeper. If your return
          threatens the safety of Asgard,
          Bifrost will remain closed to you.
          You'll be left to die in the cold
          wastes of Jotunheim.

                         THOR
          I have no plans to die today.

                         HEIMDALL
          None do.
          Heimdall inserts his sword into the control panel, and the
          apparatus of the Observatory starts up.

          31 EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE 31

          The Bifrost energy quickens along the Bridge, feeding into
          the Observatory.

          32 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY 32

          Heimdall turns his sword in the control panel. The
          Observatory's giant turret swings around, aims toward a
          section of space. As a final step, Heimdall plunges his
          sword deeper into the control panel. The great turret FIRES,
          the RAINBOW LIGHT of Bifrost energy blasts out of it.
          The Bifrost opens at the end of the platform upon which Thor
          and his five comrades stand.

                         HEIMDALL
          All is ready. You may pass.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Couldn't you just leave the bridge
          open for us?

                         HEIMDALL
          To keep this bridge open would
          unleash the full power of the
          Bifrost and destroy Jotunheim with
          you upon it.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Ah. Never mind, then.
          Thor starts towards the Bifrost, turns back to the others,
          grins.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 23A.

                         THOR
          Come on. Don't be bashful.
          The others join him at his side, then step towards the
          Bifrost. Their bodies stretch towards the maelstrom,
          changing shape, as if every atom of their being is being
          elongated by the pull of it. In an instant, they're jerked
          off the platform and inside the vortex.

          33 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (JOTUNHEIM) - DAY 33

          A hole in the sky rips open, and the Bifrost comes shooting
          out of it. Snow flurries up when the Bifrost hits, as Thor
          and his band touch down. RUNES from the Bifrost are
          imprinted on the ice around them.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 24.
          Volstagg loses his footing, falling backwards. Thor quickly
          grabs him by the belt. We see the warrior dangling
          precariously on the edge of a sheer cliff on the planet's
          inner ring, opening up to the black abyss of space beyond.

                         THOR
          Come on, big fella. Up...!
          With an effort, Thor pulls the burly warrior back onto the
          ice and, tremendously relieved, he proclaims:

                         VOLSTAGG
          This belt! This belt is now my
          lucky belt! I will never remove
          it! Even when bathing!

                         FANDRAL
          You bathe?
          Thor and the others turn and stare out in horror and wonder
          at the frozen alien wasteland before them. The whole planet
          is a massive flattened ring of jagged ice, slowly breaking
          apart. Huge CHUNKS OF ICE calve away from its outer edges
          and float off into space. The planet's icy surface cracks
          and melts as far as the eye can see. The ruins of a Jotun
          city lies in the distance.

                         HOGUN
          We shouldn't be here.

                         THOR
          Too late now.

                         FANDRAL
          Actually, it's not. We could turn
          right around, hop back to Asgard,
          share a mug by the fire. Could be
          nice.
          Thor ignore him, heads off. Loki looks around, anxious.

                         LOKI
          Perhaps we should wait.
          Thor turns back to his brother.

                         THOR
          For what?

                         LOKI
          To survey the enemy. To gauge
          their strengths and weaknesses from
          a distance.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 25.

                         VOLSTAGG
          I'm liking that. Gauging,
          surveying. Particularly the
          distance part.

                         THOR
          We know all we must. It's time to
          act.
          Thor heads on. Reluctantly, the others follow.

                         SIF
          He's just got to swing his
          hammer...

          34 EXT. JOTUNHEIM - DAY 34

          The group trudges behind Thor across the frozen wasteland,
          shielding themselves from the howling wind and cold. Loki
          looks around them, anxious. Volstagg shivers.
          Thor, invigorated, turns back to his comrades.

                         THOR
          It feels good, doesn't it? To be
          together again, adventuring on
          another world?

                         FANDRAL
          Adventuring? Is that what we're
          doing?

                         THOR
          What would you call it?

                         FANDRAL
          Freezing.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Starving.

                         SIF
          Whining.

                         THOR
          How about a song to lift our
          spirits?
          The others groan.

                         HOGUN
          No, not that!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 25A.

                         SIF
          Please don't make us sing again!

                         FANDRAL
          If I have to listen to Volstagg's
          singing voice one more time, I'll
          fall on my own sword!

                         SIF
          Well, now I'm on board.
          She and Thor share a grin.
          The party reaches the edge of the city -- its ancient
          structures of jade and ice melting and crumbling, ravaged by
          warfare long ago. A TEMPLE lies before them, across a
          central plaza.

          SIF (CONT'D)
          Where are they?

                         THOR
          Hiding. As cowards always do.
          Thor leads the others onwards towards the central plaza.
          Loki reluctantly follows. They don't notice as SHADOWY
          FIGURES move in the shadows of the structures nearby.

          35 EXT. CENTRAL PLAZA - DAY 35

          The party reaches the plaza. They sense the Frost Giants in
          the shadows and crevices, surrounding them now on all sides.
          The Asgardians reach for the hilts of their weapons.
          A JOTUN SENTRY calls to him.

                         JOTUN SENTRY
          What is your business here,
          Asgardian?
          The Jotun's voice itself sounds like cracking ice.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 26.

                         THOR
          I speak only to your King. Not to
          his foot soldiers.

          JOTUN VOICE (O.S.)
          Then speak.
          Thor turns towards the source in a balcony of the temple,
          where LAUFEY sits, veiled in shadow, behind a cascading
          waterfall. The Jotun King is ancient, noble, powerful -- too
          proud to reveal even a hint of the years of suffering he and
          his people have endured.

                         LAUFEY
          I am Laufey, King of this Realm.

                         THOR
          And I am--

                         LAUFEY
          We know who you are, Odinson. Why
          have you brought the stench of your
          blood into my world?

                         THOR
          I demand answers.
          Laufey stands, sizing up Thor, tries to piece this together.

                         LAUFEY
          You "demand?"

                         THOR
          How did your people get into
          Asgard?

                         LAUFEY
          The house of Odin is full of
          traitors.
          Sif and the Warriors Three exchange a puzzled look, disturbed
          by the Jotun King's words.

                         THOR
          Do not dishonor my father's name
          with your lies.

                         LAUFEY
          Your father is a murderer and a
          thief. He stole what was ours, and
          left our world in ruins. We have
          the right to reclaim the Casket.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 27.

                         THOR
          Not when you'd use it to make war
          against other Realms.
          Laufey laughs, cold, mocking.

                         LAUFEY
          And why have you come here? To
          make peace? You long for battle.
          You crave it. I see you for what
          you are, Thor Odinson. Nothing but
          a boy, trying to prove himself a
          man.

                         THOR
          This boy has grown tired of your
          mockery.
          Thor takes a step towards Laufey. The other Jotuns step in
          front of Thor, blocking his path. We finally see the Frost
          Giants now -- terrifying, blue-skinned, standing eight feet
          tall. Loki moves next to his brother and quietly implores
          him.

                         LOKI
          Thor, stop and think. Look around
          you. We are outnumbered.

                         THOR
          Know your place, brother...

                         LAUFEY
          You should listen to his counsel.
          You know not what your actions
          would unleash.
          Laufey steps out of the shadows.

          LAUFEY (CONT'D)
          But I do. Go now, while I still
          allow it.
          Thor simmers. Loki speaks up.

                         LOKI
          We will accept your most gracious
          offer.
          The others look to Thor imploringly. Thor stares Laufey down
          a beat -- then relents. He turns to leave. His comrades
          breathe a sigh of relief and follow, when a Frost Giant
          nearby mutters under his breath.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 28.

                         JOTUN
          Run back home, little princess.
          Thor stops in his tracks. Loki goes white. He knows what's
          coming.

                         LOKI
          Damn.
          In one quick move, Thor pulls Mjolnir, swings it, and KNOCKS
          the Jotun clear across the plaza. The Asgardians reluctantly
          draw their weapons, gather into a circle around Thor.
          Volstagg looks around at the angry Jotuns approaching them.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Silly hammer! Has a mind of its
          own!
          ICE forms on the Jotuns' bodies, creating a FROZEN ARMOR
          around them, extending off the ends of their arms like
          SWORDS. One Giant does so directly in front of Fandral.

                         FANDRAL
          I'm hoping that's just decorative.
          Thor leaves the circle of Asgardians, swings at another Frost
          Giant. His comrades form another circle around him,
          separating him from the Jotuns, as he whirls his hammer
          around once and catches it with a cocky grin. He's enjoying
          this.

                         THOR
          Next!
          Fandral calls to Volstagg and Hogun.

                         FANDRAL
          Well? What move, do you think?

                         VOLSTAGG
          I say we use "The Norn's Revenge."

                         FANDRAL
          At this close range? I think "The
          Alfheim Lunge" is a better move.

                         VOLSTAGG

                         (DISGUSTED)
          Maybe if they were three feet tall!
          No! How about "The Randy
          Valkyrie"?

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 28A.

                         HOGUN
          Shut up!
          Thor takes out yet another Frost Giant, then all hell breaks
          loose as the Asgardians and Jotuns begin to battle.
          A Jotun backs Hogun up against a wall of ice. As the Giant
          hurls an ice blade fist at him, the grim warrior swings his
          mace over his head, embedding it into the ice wall, and
          hoists himself up, dodging the Giant's blow and leaping over
          him. Hogun takes out a second approaching Frost Giant, spins
          back, dodges a swing from the first, then pounds the Jotun
          with his mace.
          Nearby, Sif expertly stabs one Jotun after another with her
          double-bladed staff. One knocks her viciously to the ground.

                         SIF
          If you don't treat me like a lady,
          I won't act like a lady!
          She takes out the Jotun.
          Loki backs away from an approaching Jotun, finds himself at
          the edge of a deep crevasse. The Giant sees he's vulnerable,
          swipes at him. But the Jotun's arm passes right through him.
          The Giant stands there, confused, when THE REAL LOKI comes
          out from behind a structure and shoves the Giant into the
          crevasse below. The false Loki dissipates into nothingness.

                         LOKI
          (to the falling Giant)
          Pathetic.
          He turns back to the battle. Two Jotuns come at him from
          either side. He lets two daggers fly, felling both Giants at
          once.
          Laufey nods to one of his guards -- a massive Jotun BRUTE.
          The Brute leaps down from the balcony, icing himself up, then
          punches his giant fist into the ice beneath his feet. It's a
          long-range attack, causing PILLARS OF ICE to explode out in
          front of Hogun, sending the grim warrior flying back.
          Across the plaza, Thor easily dispatches some Jotuns.

                         THOR
          Come on! At least make it a
          challenge for me!
          He sees the Brute coming at him. The huge Jotun lands a
          tremendous blow, sending Thor back across the ice. Thor
          rises, grins.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 28B.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Now that's more like it!
          He throws Mjolnir with all his strength, knocking the Brute
          head over heels.
          Thor raises his hand. Mjolnir slows in mid-air, then flies
          back to his grasp.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          (re: the fallen Brute)
          Ugly and stupid.
          Sif takes out a couple Frost Giants, but she's knocked to the
          ground by another. It raises its weapon above her.
          Hogun sees Sif in danger. He pulls a HIDDEN KNIFE from his
          sleeve and hurls it at Sif's attacker, hitting him square in
          the chest. The Jotun falls dead.

                         SIF
          (to Hogun, re: knife)
          I'm so glad I taught him how to do
          that!
          Volstagg grapples with a Frost Giant, getting a couple good
          hits in.

                         VOLSTAGG
          You may want to put some ice on
          that!
          The Frost Giant fights back, but Volstagg manages to grip in
          a headlock just as another comes up on him from behind.
          Volstagg fends him off, then turns the first one loose.

          VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
          You may be taller, but I'm wider!
          Volstagg launches his mighty belly at the Jotun and sends him
          flying.
          Another Jotun grabs Volstagg, squeezing him tightly and
          sending him crashing to the ground.

          VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
          It's not too late for you to
          surrender.
          Volstagg recovers and fights on. The Jotun grabs Volstagg's
          bare arm. The warrior's skin begins to freeze from the
          Jotun's grasp, a BLACKNESS spreading from it, necrotizing
          Volstagg's flesh. The warrior SHOUTS in pain.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 28C.
          Volstagg head-butts the Frost Giant, shattering the Jotun's
          ice helmet and dropping him to the ground.
          Winded, he takes a seat upon one of the fallen Jotun's bodies
          to catch his breath. As the battle rages around him, he
          opens a secret compartment at the end of his weapon, takes
          out a small FLASK.
          Volstagg grimaces in pain, sees his blackened skin. He yells
          to his comrades.

          VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
          Don't let them grab hold of you!
          He takes a swig, enjoying the brief respite, then rejoins the
          battle.
          Volstagg stabs his blade in a Giant's chest, but the sword
          stops mid ice layer.
          The Giant delivers a bone-breaking blow to Volstagg's face,
          and the warrior drops to one knee.
          Sif sees Volstagg in trouble and rushes towards him. In one
          quick move, she leaps up and off of Volstagg's back, using
          her boot to plunge Volstagg's blade deep into the Giant's
          chest, standing atop him as he falls backwards to the ground.

          VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
          (on his belly)
          Thank you, my lady. But I nearly
          had him!

                         SIF
          Of course you did.
          Nearby, a Frost Giant forms a BARRAGE OF ICE BULLETS, hurling
          them at Sif. Sif raises her shield barely in time, as the
          bullets go pinging and ricocheting off it. She races into
          the group of Frost Giants who attacked her and takes them
          out.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 29.
          A Frost Giant touches a pool of standing water. It FLASH-
          FREEZES Hogun's feet to the ground.
          Volstagg notices, hurries over, dispatching Jotuns as he
          goes.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Hang on!
          Volstagg swings his weapon, wildly hacking at the ice around
          Hogun's legs to free him. Hogun looks down, suddenly
          worried, as Volstagg's blade cuts deep -- and perilously
          close to hacking into Hogun's legs.

                         HOGUN
          Watch the legs!

                         VOLSTAGG

                         (REALIZING)
          Right. Sorry.
          Volstagg chips away at the ice more carefully, finally
          freeing Hogun's feet.
          Fandral sword fights with a Frost Giant.

                         FANDRAL
          You really think your icicles are a
          match for Asgardian steel?
          Fandral lunges at the Giant. The Jotun knocks his blade
          away.

          FANDRAL (CONT'D)
          Fair enough.
          Fandral moves on him again, but the Giant grabs Fandral's
          sword and snaps it in half.

          FANDRAL (CONT'D)
          Could we stop just a moment while I
          get another sword?
          Fandral fights the Giant with his broken sword. The Jotun
          then lunges at Fandral, who ducks just in time, grabs hold of
          the Giant's sword and redirects it, stabbing the Giant
          through with his own weapon.
          The Jotun staggers back, then reaches down and swipes at a
          pool of water, sending up a spray that freezes in mid-air,
          forming into an ICE STALAGMITE. It impales Fandral,
          rendering him helpless.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 29A.
          Loki races towards the impaled Fandral, throwing daggers and
          felling Frost Giants as he goes. He reaches the nearly-
          unconscious warrior, when other Jotuns approach. He fights
          them off.
          Volstagg looks across the plaza and sees the impaled Fandral.

                         VOLSTAGG
          That's unfortunate.
          He hurries to his wounded comrade.

                         FANDRAL
          I may need a bit of help. Not a
          good look, is it?

                         VOLSTAGG
          Just try not to bleed.

                         FANDRAL
          How's the face?

                         VOLSTAGG
          Flawless.
          Volstagg begins to pull the bleeding Fandral off the ice
          stalagmite.
          Loki plunges two daggers into the chest of one of the Frost
          Giants.
          The Giant grabs hold of Loki's gloved wrists. Loki pulls his
          hands free of the gloves, which are still in the Giant's
          grasp, revealing Loki's skin beneath. The wounded Jotun sees
          his chance, grabs hold of Loki's bare arm.
          Loki looks at his arm, prepared for the worst. But instead
          of the blackness of necrotizing flesh, Loki's arm turns BLUE
          -- like the Frost Giant's own skin. The blueness spreads
          painlessly up Loki's arm. He stares at it, confused.
          The Frost Giant is thrown as well, distracted by the
          unexpected phenomenon. Loki takes advantage of the
          distraction, KICKS the Giant.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 30.
          Thor continues fighting, his blood lust rising. He taunts
          the Jotuns around him.

                         THOR
          Come on!
          But when he hurls his hammer to take out a Jotun, the Frost
          Giants seize the opportunity. A group of Jotuns swarm Thor
          from all sides, keeping him separate from his weapon.
          Mjolnir falls to the ground.
          A Frost Giant desperately struggles to lift Mjolnir off the
          ground, to no avail.
          Now free, the wounded Fandral looks relieved as Volstagg
          slings him over his shoulder, and the warriors start to
          leave.
          From his balcony, Laufey looks upon the battlefield, decides
          it's time to pull out the big guns. He touches a wall of the
          palace. An ENERGY WAVE sweeps from his touch, across the
          wall of the palace, and down to the ground below.
          The Asgardians hear a foreboding CRACK OF ICE below their
          feet.

                         LOKI
          That can't be good.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Yes, it could! Might be an early
          spring!
          They look down, suddenly filled with dread when they see
          shadowy figures moving in the ice -- dozens of JOTUN WARRIORS
          awakening beneath the surface, rousing to join the battle.
          Loki turns to his brother, who battles a group of the Giants.

                         LOKI
          Thor, we must go!
          Thor, still without his hammer, fights his Jotun foes
          mercilessly, a man consumed by blood lust. Loki sees the
          look on his brother's face -- the savage thrill of the heat
          of battle.

                         THOR
          Then go!

                         SIF
          There are too many of them!

                         THOR
          I can stop them!
          The others hesitate. Jotuns break up through the ice all
          around them.

                         SIF
          Thor!
          But Thor ignores his comrades, continues fighting.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Run!
          Reluctantly, the group flees back toward the inner edge of
          the planet as the Giants break up through the ice and give
          chase.
          Thor battles valiantly, but there's just too many of them.
          The Frost Giants swarm him from all sides now, as he
          disappears beneath a pile of blue flesh and ice. After a

                         MOMENT --

          THOR'S FIST
          Forces its way up through the middle of the pile of Jotuns.
          He opens his hand, beckoning.
          One of Thor's attackers hears something ROARING up behind
          him. He whirls around -- BAM! -- Mjolnir nails him square in
          the face, then flies into Thor's outstretched hand. Thor
          raises the hammer up high, and brings it down on the ground
          with all his might.
          KRAKABOOM! Lightning strikes down from the sky, the hammer
          channeling the blast, firing the electricity out at the
          Jotuns around him. They're blasted back in a massive
          shockwave. The Jotuns convulse, drop dead to the ground.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 32.
          But the force of the blast also cracks the ice below, the
          shockwave continuing to spread outwards. It moves out to
          where his comrades are running, breaking up the ground
          beneath them, exposing the black void of space below.

          VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
          What's Thor done?

                         LOKI
          Likely killed us all!
          As the Jotuns race towards the Asgardians, they open their
          mouths wide and breathe out an ICY FOG. The swirling mists
          quickly engulf the fleeing Asgardians before them.
          The Asgardians stand in the mist, unable to see. Hogun takes
          a step back, the ice cracking beneath him. They dare not
          move, for fear of falling through, into the void below.
          Thor sees he's put his friends in even greater danger. He
          raises Mjolnir high, SUMMONING THE WINDS. They lift him off
          the ground and carry him across the frozen wasteland to his
          comrades.

          35A EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (JOTUNHEIM) - DAY 35A

          Thor lands beside his comrades in the shroud of mists.

                         THOR
          Loki, we have to see.
          Loki raises his arms, concentrates, the mists dissipating.
          But as they do, the Asgardians see before them the faces of
          the Frost Giants. And there are HUNDREDS of them -- too
          many, even for a Thunder God.

                         VOLSTAGG

                         (TO LOKI)
          Actually, could you bring the mists
          back, please?
          Thor realizes that he and his comrades are as good as dead.
          The Giants move in for the kill, when they hear a deafening
          ROAR. A hole in the sky opens up, and the Bifrost blasts
          down onto the inner edge of the planet. Out of the maelstrom
          comes the sound of THUNDERING HOOVES, and, to the shock of
          all, tearing across the frozen wasteland comes --

                         ODIN ALLFATHER
          Astride his powerful, eight-legged steed SLEIPNIR. He's clad
          in battle armor, Gungnir in his hand -- an imposing sight.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 32A.
          The Giants part in fear as he thunders into their ranks,
          stopping before Laufey and the Asgardians.
          Laufey slams his fists into the ground, and the ice beneath
          his feet raises him towards Odin. The Asgardians start to
          react, thinking it's an attack, but Laufey just stands face-
          to-face with Odin.
          Asgardian and Jotun alike look on uneasily, unsure what's
          about to happen.
          Laufey sizes up Odin, notices that as powerful as the
          Allfather still is, the years have taken their toll. He's
          not the foe he once was. The two rulers talk quietly, out of
          earshot of the others.

                         ODIN
          Laufey. End this.

                         LAUFEY
          Your boy sought this out.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 33.

                         ODIN
          You're right. These are the
          actions of a boy. Treat them as
          such. You and I can stop this
          before there's further bloodshed.
          Unseen by Odin and the others, Laufey starts to form an ice
          blade at the end of his arm.

                         LAUFEY
          We are beyond diplomacy now,
          Allfather. He'll get what he came
          for -- war and death.
          Odin looks grim, determined.

                         ODIN
          So be it.
          Without warning, Laufey swings his ice blade at Odin, but
          Odin is quicker. The Allfather brings his spear down upon
          the ice. Laufey and the nearest Jotuns go falling backwards
          in a wave, the ice cracking beneath their feet.
          The other Frost Giants turn tail and run. Thor watches the
          fleeing Jotuns with delight.

                         THOR
          Now! We'll finish them together!

                         ODIN
          Silence!
          Odin raises his spear. The hole in the sky opens, the
          Bifrost energy blasting forth from it. The Bifrost envelops
          the Asgardians, yanks them off the ground and up through the
          hole. The vortex closes behind them as all falls silent.
          Laufey stares up after them contemptuously.

          36 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 36

          Heimdall stands at the Observatory controls. Odin pulls
          Heimdall's sword from the control panel and throws it to him.
          Heimdall backs away.

                         THOR
          Why did you bring us back?

                         ODIN
          Do you realize what you've done?
          What you've started?

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 33A.

                         THOR
          I was protecting my home.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 34.

                         ODIN
          You cannot protect your friends.
          How can you hope to protect a
          kingdom?
          Odin turns to the others.

          ODIN (CONT'D)

                         (RE: FANDRAL)
          Get him to the healing room!
          Sif, Volstagg, and Hogun hurry to help Fandral out of the
          room.

                         THOR
          There won't be a kingdom to protect
          if you're afraid to act!
          Odin stares at him.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Whatever the cost, the world must
          know that the new King of Asgard
          will not be held in contempt.

                         ODIN
          That's pride and vanity that talks!
          Not leadership! Have you forgotten
          everything I've taught you? What
          of a warrior's patience, cunning?

                         THOR
          While you wait and be patient, the
          Nine Realms laugh at us! The old
          ways are done. You'd stand giving
          speeches while Asgard falls!

                         ODIN
          You're a vain, greedy, cruel boy!

                         THOR
          And you are an old man and a fool!
          The whole world seems to stop at Thor's words. Odin falls
          quiet. When he speaks again, there's something terrifying
          beneath the calmness of his words.

                         ODIN
          A fool, yes! I was a fool to think
          you were ready.
          Loki takes a step towards Odin imploringly.

                         LOKI

                         FATHER--
          Odin turns and gives Loki a look which stops him in his
          tracks.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 35.

                         ODIN
          Thor Odinson... You have disobeyed
          the express command of your King.
          Through your arrogance and
          stupidity, you have opened these
          peaceful Realms and innocent lives
          to the horrors of war.
          The Allfather plunges Gungnir into Observatory's control
          panel. The turret turns, the Bifrost energy building along
          with Odin's rage. It FIRES, as the Bifrost opens at the end
          of the platform, creating a portal behind Thor.
          Odin turns angrily to his son.

          ODIN (CONT'D)
          You are unworthy of this Realm...
          Odin RIPS a disc off Thor's chest.

          ODIN (CONT'D)
          ...unworthy of your title...
          He rips away Thor's cloak.

          ODIN (CONT'D)
          ...unworthy of the loved ones
          you've betrayed. I hereby take
          from you your powers.
          Odin extends his hand towards his son. Mjolnir goes flying
          from Thor's grasp into Odin's hand.

          ODIN (CONT'D)
          In the name of my father...
          A FINGER OF LIGHTNING comes off the hammer and hits Thor,
          disintegrating the right arm of his armor and part of the
          chest piece.

          ODIN (CONT'D)
          ...and of his father before...
          Another strike disintegrates the remainder of Thor's armor,
          including the cape and torn-away disc on the floor.

          ODIN (CONT'D)
          I cast you out!
          Odin thrusts Mjolnir before him and -- with a CRACK OF
          THUNDER -- Thor is hurled backwards into the open Bifrost and
          disappears in the vortex.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 35A.
          Odin holds Mjolnir in his hand, stares at it bitterly. He
          closes his eyes, lost in contemplation, whispers something
          quietly.

          ODIN (CONT'D)

                         (WHISPERING)
          Whosoever holds this hammer, if he
          be worthy, shall possess the power
          of Thor.
          RUNES appear on the side of the hammer, as if carved into its
          smooth surface. The runes linger for but a moment, then
          disappear. Suddenly, Odin turns and hurls the hammer into
          the Bifrost.

          CUT TO BLACK.

          37 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - NIGHT 37

          Thor opens his eyes, surrounded by darkness. Suddenly, he's
          blinded by bright headlights of a vehicle -- an SUV. It
          swerves, the side of it coming straight at him. It SLAMS
          into him, as we:

          CUT TO BLACK.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 36.
          After a beat, we hear familiar voices.

          DARCY (V.O.)
          I think that was legally your
          fault.

          JANE (V.O.)
          Get the first aid kit.

                         (THEN)
          Come on, big guy. Do me a favor
          and don't be dead, okay? Open your
          eyes and look at me.

          THOR'S POV
          Thor opens his eyes to see Jane Foster staring at him,
          concerned. She looks vulnerable and beautiful.

          DARCY (O.S.)
          Wow. Does he need CPR? Because I
          know CPR.

          END THOR'S POV

          TIME CUT TO:
          Jane regretfully watches the storm EVAPORATE above their
          heads. A thought strikes her.

                         JANE

                         (TO SELVIG)
          Where did he come from?
          They exchange puzzled looks when Thor GROANS again. He sits
          up abruptly, and Jane topples backwards in surprise.
          Thor staggers groggily to his feet, then turns and offers
          Jane a hand up. She takes it hesitantly, and he easily pulls
          her up. She can't help but marvel at his strength.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          Uh, thanks. Are you okay?
          Thor searches the ground.

                         THOR
          Hammer...

                         DARCY
          Yeah, we can tell you're hammered.
          That's pretty obvious.
          Jane notices something on the ground around them. She shines
          her flashlight down at the sand.

                         JANE
          Erik... look at this.
          He joins her at her side and sees it. A faint, discernible
          pattern is etched into the sand. They exchange a look.
          Amazed and excited, Jane hurriedly takes out a camera and
          snaps some photos of the runes. A breeze begins to blow them
          away.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          We've got to move fast before
          anything changes.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 37.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          We need soil samples, light
          readings, everything.
          She pulls out a light meter, holds it up, takes some
          readings, jots them down in her notebook. Selvig looks at
          Thor, who stares up at the sky.

                         SELVIG
          Jane, we need get him to a
          hospital.
          Jane kneels and quickly scoops up a soil sample in the
          cannister.

                         JANE
          Not right now. It'll take too
          long. County's an hour away.
          We'll drop him off after we're done
          here.
          Selvig looks uncertain.

          JANE (CONT'D)

                         (RE: THOR)
          Look at him, he's fine.
          Thor stares up at the stars, shouts up at them angrily.

                         THOR
          Father! Heimdall! I know you can
          hear me! Open the bridge!

                         JANE
          (off Selvig's look)
          Okay, you and Darcy take him to the
          hospital, I'll stay here.

                         SELVIG
          You expect me to leave you alone in
          the middle of the desert?
          Thor turns to the others, frustrated.

                         THOR
          You! What world is this?
          The group is intimidated by his fervor.

                         SELVIG
          It's all right, my friend. We're
          going to get you some help.
          Selvig touches Thor's shoulder. Thor shoves him off, grows
          agitated, belligerent.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 37A.

                         THOR
          Where am I?! Answer me!
          Darcy reaches into her fanny pack, pulls something out of it.
          Jane looks on, concerned.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 38.

                         JANE
          Erik, just back away...

                         SELVIG
          (to Thor, calming)
          You're in the desert outside the
          town of Puente Antiguo.

                         THOR
          What Realm?! Alfheim? Nornheim?

                         DARCY
          Uh... New Mexico?
          Darcy raises a TASER at him. Thor looks at the weapon,
          unsure what to make of it.

                         THOR
          You dare threaten Thor with so puny

                         A--
          Darcy fires, the electrified wires shooting out of the taser,
          ZAPPING him in the chest. Thor convulses, falls to the
          ground unconscious. Jane and Selvig stare at her, shocked.

                         DARCY
          What? He was freaking me out.

          38 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - MOMENTS LATER 38

          As Jane still takes soil samples, Darcy and Selvig struggle
          to drag an unconscious Thor to the SUV and lift him inside.

                         SELVIG

                         (TO DARCY)
          Next time you decide to taser
          someone, do me a favor and make
          sure they're already inside the
          truck.

                         (TO JANE)
          Jane, come on...
          Reluctantly, Jane joins the others inside the SUV.

          39 EXT. DESERT - MOMENTS LATER 39

          The SUV heads off into the distance. Behind it, high
          overhead, a HOLE opens in the sky. A last blast of Bifrost
          energy bursts forth from it, and a small OBJECT comes firing
          into our world. It BURNS across the desert sky like a
          meteor.

                         40 OMITTED 40

          41 EXT. COUNTY HOSPITAL - NIGHT 41

          The SUV sits parked before the emergency room entrance.

          42 INT. COUNTY HOSPITAL ER - NIGHT 42

          Selvig watches the unconscious Thor with interest as two
          ORDERLIES set the Asgardian onto a gurney. Jane and Darcy
          stand before a sweet, ditzy ADMISSIONS NURSE.

                         ADMISSIONS NURSE
          Name?

                         JANE
          He said it was "Thor."
          The Nurse painstakingly types it into the computer, one key
          at a time. Jane watches as Thor is wheeled out of the room.

                         ADMISSIONS NURSE

                         (SPELLING)
          T-H-O-R. And your relationship to
          him?

                         JANE
          I've never met him before.

                         DARCY
          Until she hit him with the car.

                         JANE
          Grazed him, actually.

                         (THEN)
          Oh, and we tasered him, too.

                         ADMISSIONS NURSE

                         (SYMPATHETIC)
          Must have been quite the spat.

                         JANE
          I told you, I don't know him. I
          just want to make sure he's okay.

                         ADMISSIONS NURSE
          I'm going to need a name and
          contact number.

                         JANE
          Jane Foster.

                         ADMISSIONS NURSE

                         SELVIG
          Oh, for God's sake...
          He reaches over Jane's shoulder and hands the Nurse his
          business card.

          SELVIG (CONT'D)
          Here. Let's go.
          Selvig, Darcy, and Jane head out.

          43 INT. HOSPITAL ER - NIGHT 43

          Thor, now in a hospital gown, winces in pain as he awakens on
          a gurney to find a NURSE standing over him, a syringe in his
          arm.

                         NURSE
          Hi. Just taking a little blood.
          Thor SLAPS the syringe away angrily, starts to sit up.

                         THOR
          How dare you attack the son of
          Odin!

                         NURSE
          I need some help!
          Two ORDERLIES race over, try to hold Thor down.

          NURSE (CONT'D)
          We're trying to help you!

                         THOR
          Then bring me a healing stone, you
          savages!
          He hurls one of them off, smashing against a wall. Now a
          couple SECURITY GUARDS and MALE NURSES join the fracas, all
          struggling to hold Thor down. Medical equipment goes flying,
          furniture overturned.

                         ORDERLY
          What the hell is this guy on?
          Finally, they force him back down onto the gurney. Thor
          looks shocked and amazed that he's actually being overpowered
          by this small group. The NURSE injects him with a sedative.

                         THOR
          You're no match for the Mighty--
          Thor struggles a beat, then passes out.

          44 EXT. NEW MEXICO DESERT - DAWN 44

          Smoke rises from a fifty foot wide CRATER. A TOWNIE pulls
          his pick-up to a stop at the crater's edge. He climbs out,
          peers down below, his curiosity piqued by what he sees.

                         TOWNIE
          Huh.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 40A.
          The Townie approaches something at the center of the crater.
          We don't see what it is, but it bathes him in an
          otherworldly, BLUE LUMINOUS GLOW. He reaches for the object,
          tries to lift it, but can't. He redoubles his efforts,
          strains with all his might, with no luck.
          He takes off his hat, fans himself, stares at the mysterious
          object.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 41.

           TOWNIE (CONT'D)
           Huh.

          45 EXT./INT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB - MORNING 45

          The distant mountains glint snow in the early morning light.
          Selvig appears with a cup of coffee and surveys the vast
          desert. He turns back into the lab and sees Jane, busy at
          her workstation, soldering a piece of equipment.
          A printer churns out blown-up screen-cap PHOTOS of the
          Bifrost footage. Darcy hangs them on the wall.
          Selvig surveys the scene, watches how Jane works, impressed.
          He notices a monitor which displays a complex program
          entitled "J. FOSTER ALGORITHM ANALYSIS". He looks proud.
          The three of them have been up all night, fueled by caffeine
          and excitement.

                         JANE
          Darcy, when you're done, take the
          soil samples to Professor Meyers in
          geology. Remind him, he owes me.

                         SELVIG
          We might want to perform a spectral
          analysis.

                         JANE
          "We?"

                         SELVIG
          I flew all the way out here --
          might as well make myself useful.
          This is the offer Jane's been waiting for. She gets up,
          inserts the piece of equipment she's been working on into a
          rack-mounted server.

                         JANE
          You know what would be really
          useful? Do you still have that
          friend at LIGO?

                         SELVIG
          She was more than a friend.

                         JANE
          Could you call in a favor?

                         SELVIG
          You don't think this was just a
          magnetic storm?

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 41A.

                         JANE
          If I'm right, their observatory
          must have picked up gravitational
          waves during last night's event.

                         SELVIG
          Meaning?
          Jane heads over to a computer monitor. Selvig follows.

                         JANE
          Meaning these anomalies might
          signify something bigger.

                         SELVIG
          How "big" are we talking about?
          Jane indicates the footage on the monitor. As the last of
          the Bifrost cloud disappears into the night sky, there
          appears to be a blister in space, bulging out in convex and
          covered with stars.

                         JANE
          I think the lensing around the
          edges is characteristic of an
          Einstein-Rosen Bridge.

                         DARCY
          A what?

                         SELVIG
          I thought you were a science major.

                         DARCY
          Political Science.
          Selvig shoots Jane a confused look. Jane shrugs.

                         JANE
          She was the only applicant.

                         SELVIG

                         (TO DARCY)
          An Einstein-Rosen Bridge -- a
          "theoretical" connection between
          two different points of space-time.
          Darcy stares blankly.

                         JANE

                         (TO DARCY)
          A wormhole.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 41B.
          Selvig looks skeptical. Jane prints out a frame-grab off the
          monitor.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          Erik, look...

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 42.
          Jane indicates the print-out showing the constellations seen
          through the "bubble" in the clouds.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          What do you see here?

                         SELVIG
          Stars.

                         JANE
          Yes. But not our stars.
          She spreads out a STAR CHART, barely able to contain her
          excitement.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          This is the star alignment for our
          quadrant, this time of year. So
          unless Ursa Minor decided to take
          the day off... those are someone
          else's constellations.
          Selvig's intrigued, in spite of himself.
          Darcy pulls another frame-grab of the Bifrost footage from
          the printer and hangs it on the wall, when something in the
          image catches her eye.

                         DARCY
          Hey, check it out.
          Jane and Selvig examine the photo, amazed.

                         SELVIG
          Is that...?

                         JANE
          I think I left something at the
          hospital.
          As Jane walks away, we REVEAL the photo. Inside the Bifrost
          funnel cloud is a FIGURE -- the vague, but unmistakable shape
          of a MAN.

          45A EXT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 45A

          At the top of the palace, we see a small FIGURE on the
          balcony. As we move closer, we see it is a burdened Odin,
          looking out over Asgard.

          46 INT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 46

          Frigga enters to find Odin standing lost in thought.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 42A.

                         FRIGGA
          How could you have done this?

                         ODIN
          Do you understand what he set in
          motion? He's taken us to the brink
          of war!

                         FRIGGA
          But banishment? You would lose him
          forever? He's your son!

                         ODIN
          What would you have done?

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 43.

                         FRIGGA
          I would not have exiled him to a
          world of mortals, stripped of his
          powers, to suffer alone. I would
          not have had the heart for such
          cruelty!

                         ODIN
          That is why I'm King.

                         (THEN)
          I, too, grieve the loss of our son.
          But there are some things that even
          I cannot undo.

                         FRIGGA
          You can bring him back.

                         ODIN
          No. His fate is in his own hands
          now.

          47 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY 47

          Thor awakens on a hospital bed. He notices RESTRAINTS on his
          wrists now. He pulls at them, tries to free himself, to no
          avail.

                         THOR
          It's not possible.
          He tries again, mustering all his strength. One of his hands
          slips free from its restraint.

          47A INT. COUNTY HOSPITAL ER - DAY 47A

          Jane again faces the Admissions Nurse, with Selvig and Darcy

          I'm sorry, only relatives can visit
          patients.

                         JANE

                         (THINKING FAST)
          But... I'm his wife.
          Darcy stifles a SNICKER at this, as the Nurse looks doubtful.

                         ADMISSIONS NURSE
          I thought you said you didn't know
          him.

                         JANE
          I meant I barely know him anymore.
          The man he's become. He's changed.
          I mean, what woman really knows her
          husband, anyway?

                         ADMISSIONS NURSE
          None of us, dear. He's in Room

          102.

          48 INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY 48

          Jane, Selvig, and Darcy head down the corridor, passing the
          destruction of the ER Thor wrecked the previous night.

          They enter Thor's room.

          49 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM 49

          They step inside to find Thor's bed empty.

          50 EXT. HOSPITAL PARKING LOT - DAY 50

          Jane, Selvig, and Darcy quickly climb into Jane's SUV.

          51 INT. JANE'S SUV 51

          Jane starts the car, frustrated.

                         JANE
          Typical. I just lost my most
          important piece of evidence.

                         DARCY
          So now what?

                         JANE
          We find him.

                         SELVIG
          Did you see what he did in there?
          I don't know if finding him is the
          best idea.

                         JANE
          I want to know what that thing was,
          and he may have the answers. We
          don't have a choice.

                         DARCY
          Oo-kay.
          She pulls out her taser and a can of mace.

                         SELVIG
          So we're just going to spend the
          rest of the day looking for him?

                         JANE
          However long it takes.
          Jane puts the car in reverse and backs up, when --

          BAM!
          She collides with Thor again, dressed in stolen hospital
          scrubs. Jane and Selvig exchange a look.

          Jane and Selvig emerge from the SUV, help Thor to his feet.

                         JANE
          I'm so sorry. I swear I'm not
          doing that on purpose.

          Thor looks up at the sky.

                         THOR
          Blue sky... one sun... This is
          Earth, isn't it?

                         DARCY
          I think you may have hit him with
          the car one time too many.

                         JANE

                         (TO THOR)
          Let's get you some clothes.

          53 INT. HEALING ROOM - DAY 53

          Sif, Loki, and the Warriors three, battered and shell-
          shocked, still reeling from the day's events, sit before a
          ROARING central fire.
          Hogun reaches into the flames, pulls out some fragile HEALING
          STONES. Neither the fire, nor the stones burn him. As he
          carefully places the stones over the wounds of his comrades,
          the stones begin to glow. He crushes them to a powder. His
          comrades' injuries heal up at the glowing powder's touch.
          Fandral winces in pain as Hogun heals his gaping wound.
          Volstagg looks at the skin on his arm -- healing, but still
          blackened from the necrotizing touch of the Frost Giant.
          Loki watches him, then stares at his own arm, where the
          Giant's touch turned his skin blue. It's undamaged, back to
          its normal color.

                         VOLSTAGG
          We should never have let him go.

                         SIF
          There was no stopping him.

                         FANDRAL
          At least he's only banished, not
          dead. Which is what we'd all be if
          that guard hadn't told Odin where
          we'd gone.

                         VOLSTAGG
          How did the guard even know?
          Loki stares at his arm.

                         LOKI
          I told him.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 45A.

                          FANDRAL
          What?

                         LOKI
          I told him to go to Odin after we'd
          left. Though he should be flogged
          for taking so long.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 46.

                         VOLSTAGG
          You told the guard?

                         LOKI
          I saved our lives! And Thor's. I
          had no idea Father would banish him
          for what he did.

                         SIF
          Loki, you're the only one who can
          help Thor now. You must go to the
          Allfather and convince him to
          change his mind!

                         LOKI
          And if I do, then what? I love
          Thor more dearly than any of you,
          but you know what he is. He's
          arrogant. He's reckless. He's
          dangerous. You saw how he was
          today. Is that what Asgard needs
          from its King?
          The others exchange glances, torn. Loki has a point. He
          leaves the room. Hogun stares after him.

                         SIF
          He may speak about the good of
          Asgard, but he's always been
          jealous of Thor.

                         VOLSTAGG
          True, but we should be grateful to
          him. He did save our lives.

                         HOGUN
          Laufey said there were traitors in
          the House of Odin.
          The others turn to the usually quiet Hogun.

                         FANDRAL
          Why is it every time you choose to
          speak, it has to be something dark
          and ominous?

                         HOGUN
          A master of magic could easily
          bring three Jotuns into Asgard.
          The others look to Hogun, understanding the implication.

                         VOLSTAGG
          No! Surely not!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 46A.

                         FANDRAL
          Loki's always been one for
          mischief, but you're talking about
          something else entirely.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 47.

                         SIF
          Who else could elude Heimdall's
          gaze with tricks of light and
          shadow?

                         VOLSTAGG
          The ceremony was interrupted just
          before Thor was named King.

                         SIF
          We should go to the Allfather.

                         FANDRAL
          And tell him what? "Oh, by the
          way, we think your son just
          betrayed the throne. And do us a
          favor. Bring back Thor. There's a
          good fellow!"

                         SIF
          It's our duty. If any of our
          suspicions are right, then all of
          Asgard is in danger.

          54 INT. VAULT - DAY 54

          Loki heads into the Vault, sees the Casket of Ancient Winters
          sitting on its stand.
          He walks over to it slowly, reaches out to it, lifts it
          between his forearms off its pedestal. As he does, a
          blueness spreads from his arms, across his body.
          The latticework behind the Casket starts to separate, the
          Destroyer rousing. A fire starts to glow within its black
          metal armor, as it rattles to life, but Loki ignores it --
          the blueness spreading further, consuming his whole body.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 48.

           ODIN (O.S.)
          Stop!
          Loki turns, sees Odin hurrying into the room, the Destroyer
          goes motionless, the latticework rejoining before it.
          Odin eyes Loki with dismay.

                         LOKI
          Am I cursed?

                         ODIN
          No. Put the Casket down.
          Loki sets the Casket back upon its pedestal, his body quickly
          returning to its normal form and color. He stares at his
          father.

                         LOKI
          What am I?

                         ODIN
          You're my son.

                         LOKI
          What more than that?
          Odin doesn't answer. He looks suddenly weary, burdened.
          Loki sizes him up, realizes the truth.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          The Casket wasn't the only thing
          you took from Jotunheim that day,
          was it?
          Odin looks him in the eye. He can deny it no longer.

                         ODIN
          No.

                         (BEAT)
          In the aftermath of the battle, I
          went into the Temple, and I found a
          baby. Small for a giant's
          offspring -- abandoned, suffering,
          left to die. Laufey's son.
          Loki is sent reeling by the revelation.

                         LOKI
          Laufey's son...
          He desperately struggles to make sense of it all.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 48A.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          Why? You were knee-deep in Jotun
          blood. Why would you take me?

                         ODIN
          You were an innocent child.

                         LOKI
          You took me for a purpose, what was
          it?
          Odin doesn't answer.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          Tell me!

                         ODIN
          I thought we could unite our
          kingdoms one day, bring about an
          alliance, bring about a permanent
          peace... through you. But those
          plans no longer matter.

                         LOKI
          So I am no more than another stolen
          relic, locked up here until you
          might have use of me.

                         ODIN
          Why do you twist my words?

                         LOKI
          You could have told me what I was
          from the beginning. Why didn't
          you?

                         ODIN
          You are my son. My blood. I
          wanted only to protect you from the
          truth.

                         LOKI
          Because I am the monster parents
          tell their children about at night?

                         ODIN
          Don't...

                         LOKI
          It all makes sense now. Why you
          favored Thor all these years.

                         ODIN
          Listen...

                         LOKI
          Because no matter how much you
          claim to "love" me, you could never
          have a Frost Giant sitting on the
          Throne of Asgard!
          Odin's body begins to shake, he lifts his hand. It starts to
          move out of synch temporarily, leaving a trail, the effect of
          the Odinsleep approaching. Loki doesn't notice as Odin tries
          to fight it off.

                         ODIN
          Listen to me!
          Loki strides away towards the exit.

          ODIN (CONT'D)
          Loki!
          Odin starts towards him, when the enormous mental, emotional,
          and physical strain of recent events finally takes its toll.
          The effect of the Odinsleep consumes him. His entire body
          now moves out of sync with the rest of the world, leaving
          trails behind him as he staggers backwards.
          Odin falls back against a wall, his face contorting in a
          scream. He collapses to the stone floor.
          Loki, shocked, hurries to him. He takes Odin in his arms,
          calls out.

          It looks like the whole town has turned out. LOCALS sit on
          lounge chairs, drink beer from coolers, laugh and talk. They
          watch the center of the crater, where LARGE MEN have formed a
          line to take a turn with the mysterious object.
          One of them struggles and fails to lift it. As he gives up,
          the next man steps up and takes his turn, straining from the
          effort. Other Townies SNAP PICTURES of the scene with their
          cell phones.
          They hear an approaching RUMBLE, then clear a path as a large
          PICK-UP TRUCK backs its way down the crater's edge. An EAGER
          TOWNIE hops out the passenger side and pulls a thick chain
          from the back of the truck.
          He fastens one end around the object, then securely affixes
          the chain to the bumper and the rear of the undercarriage.

                         EAGER TOWNIE
          This'll do it.
          He yells to the driver.

          EAGER TOWNIE (CONT'D)
          Okay, let 'er rip!
          The townsfolk watch as the pick-up's engine ROARS, then
          STRAINS, its wheels spinning futilely, until finally the rear
          of the truck, along with the back wheels and axles, break off
          and go flying.
          People dive out of the way.
          The PICK-UP DRIVER sticks his head out. He is STAN "THE MAN"
          LEE. He looks back, shocked. The townsfolk laugh, the party
          continuing. They don't notice as --

          ON THE CRATER'S EDGE ABOVE THEM
          An imposing GOVERNMENT VEHICLE pulls up to a stop. A Fed in
          a suit climbs out, peers down at the boisterous gathering
          below, his eyes fixed on the object at the center of the
          crater.
          He is SHIELD AGENT COULSON. He stares down at the object
          which glows with an otherworldly blue energy -- MJOLNIR. He
          pulls out a phone.

                         COULSON

                         (INTO PHONE)
          Sir -- we've found it.

          60 INT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB - DAY 60

          In a back room, Thor, now shirtless and wearing jeans, looks
          around for a t-shirt.
          Jane and Darcy, standing in the lab, can't help but notice
          his reflection in the mirror. Darcy eyes his powerful build,
          rippling biceps.

                         DARCY
          You know, for a crazy homeless guy,
          he's pretty cut.
          Jane turns away. Thor emerges from the back room, holding a
          t-shirt.

          DARCY (CONT'D)
          Hey, sorry I tased you!
          Thor heads over to Jane's work area, starts fiddling with the
          equipment there with interest. Jane hurries over to put a
          stop to it.

                         JANE
          Excuse me... excuse me!
          She leads him away from the work station. Thor holds up the
          t-shirt. On the front, it bear a sticker which reads:
          "HELLO, MY NAME IS DR. DONALD BLAKE". Thor looks at it,
          puzzled. Jane rips the sticker off.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 52.

           JANE (CONT'D)
          My ex.
          Thor stares at her a beat.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          They're the only clothes I had
          that'll fit you. Sorry.

                         THOR
          They will suffice.
          Thor turns his attention to the pictures of the Bifrost on
          the wall.

                         JANE
          You're welcome. Now tell me...
          Thor studies the frame-grabs with interest. Jane points to
          his form in the Bifrost photo.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          What were you doing, in that?
          He glances at it, dismissive.

                         THOR
          What does anyone do in the Bifrost?
          Everyone stares at him. Selvig seems to recognize the word.
          Jane opens her notebook, quickly writes the word down. Thor
          moves close to her, eyes the notations and drawings within
          the book, curious.

                         SELVIG
          (amused, skeptical)
          The Bifrost...
          Jane starts to get uncomfortable with Thor standing so close
          to her, looking over her notations. She quickly closes the
          book.

                         JANE
          What exactly is the Bifrost?

                         THOR

                         (IGNORING HER)
          This mortal form has grown weak.

                         JANE

                         BUT--

          Somebody get the mortal a Pop-Tart.

          61 INT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 61

          Frigga sits at her husband's bedside, holding his hand. Odin
          lies there -- looking pale and lifeless, his body and the
          space around it warped from the effect of the Odinsleep. The
          walls of the chamber have moved close around him, protecting
          him like a dark crypt, sealing off any daylight.
          Loki sits at Odin's side, across from Frigga. She speaks
          softly to him.

                         FRIGGA
          I asked him to be honest with you
          from the beginning. There should
          be no secrets in a family.

                         LOKI
          So why did he lie?

                         FRIGGA
          He kept the truth from you so that
          you would never feel different.
          You are in every way our son, Loki,
          and we your family. You must know
          that.
          Loki takes this in, stares at Odin.

          FRIGGA (CONT'D)

                         (RE: ODIN)
          You can speak to him. He can see
          and hear us, even now.

                         LOKI
          How long will it last?

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 53.

                         FRIGGA
          I don't know. This time is
          different. We were unprepared.

                         LOKI
          I never get used to seeing him like
          this. The most powerful being in
          the Nine Realms lying helpless
          until his body is restored.

                         FRIGGA
          But he's put it off for so long
          now, I fear...
          Loki takes her hand. She's grateful, wipes tears from her
          eyes.

          FRIGGA (CONT'D)
          You're a good son.
          Loki sits there, uncertain how to react, uncertain how he
          really feels.

          FRIGGA (CONT'D)
          We mustn't lose hope that your
          father will return to us. And your
          brother.
          Loki looks to Frigga, concerned.

                         LOKI
          What hope is there for Thor?

                         FRIGGA
          There's always a purpose to
          everything your father does. Thor
          may yet find a way home.
          Loki looks troubled by the revelation. He rises, heads for
          the exit, when they hear the clatter of ARMORED FOOTSTEPS
          hurriedly approaching.

          THE EINHERJAR GUARD
          Enter the room, block his way out. Loki tenses, prepared for
          the worst, but the guards just stand before them. Loki is
          baffled.

          FRIGGA (CONT'D)
          Thor is banished. The line of
          succession falls to you. Until he
          awakens, Asgard is yours.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 53A.
          The Einherjar kneel before the shocked Loki. Another
          EINHERJAR enters, holding Gungnir before him. He kneels
          before Loki, offers the spear to him.

          FRIGGA (CONT'D)
          Make your father proud.
          Loki reaches out tentatively, then takes it. He likes the
          feel of it in his hand.

          62 INT. ISABELA'S DINER - MORNING 62

          Thor, Selvig, Darcy, and Jane sit at a table in the local
          diner. Selvig and Darcy watch as Thor eats ravenously from a
          huge mound of steak and eggs. A couple other full plates --
          pancakes and biscuits and gravy -- are piled high before him.
          Jane's eager, her notebook at the ready.

                         JANE
          Now tell us exactly what happened
          to you last night.
          Thor looks her in the eyes, staring, intrigued. Jane gets
          flustered, looks away.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          Maybe start with how you got inside
          that cloud.

                         DARCY
          And how you could eat an entire box
          of Pop-Tarts and still be this
          hungry.
          Jane shoots her a withering look. Thor downs a cup of
          coffee.

                         THOR
          (re: coffee mug)
          This drink. I like it.

                         DARCY
          (to Thor, re: coffee)
          Yeah, it's great, isn't it?
          Isabela makes the best coffee in
          town.
          Thor hurls the empty mug at the ground, SHATTERING it.

                         THOR

                         (CALLS OUT)
          Another!
          ISABELA ALVAREZ (60), the diner's proprietor, glares at Thor
          from behind the counter.

                         JANE
          Sorry, Izzy. Little accident.

                         (IN SPANISH)
          Yo voy a pagar la taza.
          Isabela turns to a WAITRESS and starts venting quickly in
          Spanish.

                         ISABELA

                         (IN SPANISH)
          Did you see that? The first time
          she brings a man in here, and he's
          a lunatic!

                         JANE
          (to Thor, re: mug)
          What was that?
          He doesn't understand. The other patrons stare at him.

                         THOR
          It was delicious. I want another.

                         JANE
          Then you should just say so!

                         THOR
          I just did.

                         JANE
          I mean ask for it. Nicely.

                         THOR
          I meant no disrespect.

                         JANE
          All right, then no more smashing,
          deal?

                         THOR
          You have my word.

                         JANE
          Good.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 55.
          A few TOWNIES, looking bedraggled, enter and take a seat at
          the counter. We recognize them from the crater. (Among them
          is the Drunk Townie Jake, who is not presently drunk.)

                         ISABELA
          Morning, Pete. Jake.

                         TOWNIE PETE
          The usual, please, Izzy.
          Isabela pours them a couple cups of coffee.

          DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE
          You missed all the excitement out
          at the crater.

                         ISABELA
          What crater?
          Jane and Selvig overhear this, exchange a look, turn to the
          Townies with interest.

                         TOWNIE PETE
          They're saying some kind of
          satellite crashed in the desert.

          DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE
          We were having a good time with it
          till the Feds showed up, chased us
          out.

                         JANE
          (to the Townies)
          Excuse me, did you say there was a
          satellite crash?

          DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE
          Yep. They said it was radioactive.
          And I had my hands all over it.

                         (REALIZING)
          I'm probably sterile now.
          Thor, unconcerned, prepares to dig into the giant pile of
          pancakes. Darcy is amazed by the sight.

                         DARCY
          Oh my God, this is going on
          Facebook.
          Darcy whips out her cellphone.

          DARCY (CONT'D)

                         (TO THOR)
          Smile!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 55A.
          Thor looks puzzled as she SNAPS a photo of him and his
          massive stack of food.

                         SELVIG
          (to the Townies)
          What did the satellite look like?

          DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE
          I don't know nothing about
          satellites. But it was heavy.
          Real heavy. Nobody could lift it.
          This gets Thor's attention.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 56.
          Thor springs to his feet, heads over to Drunk Townie Jake,
          and pulls the Townie around to face him.

                         THOR
          Where?!

          DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE
          About twelve miles east of here.
          Thor grins, his spirits soaring, as he quickly strides out of
          the diner.

                         PETE
          I wouldn't bother! Looked like the
          whole Army was coming in when we
          left!

          63 EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY 63

          Thor studies the position of the sun, gauging his bearings.
          Jane, Darcy, and Selvig catch up to him.

                         JANE
          Where are you going?

                         THOR
          Twelve miles east of here.
          He starts to stride determinedly down the street. Jane walks
          with him.

                         JANE
          Why?

                         THOR
          To get what belongs to me.

                         JANE
          So now you own a satellite?

                         THOR
          It's not what they say it is.

                         JANE
          Whatever it is, the government
          seems to think it's theirs. You
          intend to just walk in there and
          take it?

                         THOR
          Yes.
          He stops walking.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 57.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          If you take me there now, I'll tell
          you everything you wish to know.

                         JANE
          Everything?

                         THOR
          All the answers you seek will be
          yours, once I reclaim Mjolnir.
          Darcy looks to the others.

                         DARCY
          "Myeu-muh?" What's "Myeu-muh?"
          Jane studies Thor. He looks sincere. She's nearly swayed,

                         WHEN:

                         SELVIG
          Jane.
          He pulls her aside. Thor can tell that Selvig doesn't much
          care for him.

          SELVIG (CONT'D)

                         (TO JANE)
          Please don't do this.

                         JANE
          You know what we saw last night.
          This can't be a coincidence. I
          want to know what's in that crater.

                         SELVIG
          I'm not talking about the crater.
          I'm talking about him.

                         JANE
          He's promised us answers.

                         SELVIG
          He's delusional! Listen to what
          he's saying! "Thor." "Bifrost."
          "Mjolnir." These are the stories I
          grew up with as a child!

                         JANE
          I'd just be driving him out there,
          that's all.

                         SELVIG
          It's dangerous. He's dangerous.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 58.
          After a moment, she nods. They head back over to Thor and
          Darcy.

                         JANE
          I'm sorry. I can't take you.

                         THOR
          I understand. Then this is where
          we say goodbye.
          He takes her hand and kisses it.

                         JANE
          That's... thank you.
          Thor bows slightly to each of them.

                         THOR
          Jane Foster... Erik Selvig...
          Darcy. Farewell.
          He heads off down the street. Selvig looks relieved.

                         SELVIG
          Now... let's get back to the lab.
          We have work to do.
          Selvig and Darcy turn and start to go. Jane looks after Thor
          as he walks away down the street.

          64 EXT. ODIN'S PALACE - DAY 64

          Sif joins the Warriors Three as they hurry towards the Throne
          Room.

          65 INT. THRONE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 65

          Two EINHERJAR GUARDS enter, admitting Sif and the Warriors
          Three, who burst through the entrance, heads bowed.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 59.

                         SIF
          Allfather, we must speak with you

                         URGENTLY--
          But as they raise their heads, they stop short to see --

                         LOKI
          Sitting sprawled upon his father's throne. He wears his
          horned ceremonial headdress and holds GUNGNIR in his hand.
          Sif and the others look up, shocked at the sight before them.

                         VOLSTAGG
          What is this?

                         LOKI
          My friends... you haven't heard? I
          am now Ruler of Asgard.

                         FANDRAL
          Where is Odin?

                         LOKI
          Father's fallen into the Odinsleep.
          My mother fears he may never awaken
          again.

                         SIF
          We would speak with her.
          Sif and the Warriors Three exchange a look. Loki notices.

                         LOKI
          She has refused to leave my
          father's bedside. You can bring
          your "urgent" matter to me, your
          King.
          Sif covers quickly.

                         SIF
          We would ask you to end Thor's
          banishment.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 60.

                         LOKI
          My first command can not be to undo
          the Allfather's last. We're on the
          brink of war with Jotunheim. Our
          people must have a sense of
          continuity in order to feel safe in
          these difficult times.
          Sif and the Warriors Three trade looks, not liking any of
          this.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          All of us must stand together, for
          the good of Asgard.

                         FANDRAL
          Of course.
          Sif and the Warriors Three bow their heads and exit. Loki
          stares after them.

          66 EXT. PUENTE ANTIGUO, NEW MEXICO - MAIN STREET - DAY 66

          Jane, Selvig, and Darcy head up the street. They're by
          Arturo's, when a PICK-UP TRUCK pulls up before them, stopped
          by traffic. In the back of the vehicle, Jane notices,
          partially covered by a tarp, the dark matter analysis machine
          from her lab.

                         JANE
          Hey! That's my stuff!

          66A EXT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB 66A

          Jane, Selvig, and Darcy reach the lab, where government
          vehicles are parked. SHIELD AGENTS haul equipment out of the
          lab and load it into waiting vans. Other Agents strip all
          the equipment from inside the Pinzgauer and cart it away.
          Still others emerge from her trailer, arms loaded with
          scientific instruments and documents.

                         JANE
          What the hell is going on here?!
          The Agents ignore her as Agent Coulson approaches.

                         COULSON
          Ms. Foster, I'm Agent Coulson, with

          SHIELD.
          Selvig, recognizing the name of the organization, grows wary.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 60A.

                         JANE
          I don't care who you work for, you
          can't do this!

                         SELVIG
          Jane. This is more serious than
          you realize. Let it go.

                         JANE
          Let it go?! This is my life!

                         COULSON
          We're here investigating a security
          threat. We need to appropriate
          your equipment and all your
          atmospheric data.

                         JANE
          By "appropriate" you mean "steal?"
          Instead of answering, Coulson gives her a check.

                         COULSON
          This should more than compensate
          you for your trouble.
          She throws the check to the ground without looking at it.

                         JANE
          I can't just pick up replacements
          from RadioShack! I made most of
          that equipment myself!

                         COULSON
          Then I'm sure you can do it again.

                         JANE
          And I'm sure I can sue you for
          violating my constitutional rights!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 61.

                         COULSON
          We're the good guys, Ms. Foster.
          He tries to walk away, but Jane blocks his path. She is
          fully herself, fueled by outrage.

                         JANE
          So are we! We're on the verge of

                         UNDERSTANDING SOMETHING
          extraordinary.
          Jane holds up her notebook.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          Everything I know about this
          phenomenon is in this lab and in
          this book, and no one has the right
          to take it from me.
          Coulson gestures to a nearby AGENT, who promptly plucks the
          notebook out of Jane's hands and adds it to the pile he's
          carrying. Jane is stunned.

                         COULSON
          Thank you for your cooperation.
          He gets into a car. The cars and trucks pull away.

          67 INT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB - DAY 67

          Jane, Selvig, and Darcy enter, staring in shock at the now-
          empty space.

                         JANE
          Years of research, gone.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 62.

                         DARCY
          They even took my iPod.

                         SELVIG
          And your back-ups?

                         JANE
          Look around! They took our back-
          ups. They took the back-ups of our
          back-ups.

                         DARCY
          I just downloaded, like, thirty
          songs on there.

                         JANE

                         (TO DARCY)
          Will you please stop talking about
          your iPod?!

                         (TO SELVIG)
          Who are these people?

                         SELVIG
          No one knows much about them. But
          I knew a scientist -- a pioneer in
          gamma radiation. SHIELD showed up,
          and he was never heard from again.

                         JANE
          I'm not going to let them do this.
          I'm getting everything back.

                         SELVIG
          Please, let me contact one of my
          colleagues. Dr. Pym has had some
          dealings with these people. I'll e-
          mail him and see if he can help.

                         DARCY
          They took your laptop, too.
          Annoyed, Selvig thinks.

          67A EXT. PUENTE ANTIGUO LIBRARY - DAY 67A

          Selvig and Jane in the Pinzgauer drive up in front of the
          town's rinky-dink library. A sign in the window reads, "FREE

          INTERNET."

                         SELVIG
          I'll just be a minute.
          He climbs out and heads inside. Jane looks down the street
          and sees something that intrigues her.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 62A.

          68 INT. PET STORE - DAY 68

          Thor enters the store and approaches a PET STORE CLERK.

                         THOR
          I need a horse.

          PET STORE CLERK
          Sorry, we don't sell horses. Just
          dogs, cats, birds.

                         THOR
          Then give me one of those, large
          enough to ride.
          The Pet Store Clerk looks confused.
          Just then, Thor hears a CAR HORN. He turns to the open door.
          Across the street, Jane calls to him from the Pinzgauer.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 63.

                         JANE
          You still want a lift?

          68A INT. PUENTE ANTIGUO LIBRARY - DAY 68A

          It's story time in the library, as a LIBRARIAN reads a book --
          "THE SECRET HISTORY OF GIANTS" -- to a group of kids.

                         LIBRARIAN

                         (READING)
          "And though they're large, giants
          can be quiet. You have to listen
          carefully for the sound of their
          footsteps -- because they may be
          closer than you think."
          Nearby, Selvig sits at a computer terminal, finishing up his
          e-mail. Beside him, a KID flips through a book with
          interest. The Librarian stops mid-story and calls to the Kid
          pleasantly.

          LIBRARIAN (CONT'D)
          Joshua, come sit down. It's story
          time.
          The Kid closes his book and joins the others. Selvig looks
          over, notices the title of the book the Kid was reading --

          "MYTHS AND LEGENDS FROM AROUND THE WORLD."
          He picks it up, flips through it, stops at the section on
          Scandinavian Mythology.
          It's a picture of a RAINBOW BRIDGE coming down from Asgard to
          earth. ASGARDIANS walk upon it, among them ODIN, LOKI, and
          THOR, who wields Mjolnir. On the ground below them, a group
          of VIKINGS kneel reverently.
          He eyes the illustration, pondering.

                         69 OMITTED 69

          70 EXT. DESERT - DUSK 70

          Jane's Pinzgauer cuts off the road, heads over the rugged
          terrain. Storm clouds roll in over the desert sky.

          71 INT. PINZGAUER - DUSK 71

          Jane drives, pumped with adrenaline, nervous and excited, as
          Thor sits beside her, upbeat and eager for battle.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 63A.

                         JANE
          I've never done anything like this
          before! Have you ever done
          anything like this before?
          Thor looks amused by her excitement.

                         THOR
          Many times. You're brave to do it.

                         JANE
          They just stole my entire life's
          work. I really don't have anything
          left to lose.

                         THOR
          But you're clever. Far more clever
          than anyone else in this Realm.

                         JANE
          "This Realm?" Why do you talk like
          that?

                         THOR
          You think me strange?
          Jane laughs, catches herself.

                         JANE
          Yeah. Just a little.

                         THOR
          Good strange or bad strange?

                         JANE
          I'm not quite sure yet.
          She looks at him, sees him staring at her. She's lost in his
          gaze, distracted, when the PINZGAUER LURCHES. She quickly
          turns her eyes forward, regains control of the car.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          Sorry.
          She glances back at him. He's confident, determined.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          Who are you? Really?

                         THOR
          You'll see soon enough.

                         JANE
          You promised me answers.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 63B.
          Thor looks at her, charmed by her persistence.

                         THOR
          What you seek -- it's a bridge.

                         JANE
          A bridge? Like an Einstein-Rosen
          Bridge?

                         THOR
          More like a rainbow bridge.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 64.
          A beat.

                          JANE
          God, I hope you're not crazy.

          71A EXT. DESERT - NIGHT 71A

          As the Pinzgauer heads away, we continue up a hillside,
          revealing a light illuminating the valley beyond. As we move
          closer, we see the glow comes from --

          A MASSIVE SHIELD BASE
          Now set up around the crater -- vehicles, trailers,
          barricades. Armed GUARDS man a gate in the razor wire fence
          that runs fifty yards from the crater's edge, enclosing the
          complex.
          Clear, plastic access tubes with junction boxes lead to a
          translucent cube structure erected in the middle of the
          crater.
          Through the glass walls of the base's command trailer, we see
          Coulson directing TECHNICIANS, busy at work.
          Within the cube structure itself, a team of SHIELD SCIENTISTS
          work with high-tech machinery, analyzing the object at the
          center of it all -- Mjolnir.

          72 EXT. RIDGE ABOVE CRATER - NIGHT 72

          Jane and Thor crawl to the edge of the ridge, look through
          binoculars, see the impressive SHIELD base.

                         JANE
          That isn't a satellite crash. They
          would have hauled the wreckage
          away, not built a city around it.
          Thor shrugs out of his jacket and hands it to her.

                         THOR
          You're going to need this.

                         JANE
          Why?--
          Thunder RUMBLES overhead. She stares at him intently and
          takes his jacket.

                         THOR
          Stay here. Once I have Mjolnir, I
          will return what they stole from
          you.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 64A.
          He looks to her, already knowing that Jane may disobey his
          request.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Deal?

                         JANE
          No! Look what's down there! You
          can't just walk in, grab our stuff,
          and walk out!

                         THOR
          No.
          Jane looks relieved.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          I'm going to fly out.
          Before she can react, he starts heading towards the crater.
          The first drops of rain begin to patter into the dust.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 65.

                         JANE
          Wait...
          But Thor is already headed towards the crater.

          72A EXT. SHIELD BASE / INT. HAMMER CONTAINMENT CUBE STRUCTURE 72A

          A NEEDLE spikes on a handheld SENSOR DEVICE. The TECHNICIAN
          holding it looks over at the hammer. Mjolnir begins to give
          off a subtle glow. A bolt of lightning CRACKS across the sky
          above.

                         CUT TO:

          73 AN AERIAL INFRARED VIDEO IMAGE OF THE AREA 73
          It's fuzzy, doesn't show much. We widen to see we are:

          74 INT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - SECURITY ROOM 74

          A younger SHIELD agent, a TECHIE in a headset, monitors
          security. AGENT SITWELL, humorless, just this side of
          junior, looks on, none-too-pleased.

                         TECHIE
          Feed from the keyhole. Can barely
          penetrate the cloud cover.
          The Techie hikes a thumb at another monitor, SQUELCHING with
          static. It shows an SAR shot of the area, laid over a
          terrain map.

          TECHIE (CONT'D)
          Tech's barely working as it is,
          with all the interference that
          thing's giving off.
          He gestures towards the hammer. He checks a computer.

          TECHIE (CONT'D)
          Hey, we've got a commercial
          aircraft coming in right over us,
          Southwest Airlines Flight 5434.

                         SITWELL
          Reroute it, like all the others.

                         TECHIE
          Right. Can I get the passengers
          some free drinks for the trouble?
          Sitwell glares at him.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 65A.

          TECHIE (CONT'D)

                         (SHRUGS)
          It'd be a nice gesture.
          The Techie types into the computer, when he notices something
          on another screen, holds up a hand.

          TECHIE (CONT'D)
          Hold a sec... we got something
          outside the fence, west side...
          He points at the screen. Through the haze, it shows a
          THERMAL IMAGE huddled beside the fence.

                         SITWELL
          (into a radio)
          DeLancey, Jackson -- check it out.

          74A EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE 74A

          A pair of SHIELD AGENTS (DELANCEY and JACKSON) take off in a
          jeep to investigate.

          74B EXT. SHIELD SECURITY ROOM 74B

          Sitwell looks out the window, something strange catching his
          attention. We see in the window's reflection that a glow is
          coming from the hammer containment area.

          75 EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - FENCE - MOMENTS LATER 75

          The jeep pulls up as the Agents scan the fence with a
          flashlight, see nothing unusual.

                         AGENT JACKSON

                         (INTO RADIO)
          Looks like we're good here. Must
          have been another coyote.
          Just then, the Agents notice a section of the fence has been
          bent up from the ground, leaving a gap.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 66.
          Before they can call it in, a massive CRACK OF LIGHTNING
          illuminates the night sky -- revealing the silhouette of a
          large man standing outside the driver's (Jackson's) side of
          the jeep. DeLancey looks over, notices.

                         AGENT DELANCEY
          Jackson?
          The Agents reach for their weapons. Thor elbows the driver
          across the jaw, causing him to drop his weapon. Jackson
          slumps over the steering wheel, as DeLancey starts to raise a
          shotgun at Thor.
          Thor grabs the barrel, yanks it out of DeLancey's hands and
          thrusts the hilt back, smashing the Agent's jaw.
          Thor reaches into the jeep to grab a rain slicker.

          75A INT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - SECURITY 75A

          Sitwell talks into his radio, starting to look worried.

                         SITWELL

                         (INTO RADIO)
          DeLancey, Jackson -- report.

          76 EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - MOMENTS LATER 76

          Thor, now wearing a SHIELD rain slicker, makes his way across
          the base.
          Another SHIELD AGENT approaches the jeep, spots the
          unconscious DeLancey and Jackson. He quickly calls into his
          radio.

                         SHIELD AGENT
          Agents down! We've got a perimeter
          breach!

          77 INT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - SECURITY 77

          The security monitors SQUELCH with static and interference.
          Sitwell holds his PDA -- even it's on the fritz. Sitwell and
          the Techie watch the monitors warily.
          On the monitor showing the hammer containment area, Mjolnir
          starts to crackle with energy.

                         SITWELL
          (to the Techie)
          Get Coulson.
          Sitwell punches an alarm.

          78 EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE 78

          As Thor makes his way towards the crater, an alarm sounds and
          SECURITY LIGHTS explode to life.

          78A EXT. RIDGE ABOVE CRATER 78A

          A spotlight fires out from the base and sweeps across the
          ridge towards Jane. She ducks down, out of sight.
          She pulls out her cellphone and dials. We hear Selvig's
          recorded message.

          SELVIG (V.O., ON PHONE)
          You've reached Dr. Erik Selvig.
          Please leave me a message.
          His voicemail BEEPS. She talks quietly, urgently.

                         JANE
          Erik, okay, first of all, don't
          worry. I'm perfectly fine, really.
          More sounds of MAYHEM come from the base.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          But if you don't hear from me
          again, you might want to come out
          to the crater site and look for me.
          I kind of did what you said I
          shouldn't do. Thanks. Bye.
          She hangs up.

          79 EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - COMMAND TRAILER 79

          Coulson emerges from the SHIELD command trailer and marches
          across the mud, radio to his ear. He looks out across the
          lit up site uneasily.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 67.

          80 EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - NIGHT 80

          A SHIELD GUARD moves through the base, rifle in hand. From
          the shadows behind a trailer, a FIGURE looks out at him.
          As the Guard raises his radio to check in, Thor quickly
          rushes towards him and chokes him out. He falls to the
          ground.
          Thor notices the AR-15 rifle lying on the ground beside the
          fallen Guard. He stares down at the weapon quizzically. As
          more GUARDS approach, Thor snatches up the weapon and takes
          cover in the shadows of the trailer. The Guards pass by.
          Thor peers around the corner, sees the well-guarded main
          entrance tube to the center of the site.
          A bright light suddenly illuminates his face. He looks to
          see an ATV moving across the site, shining its spotlight
          right on him.
          Thor sees that the ATV DRIVER has spotted him. The Driver
          raises his radio to report. Thor knows he has to act fact.
          He raises the rifle -- then flips it over in the air and
          catches it by the barrel. He rears the weapon back, then
          hurls it like a hammer. It flies through the air, smashing
          the ATV's spotlight.
          Glass and debris shower the driver, who takes his hands off
          the wheel to protect himself.
          The ATV roars out of control past the Guards near the tube
          entrance. The Guards notice and chase after it.
          Thor emerges from the shadows, watches the Guards abandoning
          the site entrance.

          80A EXT. EDGE OF CRATER 80A

          The ATV Driver looks forward in panic as the ATV approaches
          the crater lip.
          The vehicle careens over the edge of the crater and heads
          straight for one of the plastic tunnels. The Technicians
          inside scatter as the ATV CRASHES into it, tearing into the
          tunnel, sending sparks everywhere.
          The ATV finally comes to a stop, the tunnel collapsing around
          it and the Driver. SHIELD AGENTS rush in behind to help.

           Jane peers over the ridge, stares down at the frenzied
           aftermath of the ATV crash, at the base on high alert.
           Lightning CRACKS in the sky behind her.

          Coulson climbs to the lip of the crater as a light rain
          begins to fall. He eyes the damage of the ATV crash.
          He's not pleased. The light rain becomes a downpour.

          82C EXT. MAIN ENTRANCE TUBE 82C

          As SHIELD Agents pull the ATV driver from the wreckage, Thor
          races towards the unguarded entrance to the tunnels and heads
          inside.

          82D INT. ENTRANCE TUBE 82D

          Thor races up the entrance ramp. Before him, two GUARDS
          round the corner.
          Thor knocks out the first Guard, then tackles the second. He
          hurries around the corner, when more GUARDS come up a ladder
          ahead. Thor punches the closest Guard, sending him tumbling
          backwards, toppling the others on the ladder behind him.
          Thor takes off running, as the Guards regroup and give chase.
          Thor spots the glow of Mjolnir in the central cube, through
          the translucent walls of the tunnels. He hurries through to
          tunnels to find a way towards it.

          82E EXT. EDGE OF CRATER 82E

          Coulson stands on the crater lip, barking out orders, as the
          Guards in the tunnel rush to cut off Thor.
          Coulson activates his radio.

          As Thor races through the tunnel, a GUARD runs right at him,
          on a collision course. Thor takes him out with a punch to
          the gut, then turns to see more AGENTS coming towards him.
          Thor picks up the fallen Guard he punched, then throws him
          into the approaching Agents, scattering them.
          Thor turns around, runs back the way he came. The Agents
          give chase.

          83 EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - CRANE SITE 83

          The crane holding Barton arcs out over the structure. Barton
          takes aim.

                         BARTON

                         (INTO RADIO)
          One shot, one kill, sir. Just give
          the word.

          BARTON'S NIGHTVISION POV
          Overlooking the complex. It's a clear field of vision,
          nowhere to hide. A digital read-out gives information on the
          distance to the target. He locks in on Thor, who's inside
          the plastic tubing, emerging from the junction box and
          heading towards the cube structure.

          BARTON (CONT'D)
          Hello, handsome.

          83A INT. TUNNEL 83A

          Thor races through the tunnel, comes across a wall of AGENTS.
          Thor ROARS and barrels through them -- elbowing, punching --
          whatever it takes to keep moving.
          As he takes down the last Agent, Thor sees the last junction
          box and the entrance to the cube structure up ahead.
          He races towards it. He can actually see Mjolnir within the
          middle of the structure, when -- BAM! From out of nowhere, a
          fist lands a powerful blow across his jaw, sending him
          reeling. Dazed, Thor looks up to see --

          A HUGE SHIELD AGENT
          The biggest of them all, standing between him and his hammer
          in the cube structure beyond. Thor sizes him up.

                         THOR
           You're big.
          Thor grins.

           THOR (CONT'D)
           Fought bigger.

          83B EXT. JUNCTION BOX 83B

          Thor and the Huge Agent explode through the wall of the
          junction box, then crash into the mud, sending them sliding.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 68A.

          83C EXT. CRANE BUCKET 83C

          Barton has Thor in his sites. The sniper stands still as a
          statue.

          83D INT. TUNNEL 83D

          Coulson hurries through the tunnel, ready to give the word to
          Barton, when he stops short. He sees what looks like an
          electrical storm erupting inside the structure ahead,
          directly above the crater... and the hammer.

          83E EXT. RIDGE ABOVE CRATER 83E

          Jane sees SHIELD Agents and Guards swarming into the cube
          containment structure.

                         JANE
          No...

          84 EXT. CRATER 84

          Thor and the Huge Agent struggle to stand in the mud.
          Through the translucent walls of the cube structure, Thor
          sees Mjolnir. The Huge Agent rises up before him, blocking
          his view.
          Rain and blood run down Thor's face. He lunges forward,
          whipping his feet in front of him, then kicks out, nailing
          the Huge Agent in the chest. The Agent goes down hard as
          Thor's momentum carries him past.
          Thor stands, heads for the cube structure, when the Huge
          Guard grabs his ankle in a last effort. Thor looks back down
          at his foe, then drops backwards, pile driving his elbow into
          the fallen Agent's chest. The Huge Agent grimaces in pain,
          defeated.
          Thor races back towards the structure.

          84H INT. HAMMER CONTAINMENT CUBE 84H

          From outside, Thor rips an opening in the plastic wall of the
          structure.
          He stands there -- soaking, bleeding, caked with wet earth.
          His hammer rests just a few yards before him, energy surging
          around it.
          Coulson steps into the structure through an access tunnel,
          one story up.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 68B.
          As Thor approaches his hammer, Mjolnir starts to glow
          brighter, blue electricity sparking off its surface. The
          crackling energy seems to reach out to him. Coulson notices,
          his interest piqued.
          Above the open ceiling of the structure, Barton's crane
          bucket comes into view.

          84I EXT. CRANE BUCKET 84I

          Wind and rain whip around Barton as he stares into his rifle
          site, locked on the back of Thor's head -- his finger on the
          trigger.

          84J INT. HAMMER CONTAINMENT CUBE 84J

          Thor stands next to the hammer, feels its power. He reaches
          out to it confidently.
          Coulson watches from above. Armed AGENTS approach behind
          him. He motions for them to hold their positions, then
          radios Barton.

                         COULSON
          Barton...

          84K EXT. CRANE BUCKET 84K

          Barton stands ready to take Thor down. His finger starts to
          squeeze the trigger.

          COULSON (V.O., ON RADIO)
          ...hold your fire.
          Barton releases the trigger, pulls up.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 69.

          84L INT. HAMMER CONTAINMENT CUBE 84L

          Coulson watches Thor with anticipation as Thor wraps his hand
          around the hammer. He smiles, triumphant, lifts... but the
          hammer doesn't move.
          Thor looks confused, tries again with two hands, to no avail
          -- anger and frustration overtaking him. He strains with all
          his might, SCREAMS from the effort, bellowing up at the storm
          and lightning above him.
          Something begins to appear on the side of Mjolnir -- glowing
          RUNES. Thor looks down, sees them.
          But, still, the hammer doesn't budge. Thor falls to his
          knees before it, rain pouring down around him, as the glowing
          runes fade away. He's failed. Unworthy.
          Coulson looks on, disappointed.
          SHIELD AGENTS move in, guns trained on Thor, surrounding him.
          Coulson activates his radio.

                         COULSON
          Ground units, move in. Show's
          over.
          As the Agents surround him, Thor doesn't seem to notice or
          care. He just sits there on his knees, head bowed in the
          rain -- a man broken, lost.
          From overhead, we see the hammer in the cube containment
          room. We pull up as the Guards approach Thor, then continue
          to climb, until we see the whole camp -- and the extensive
          damage Thor's done to it during the melee.

          86 EXT. RIDGE ABOVE CRATER - NIGHT 86

          Jane lowers her binoculars, sensing things have gone from bad
          to worse.
          She steels herself, then starts over the ridge to help him.
          Almost immediately, a SPOTLIGHT sweeps past her. She hears
          the sound of DOGS and SHIELD AGENTS approaching, sees the
          glow of flashlights moving from the base towards her.
          With no other choice, she makes a quick retreat.

          Heimdall stands at his post, watching the scene. He lowers
          his head.

          88 INT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB - NIGHT 88

          Jane stands with Selvig and Darcy in the empty lab.
          Darcy picks up the book Selvig checked out of the library,
          looks through it.

                         JANE
          I can't just leave him there.

          Why not?

                          JANE
          You didn't see what happened.
          Darcy points at an illustration of Thor's hammer in the book.

                         DARCY
          Hey! Myeu-muh!
          Jane looks at the illustration in the book, turns to Selvig
          knowingly.

                         JANE

                         (RE: BOOK)
          Where did you find this?
          Selvig grabs the book from them, quickly closes it.

                         SELVIG
          In the children's section. I
          wanted to show you how ridiculous
          his story was.
          Jane is unconvinced by this. She knows he wants to believe.

                         JANE
          Aren't you the one who's always
          told me to chase down all leads,
          all possibilities?

                         SELVIG
          I was talking about science, not
          magic!

                         JANE
          Magic's just science we don't
          understand yet. Arthur C. Clarke.

                         SELVIG
          Who wrote science fiction.

                         JANE
          The precursor of science fact.

                         SELVIG
          In some cases.

                         JANE
          If that's really an Einstein-Rosen
          Bridge out there, then there's
          something on the other side.

          Jane...

                         DARCY
          A primitive culture like the
          Vikings might have worshipped them
          as deities.
          They give her a look, surprised by her unexpectedly
          insightful input. Darcy shrugs. Jane points at her,
          grateful for the support.

                         JANE
          Yes! Exactly! Thank you!
          Darcy beams.

                         SELVIG
          Jane, if you do this, you'll find
          yourself in a situation that I
          won't be able to get you out of
          this time.

                         DARCY
          I'll help you.
          Jane looks grateful. Selvig looks at her, sees there's no
          stopping her. He sighs.

          89 INT. SHIELD HOLDING CELL - NIGHT 89

          Thor sits in a chair, staring forward blankly, hands cuffed
          behind him. Coulson stands across from him.

                         COULSON
          It's not easy to do what you did.
          You made us all look like a bunch
          of mall cops. That's hurtful.

                         (THEN)
          The men you so easily subdued are
          highly-trained professionals, and
          in my experience, it takes someone
          who's received similar training to
          do what you did to them. Would you
          like to tell me where you received
          your training?
          Thor sits silently.

          COULSON (CONT'D)
          Pakistan? Chechnya? Afghanistan?
          Then again, you strike me more as
          the soldier of fortune type. What
          was it, South Africa?
          Still no answer. Coulson leans in close to him.

          COULSON (CONT'D)
          Certain groups pay well for a good
          mercenary. Especially HYDRA.
          Coulson waits for a response, but gets none.

          COULSON (CONT'D)
          Who are you?

                         THOR
          Just a man.

                         COULSON
          One way or another, we find out
          what we want to know. We're good
          at that.
          Coulson leaves the room. Thor lowers his head.

          LOKI (O.S.)
          I thought he'd never leave.
          Thor looks up, shocked to find Loki standing there, dressed
          in 21st century attire.

                         THOR
          Loki? What are you doing here?

                         LOKI
          I had to see you.

                         THOR
          What's happened? Tell me! Is it
          Jotunheim? Let me explain to

                         FATHER--

                         LOKI
          Father is dead.
          Thor stares at him, stunned.

                         THOR
          What?

                         LOKI
          Your banishment, the threat of a
          new war, it was too much for him to
          bear.
          The implications of Loki's words dawn on Thor -- he's
          responsible for his father's fate. Loki draws close to him,
          looks in his eyes, consolingly.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          You mustn't blame yourself. I know
          that you loved him. I tried to
          tell him so, but he wouldn't
          listen.

                         (THEN)
          It was cruel to put the hammer
          within your reach, knowing you
          could never lift it.
          Thor stares ahead, falling deeper into the abyss.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          The burden of the throne has fallen
          to me now.

                         THOR
          Can I come home?

                         LOKI
          The truce with Jotunheim is
          conditional upon your exile.

                         THOR
          But couldn't we find a way to--

                         LOKI
          Mother has forbidden your return.
          Thor nods, lowers his head, beaten.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          This is goodbye, brother. I'm so
          sorry.

                         THOR
          No, I'm sorry. Loki... thank you
          for coming here.

                         LOKI
          Nothing could have stopped me.
          Coulson enters the room, but seems to take no notice of Loki.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          Fare well, brother.

                         THOR
          Good-bye.

                         COULSON
          Good-bye? I just got back.
          Thor looks up to see that Loki is gone.

          COULSON (CONT'D)
          Now. Where did we leave off?

          90 EXT. CRATER - NIGHT 90

          Agents and Scientists work to repair the damaged area around
          Mjolnir. They take no notice of Loki as he steps up beside
          the hammer. He stares at it -- intrigued, wondering. Can he
          do it?
          He reaches down, tries to lift it -- but can't. He lets it
          go, eyes it with contempt, then steps away.
          He gestures with his arms. An odd GREEN AND GOLD LIGHT rises
          from the ground, enveloping him, then he disappears.

          91 INT. HOLDING CELL - NIGHT 91

          Sitwell enters and speaks sotto to Coulson.

                         SITWELL

                         (RE: THOR)
          Sir... he's got a visitor.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 74.

          92 INT. SECURITY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 92

          Coulson and several other SHIELD AGENTS stand across from
          Erik Selvig.

                         COULSON
          "Donald Blake?"

                         SELVIG
          Doctor Donald Blake. He's part of
          our team.

                         COULSON
          You have dangerous coworkers, Dr.
          Selvig.

                         SELVIG
          Troubled, not dangerous. He was
          distraught when he found out that
          you'd taken all of our research.
          It was years of his life, gone! He
          got depressed, started drinking,
          and... well, you know the rest.

                         COULSON
          Uh-huh. You mind if we take a
          moment to verify his identity?

                         SELVIG
          Certainly.
          The Techie at a computer nearby runs the name.

          SELVIG (CONT'D)
          You can understand how a man could
          go off like that. I mean, a big,
          faceless organization like yours,
          coming in with their jack-booted
          thugs and stealing private
          property...

                         (THEN)
          ...is how he described it.

                         COULSON
          That doesn't explain how he managed
          to tear through our security.
          Selvig shrugs.

                         SELVIG
          Steroids. He's a bit of a fitness
          nut.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 74A.
          On the Techie's monitor, a DMV record from the State of New
          York pops up reading "DR. DONALD BLAKE". The license photo
          is indeed a picture of Thor -- the one Darcy took with her
          cellphone.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 75.
          The Techie hits a button, and a graphic reads, "SHIELD
          SECURITY ANALYSIS IN PROGRESS." Coulson eyes the screen.
          After a beat, he turns back to Selvig.

                         COULSON
          It says here he's an M.D.

                         SELVIG
          He is. That is, he was. He
          switched careers and became a
          physicist. He's quite brilliant,
          really.

                         (THEN)
          If you would just release him to
          me, I promise to keep an eye on
          him.
          Coulson thinks, sizing Selvig up -- then smiles. He turns to
          an AGENT nearby.

                         COULSON
          Release Dr. Blake to Dr. Selvig
          here.
          The Techie looks to him, surprised.

          COULSON (CONT'D)

                         (TO SELVIG)
          Make sure he stays in town for the
          next few days in case we need to
          talk to him again.
          Selvig shakes his hand.

                         SELVIG
          Thank you.

          92A INT. SHIELD HOLDING CELL - NIGHT 92A

          Selvig bursts into the room with a SHIELD Agent to find a
          seated Thor.

                         SELVIG
          Donny, Donny, Donny! There you
          are!
          Thor looks up, unsure what the hell is going on. Selvig
          pulls Thor to his feet, gives him a warm hug.

          SELVIG (CONT'D)
          It's going to be all right, my
          friend. Come on, I'm taking you
          home.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 75A.
          He leads the bewildered Thor out the door.

          92B EXT. COULSON'S TRAILER - NIGHT 92B

          As Thor and Selvig make their way past the SHIELD Security
          Room, Thor notices Jane's possessions and equipment from the
          Smith Motors lab stacked under a tarp. He spots Jane's hand-
          written journal among them. As he passes, he quickly takes
          it from the pile and pockets it.

          92C INT. SECURITY ROOM - NIGHT 92C

          Coulson looks at the computer bearing Donald Blake's DMV
          record. A security warning over the image clearly reads
          "SECURITY ALERT: FALSIFIED DATA." He knows it's been a ruse
          all along.
          He looks to Selvig and Thor heading away from the Security
          Room, then follows them outside.

          93 EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - NIGHT 93

          Coulson and two SHIELD Agents watch as Selvig walks with Thor
          away from the base to the SUV. Coulson calls to Selvig.

                         COULSON
          Just keep him away from the bars.

                         SELVIG
          I will!

                         THOR

                         (TO SELVIG)
          Where are we going?
          Selvig drops his cool demeanor.

                         SELVIG
          To get a drink.
          Selvig and Thor climb into the SUV.
          As they drive off, Coulson turns to the other two agents --
          GARRETT and CALE.

                         COULSON
          Follow them.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 76.

          94 EXT. JOTUNHEIM - DAY 94

          Loki, looking apprehensive, walks alone across the icy
          surface of the planet.

          95 INT. LAUFEY'S TEMPLE - DAY 95

          Darkness shrouds the ruined temple, save for the shafts of
          light which knife their way in through the damaged ceiling.
          Loki enters. Frost Giant guards surround him on all sides.
          Laufey approaches, towers over him menacingly.

                         LAUFEY
          Tell me why I shouldn't kill you.

                         LOKI
          I've come alone and unarmed.

                         LAUFEY
          To what end?

                         LOKI
          To make you another proposition.

                         LAUFEY

                         (REALIZING)
          So you're the one who let us into
          Asgard.

                         LOKI
          You're welcome.

                         LAUFEY
          My men are dead, and I have no
          Casket. You are a deceiver.
          Laufey lashes out, grabs Loki around the throat, but Loki
          calmly stands his ground.

                         LOKI
          You have no idea what I am.
          The blueness spreads across his face, as Laufey and the
          guards stare in shock. Loki grins.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          Hello, Father.
          Laufey releases him. Loki's body turns back to normal.
          Intrigued, Laufey sizes up his son.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 76A.

                         LAUFEY
          Ah, the bastard son. I thought
          Odin had killed you. That's what I
          would have done. He's as weak as
          you are.

                         LOKI
          No longer weak. I now rule Asgard,
          until Odin awakens. Perhaps you
          should not have so carelessly
          abandoned me.
          This gives Laufey pause.

                         LAUFEY
          Or perhaps it was the wisest choice
          I've ever made. I will hear you.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 77.

                         LOKI
          I will conceal you and a handful of
          your soldiers, lead you into his
          chambers, and let you slay him
          where he lies. I'll keep the
          throne, and you will have the
          Casket.
          Laufey studies Loki's face.

                         LAUFEY
          Why would you do this?

                         LOKI
          When all is done, we will have a
          permanent peace between our two
          worlds. Then I, the bastard son,
          will have accomplished what Odin
          and Thor never could.

                         LAUFEY
          This is a great day for Jotunheim.
          Asgard is finally ours.

                         LOKI
          No. Asgard is mine. The rest of
          the Nine Realms will be yours, if
          you do as you're told.
          Laufey considers the proposition.

                         LAUFEY
          I accept.
          Loki turns to leave. As he goes, the slightest trace of a
          smile crosses his face.

          96 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 96

          Loki emerges out of the Bifrost, as Heimdall steps away from
          his controls. Heimdall glares at Loki. Loki notices.

                         LOKI
          What troubles you, Gatekeeper?

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 78.

                         HEIMDALL
          I turned my gaze upon you in
          Jotunheim, but could neither see
          nor hear you. You were shrouded
          from me, like the Frost Giants who
          entered this Realm.

                         LOKI
          Perhaps your senses have weakened
          after your many years of service.

                         HEIMDALL
          Or perhaps someone has found a way
          to hide that which he does not wish
          me to see.
          Loki sizes him up, smiles.

                         LOKI
          You have great power, Heimdall.
          Tell me, did Odin ever fear you?

                         HEIMDALL
          No.

                         LOKI
          And why is that?

                         HEIMDALL
          Because he is my King, and I am
          sworn to obey him.

                         LOKI
          Exactly. Just as you're sworn to
          obey me now. Yes?
          A beat.

                         HEIMDALL
          Yes.

                         LOKI
          Good. Then you will open the
          Bifrost to no one until I have
          undone what my brother has started.
          Loki heads out of the Observatory. Heimdall stares after
          him.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 78A.

          97 INT. BAR - NIGHT 97

          Thor and Selvig sit at a booth at the back of the local dive.
          The bartender sets down a couple mugs of beer and two shots
          of whiskey. Selvig pours the shot into his mug and downs it.
          Thor follows his example.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 79.

                         SELVIG
          Seems Darcy's a terrible intern,
          but a talented hacker.

                         THOR
          Thank you for what you've done.

                         SELVIG
          Don't thank me. I only did it for 
          Jane.

                         THOR
          Are you in love with her?

                         SELVIG
          Of course not! Jane's like a
          daughter to me. Her father and I
          taught at University together. A
          good man, but he never listened.
          This registers with Thor.

                         THOR
          Neither did I.
          Selvig eyes him with interest.

                         SELVIG
          I don't know if you're really 
          delusional, and I really don't care 
          at this point. I just care about 
          her. I've seen the way she looks
          at you.

                         THOR
          I swear to you, I mean her no harm.

                         SELVIG
          Good. If that's the case, then
          I'll buy you one more drink, and 
          you'll leave town tonight. 
          A long pause, then Thor nods. He takes a drink.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 80.

                         THOR
          I had it all backwards. I had it
          all wrong.
          Selvig watches him keenly. This is a different Thor than
          he's seen before.

                         SELVIG
          It's not a bad thing, finding out
          that you don't have all the
          answers. That's when you start
          asking the right questions.
          Thor takes this in.

                         THOR
          For the first time in my life, I
          have no idea what I'm supposed to
          do. 

                         SELVIG
          Anyone who's ever going to find 
          their way in this world has to
          start by admitting they don't know
          where the hell they are.
          Thor nods.

          DRUNK TOWNIE (O.S.)
          Hey, I know you, man... 
          An intimidating DRUNK TOWNIE nearby sizes up Thor. He is one 
          of the Townies from Isabela's Diner who saw Thor earlier. He
          approaches, belligerent and looking for a fight. 

          DRUNK TOWNIE (CONT'D)
          You were in the diner with that hot 
          girl.
          Thor doesn't like where this is going. 

          DRUNK TOWNIE (CONT'D)
          I wouldn't mind her doing a little
          research on me.
          He laughs. Thor is annoyed. 

                         THOR
          I have no quarrel with you. But 
          she's a lady. You should be more 
          respectful.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 80A.

                          DRUNK TOWNIE
           And you should shut the hell up, 
           princess.
           Selvig looks to Thor, concerned that he's going to lose it. 
           But, to his surprise, Thor remains unaffected by the Townie's 
          baiting. 

                          THOR 
           I will not fight him. 

                          DRUNK TOWNIE 
           Then it'll be easy to kick your 
           ass. 
           Selvig stands, steps between the two men.

                          SELVIG
           Gentlemen, please. Let's keep our 
           heads. 
          Just then, Selvig HEAD-BUTTS the Townie, knocking him out.
          Thor's impressed. Selvig downs his drink, then hurls his
          glass aside, SHATTERING it on the ground.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 81.

          SELVIG (CONT'D)

                         (TO THOR)
          Another drink?

          98 EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT 98

          Thor and Selvig stumble down the street, singing a NORWEGIAN
          FOLK SONG. They improvise an impromptu drinking song dance
          routine involving side steps and happy slaps, optimistically
          in time with the song.

                         THOR/SELVIG

                         (SINGING)
          "The mood is good, our hearts are
          full, there's magic in the air. /
          It's all because we're here
          tonight, and haven't got a care. /
          So raise a glass, and toast to
          life, wherever it may lead / Tra-la-
          la, tra-la-la, a friend is fine
          indeed. / Tra-la-la, tra-la-la, a
          friend is fine indeed!"
          Thor holds up a hand for Selvig's last finishing slap.
          Selvig misses it completely and falls out of frame like a
          straight dead weight with a CLUNK.
          WIDE SHOT. Emerging from behind the car where Selvig fell,
          Thor stands up, Selvig slung over his shoulder, and starts to
          walk up the street towards Jane's trailer.

          99 INT. JANE'S TRAILER - NIGHT 99

          The small trailer is in a state of perpetual disarray, strewn
          with various books, old pizza boxes, etc. A worried Jane
          lies on her bed, trying to read.
          She's startled by the loud RAPPING on the door. She bolts to
          the door and opens it to find --

                         THOR
          Standing there with the unconscious Selvig slung over his
          shoulder.

                         JANE
          Erik!

                         (TO THOR)
          Is he all right?

                         THOR
          He's fine. Not injured at all.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 81A.
          As Thor enters, he BANGS Selvig's head on the doorway.
          Selvig GROANS.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Sorry, my friend.

                         JANE
          What happened?

                         THOR
          We drank. We fought. He made his
          ancestors proud.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 82.

                         JANE
          Put him on the bed.
          Thor moves through the small trailer carrying Selvig, like a
          bear lugging another bear, smashing into things along the
          way, until he finally sets Selvig down on Jane's bed. Selvig
          awakens groggily and looks up at him through bleary eyes.

                         SELVIG
          I still don't believe you're the
          God of Thunder.

                         (THEN)
          But you ought to be.
          Thor grins, pats him on the cheek. As Selvig drifts off to
          sleep, Thor pulls a blanket over him.
          Jane watches, stunned by their friendship, impressed by
          Thor's tenderness. Thor turns back to her, looks around.

                         THOR
          These are your chambers?
          Jane suddenly becomes self-conscious. She starts cleaning up
          the mess around her.

                         JANE
          Well, it's more of a temporary
          living space, really. I don't
          usually have visitors in here.
          Actually, never...
          Thor picks up a sock off the floor. She snatches it from
          him, puts it away.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          Can we go outside?

          100 EXT. SMITH MOTORS - ROOF - NIGHT 100

          Thor steps off a ladder onto the roof of Smith Motors. He
          offers Jane his hand, helps her up. There's a telescope set
          up, a couple chairs, some blankets.

                         JANE
          I come up here sometimes when I
          can't sleep. Or when I'm trying to
          reconcile particle data. Or when
          Darcy's driving me crazy.

                         (THEN)
          I come up here a lot, now that I
          think about it.
          Thor looks at the night sky, filled with stars.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 82A.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          I'm glad you're safe.

                         THOR
          You've been very kind. I've been
          far less grateful than you deserve.

                         JANE
          I also hit you with my car a couple
          times, so it kind of evens out.
          He grins, then reaches into his pocket and pulls out her

          NOTEBOOK.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          I don't believe it...
          She takes it from him, surprised and grateful.

                         THOR
          It was all I could get back. Not
          as much as I promised. I'm sorry.

                         JANE
          No, this is good. Thank you. This
          means I don't have to start from
          scratch...
          She sits down and opens the notebook eagerly, then stops, a
          harsh realization clouding her face. Thor notices.

                         THOR
          What's wrong?

                         JANE
          SHIELD, whatever they are. They're
          never going to let this research
          see the light of day.

                         THOR
          You must do this. You must finish
          what you've started.

                         JANE
          Why?

                         THOR
          Because you're right. It's taken
          so many generations for your people
          to get to this point. You're
          nearly there. You just need
          someone to show you how close you
          really are.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 83.
          Thor moves beside her, opens her notebook, turns to the page
          which bears a sketch of the Bifrost. He takes the pen from
          the notebook, begins to add to the sketch, leading from one
          point to another in space.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Look -- your ancestors called it
          magic. You call it science. I
          come from a place where they're one
          and the same thing.
          We recognize that Thor is drawing the branches of Yggdrasil
          as she looks on, amazed and intrigued.

                         JANE
          What is it?

                         THOR
          This is how my father explained it
          to me...

                         (THEN)
          Your world is one of the Nine
          Realms of the Cosmos, linked to
          each other by the branches of
          Yggdrasil, the Worlds Tree. Now,
          you see it every day, without
          realizing. Images glimpsed through
          -- what did you call it?...
          (checks her notebook)
          ...this Hubble Telescope. So, Nine
          Realms...
          They look at each other. She nods. They smile. This is
          going to be a long night.

          101 EXT. SMITH MOTORS - ROOF - LATER 101

          Jane sleeps beside Thor on the blankets on the rooftop. He
          stares up at the night sky.
          She rolls close to him, nuzzles against him in her sleep. He
          looks down at her, beautiful in the moonlight, looks out at
          the town beyond her.

          102 INT. HEALING ROOM - DAY 102

          Volstagg eats ravenously from a PLATTER OF FOOD. Sif stands
          nearby, ill at ease. Fandral watches Volstagg incredulously
          as the large warrior stuffs himself. Finally Fandral can
          stand it no more.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 84.

                         FANDRAL
          Our dearest friend banished, Loki
          on the throne, Asgard on the brink
          of war, yet you manage to consume
          four wild boar, six pheasant, a
          side of beef, and two casks of ale.
          Shame on you! Don't you care?!
          Fandral moves to throw the platter in the fire, but Volstagg
          pulls his weapon, stopping him.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Do not mistake my appetite for
          apathy.

                         SIF
          Stop it, both of you! We all know
          what we have to do, we're just too
          damned afraid to do it!

                         HOGUN

                         (DECIDES)
          We must go. We must find Thor.
          Hogun starts to pull the delicate HEALING STONES from the
          fire, carefully putting them into a POUCH at his side.

                         FANDRAL
          It's treason, Hogun.

                         VOLSTAGG
          To hell with treason, it's suicide.

                         (SUDDENLY NERVOUS)
          Now, shh! Heimdall may be
          watching! It's said he can hear--

                         FANDRAL
          Yes, yes, we know!

                         SIF
          Thor would do the same for us.
          An EINHERJAR GUARD enters. They tense.

                         EINHERJAR GUARD
          Heimdall demands your presence.
          Volstagg quickly drains his flagon of ale.

                         VOLSTAGG
          We're doomed.

          103 EXT. MAIN STREET - MORNING 103

          Dawn breaks over the quiet town of Puente Antiguo.

          104 EXT. SMITH MOTORS - ROOF - DAY 104

          Thor awakens, looks down to see Jane still sleeping, nuzzled
          against him. She opens her eyes, looks up at him and smiles.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 85.
          He stands, offers his hand, helps her to her feet.

          105 EXT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB 105

          Thor helps Jane down off a ladder. A groggy, hungover Selvig
          emerges from Jane's trailer. He sees Thor with Jane.
          Selvig eyes the two of them together, then:

                         SELVIG
          I need some coffee.
          The three head inside Smith Motors.

          FROM THE LIBRARY ROOFTOP ACROSS THE STREET
          SHIELD Agents Garrett and Cale watch the scene, pointing a
          small audio surveillance device towards the lab.

          105A INT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB - DAY 105A

          Darcy and Selvig sit at a card table, drinking coffee. Thor
          holds a couple plates as Jane makes eggs on a hotplate. She
          scoops them out onto the plates. Thor takes them over to the
          table, sets them down before Selvig and Darcy.

                         DARCY
          Thanks.

                         THOR
          You're very welcome.
          Jane joins them at the card table with a couple more plates.
          She and Thor sit with the others and start to eat their
          breakfast, looking like a little family.

          108 EXT. MAIN STREET 108

          On a roof across the street from Smith Motors, Agents Garrett
          and Cale continue their surveillance, bored out of their
          wits. Agent Cale watches the group through the lab window
          with binoculars. Agent Garrett listens to his comm-link,
          turns to Cale.

                         AGENT GARRETT
          They want an update.

                         AGENT CALE
          Tell them he's eating eggs.

                         AGENT GARRETT
          Scrambled or fried?
          Cale glares at him.

                         AGENT CALE

                         (INTO COMM-LINK)
          Target is eating eggs, sir.
          We'll keep you posted.

          108AA INT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB 108AA

          As the group finishes breakfast, Thor looks at the mug in his
          hand, gets an idea.

                         THOR

                         (RE: MUG)
          May I have this?

                         DARCY
          Sure.

                         THOR
          Thank you. Excuse me a moment.
          Thor leaves.

          108A EXT. MAIN STREET - MOMENTS LATER 108A

          In front of her diner, Isabela prepares to open for the day.
          (Through the window of Isabela's, we see chairs still atop
          tables.) Isabela sweeps the front porch.
          She looks up to see Thor approaching. She eyes him
          suspiciously. He offers her a MUG.

                         THOR
          To replace the one I broke. Please
          forgive my behavior.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 86A.
          She takes it, looks at it curiously, then smiles at him.

                         ISABEL
          Okay. Thank you.

                         THOR
          If I may, I'd like to come back for
          more of your "coffee."

                         ISABEL
          Any time.
          He nods and walks away. She stares after him, smiling, and
          shrugs.

          ISABEL (CONT'D)
          She could do worse.

          109 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 109

          Sif and the Warriors Three enter warily to find the
          intimidating Heimdall standing before the Observatory's
          controls. He glares at them accusingly.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Good Heimdall, less us explain--

                         HEIMDALL
          You would defy the commands of Loki
          our King, break every oath you have
          taken as warriors, and commit
          treason to bring Thor back?
          The four exchange nervous glances.

                         SIF
          Yes, but--

                         HEIMDALL
          Good.
          The group looks puzzled. What did he just say?

                         VOLSTAGG
          So you'll help us?

                         HEIMDALL
          I am bound by honor to our King. I
          cannot open the Bifrost to you.
          With that, Heimdall leaves them alone in the Observatory.
          The others exchange puzzled looks.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 86B.

                         FANDRAL
          Complicated fellow, isn't he?

                         VOLSTAGG
          Now what do we do?
          Sif glances at the control panel, notices something.

                         SIF
          Look!
          The others turn to see HEIMDALL'S SWORD stuck into the
          control panel. They exchange a grin. They have an ally.
          Sif hits the controls, and the Bifrost apparatus fires up.

          110 INT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - SECURITY ROOM - DAY 110

          Coulson races in as a SHIELD TECHIE calls up satellite
          footage of the Bifrost storm on a monitor.

                         COULSON
          What the hell was that?

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 87.

                         TECHIE
          I don't know, sir. We got massive
          energy readings out of nowhere,
          then they just disappeared.
          Fifteen miles due northwest.

                         COULSON
          Let's go take a look.

          111 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 111

          Amidst the fury of the Bifrost storm, the Warriors Three and
          Sif drop to the ground in the New Mexico desert. They
          clamber to their feet as the Bifrost quickly recedes, the
          hole in the sky closing up behind it. The Bifrost runes
          cover the desert sand around them.

                         VOLSTAGG
          He must have landed nearby. It's
          time to put our tracking skills to
          work. Spread out. Check the sand
          for indentations of his boot
          prints.

                         FANDRAL
          The winds would have blown them
          away by now. We should look for
          signs of a campfire.

                         SIF
          Or we could just start there.
          She points behind them to the town of Puente Antiguo in the
          distance -- the only visible sign of civilization -- and to
          Hogun, who has already started walking towards it. Volstagg
          and Fandral trade looks, their egos bruised.

                         FANDRAL
          It's worth a look, I suppose.
          The party tromps towards the town.

          112 EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY 112

           Townsfolk stare in wonder at the Warriors Three and Sif, as
           they stroll down the street in all their Asgardian splendor.

          113 EXT. DOWN THE STREET - DAY 113

           A BOY Hits a baseball, which rolls under a parked car. He
           runs to retrieve it, but can't reach it. Suddenly, the side 
           of the CAR rises into the air. The boy looks over, his mouth 
           dropping open at what he sees. Volstagg easily holds the car 
           up with one hand. 

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 88.
           Volstagg picks up the boy's ball, then drops the car. He 
           hands the ball back to the boy, tousling his hair. 

                          VOLSTAGG 
           There you go, lad!
           The boy just stares, standing frozen. The Asgardians head 
          off.

          VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
          Is it just me, or does Earth look a
          little different to you?

                         SIF
          It has been a thousand years...

                         VOLSTAGG
          Things change so fast here. You
          leave for a millennium, and it's
          like the whole neighborhood's gone.
          Volstagg sniffs, smells something.

          VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
          Perhaps we should split up.

          114 EXT. PUENTE ANTIGUO - ROOFTOP - DAY 114


                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 89.
          Agents Cale and Garrett spot Sif, Fandral, and Hogun walking
          down the street.

                         AGENT GARRETT
          Is there a Renaissance Faire in
          town?

                         AGENT CALE
          Call it in.
          But before they can, Volstagg rises up behind them, smashes
          their heads together. They're out.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Never cared for spies.
          He starts to go, then sees their bag of fast food on the
          ground. Intrigued, he pulls out a cheeseburger and takes a
          bite. He likes what he tastes.

          VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
          Exquisite.

          115 EXT. PALACE GROUNDS - DAY 115

          Loki stands with Gungnir, surveying his kingdom, when an
          Einherjar Guard quickly approaches him, out of breath.

                         EINHERJAR GUARD
          My liege, the Warriors Three and
          the Lady Sif have gone missing.
          Loki reacts. He knows who's responsible.

          116 EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - DAY 116

          Loki approaches Heimdall on the Rainbow Bridge.

                         HEIMDALL
          Tell me, Loki, how did you get the
          Jotuns into Asgard?

                         LOKI
          You think the Bifrost is the only
          way in and out of the Realm? There
          are secret paths between worlds to
          which even you with all your gifts
          are blind. But I have need of them
          no longer, now that I am King.

                         (THEN)
          And I say, for your act of treason,
          you are relieved of your duties as
          Gatekeeper. And you are no longer
          a citizen of Asgard.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 90.

                         HEIMDALL
          Then I need no longer obey you.
          Heimdall raises his massive sword, strides towards Loki.
          Loki reaches out and, with both hands, takes hold of
          something invisible, hovering in mid-air before him. As it
          quickly fades into view, we realize what it is --

          THE CASKET OF ANCIENT WINTERS.
          The blueness creeps from his hands and up his arms, as Loki
          opens the Casket towards Heimdall, who is fast approaching.
          From inside the Casket, all hell breaks loose. The fury of
          the Casket is unleashed, its winds not just howling, but
          SCREAMING, as ice and snow and darkness come flying straight
          towards Heimdall. Ice clings to his body, freezing him, but
          still he moves forward. Loki starts to get worried.
          Heimdall is nearly upon him. The Gatekeeper swings his
          massive sword at the prince. But the blade STOPS, frozen,
          just inches from Loki's throat. Loki breathes a sigh of
          relief and steps past him.

          117 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 117

          Loki inserts Gungnir into the Observatory's control panel and
          opens the Bifrost. He gestures, and the veiled DESTROYER
          appears before him, a fiery glow rising within it. It turns
          its head toward its King.

                         LOKI
          Ensure my brother does not return.

          118 INT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB - DAY 118

           Jane, Thor, Darcy, and Selvig make a charming team, tidying
           up after breakfast -- washing, drying, and putting plates and
          utensils away.
          The door opens.

           VOLSTAGG (O.S.)
           Found you!
          Thor, Jane, Selvig, and Darcy turn to see --

          SIF AND THE WARRIORS THREE
          Staring baffled at the sight of the domestic Thor drying
          dishes in mortal clothing.
          Jane drops a plate. It goes SHATTERING on the floor.

          My friends!
          Thor happily races over and greets his comrades.
          Jane, Selvig, and Darcy watch the Asgardians from across the
          room. Jane looks concerned. Selvig and Darcy eye them with
          wonder.

                         SELVIG
          I don't believe it...

                         DARCY
          Who are they?

                         VOLSTAGG
          Lady Sif and the Warriors Three.
          Surely you've heard tales of Hogun
          the Grim, Fandral the Dashing, and
          I, Volstagg the Svelte?
          Selvig looks pointedly at Volstagg's massive gut.

          VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
          Well, perhaps I've put on a little
          more muscle since I was here last.

                         JANE 
          That would have been a thousand 
          years ago? Northern Europe? 

                         VOLSTAGG 
          Exactly! Those lovely herring 
          people. They worshipped us! 
          Thor grins, lays a hand on Volstagg's shoulder.

                         THOR
          My friends, I've never been happier 
          to see anyone. But you should not
          have come.

                         FANDRAL
          We're here to take you home.
          Jane reacts to the news of Thor leaving.

                         THOR
          You know I can't. My father is 
          dead because of me. I must remain
          in exile.
          The other Asgardians exchange puzzled looks.

                         SIF
          Thor... your father still lives.
          Thor reacts to the revelation.

          119 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 119

          A few SHIELD vehicles are parked by the Bifrost site. A few
          SHIELD agents stand nearby as SCIENTISTS take readings.
          Coulson kneels, examines the Bifrost Runes. He turns to an
          Agent.

          Get somebody from Linguistics out
          here.
          Just then, they hear a RUMBLING overhead, as the Bifrost
          storm ROARS in the sky above.
          Coulson and the SHIELD Agents scramble for cover, their
          vehicle windshields SHATTERING, as the Bifrost storm grows in
          strength. Finally, the hole in the sky overhead opens, and
          the funnel cloud EXPLODES out of it, touching down onto the
          desert floor.
          Coulson and the Agents shelter their eyes from the maelstrom.

          120 OMITTED MERGED WITH SCENE 119 120

          121 INT. SMITH MOTORS - DAY 121

          Thor and the others see the Bifrost storm forming in the
          distance.

                         DARCY
          Was somebody else coming?
          Just then, the Bifrost funnel EXPLODES down to the ground.

          122 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 122

          From behind a jeep, Coulson and the SHIELD AGENTS stare at
          the Destroyer in awe. We don't see it, just its shadow as it
          moves towards them.

                         SHIELD AGENT

                         (RE: DESTROYER)
          Is that one of Stark's?

                         COULSON
          I don't think so. But the guy
          doesn't tell me anything.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 93.
          Coulson grabs a megaphone, steps forward, calls out to the
          Destroyer.

          COULSON (CONT'D)
          Hello! You're using unregistered
          weapons technology. Please
          identify yourself.
          We hear the HUM of the Destroyer's fiery energy power up
          inside.

          COULSON (CONT'D)
          Incoming!
          As the SHIELD Agents scramble for cover, a blast of energy
          from the Destroyer EXPLODES a vehicle. SHIELD agents return
          fire.

          123 EXT. SMITH MOTORS - DAY 123

          Townspeople fill the streets, staring at the fire fight in
          the distance. Thor and the Asgardians prepare for battle, as
          Thor turns to Jane.

                         THOR
          Leave this town now. Get yourself
          and your friends to safety.

                         JANE
          What about you?

                         THOR
          I must stay and fight.
          The Asgardians look to Thor.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          I'm still a warrior, and I will
          fight by your side.

                         VOLSTAGG
          You're but a mortal now. You'll
          get yourself killed!

                         FANDRAL
          Or one of us, trying to protect

          The best thing you can do is get
          the mortals to safety and leave the
          battle to us.
          Thor looks at the townsfolk around them, all oblivious to the
          oncoming threat.

                         THOR

                         (TO SIF)
          You're right.
          Sif looks surprised. Thor turns to Jane, Selvig, and Darcy.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Help me clear the streets. I'll
          let none of these people die this
          day.
          Thor, Jane, Selvig, and Darcy start to herd the crowd of
          Townsfolk off the streets, as the Warriors Three and Sif head
          across town, towards the Destroyer.

          125 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 125

          Laufey and two Frost Giants appear out of the Bifrost and
          step onto the platform. Loki is waiting for them. He pulls
          Gungnir from the Observatory's control panel. The giant
          apparatus slows to a stop.

                         LOKI
          Father. Welcome to Asgard.

          125A EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 125A

          The site looks like the aftermath of a war zone. The
          smoldering wreckage of SHIELD vehicles lies strewn about.

          126 EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY 126

          Thor, Jane, and Selvig clear the streets, loading confused
          TOWNSFOLK into cars, moving others indoors.

          127 EXT. MAIN STREET - EDGE OF TOWN - DAY 127

          A dog makes it way down the street, barking at something in
          front of it. Then we see it --

                         THE DESTROYER
          Strides down the street, a red, fiery energy glowing from
          within it.
          It unleashes BLASTS as it goes, blowing up cars, setting
          storefronts aflame.

                         128 OMITTED 128

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 96.

          129 EXT. STREET 129

          Sif and the Warriors Three head down the street towards the
          Destroyer.

                         SIF
          Keep him distracted.
          She hurries off. The Warriors Three continue towards the
          behemoth.

                         FANDRAL
          What do you think? "The
          Svartalfheim Twist?" "Kiss of the
          Hag?" "Face Full of Boot?"
          Volstagg grins eagerly.

                         VOLSTAGG
          "The Flying Mountain."
          Hogun and Fandral groan.

                         FANDRAL
          Not "The Flying Mountain!" It
          threw out my back for a year last
          time!

                         VOLSTAGG
          Trust me, it'll work.

          130 EXT. SMITH MOTORS - DAY 130

          Thor looks anxiously back down the street, where the Warriors
          Three get into position before the Destroyer.

                         THOR

                         (TO JANE)
          My friends fight bravely, but they
          won't be able to hold it back much
          longer.
          Darcy hurries out of the burning pet store carrying as many
          animals in cages as she can, then loads them into a truck.

          DOWN THE STREET
          Hogun and Fandral take off running towards the Destroyer, as
          Volstagg stands limbering up.

                         FANDRAL

                         (TO VOLSTAGG)
          Come on!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 96A.
          Volstagg takes off running at full speed.
          As he catches up to his comrades, Hogun and Fandral grab him
          on either side, and with all their Asgardian might, hurl the
          voluminous warrior into the air at the black metal behemoth.

                         VOLSTAGG
          For Asgaaaaard!!!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 97.
          The Destroyer is unable to react quickly enough, as Volstagg
          SMASHES into the creature. It looks like it might actually
          work for a moment, but the Destroyer stays on its feet. It
          lifts Volstagg into the by the scruff of his neck. He shrugs
          apologetically.
          The Destroyer savagely HURLS him at Hogun and Fandral,
          smashing into them, when --

                         SIF
          Leaps off a nearby rooftop with her two-headed spear and
          plunges it deep into the back of the creature.
          The creature stands there motionless, the fire dimming in its
          faceplate, Sif standing atop its back. The Asgardians have a
          brief moment of hope.
          But the creature stirs with life, its fire igniting once
          again. Sif looks on with growing trepidation.
          Slowly, unnaturally, the Destroyer spins its torso around 180
          degrees to face its attackers.
          The Destroyer unleashes a blast at Sif. She barely dives off
          of the behemoth in time, dodging the blast. The Destroyer
          rises again to its full height, pulling free from Sif's
          staff, the weapon slipping through the slats of its armor.
          Sif and the Warriors Three try to regroup, when the Destroyer
          unleashes another blast, sending Sif and her comrades flying
          in all directions. Hogun's POUCH OF HEALING STONES breaks
          free, landing in the middle of the street.

          131 EXT. SMITH MOTORS - DAY 131

          Thor sees his friends lying injured on the ground, but has no
          time to act, as the Destroyer fires in his direction.
          A storefront near Smith Motor EXPLODES, knocking Thor, Jane,
          and Selvig off their feet. Thor helps Jane to her feet, when
          they notice Selvig lying on his back amidst the debris,
          impaled by a twisted piece of iron.

                         JANE
          Erik!
          She and Thor hurry to his side. He's losing blood, going
          into shock.

                         SELVIG

                         (TO JANE)
          Go! Leave me!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 98.
          Jane takes his hand as Thor spots Hogun's pouch of healing
          stones lying in the middle of the street. He makes a break
          for it, dodging through the flaming wreckage, then grabs the
          pouch and races back.
          He opens the pouch to find the fragile stones crushed and
          useless. He pours the contents out in his hand.

                         THOR
          Come on... give me one!
          Amidst the useless powder, he finally finds one stone still
          intact. Thor tosses the pouch aside, holds the stone over
          the end of the iron rod.

                         JANE
          What are you doing? What is that?
          As the stone begins to glow, Thor crushes it.
          Jane looks on, amazed, as the glowing powder falls upon the
          piece of iron, dissolving it, heading downwards, until it
          reaches Selvig's wound. The powder heals his wound
          completely.
          Thor looks down the street, sees his wounded friends still
          lying there, as Selvig sits up in utter astonishment. He
          reaches through the hole in his shirt to touch his healed
          flesh.

                         SELVIG
          (to Jane, re: Thor)
          I'm really starting to like him.
          Jane turns to Thor to find he's gone.

          132 EXT. DOWN THE STREET 132

          Thor reaches Sif, who lies dazed, battered, and bloodied on
          the ground. He pulls her behind a burning vehicle.

                         THOR
          Go, while you can!

                         SIF
          But the others...

                         THOR
          You can't help them now. Your job
          is to survive.
          She struggles to sit up.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 98A.

                         SIF
          No! I will die a warrior's death.
          Stories will be told of this day--
          He gently takes her shield from her.

                         THOR
          Live and tell those stories
          yourself.
          At last, she nods. Thor spots Volstagg lying unconscious,
          with Hogun and Fandral lying nearby. Thor makes his way
          towards them.
          Volstagg is barely breathing. Thor tries to pull him to
          safety, but it's no use. He won't budge. He rouses Hogun
          and Fandral.

          THOR (CONT'D)

                         (RE: VOLSTAGG)
          Get him out of here!

                         FANDRAL
          No. We can still fight!

                         THOR
          But not win. Move Volstagg, or
          he'll die!
          Thor looks at them, grins.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Don't worry, my friends. I have a
          plan.
          The two Warriors reluctantly grab their fallen friend and
          drag him away from the battlefield.
          After they go, Thor turns to back to the Destroyer, then
          tosses Sif's shield aside.
          He strides down the street towards the behemoth, completely
          defenseless.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Brother... for whatever I have done
          to wrong you, whatever I have done
          to lead you to do this, I am sorry.
          But these people have done nothing
          to you. They are innocents.
          He continues towards the Destroyer.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 98B.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Take my life, and know I will never
          return to Asgard.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 99.
          Thor reaches the Destroyer, extends his arms.
          The Destroyer hesitates, sizing up the defenseless Thor, then
          swats him with its enormous arm. We hear the sickening CRACK
          of breaking bones as Thor goes flying.
          Thor lands in a crumpled, broken heap in front of Smith
          Motors, before Jane, Selvig, and Darcy.
          The wounded Asgardians watch helplessly from down the street,
          a look of horror on their faces. Jane tries to rush out to
          Thor's aid, but Selvig holds her back.

                         SELVIG
          Jane, no!
          He pulls her into Smith Motors. A RAVEN flies overhead,
          watching the scene --

          133 INT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - SAME TIME 133

          Odin lies in the Odinsleep.
          A single tear rolls down the Allfather's cheek.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 100.

          134 EXT. SMITH MOTORS - DAY 134

          Thor's eyes close, his last breath leaving his lips. The
          Destroyer stands over Thor's body, lowers its head towards
          him. It opens its faceplate, locks it in place, readying to
          unleash its fiery blast.

          135 EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE 135

          Inside the crater, the RUNES of the side of Mjolnir reappear,
          burning bright. Electricity starts to CRACKLE on the
          hammer's surface. SCIENTISTS beside it take notice as it
          vibrates, and a RUMBLE comes from overhead. They look up.
          Clouds form in the sky above.
          Just then, with a CRACK and flash of lightning, Mjolnir flies
          straight up into the air like a rocket.

          136 EXT. MAIN STREET 136

          The Destroyer unleashes its blast at Thor's body, when --

          KRAKAKABOOM!
          A blinding BOLT OF LIGHTNING strikes down from above,
          colliding with the Destroyer's blast. The explosion is
          massive. The Destroyer is hurled backwards, a cloud of dust
          enveloping the street. As the smoke clears we see --

                         JANE
          Oh. My. God.

          THE MIGHTY THOR
          Clad in his full battle armor, holding Mjolnir in his hand --
          the God of Thunder once more. Thor kneels, brings Mjolnir
          down onto the ground.

          KRAKABOOM!
          Lightning strikes the Destroyer. It convulses. Thor swings
          Mjolnir around, takes off straight up into the air, as the
          Destroyer gets back on its feet and looks up at the Thunder
          God. Storm clouds gather around Thor as he summons gale
          force winds.
          Debris from the battle begins to rise up into the sky. The
          Destroyer stays there, kept grounded by its massive weight.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 101.
          It lifts its head up at the Thunder God, opens its faceplate,
          locks it in place, unleashes its blast. Thor dives downwards
          straight at it, with Mjolnir before him.
          Mjolnir collides with the Destroyer's fiery energy blast,
          overpowering it, pushing it back, forcing it downwards at the
          Destroyer.
          Thor jams his hammer deep into the Destroyer's faceplate.
          The fiery energy within the creature builds up and EXPLODES
          within him, firing out of all his openings.
          Thor smashes the Destroyer to the ground in a tremendous
          heap, the fiery energy within it extinguished forever.
          Thor pulls Mjolnir from its faceplate, walks away from its
          lifeless carcass. As he does, the other objects and debris
          pulled into the air by the gale winds drop down from the
          skies, around the Destroyer, burying it.
          Jane and Thor's comrades, now roused, stand to join him.
          A battered Coulson approaches with several SHIELD AGENTS.

                         COULSON
          Donald... I don't think you've been
          completely honest with me.

          137 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 137

          Thor, Jane, Darcy, Selvig and the other Asgardians stand in
          the desert with Thor, Coulson, and several SHIELD AGENTS.
          Darcy turns to Volstagg.

                         DARCY
          So, how can you speak our language?

                         VOLSTAGG
          Your language? Ha! Silly girl,
          you're speaking ours.
          Thor calls up to the sky.

                         THOR
          Heimdall! Open the Bifrost!

          138 EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - DAY 138

          Heimdall stands frozen.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 102.

          139 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 139

          Thor looks to the others with concern.

                         THOR
          He would open it if he could. I
          fear the worst.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Then we're trapped here forever.

                         FANDRAL
          Then I suppose we'd best start
          settling into our new lives.
          He looks to Darcy, turns on the charm.

          FANDRAL (CONT'D)
          Are all earth maidens as fair as
          you?
          Darcy enjoys the attention.

                         DARCY
          No.
          Thor shouts back up to the sky.

                         THOR
          Heimdall!

          140 EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - DAY 140

          From inside the ice, Heimdall hears Thor calling to him.
          Knowing that the fate of Asgard depends on him, he musters
          all his strength. The ice around him begins to CRACK. With
          a tremendous effort, Heimdall SHATTERS free from the ice.
          Weakened, near death, he drags himself inside the
          Observatory.

          141 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 141

          The Asgardians begin to lose hope. Volstagg eyes a SHIELD
          Agent's machine gun.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Primitive. Good enough for hunting
          small game, I suppose.
          Suddenly, the Bifrost EXPLODES down from the sky. Thor
          grins. The mortals look on, amazed. Fandral turns to Darcy.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 102A.

                         FANDRAL
          Sorry, my love. These things
          happen.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 103.
          He joins the other Asgardians at their side. Thor turns to
          Coulson.

                         THOR
          Know this, son of Coul. You and I,
          we fight for the same cause -- the
          protection of this world. From
          this day forward, count me as your
          ally.

                         (THEN)
          If you return the items you have
          stolen from Jane Foster.

                         COULSON
          Not stolen. Borrowed.
          Jane shoots him a look. Coulson quickly continues.

          COULSON (CONT'D)
          You'll get your equipment back.
          You're going to need it to continue
          your research... which, after
          today's events, SHIELD would like
          to fully sponsor. If that's all
          right with you.
          Thor takes Jane's hand, kisses it tenderly. She looks at
          him, her eyes filled with the fear that she may never see him
          again.

                         THOR
          Whatever fate lies before me, you
          are part of it.
          He takes her in his arms, kisses her passionately. Thor and
          the Asgardians leap into the Bifrost.

          142 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 142

          The Asgardians emerge from the Bifrost to find Heimdall
          slumped over his controls.

                         THOR
          (to the others)
          Get him to the healing room! Leave
          my brother to me.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 104.
          Thor bolts out the door.

          143 INT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 143

          Odin lies in the Odinsleep, Frigga at his bedside. She hears
          the SHOUTS of Guards outside, the sound of a battle. Frigga
          grabs a sword.
          A Frost Giant bursts in. She swings the sword around hard,
          cleaving into his shoulder. He swats her aside angrily.
          Laufey and the Brute Frost Giant enter.
          Laufey looks at Odin lying helpless on the bed.

          144 EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - DAY 144

          Thor rides the winds over the Bridge, speeding towards the
          palace.

          145 INT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 145

          The Jotun king stands over the unconscious Odin, relishing
          the moment.
          He forms an ICE BLADE.

          146 EXT. ODIN'S PALACE - DAY 146

          Thor races through the entrance to the palace.

          147 INT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 147

          Laufey stands before the sleeping Odin.

                         LAUFEY
          It's said you can still see and
          hear what transpires around you,
          even in this state. I hope it's
          true, so that you may know your
          death came by the hand of Laufey.
          He raises his blade above Odin's body, when --

          A BLAST OF ENERGY
          Hits him from behind. As the Jotun king falls to the ground,
          we see it is not Thor standing behind him, but Loki, holding
          Gungnir.

                         LOKI
          And your death came by the son of
          Odin.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 104A.
          Laufey dies as the other two shocked Frost Giants move for
          Loki. He fires Gungnir at one, blasting him against a wall,
          taking him out.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 105.
          The Brute is nearly upon him, when the Jotun stops suddenly,
          his eyes going wide. The Brute falls to the ground,

                         REVEALING --

                         FRIGGA
          Standing behind him -- the sword stuck in his back. She
          looks to Loki, takes him in her arms.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          I swear to you, mother, they will
          pay for what they've done today. I
          will end the Jotun threat, now and
          forever!
          He looks to Odin.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          And I will make you proud.
          Loki savors the moment, but it's short-lived, as Thor bursts
          in. He's thrown by the scene before him -- Odin safe, Laufey
          and two Jotuns dead, Frigga regarding Loki with pride and
          respect. Stunned and delighted to see Thor, Frigga beams.

                         FRIGGA
          Thor!
          She moves to Thor and hugs him, but Thor's eyes remain fixed
          on his brother. Loki looks at Mjolnir in his brother's hand.

                         LOKI
          Found its way back to you, did it?

                         THOR
          No thanks to you.
          Frigga picks up on the tension building between her sons.

                         FRIGGA
          What?

                         THOR
          Why don't you tell her? How you
          sent the Destroyer to kill our
          friends? To kill me?
          Frigga looks to Loki, alarmed and confused.

                         LOKI
          It must have been enforcing
          Father's last command.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 106.

                         THOR
          You're a talented liar, brother.
          Always have been.

                         LOKI

                         (SMILES)
          It's good to have you back.

                         (DEAD SERIOUS)
          Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to
          destroy Jotunheim.
          Loki suddenly raises Gungnir, FIRES it point-blank at Thor.
          Thor goes flying backwards, SMASHING through the chamber
          walls, into...

          148 INT. ODIN'S PALACE - CORRIDOR 148

          Thor flies from the blast through ANOTHER wall on the
          opposite side of the corridor, to...

          149 EXT. PALACE GROUNDS - DAY 149

          Thor plummets from the palace and CRASHES into the reflecting
          pools below.

          150 EXT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 150

          Loki speeds on horseback down the Rainbow Bridge, then
          quickly dismounts and enters the Observatory.

          151 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 151

          Loki operates the Observatory's controls. The massive turret
          spins, points.

          152 EXT. PALACE GROUNDS - DAY 152

          Thor awakens to the sound of the Bifrost. He stands, sees
          the Observatory firing the Bifrost energy into space. He
          looks to where the Bifrost is aimed.

                         THOR
          Jotunheim...

          153 EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - DAY 153

          Thor soars on the winds above the Rainbow Bridge, the Bifrost
          energy roaring through Bridge, feeding into the Observatory.
          He lands before the Observatory's huge doorway.

          154 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY 154

          Thor enters, shields his eyes from the brilliant light of the
          Bifrost energy blasting towards Jotunheim.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 106A.
          He looks over to the controls, sees that they're frozen in an
          enormous block of ice. Loki stands atop it.

                         LOKI
          All these years, and no one's ever
          dared to use it as a weapon.
          Thor hurries to the ice, raises his hammer to SMASH through
          it to get to the controls frozen within. Before he can, Loki
          fires Gungnir. The blast hits the ice in front of Thor,
          blasting him back across the floor. Loki steps down from the
          ice as Thor staggers to his feet.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 107.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          You can't stop it. The Bifrost
          will build until it rips Jotunheim
          apart.

                         THOR
          Why have you done this?

                         LOKI
          To do what Father never could. To
          destroy their kind forever. When
          he awakens, he'll see the wisdom of
          what I've done.

                         THOR
          He won't! You can't kill an entire
          race!

                         LOKI
          What is this newfound love for the
          Frost Giants? You, who would have
          killed them all with your bare
          hands.

                         THOR
          I've changed.

                         LOKI
          So have I.
          Loki hits Thor across the face with Gungnir.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          Fight me.
          He swings Gungnir at Thor again. Thor catches it in his
          hand, rears back his hammer as if ready to return the blow,
          but instead takes to the air and flies past Loki, back
          towards the frozen controls.
          Loki spins around, aims Gungnir, and fires a blast which
          immobilizes Thor in the air. He hangs there, suspended.

                         THOR
          Is the throne really worth what
          you've done? What you would
          become?

                         LOKI
          I never wanted the throne. I only
          wanted to be your equal. Now fight
          me!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 108.
          With a gesture of Gungnir, he flings Thor to the ground.
          Thor rises to his feet, turns to Loki.

                         THOR
          I will not fight you, brother.

                         LOKI
          I am not your brother. I never
          was.

                         THOR
          Loki, this is madness...
          Loki grins.

                         LOKI
          Is it?
          He FIRES Gungnir at Thor. Thor dodges the blast, rolls to
          his feet.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          What happened to you on earth that
          turned you so soft? Don't tell me
          it was a woman.
          Thor doesn't answer. Loki laughs, realizing he's right.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          It was. Perhaps when we're
          finished here I'll pay her a little
          visit myself.
          That did it. Loki and Thor rush at each other. They and
          their weapons collide.
          The two battle -- Loki unleashing years of pent-up rage and
          jealousy, Thor having no choice but to defend himself.

          155 EXT. JOTUNHEIM - DAY 155

          It's mayhem. The growing Bifrost TEARS through the ice of
          the planet like a destructive wave, breaking it apart.
          JOTUNS go running in terror, others fall through the breaking
          ice.

          156 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) 156

           Jane, Selvig, Darcy, and Coulson look up with concern at the
           hole in the sky, where excess Bifrost energy builds up around
          it.

                          SELVIG
          Jane?

           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 109.

          157 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY 157

          Thor and Loki battle savagely. Loki fires Gungnir, sending
          Thor sliding across the floor and knocking Mjolnir from his
          hand.
          The hammer flies into the Bifrost towards Jotunheim.
          Thor raises his hand towards his hammer, tries to summon it
          back to him, to keep it in this Realm, but the Bifrost is too
          powerful.
          Mjolnir disappears into the maelstrom as Thor himself slides
          towards the Bifrost.

                         LOKI
          If you care so much for the Jotuns,
          then die with them.
          The Bifrost stretches every cell of Thor's body, trying to
          drag him away. He's nearly swallowed by the vortex, when he
          concentrates, mustering his will. He reaches out his hand
          towards the Bifrost.
          MJOLNIR flies back through the maelstrom, into Thor's hand.
          The hammer pulls him free. Loki tries to fire off another
          blast at him, but Thor takes to the air, speeds towards his
          brother.

          158 EXT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY 158

          Thor and Loki come CRASHING through the Observatory dome and
          land hard, rolling across the Rainbow Bridge. As Thor gets
          to his feet, he sees Loki dangling off the Bridge's edge.

                         LOKI
          Thor! Help me!
          Thor steps over to the side of the Bridge, sees Loki looking
          up at him desperately.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          Please...
          Loki's fingers start to slip. Thor reaches down to grab his
          brother's wrist, but his hand passes through Loki's. Just
          then, the REAL LOKI materializes behind him. Thor whirls
          around as Loki STABS him in the chest with Gungnir.
          Loki lifts Thor into the air, impaled on the spear, and hurls
          him across the bridge.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 110.
          Thor, bleeding, rises to his knees. Loki strides up behind
          him to finish him off, when Thor swing his hammer around.
          It passes through him. Instantly, another Loki appears next
          to him, Thor swings his hammer, but that too is an illusion.
          Loki after Loki appears, Thor futilely swinging at each one,
          never making contact. Thor falls back to his knees. The
          Lokis grin as their raises their spears, encircling him.

                         LOKIS
          I was always more clever than you.

                         THOR
          Yet still not clever enough.
          With that, Thor raises his hammer, rising into the air,
          summoning lightning. A massive bolt strikes Mjolnir, then
          channels outwards, splitting up, striking each one of the
          Lokis.
          All of them dissipate into nothingness, save one -- the real
          Loki -- who's sent flying back across the Bridge, Gungnir
          knocked from his grasp.
          Thor steps over to his fallen brother, lying dazed on his
          back. Loki winces, prepares for the worst, when Thor steps
          away.
          Loki opens his eyes, tries to stand, but can't. He looks
          confused, then sees what the problem is -- Mjolnir rests atop
          his chest. Struggle as he may, Loki can't lift it off. He's
          pinned to the ground.
          Thor looks about him desperately -- at the Bifrost firing
          towards Jotunheim, gaining in strength, at the surge of
          energy moving through the Bridge. He's at a loss of what to
          do.
          Loki watches him smugly.

                         LOKI
          Look at you, the Mighty Thor.
          With all your strength, what good
          does it do you now?
          Thor knows Loki's right. He's powerless to stop what's
          happening. He looks down at the Bridge beneath his feet,
          VIBRATING from the force and speed of the Bifrost energy
          feeding into the Observatory. Then he gets an idea.
          He realizes what he must do -- and what he must sacrifice.
          Thor extends his hand towards Loki, summoning Mjolnir. The
          hammer goes flying to his grasp. Loki looks confused.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 111.
          Thor raises Mjolnir in the air. Clouds form above him,
          thunder RUMBLING. Lightning arcs off of his hammer, as he
          channels the power of the storm into it, then --
          He strikes Mjolnir down upon the Rainbow Bridge. The blow is
          massive, causing a rumbling along the whole bridge, shaking
          the Observatory itself like an earthquake. A crack appears
          where the blow struck. Loki rises to his feet.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          Stop! What are you doing?!
          Thor lifts the hammer again, brings it down harder. BOOM!
          The crack grows bigger. The Bifrost energy starts to stream
          out from it. Loki thinks fast.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          If you destroy the Bridge, you'll
          never see her again!
          Loki grabs Gungnir, runs towards him, ready to pierce Thor
          through the back.

                         THOR
          Forgive me.
          Summoning every bit of strength he has left, Thor raises
          Mjolnir one last time, drawing lightning to it from all
          sides, and brings it down with a final, terrible blow --
          KRAKABOOM! The Bifrost SHATTERS, rainbow energy EXPLODING
          out of it.
          Both Loki and Thor are hurled into the air by the force of
          the blast. A wave of destruction moves forward along the
          Bridge towards the Observatory, breaking it apart as it goes.
          The Observatory RIPS ITSELF APART.
          As Loki and Thor fall together, Thor grabs hold of one end of
          Gungnir, while Loki still clutches the other. They both fall
          towards the MASSIVE WAVE of Bifrost energy which spews out
          from the broken Bridge.
          They're an instant from being blasted by the destructive
          force of the energy, carried away by the current, pulverized
          by the debris, when --

          A POWERFUL HAND
          Catches Thor's leg. Thor dangles there, holding onto Gungnir
          as Loki hangs onto the other end. Loki looks up, shocked to

                         SEE --

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 112.

                         ODIN ALLFATHER
          Standing on the edge of the broken Bridge, awakened from the
          Odinsleep, restored to his full strength.
          Loki searches his father's face, looking for some kind of
          approval, some kind of redemption, but all he sees is
          disappointment and regret.
          Loki lets go.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          No!
          But it's too late. Odin and Thor can only watch as Loki
          falls into the rushing torrent of Bifrost energy. It carries
          him away, along with the debris of the Bridge and the
          Observatory, disappearing out of sight.
          Odin pulls Thor up onto the Bridge. Drained, Thor falls back
          into his father's arms.

                         ODIN
          It is over.

          159 BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 159
          The Bifrost energy explodes in the sky like fireworks firing
          in all directions.
          Jane, Selvig, Darcy, and Coulson stand watching in amazement.
          Jane looks back up at the sky, distraught. She knows the
          significance of what's just happened.

                         JANE
          It's gone.

          160 INT. ODIN'S PALACE - BANQUET HALL - NIGHT 160

          A FEAST is in progress as Thor, Sif, and the Warriors Three
          sit amongst the gathered Asgardians. Hogun sits between
          Fandral and Volstagg, who is in the middle of recounting
          their battle with the Destroyer.

                         VOLSTAGG
          ...and then, with a mighty bellow,
          I flew at the great metal beast and
          laid it low...

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 113.

                         FANDRAL
          Is that another way of saying you
          fell on your huge a--

                         VOLSTAGG
          As a matter of fact, falling down
          was a tactic. Lulling the
          Destroyer into a false sense of
          security!

                         FANDRAL
          Well, I was the one who had to drag
          your enormous carcass off the
          battlefield. That makes me the
          real hero. Doesn't it, Hogun?
          Hogun points to Volstagg.

                         HOGUN
          Big stomach.
          (points to Fandral)
          Big mouth.
          The other gathered Asgardians laugh. Volstagg and Fandral
          look to Hogun. The grim warrior gives just a trace of a
          smile.

                         FANDRAL
          Well, how about that? A smile!
          I'd say that calls for another
          drink!
          They laugh and raise another round.
          Frigga sits nearby, lost in thought, her face betraying the
          sadness she struggles to conceal. Sif notices, approaches
          Frigga, bows her head.

                         SIF
          My Queen. I am so sorry for your
          loss.
          Frigga takes Sif's hand appreciatively.

                         FRIGGA
          Thank you, Sif.
          She looks to Thor, who's unable to enjoy the merriment around
          him.

          FRIGGA (CONT'D)
          How is he?

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 113A.

                         SIF
          He mourns for his brother. And he
          misses her. The mortal.
          Frigga sees the trace of regret in Sif's face as she looks at
          Thor with new feelings. He rises and leaves the hall.

                         FRIGGA
          He will need his friends now more
          than ever.

                         SIF
          I will always be at his side.
          Frigga understands, puts her arm around Sif gratefully.

          161 EXT. PALACE BALCONY - NIGHT 161

          Thor stands alone on the balcony, lost in thought. Odin
          walks up behind him.

                         ODIN
          You'll be a wise King.

                         THOR
          There will never be a wiser king
          than you. Or a better father.

                         (THEN)
          I have much to learn. I know that
          now. But some day, perhaps, I will
          make you proud.

                         ODIN
          You've already made me proud.
          Odin leaves, Thor consoled by his words.

          162 EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - NIGHT 162

          Out of the broken, jagged Rainbow Bridge flows the Bifrost
          energy, drifting off into space.
          Thor walks out to its edge, where Heimdall stands watch.
          Thor stares out at the stellar void.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 114.

                         THOR
          Can you see her?
          Heimdall turns, gazes out towards Earth.

                         HEIMDALL
          Yes.

                         THOR
          How is she?

          163 EXT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB - NIGHT 163

          Through the window into Jane's lab, we see an enlarged
          ILLUSTRATION from her notebook pinned to a board. As we pull
          away, we see a computer terminal displaying a program clearly
          inspired by the illustration. We pull further back to see
          that the lab has been transformed into a well-funded research
          facility, abuzz with activity.
          SHIELD SCIENTISTS and AGENTS work with impressive, state-of-
          the-art equipment.
          Selvig orchestrates the process, giving instructions to the
          SCIENTISTS. We continue to track right outside the glass
          windows and rise up to find Jane sitting at the front of the
          roof, working at a small, improvised workstation, notebook at
          hand, as always. She sets up an impressive, HIGH-TECH DEVICE
          before her, which bears the "STARK INDUSTRIES" logo.
          From behind, Darcy approaches, hands her a flash drive.

                         DARCY
          Here you go.

                         JANE
          Thanks.
          Jane inserts the flash drive into the device.

                         DARCY
          He would have come back if he
          could.

                         JANE
          I know. But if he can't get here
          on his own...
          Jane hits a switch on the device. Suddenly, a 3-D
          HOLOGRAPHIC PROJECTION bursts to life over the device,
          bathing the two women in its glow. We recognize what it is --
          YGGDRASIL, in all its beauty.

                         

                         

                         

                         
"

           JANE (CONT'D)
           ...maybe we can help him find his
           way back.

                                       January 5, 1993

                       THE THREE MUSKETEERS

    OPEN ON:
1   EXT. GASCONY - DAWN                                        1

    Dawn. A verdant field in Gascony. BIRDS CALL from tree-
    tops. The WIND RUSTLES through green leaves. A fox
    darts into a thick hedge. And last, anti-pastoral, out
    of place -- the sound of CLASHING STEEL.

    SUPERIMPOSE:   France, 1625.
    Suddenly, two young men burst INTO VIEW, sword points
    cutting brilliant arcs through the morning air. The
    first is GIRARD, bearded, nearly thirty, a man in every
    facet. The second, D'ARTAGNAN. Younger in appearance
    and attitude. Exuberant, handsome. And at just this
    moment, bounding over a low stone wall with a boisterous
    cry.

    They battle across an expanse of turf thick with dew.
    Girard is the more polished combatant. But d'Artagnan is
    nearly a force of nature. He whips his sword through the
    air with wild-hearted abandon. He tumbles and somer-
    saults. This is fun.
    Girard and d'Artagnan cross the field, pass over a wooden
    fence, struggle toward a stable and hayloft. As they
    fight, both men utilize a variety of props. Handfuls of
    hay, a wooden spar, quick kicks from heavy boots.
    Anything goes as the swords cut through the air.
    D'Artagnan, gaining increasing advantage, forces Girard
    up against a peaceful country manor. Girard, seemingly
    cornered, executes a gymnastic flip onto the roof,
    fights from this high angle. D'Artagnan merely smiles...
    and follows.


2   ANGLE ON ROOFTOP                                           2

    Seen briefly in silhouette against the rising sun, Girard
    and d'Artagnan scramble up the v-shaped rooftop, pause
    to exchange swipes at the peak, then slide down the other
    side, attacking, defending, as they go.

3   INCLUDE INTERIOR                                           3

    Inside the manor house, a HANDSOME WOMAN of forty glances
    up from her writing table, hears FOOTSTEPS on the roof.
    She reacts -- curious, not afraid -- and steps to an open
    window. As  if to follow the footsteps to the other side.

                                                        2.

4   BACK TO SCENE                                              4
    Girard leaps to the ground first -- landing in an en-
    closure filled with SQUAWKING GEESE. D'Artagnan flies
    after. The geese scatter, d'Artagnan -- whose wild
    progress frequently resembles that of a young colt --
    stumbles briefly. Girard seeks advantage, thrusts his
    sword toward the young man's heart. But d'Artagnan
    parries the blow with a heavy gloved hand, rolls over
    the offending goose -- glances deadpan apology -- and
    rises to fight again.
    The epic battle continues. Girard's modest success de-
    volves into desperate flight. D'Artagnan's seemingly
    endless reserves are wearing him down. Then, at the
    last possible moment, Girard spies escape: a slow-
    moving HAYCART RUIMBLING up the country road. He runs
    toward the cart, leaps upon it, turns back to d'Artagnan
    with a confident smirk -- an expression that vanishes
    when the young Gascon executes a nearly impossible leap
    to join him.
    And still they battle, the clash of swords a kind of
    music by now, the men, their exuberance, the bright morn-
    ing all combined into a dazzlingly heroic display. Just
    then: The haycart crosses a wooden plank bridge. Girard
    backs from d'Artagnan's sword, weak from exhaustion, he
    stumbles. D'Artagnan has his man and he knows it. He
    prepares one last blow --
    -- And the haycart shifts, deposits both men over the
    side and down to the small muddy creek below. A comical
    antidote to all this glorious swordplay.


5   INCLUDE CREEK                                              5
    Girard lands flat on his back, stunned, his sword out of
    reach. D'Artagnan lands similarly, but recovers with
    grace, or rather, as much grace as the muddy situation
    will allow. He rolls toward Girard, sword in hand, and
    lightly places the sharp gleaming tip against his adam's
    apple.

    A long beat. Then a surprise. Girard begins to laugh,
    long and loud. D'Artagnan responds with a charmed smile.

                            D'ARTAGNAN
              Had enough?
                            GIRARD
                     (breathless
                      deadpan)
              I believe now would be a good
              time to end your, uhm, formal
              training. Well done.

                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                             3.

5   CONTINUED:                                                    5
                               D'ARTAGNAN
                 Thank you, sir.

    D'Artagnan leaps to his feet, races off without another
    word. Girard struggles upward, peers at the shape of his
    clothing -- cut to ribbons, muddy and soaked.

                               GIRARD
                 And god have mercy on whomever
                 you meet next.

                                                   CUT TO:

6   EXT. GASCONY - HANDSOME WOMAN'S POV - DAY                     6

    D'Artagnan races across the green fields, triumphant.


7   ANOTHER ANGLE                                                 7
    She stands at the open window, watches his coltish high
    steps with love. Sadness too.

                                                   CUT TO:

8   INT. D'ARTAGNAN'S HOME - DAY                                  8

    D'Artagnan steps through the country manor, calls out:
                              D'ARTAGNAN
                 Mother...?

    But he does not see her.    D'Artagnan continues, chatter-
    ing proudly as he goes.

                               D'ARTAGNAN
                 Did you see us? You heard us,
                 I'll bet. Girard finally
                 surrendered a compliment...
                 though I almost had to kill him
                 to get it... Mother...?
    D'Artagnan comes upon an open door, a small room beyond.
    He pauses, then steps inside.

    A piece of parchment, on it the words: "All For One, and
    One For All." And, in a place of honor, a worn blue and
    gold tunic. Below it, the Handsome Woman, d'Artagnan's
    mother, kneels at an open chest. She turns back to him.
                              MOTHER (HANDSOME WOMAN)
                 Sit down.

                 Sit.
    D'Artagnan sighs, sits in a large wooden chair. A beat.
    His mother speaks quietly, eyes turned back to the open
    chest.
                               MOTHER
                 Your father was a proud man. And
                 he had a right to be. I never
                 knew one as brave or as kind. He
                 knew that his strength was a gift
                 to be given in the service of
                 honor. That is why he dedicated
                 his life to his country and his
                 King. That is why he gave his
                 life, for both.

    She reaches into the chest, carefully extracts a
    beautiful saber.
                               MOTHER
                 I watched you this morning and
                 saw someone I knew. You have
                 your father's heart, his will to
                 fight, his courage. But these
                 gifts have no value unless they
                 are given.
    She rises, holds the sword out to him.

                               MOTHER
                 It's time for you find your
                 fortune with men as brave and
                 as bold as you are. In Paris.
                 With the King's Musketeers.

                  And now to me.

     D'Artagnan can't help it, his eager reply leavens the
     nobility of the moment with warm humor, youthful inno-
     cence. His mother smiles as she repeats.

                                 MOTHER
                  Yes, son.   And now to you.
     With that, she holds out the beautiful saber.         D'Artagnan
     takes it firmly into his hands.

     A huge and beautiful field appropriate to the moment.
     Mother and son stand in the vast expanse. D'Artagnan
     holds a restless horse by the reins, his traveling satch-
     el attached to the saddle.
                                MOTHER
                  I'm not your mother now. I'm
                  speaking for your father. And
                  this is what he would have told

     A bittersweet moment. D'Artagnan posed before his first
     great adventure. But not completely certain that he
     wishes to leave home.

                  Until after harvest.
     D'Artganan's mother smiles, understands.       And speaks
     gently to urge him forward.

                                MOTHER
                  You've heard that every man in
                  the Musketeers is on the run from
                  someone or something?
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                  Yes.   But what am I running from?

                  A shrew of a mother, and a drafty
                  old house. Now go.

     And in this fashion, she releases him. D'Artagnan sweeps
     his Mother into an embrace, now turns, heroic, and leaps
     into the saddle. The horse reacts with a start, skitters
     in a half-cicle. D'Artagnan struggles to gain control,
     finally brings the horse to rein. He manages a charmed
     grin. His mother smiles, scolds:
                                MOTHER
                  And for heaven's sake, practice
                  your horsemanship.

                  Horsemanship.    Got it.
     D'Artagnan digs his heels into the horse's flanks, shoots
     off across bright green fields. His Mother shields her
     eyes from the sun, feels a gathering of tears, and
     watches him ride into the distance.

12   EMBLEM OF KING'S MUSKETEERS                                  12
     It FILLS the SCREEN, serves as background for the MAIN
     TITLES. As the FINAL CREDIT APPEARS, and the MUSIC ENDS,
     the blade of a sword ENTERS FRAME. It slides beneath the
     emblem, pries it off the wall. The emblem falls to the
     floor with an undignified thud. A fire blazes in a huge
     hearth behind it.


13   INCLUDE MUSKETEERS' HEADQUARTERS                             13
     A room in the Musketeers Headquarters. The fallen emblem
     is retrieved by JUSSAC, an officer who wears the bright
     red tunic of the Cardinal's Guards.
                             JUSSAC
               What should I do with this?

     Jussac offers   the emblem to a tall, elegant wraith in
     black finery,   a patch covers one eye. This is the COUNT
     DE ROCHEFORT,   Richelieu's right hand, one of the deadli-
     est swordsmen   in all of France.
                             ROCHEFORT
               Throw it on the fire with
               everything else.
                             JUSSAC
               But this is the emblem of the
               Musketeers...
                             ROCHEFORT
               The Musketeers no longer exist.
               Or haven't you heard?
                      (cold command)
               Throw it on the fire.
     Jussac hastily adds the emblem to the fiery blaze, it is
     instantly consumed. Rochefort watches it burn, then
     walks to a balcony overlooking a vast courtyard.

14   INCLUDE COURTYARD                                            14
     Grim, funereal silence as a hundred Musketeers remove
     their blue and gold tunics, drop them into a pile that
     already contains their swords and muskets. The
     Musketeers remain stoic throughout, unwilling to reveal
     the depth of their despair. The latter is supervised by
     the Cardinal's Guards, who view their hated enemies'
     plight with satisfaction. This is a sad day for the
     Musketeers, the end of an era.

     MONSIEUR DE TREVILLE forces a salute toward the captain
     of the Cardinal's Guards, hands over his own musket.

     Treville is the respected leader of the Musketeers.       This
     is the saddest moment of all.

     Rochefort watches from above, a cruel smile twists his
     lips. He steps to the railing, addresses the men below.

                                  ROCHEFORT
                  Musketeers...
     A hundred faces turn   upward to regard him. And on each
     the same expression   -- absolute loathing for the man in
     black. Rochefort is    not intimidated by this sea of con-
     tempt. He revels in    it.
                                ROCHEFORT
                  By joint edict of His Majesty
                  King Louis XIII and His Eminence
                  Cardinal Richelieu, the
                  Musketeers are officially
                  disbanded. In preparation for
                  the coming war with England, your
                  ranks and commissions are hereby
                  transferred to the Infantry. You
                  will be contacted and told where
                  to report. Until that time, you
                  are instructed to return to your
                  homes.

                          Rochefort)
                  And who will protect the King?
                                ROCHEFORT
                  The Cardinal's Guards are more
                  than capable of assuming that...
                  responsibility.

     Muttered curses and dissent throughout.       Rochefort raises
     his voice to be heard:

                                ROCHEFORT
                  You are hereby ordered to
                  disperse. Should even one of you
                  resist... the entire corps will
                  be arrested and imprisoned.
                         (with pleasure
                          and disdain)
                  'All for one, and one for all.'

     As Rochefort intended, the Musketeers explode. But
     before they can attack the Guards, de Treville's com-
     manding voice calls out above the clamor.

                  Musketeers!

     And with that, the Musketeers freeze. Their eyes go to
     de Treville. There is a moment of silence as de Treville
     chooses his words carefully. Even in defeat, de Treville
     is stoic.

                                DE TREVILLE
                  Go to your homes. Wait. Our
                  day will come again.

     De Treville shoots a defiant look at Rochefort who smiles
     in a patronizing manner. Then, de Treville leads his
     Musketeers out of the courtyard.

     He returns to the adjoining room where Jussac stands by.
     Rochefort has enjoyed himself immensely. He goes to a
     mirror and preens, adjusting his eye patch to a more rak-
     ish angle. That's when he catches a glimpse of something
     behind him. Something red. Rochefort turns.
     a tall, powerfully built MAN stands in the shadows of the
     room, a spectre in red.
                                ROCHEFORT
                  Your Eminence.
     Rochefort and Jussac instantly fall to their knees.
     ARMAND DU PLEISS THE CARDINAL RICHELIEU steps out of the
     darkness and into the light, his long crimson robes
     swirling about him like clouds of blood. His face is
     long, shrewd and intelligent. His eyes are penetrat-
     ing. He smiles his crocodile smile.
     Richelieu observes a duty roster on one of the walls.
     It contains the names of all the Musketeers, past and
     present.

     On Richelieu's face, a flicker of irritation.

16   EXT. BOULEVARD OF CRIME - DAY                                   16
     Jussac leads   a regiment of the Cardinal's Gruards down
     Paris' most   colorful and notorious street. They react
     to SHOUTING   and VIOLENT NOISES coming from a tavern
     ahead. The    one called... The Dead Rat.
     The tavern door flies open, and two of the Cardinal's
     Guards are flung into the street, bruised and bloody.
     Just then: A window on the second floor bursts open,
     and a big Musketeer dangles a struggling Guard by his
     feet, threatening to drop him into the street. The
     Musketeer, a man of enormous appetites -- wine, women,
     song -- is called PORTHOS. Jussac shouts:
                                JUSSAC
                  Release that man!!
     Happy to comply, Porthos lets go of the Guard who plunges
     to the street with a dull thud. Then, with a wink and a
     piratical grin, Porthos ducks inside. Jussac darkens,
     signals his men, and they rush toward the tavern.


17   INT. TAVERN                                                     17

     Jussac and his company burst in and discover the room in
     a shambles, the aftermath of a violent fight. But for
     now, all is calm.

     A group of the Cardinal's Guards is seated around a big
     table littered with flagons and bottles. On the floor
     around them are their swords and rifles. It appears the
     Gruards are celebrating a victory. But wait. There's
     something wrong with this picture. On closer inspection,
     we see that the Guards have been stripped to their under-
     clothes and tied to their chairs with ropes. They are
     all bruised and bloody. Some are unconscious.

     Presiding over the "celebration" are two Musketeers.
     They sit at the head of the table, relaxing with their
     boots up.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                           11.

     One of them casually cleans his sword with a lace hand-
     kerchief. He is ARAMIS, the most handsome and dashing of
     the Musketeers -- a poet and idealist -- a gentleman of
     great personal charm and style.
     His companion is   ATHOS, the Musketeers' deadliest and
     most charismatic   member -- also its most mysterious and
     tortured. Athos    is the unofficial leader of the Three
     Musketeers, their   planner and strategist. At the moment,
     he's sewing up a   nasty gash on his right arm.

                                JUSSAC
                         (approaching)
                  What is this?

     Athos greets him with a dark smile.

                                ATHOS
                  A private party. Go away.
                                ARAMIS
                  Athos -- is that any way to greet
                  our guests?

     Aramis leaps to his feet and bows graciously.    He is the
     epitome of politeness.
                                ARAMIS
                  Don't be shy, gentlemen. Come
                  in. Your friends have been
                  expecting you.
     Jussac is not amused.

                                JUSSAC
                  Your presence is requested at
                  Musketeer Headquarters by Captain
                  Rochefort.
     Athos and Aramis exchange looks.

                                ATHOS
                  The Cyclops is a Captain? He
                  must've made a pact with the
                  Devil.

                                ARAMIS
                  Or the Cardinal.
                                ATHOS
                  What's the difference?

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                            12.

                                ARAMIS
                         (with an edge
                          of contempt)
                  The Devil is more ethical than
                  the Cardinal.

     Jussac takes a step forward, fingering his saber.

                                JUSSAC
                  You're instructed to come with
                  me and surrender your tunics.

     With a sweeping gesture, Athos indicates the bloody
     Guards around him.

                                ATHOS
                  These gentlemen made a similar
                  request.
                                JUSSAC
                  Are you refusing to come
                  peaceably?
                                ATHOS
                  Probably. But I'll leave it up
                  to my companions. Aramis?
                                ARAMIS
                  We can't refuse Rochefort's
                  invitation. It would be
                  impolite.
     Athos tips back in his chair and gazes upward.

                                ATHOS
                  And what do you say, Porthos?

     To the Guards' surprise, Porthos is balancing on the
     balcony rail above, just about even with a large wagon
     wheel chandelier.

                                PORTHOS
                  I'll be right down!
     With the grace of an aerialist, Porthos jumps from the
     balcony and lands atop the chandelier. His weight causes
     the chains suspending it to break. With a whoop of
     pleasure, Porthos rides the chandelier down as it lands
     squarely atop Jussac's Guards, squashing them.

     When the dust clears, only Jussac has been spared. He
     looks on in disbelief as Porthos extricates himself from
     the wreckage and calmly brushes his clothes off.

                          Aramis; cheerful)
                  Ready when you are.
     Athos and Aramis sheathe their swords, put on their hats,
     wrap their capes around them and cross the room to join
     Porthos.
                                ARAMIS
                  Congratulations, Porthos.   You
                  brought down the house.
                                PORTHOS
                  My aim was off. I was trying to
                  hit Jussac.

     Athos fixes Jussac with a dark, threatening look.
                                 ATHOS
                  Now.   About those tunics...
     Jussac turns to watch Athos, Porthos, and Aramis step to
     the street. He mutters as if to curse:
                                JUSSAC

18   EXT. HIGH ROAD TO PARIS - DAY                                  18
     D'Artagnan, on horseback, pauses on a bluff overlook-
     ing the magnificent city on the Seine. What he beholds
     is Paris as it looked in the early part of the Seven-
     teenth Century, its steeples and towers rising to meet the
     sky. For a country boy like d'Artagnan, Paris is a
     magical place where the wildest of dreams can come true.
     D'Artagnan's reverie is broken by the sound of THUNDERING
     HOOFBEATS coming from behind. He turns in response and
     what he sees is this:
     Two women on horseback are riding for all they're worth
     pursued by two men on horseback.

19   D'ARTAGNAN                                                     19

     His heroic blood stirs. Women in danger! As the women
     GALLOP past, d'Artagnan leaps from his horse. Quickly
     formulating a plan, he clambers up the trunk of a nearby
     tree and climbs out on a branch that overhangs the road.

                                                           14.

20   ANGLE                                                       20
     As the two riders pass underneath, d'Artagnan leaps into
     space and tackles one of them, knocking him out of the
     saddle. The rider hits the ground and is knocked sense-
     less. One down.
     D'Artagnan scrambles to his feet as the second rider re-
     verses direction and GALLOPS back, charging d'Artagnan.
     The rider draws his saber.
     D'Artagnan dodges the horse and the sword. He catches
     the second rider's arm and yanks him right out of the
     saddle. The man lands with a painful thud at
     d'Artagnan's feet. Before he can recover, d'Artagnan is
     upon him with flying fists. One swift punch -- and the
     second rider is senseless. Two down.

     D'Artagnan stands over his two victims, out of breath,
     but greatly pleased with his performance. He looks up as
     the two women ride back to see what's happened.
     The first woman is of noble breeding, a beautiful dark-
     haired girl in her late teens. Her name is ANNE. Her
     companion is roughly the same age, titan-haired and
     equally beautiful. Her name is CONSTANCE.
     Anne regards the two men on the ground, then d'Artagnan.
     She shakes her head, laughs with delight and rides off.
     Constance remains. She smiles down at d'Artagnan from
     atop her horse.
                             CONSTANCE
               Do you have any idea what you've
               done?

                             D'ARTAGNAN
               I've saved you and your friend
               from these bandits.

                             CONSTANCE
               These 'bandits' are the Queen's
               own bodyguards.

     D'Artagnan is stunned.
                              D'ARTAGNAN
               The Queen?

     Constance points a finger in Anne's direction.
                             CONSTANCE
               If I were you, I'd make myself
               scarce. These men are going to be
               very angry when they wake up.

     D'Artagnan looks at the two bodyguards who are beginning
     to recover. Then he looks up at Constance, feeling like
     a prize idiot.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  I didn't know. I thought...

     Constance smiles at him, her eyes twinkling.
                                CONSTANCE
                  Do you have a name?

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  D'Artagnan.

                                CONSTANCE
                  You're a very foolish boy,
                  d'Artagnan... but a very handsome
                  one. Good-bye.
     Constance spurs her horse and rides off to catch up with
     Anne.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                          (calling after her)
                  Wait!   You didn't tell me your
                  name!
     But Constance is gone.
     D'Artagnan stands in the middle of the road, feeling
     foolish and oddly thrilled at the same time. The two
     bodyguards groan and grumble.

     A bright reflection catches d'Artagnan's eye. He looks
     down and sees a gleaming bracelet. He picks it up and...

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  The man who attacked you...
                         (pointing in the
                          opposite direction)
                  ... went that way.
     With a guilty smile, d'Artagnan spurs his horse and rides
     like Hell.

                                                    CUT TO:

21   EXT. COUNTRY ROAD                                              21

     D'Artagnan rides to the top of the ridge, stops suddenly,
     sees something that takes his breath away.

                                                            16.

22   D'ARTAGNAN'S POV                                             22
     Paris laid out for him like a jewel, cloaked in mystery,
     promising adventure and romance. D'Artagnan watches the
     women as they ride into the fabled city in the distance.
     He follows.
                                                  CUT TO:


23   INT. MUSKETEER HEADQUARTERS - DAY                            23
     Athos, Aramis, and Porthos sweep into the now deserted
     courtyard. Silence -- the last thing they expected --
     stops them in their tracks. The place is a cemetery,
     haunted by the ghosts of generations of Musketeers.
     Porthos is visibly distraught. Rochefort enters from
     behind an archway.

                             ROCHEFORT
               I'll take those tunics,
               Musketeers.
                             PORTHOS
                      (to Aramis)
               What did he say?
                             ARAMIS
               He said he'll take those tunics.
                              PORTHOS
               Tunics?   Coming right up.
     Porthos reaches inside his cloak and takes out a crumpled
     red tunic he took from one of the Cardinal's guards. He
     drops it on the ground, digs into a pocket and takes out
     another. He finds another in his boot and another up his
     sleeve. There's one in his hat. Like a magician, he
     keeps pulling red tunics out of the most bizarre places.

     Athos and Aramis have a few guard tunics themselves.
     They pull them out and drop them into the growing pile.

                             ATHOS
               I was trying to remember the last
               time I saw you here. I know. It
               was the day you were kicked out of
               the Musketeers.

                             ARAMIS
               Conduct Unbecoming a Musketeer.
               Wasn't that the charge?

                             ROCHEFORT
               You ought to know. Three witnesses
               stood against me.

                                ATHOS
                  It was the least we could do.

     The bitter memory hangs in the air for a moment.
                                ROCHEFORT
                  You are hereby ordered to
                  surrender your commissions and
                  make yourselves available for
                  reassignment in the King's Army.

                                ATHOS
                  And if we refuse?
                                ROCHEFORT
                  You will become outlaws.   Hunted
                  men.
                                PORTHOS
                  It doesn't matter where I go or
                  what I do. Sooner or later
                  somebody's calling me 'outlaw.'
     Athos cuts him off with a look. He's familiar with
     Porthos' propensity for tall tales. But not here, not
     now. Athos turns back to the balcony. Rochefort lobs a
     taunt.
                                ROCHEFORT
                  Are you refusing to serve your
                  King?
                                ARAMIS
                  We are refusing to serve the
                  Cardinal.
                                PORTHOS
                  Same thing, these days.
                                ARAMIS
                  France has one King too many.

                                ROCHEFORT
                  I'll tell him you said that.

     Athos, who has remained silent, speaks with quiet power:

                                ATHOS
                  Do that, Rochefort. Tell his
                  Emminence the Cardinal that we
                  will continue to perform our sworn
                  duty to protect the King. From
                  enemies across the sea.

                  take away our tunics, our muskets,
                  even our swords. But he cannot
                  stop us from being what we are.
                  Musketeers.

     The gauntlet has been thrown.       Rochefort picks it up with
     glee.

                                ROCHEFORT
                  I'll make sure His Emminence the
                  Cardinal gets the message. But I
                  can't promise he'll be pleased.

     Rochefort steps back, disappears into the shadows.       A
     beat. The Musketeers regard each other.

24   EXT. STREETS OF PARIS - DAY                                  24

     D'Artagnan rides through the streets of Paris. A country
     boy happily stunned by the sights, sounds, and smells of
     the city. Merchants gossip and call to each other from
     shop doors. Colorful vendors and pedestrians move along
     the crowded boulevard. Acrobats, puppeteers, and jug-
     glers perform on street corners. LAUGHTER and MUSIC
     drift from taverns and public houses.

     D'Artagnan views it all with great enthusiasm. He sees
     the exterior of the Musketeer Headquarters... wow! The
     future belongs to him.

25   ATHOS                                                        25
     He crosses the courtyard to a large wooden door. But as
     he reaches for the handle, the door flies open and smacks
     him in his injured arm.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                         (as he enters)
                  Look out!
                                ATHOS
                         (wincing in pain)
                  Aaarrgghh...

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                         (in a panic; looking
                          around)
                  Where are they? Where are the
                  Musketeers? I'm in the right
                  place, aren't I?

                                ATHOS
                         (through gritted
                          teeth)
                  Not as far as I'm concerned.

     Athos is wearing his cape in such a way that it hides
     his Musketeer tunic. D'Artagnan has no idea who he's
     dealing with.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  But this is Musketeer
                  Headquarters...

                                ATHOS
                  No. This was Musketeer
                  Headquarters.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  You mean it's been moved?

                                ATHOS
                  I mean the Musketeers have been
                  disbanded. Feel free to poke
                  around for souvenirs.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  What do you mean 'disbanded'?

                                ATHOS
                  Some nonsense about being needed in
                  the army. Now if you'll excuse
                  me...
     D'Artagnan blocks Athos' path.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  But I just got here. How can I
                  become a Musketeer if they've been
                  disbanded?
                                ATHOS
                  I'd say you've got a problem.
     D'Artagnan grabs Athos by his injured arm. Athos, stif-
     ling pain, fixes d'Artagnan with a deadly look.
                                ATHOS
                  You could use a lesson in manners.
     D'Artagnan touches his sword, eyes flashing at the pos-
     sibility of a duel.
                               D'ARTAGNAN
                  Any time.

                                ATHOS
                  I'm in a hurry now -- but I'll
                  meet you at the Carmes-Deshaux
                  monastery at noon.

     Athos exits.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                         (calling after him)
                  I'll be there ten minutes early.

                  An hour in Paris, and I already
                  have my first duel!
     Just then, d'Artangnan spies two familiar figures on
     horseback, distinctive cloaks hiding their faces. Anne
     and Constance, though he does not yet know their names.
     D'Artagnan hurries after.

                  But, Catherine, don't you see? As
                  an outlaw I'll be constantly on
                  the run from the Cardinal's guards,
                  a refugee. Think of all the places
                  you can hide me. I'm thinking of
                  them now.

     reveals Porthos leaning against an open window, speaking
     amiably to a pretty woman on the other side. She dabs a
     tear from her eye, manages a nod.


28   ANGLE ON D'ARTAGNAN                                    28
     Meanwhile, d'Artagnan races around another corner, down a
     narrow lane, and speeds after the ladies on horseback.
     He dashes through a muddy puddle -- spraying foul water
     all over Porthos where he stands. D'Artagnan doesn't
     notice, a huge cart loaded with wine barrels has rolled
     INTO VIEW, blocking the lane. Fellow travelers shout
     complaints, the cart driver shakes his head, makes an
     obscene gesture. It's a Seventeenth Century traffic jam.

     D'Artagnan sees Anne and Constance dismount in the dis-
     tance, tie their horses, and step into an alley. A man
     waits in the shadows to escort them. D'Artagnan leaps
     off his horse, he means to continue his pursuit on foot.
     But he takes two quick steps, and... runs directly into
     Porthos' outstretched hand.

     D'Artagnan looks up -- literally, given Porthos' impres-
     sive stature -- and sees the Musketeer's muddied tunic,
     and worse, a unique and expensive sash, now thoroughly
     soiled.
                                PORTHOS
                         (not a glimmer of a
                          grin)
                  Do you know where this sash comes
                  from?

                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                  No.
                                PORTHOS
                  It is a gift from the Queen of
                  America.
     Porthos' righteous indignation is more impressive than
     his knowledge of current affairs. D'Artagnan corrects.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  There is no Queen of America.

                          ever the gentleman)

                  That seems to be the local custom.
     Porthos lets out a weary sigh.         He shakes his head.

                  Me, you idiot.

     D'Artagnan gives him a blank look.

     Porthos couldn't be more insulted.       He sputters with
     rage.

                  All right, you little puke! You

29   EXT. STREETS OF PARIS - ALLEY - DAY                               29
     D'Artagnan thinks he sees     Anne and Constance, races down
     the alley, turns a corner,     down a short street, makes a
     hasty decision, runs down     yet another alley... and tum-
     bles into a shadowy lane.      He stops, looks left and
     right. And does see them.

     The ladies enter a chapel's back door, close the door
     behind them. D'Artagnan flies after, skids across cob-
     blestones, rips the door open... and finds himself face
     to face with the man who has escorted Anne and Constance
     this far.

                                 D'ARTAGNAN

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  A bracelet.
                                GUARD
                  I'll deliver it for you.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  No, you've been enough help
                  already. Would you be so kind
                  as to point out the Carmes-Deshaux
                  Monastery?
     The Guard points to a large building in the distance with
     a large cross.

30   INT. ROOM                                                       30

     PAN ACROSS the Virgin Mary and many lit candles to a
     BEAUTIFUL DAMSEL sharing a love seat with the third
     Musketeer, the dashing Aramis. Aramis has a book open
     and is reading from it.
     The Damsel suddenly grabs Aramis and kisses him on the
     mouth. Aramis politely extricates himself. He's not the
     least bit embarrassed, only slightly amused.

                                ARAMIS
                  Madam, I'm flattered but I thought
                  you wanted me to tutor you in
                  theology.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                                   25.

                                DAMSEL
                  Excuse me, Monsieur Aramis. But
                  when you started talking about
                  Original Sin, I lost control and
                  became impassioned. It won't
                  happen again.

                                ARAMIS
                  There's nothing unholy about
                  expressing one's emotions. On
                  the contrary. Religion should be
                  experienced in a passionate, all-
                  embracing way. We should feel
                  free to express our spirituality.

                                  DAMSEL
                  Yes, darling!
     The Damsel attacks him again.         Suddenly, a pounding on
     the door.
                                  MAN (O.S.)
                  Open up!

                                DAMSEL
                         (a gasp of fear)
                  My husband!
                                ARAMIS
                  Your husband!?
                                DAMSEL
                  Aramis -- run!

     But Aramis' heart is too noble.         He gets down on his
     knees.

                                ARAMIS
                  First we must pray to God for
                  forgiveness.

     That's when the door bursts open and the lady's husband,
     an irate MARQUIS enters with a pistol. His eyes blaze
     with madness. He aims the pistol at Aramis' head.

                                ARAMIS
                  On second thought, God's often
                  busy.
     Aramis leaps to his feet and sprints for the open window.

     As the Marquis aims and FIRES, Aramis puts one foot on
     the ledge and leaps into space. The shot misses him by
     inches.

                                                            26.

     As d'Artagnan runs past. Aramis lands on top of him and
     they go crashing to the cobblestones. As they untangle
     themselves and get up...
                             ARAMIS
               Thanks. You broke my fall
               perfectly. But I do apologize
               for the inconvenience...
                             D'ARTAGNAN
                      (angry)
               Get off me!
     D'Artagnan pushes Aramis aside. Aramis grabs d'Artagnan
     by the scruff of his neck and pulls him back.

                             ARAMIS
               If there's one thing I can't
               abide, it's rudeness.
                             D'ARTAGNAN
               You fell on me!
                             ARAMIS
               And I apologized for it.
                             D'ARTAGNAN
               I suppose you'd like to teach me a
               lesson in manners, too.
                             ARAMIS
               I'd be honored.
     D'Artagnan brightens.   Another duel!
                             D'ARTAGNAN
               How's two o'clock behind the
               Luxembourg?
     Aramis bows politely.

                             ARAMIS
               If that's where you wish to die,
               I won't disappoint you. Until
               then...

     Aramis takes off.   d'Artagnan swells with pride.
                             D'ARTAGNAN
               Three duels in one day. I love
               this town.

32   EXT. LOUVRE - DAY                                            32
     The Royal Palace of Louis XIII.

                             ANNE (V.O.)
               Have you seen the King?
                             SENESCHAL (V.O.)
               No, Your Majesty.

33   INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY                                       33

     Anne, or rather, Queen Anne, steps into the throne room,
     a massive cathedral-like chamber. Twin thrones occupy
     a raised dais. An entire wall is covered with a spectac-
     ular map of the world. The map contains every known
     country and continent, including the New World. The
     SENESCHAL exits, closing the doors with a resounding boom.
     Anne pauses, all alone in the big, drafty chamber. And
     for the first time, she looks and acts her age. Barely
     a woman, chilled by the ghosts of all the French kings
     and queens who came before her. And a long way from
     home. Anne steps to the great map of the world. She
     reaches out to touch her own country, Austria, feels a
     pang of separation. We hear:
                             MAN (O.S.)
               Your Majesty...

     Anne reacts with a start. A tall, powerfully built man
     stands in the shadows, a spectre in red.
                             ANNE
               Cardinal Richelieu, you surprised
               me.
     Cardinal Richelieu steps out of the darkness.     He smiles.

                             RICHELIEU
               How was your ride?

     Richelieu's question takes her by surprise. He bows
     before Anne. Considering a reply, she extends her hand.
     The Cardinal kisses it.

                               ANNE
               My ride...?    Well, I... I'm not
               sure...
                             RICHELIEU
                      (rising up)
               Forgive me.

               But your welfare is
               more than a matter of personal
               interest. It is a matter of
               State. But rest assured, your
               secret is safe with me.

     His manner is both charming and paternal. Anne, smart
     enough to exercise caution in all her palace dealings,
     is nonetheless touched by his concern.

                                 ANNE
                  Thank you.
     Richelieu turns to the great map, speaks gently.

                                RICHELIEU
                  You're homesick.
                                ANNE
                         (after a beat)
                  Lonely. Is that the same thing?
                                 RICHELIEU
                  Sometimes.
     Richelieu brings his eyes back to Anne, continues:
                                RICHELIEU
                  Austria's loss is France's gain.
                                ANNE
                  I'm not sure my new husband shares
                  your opinion.
                                  RICHELIEU
                  Nonsense.    He's young, not blind.

                                ANNE
                  Mostly, he is absent. I've barely
                  seen His Majesty since our wedding,
                  and that was three months ago.
                  Whenever he's around me, he has
                  nothing to say.

                                RICHELIEU
                  Arranged marriages can be
                  difficult. Your father and I
                  thought yours would bring Austria
                  and France closer together.

                                ANNE
                  Countries align more swiftly than
                  people, I'm afraid. Louis and I
                  remain... far apart.
                                RICHELIEU
                  May I advise you?

     He says it with seeming humility, not condescension.        Anne
     nods assent.

                                RICHELIEU
                  Louis was only nine years old
                  when his father was assassinated.
                  He lost his childhood forever that
                  day. I have watched him grow
                  toward manhood, seen the toll his
                  life demands. A boy who is not
                  allowed to be a boy sometimes has
                  difficulty becoming a man. He is
                  shy, yet boastful. Giving, yet
                  stubborn. But most of all, he is
                  not yet sure exactly who he is.
                  The boy who lost his father. Or
                  the King of France.
                                ANNE
                  But how can I...?

                                RICHELIEU
                  Flatter him. Make the boy feel
                  like a King. So that the King
                  may be your husband.

     Anne considers his eloquent advice, formulates a reply...
     when the huge doors to the throne room open with a dull
     boom, the Seneschal chants:

                                SENESCHAL
                  His Majesty, the King.

     The Seneschal steps aside as LOUIS XIII enters. He is
     surprisingly young, no older than d'Artagnan. His face
     is handsome and intelligent.

                                  RICHELIEU
                  Your Majesty.
                                LOUIS
                  Cardinal Richelieu, I've been
                  looking for you.

     As Louis strides toward them, Richelieu and Anne bow.

     When Louis sees Anne, he reacts with an almost imper-
     ceptible start. Her presence catches him off guard.

                                LOUIS
                  Oh. Anne. Hello. I didn't know
                  you were here.

     Louis hides his nervousness, not to mention his love,
     behind a formal veneer. Anne, emboldened by Richelieu's
     confidences, replies:

                                ANNE
                  Would you like me to go?
     Louis suddenly remembers the reason he's here.       Determin-
     ation breeds a more capable attitude.

                                LOUIS
                  No.  Please, stay.
                         (to Richelieu, aware
                          that she is watching
                          him)
                  Your Eminence, I demand an answer.

                         (hiding his amusement)
                  Perhaps if I knew the question...
                                LOUIS
                  I've just been told that you went
                  ahead and disbanded my Musketeers.
                                RICHELIEU
                  You approved the decision.
                                LOUIS
                  But not the timing of the matter.
                  I intended to address them myself,
                  explain the situation...
                                RICHELIEU
                  Your Majesty, France is on the

                  to invade La Rochelle within the
                  month. I thought it best to act
                  quickly --

                                LOUIS
                  I will be the judge of what is
                  best. For me, and for France.

     He says it with newfound resolve. Richelieu receives the
     rebuke with quiet grace. Anne watches the latter closely,
     suppresses a smile. The boy is nearer to King than
     Richelieu imagined.

                                 RICHELIEU
                  Of course.   Forgive me.
     A tense beat.    Anne, feeling out of place, steps toward
     the door.
                                 LOUIS
                  Anne?   Are you all right?
                                ANNE
                  You two should continue this
                  discussion in private.

                  Your thoughts on the matter
                  interest me. They might... help.

                                ANNE
                  It seems to me that... you're
                  doing very well on your own.

     She means it.    Anne smiles, exits.      A beat.   Louis sighs.
                                LOUIS
                  She's beautiful.

                  May I advise you?

     Repetition reveals calculation. Louis nods.       And the
     Cardinal surprises with quiet humor:

                                RICHELIEU
                  She scares me too. As do all
                  women who join beauty to
                  intelligence. What's a man to
                  do?

                                RICHELIEU
                  The course of love is full of
                  frightful turns. But, no matter
                  how you feel, no matter how
                  hopelessly afraid... never let
                  her know that you are anything
                  other than the bravest and most
                  confident man in France. Make
                  that your starting point, and
                  everything else will fall... into
                  place.

     A beat. Richelieu acting as the lost father.        And Louis
     appreciating it, speaking as a son:

                  Your Eminence, I'm sorry that I

                                 RICHELIEU

                  He's a foolish boy. And barely

     D'Artagnan walks proudly toward the Carmes-Deschaux
     monastery, bold and brave, his future at hand. Suddenly.

                                COACH DRIVER (O.S.)
                  Get out of the way, idiot!!

     A speeding carriage bears down on him. D'Artagnan leaps
     from its path, stumbles. He looks up in time to see the
     passenger inside, and for a moment, time seems to stop.

     She is a noblewoman of remarkable beauty, her face framed
     by the carriage window. Long blonde curly hair that
     cascades in ringlets to her shoulders, languid blue eyes,
     and skin as white as alabaster. She is known as MILADY
     DE WINTER. She is to sex, what Constance is to innocence.

     D'Artagnan watches as if in a dream. The carriage, the
     beautiful woman inside it. Paris wraps its arms around
     the young man's heart. Suddenly: a second face enters the
     carriage window, replacing hers, jarring by contrast. It
     is the fierce visage of Milady's Indo-Chinese Bodyguard,
     PARKER. The bodyguard glares, pulls at the carriage
     window curtains, taking Milady, the dream, from view.
     HOLD ON d'Artagnan, bewitched, as the CARRIAGE RUMBLES off
     into the city.

36   EXT. STREETS OF PARIS - SEINE - POV SHOT - DAY              36
     A beautiful house situated near the Seine. Milady's
     carriage stops before it. She steps to the street,
     Parker follows. After a brief spoken exchange, the body-
     guard departs on some errand. HENRI, the driver, a brutal-
     looking fellow, incongruous in his elegant coachman's
     uniform, snaps the reins, and guides the carriage away.
     Milady steps inside.


37   ANOTHER ANGLE - POV                                         37
     REVEALS this to have been the POV of two men standing in
     the shadows across the street. COUNT DE WINTER, forty-
     five, a kind face etched with sadness, and ARMAND DE
     WINTER, twenty-five, his son. They are well-dressed. But
     their manner and appearance suggests that they have
     traveled a long distance to find her.
                               COUNT DE WINTER
                  Wait here.
                                ARMAND
                  But, Father...

                               COUNT DE WINTER
                  Wait.
     He will not consider otherwise. Armand sighs, stands in
     the shadows, and watches his father cross toward Milady's
     house.

     Milady stands before a mirror, reaches for one of the many
     ivory combs that adorn her hair. As she places the comb
     we notice a small flower-like tattoo on her arm. She
     pauses to admire her beauty, then to see the image of
     Count de Winter, now standing behind her, his eyes dark
     and cold. Milady does not move from the reflecting glass,
     she smiles.

                             MILADY
               Count de Winter.

                             COUNT DE WINTER
                      (as much happiness as
                       the thought allows)
               We found you.

                             MILADY
                      (eyes on the mirror)
               Yes. Now that you have, what
               will you do?
                             COUNT DE WINTER
               Bring you back. To pay for what
               you did to my son.
                             MILADY
               And if I resist...?

                      (voice breaking with
                       emotion)
               I will kill you with my bare
               hands.

     The Count steps closer, close enough to touch. Milady,
     eyes bright with excitement, the smile still playing about
     her lips, replies:

                             MILADY
               Well if that's the case, I'd
               better start packing. But first,
               my hair...
     Milady, who has been removing combs throughout, reaches
     for the next, and...

     sign of his father. He looks about, impatient... and
     steps across the street to enter.

     Armand climbs a flight of stairs.    Still no sign of his
     father, or Milady. He calls out:

                            ARMAND
               Father?

     Worry makes him hurry. Armand takes hasty steps into
     Milady's bedroom. The first thing he sees is his own
     face in the mirror. The second is his father's inert
     body below it. Armand gasps, races to his side. A thin
     trail of bright blood is seen briefly at the older man's
     ear. Armand gathers his father up into his arms, and
     begins to weep.

     The monastery is a windowless building   bordered by a
     barren field, a dueling ground for men   who have little
     time to waste.  Athos sits on a stone   bench, waits for
     his adversary to arrive. His horse is    hobbled nearby.
     D'Artagnan rides INTO VIEW, dismounts.

               I have another appointment at one.

               You'll miss it, I'm afraid.

                             D'ARTAGNAN
               I'll try my best to be on time.

     Athos appreciates the young man's retort, takes a closer
     look. Then he rises to his feet, the pain in his arm
     makes him wince.

                             ATHOS
               I asked two of my friends to act
               as seconds, but they are not as
               punctual.

     D'Artagnan notices Athos' pained expression, the blood on
     his sleeve.
                             D'ARTAGNAN
               But you're wounded.

                             ATHOS
               Don't worry. I fight just as well
               with my left hand.

                  Thanks, but I see my seconds
                  coming now.

     Porthos and Aramis arrive on horseback. They dismount,
     view d'Artagnan with amazement. D'Artagnan reacts with
     similar surprise, smiles sheepishly.

                  What're you doing? You can't
                  fight this man.

                  I've also fallen in love.
                                ATHOS
                         (gruff to a fault)
                  Better to die for love than to
                  live for it. Gentlemen?
                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                              38.

     Athos gestures for Aramis and Porthos to stand aside. He
     draws his saber, ready to fight. A beat. And in that
     moment, d'Artagnan's face reveals an emotion he has never
     felt before in his young life. Fear. Athos sees it,
     allows him a moment to withdraw his saber. D'Artagnan
     does so, they square off, touch sabers, and...

     ... Jussac leads a patrol of the Cardinal's Guards INTO
     VIEW.
                                JUSSAC
                  There they are!!
     Athos and d'Artagnan separate as Jussac and his four
     swordsmen stride towards them.

                                 ARAMIS
                  Jussac.   Again.
     Athos steps forward to meet him.
                                ATHOS
                  I told you the next time we met
                  I'd want an answer. But I didn't
                  expect you so soon.
                                JUSSAC
                  The three of you are under arrest.
                  The boy's of no interest to me
                  and is free to go. Do you intend
                  to resist?
                                PORTHOS
                  Oh, don't be stupid. Of course we
                  intend to resist. Just give us
                  a second.

     Porthos huddles with Athos and Aramis.
                                PORTHOS
                  Interesting odds. Five of them
                  and three of us.
                                ARAMIS
                  It hardly seems fair. Let's give
                  them the chance to surrender.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                         (interrupting)
                  Excuse me, but there are four of
                  us.

     They turn and regard d'Artagnan.
                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                               39.

                                ATHOS
                  This is not your fight.    You're
                  not a Musketeer.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  I may not wear the uniform, but I
                  believe I have the heart of a
                  Musketeer.
     The three Musketters exchange smiles. D'Artagnan's
     youthful bravado manages a small dent in their cynicism.

                                PORTHOS
                  Bold and brave.

                                ARAMIS
                  A poet.
                                ATHOS
                  Have you got a name, boy?
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  D'Artagnan.

                                PORTHOS
                         (startled)
                  D'Artagnan?
     The name has meaning for all of them. The Musketeers
     look at each other, deadpan, shake their heads.
                                ARAMIS
                  Impossible.

                                PORTHOS
                  It couldn't be.

     Athos knows that it is. He steps forward, extends a
     hand. The others follow, shake as well. Athos intro-
     duces each in turn.

                                ATHOS
                  Athos... Porthos... Aramis.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  Pleased to meet you... How do you
                  do?... Good to see you again...
     Meanwhile, Jussac and his Guards look on with increasing
     impatience. He clears his throat, draws his saber. The
     Musketeers turn toward the Guards, d'Artagnan standing
     among them.
                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                PORTHOS
                  Well. Now that we're all
                  acquainted...
                                ATHOS
                  The Cardinal's Guards.

     D'Artagnan and the Musketeers draw their swords... and
     charge.

42   FIGHT                                                      42
     Suddenly: nine men are locked in mortal combat. Athos
     takes a Guard named Cahusac, Porthos battles BISCARAT,
     and Aramis battles with two adversaries at once.
     D'Artagnan looks for an opponent... and finds himself
     face to face with Jussac.
     The fighting style of the Musketeers is an exuberant mix-
     ture of styles and techniques. Athos is a brutal swords-
     man, his strokes overpowering and savage. His repertoire
     also includes swift kicks, solid punches, the occasional
     elbow when necessary. Aramis is a seamless and graceful
     technician, he handles his two opponents with balletic
     ease, an artist working with steel and flesh, rather than
     paint and canvas.
     And last, and perhaps the most entertaining of all,
     Porthos. He is a walking arsenal, carrying a variety of
     bizarre weapons on his body -- a crossbow, daggers, bolo,
     nunchucks -- all of which he uses with the polished skill
     of a master. Add this funhouse of armaments to his
     already impressive size and strength, and you have a one-
     man wrecking crew of epic proportions.
     D'Artagnan's youthful energy is by now familiar. He
     bounds about like a newborn tiger, encircles his adver-
     sary, changing stance and shifting his ground with alac-
     rity. Jussac is having a hard time defending himself
     against his opponent who seems to be attacking from all
     directions at once.
                                JUSSAC
                         (losing patience)
                  Stand still! How do you expect
                  me to kill you if you keep jumping
                  around!!

43   MONASTERY                                                  43

     A monk watches from the bell tower, incensed by the battle
     raging on the field below. He grabs the BELL rope, gives
     it a mighty pull... and sounds a clamorous ALARM.

                                                           41.

44   BACK TO SCENE                                               44
     Porthos reacts to the interruption with irritation. He
     produces a pair of nunchucks. Biscarat looks at the odd
     weapon with professional curiosity, slight confusion...
     and Porthos whacks him on the side of the head, knocks
     him to the ground.

                             PORTHOS
                      (eyes on the tower)
               Damn monks. Always spoiling
               everybody's fun.

     Aramis replies while shifting from one foe to the next.
                             ARAMIS
               They are nearer to God...

                             PORTHOS
               They're about to get a little
               nearer to the hilt of my sword.
                               ARAMIS
               Pagan.
                               PORTHOS
               Papist.
     Porthos slides over to handle one of Aramis' opponents.
     He'd rather bicker from close range. But Biscarat
     struggles to his feet, grabs his saber. Porthos sees
     him, sighs.
                             PORTHOS
                      (to Aramis)
               Excuse me?
                             ARAMIS
               I'm fine, thank you.

     And Porthos returns to his original foe. Meanwhile,
     Athos' heavy strokes take their toll. Cahusac staggers,
     wounded in arm, shoulder, grazed at the head -- and falls
     to the ground with a thud. Aramis calls out to him,
     indicates d'Artagnan:
                             ARAMIS
               Take a look at our young friend.

                             ATHOS
               You mean he's still alive?

     Not only is d'Artagnan alive, but he's making a fool out
     of Jussac.  Frustrated, enraged, Jussac makes a full lunge
     at him, but d'Artagnan ducks, then slips under Jussac's
     sword like a snake and runs him through.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                              42.

44   CONTINUED:                                                     44
     Jussac falls to the ground, lies still.    He is dead.

     Athos and Aramis react, impressed. Then turn their full
     attention on weakening foes. They disarm and disable
     them with swift strokes. Meanwhile, Porthos chases
     Biscarat into a grove of trees. The Guard has discovered
     the better part of valor, now runs for his life. Porthos
     -- who is at play as much as he is war -- takes a Spanish
     bolo from his cloak, and whips the balls over his head.
     Biscarat hears the odd WHIZZING sound, turns to face him.
     The color drains from his face.

                                 BISCARAT
                  Now what...?

     Porthos lets the bolo fly -- it catches Biscarat about
     the neck, the balls slam into his head. The Guard drops
     to the ground without a sound.
                                PORTHOS
                  God, I love my work.


45   AFTERMATH                                                      45
     A sudden silence, save for the occasional dull groan.
     D'Artagnan scans the battlefield, sees Aramis bending
     over Jussac's body, speaking in solemn tones under his
     breath.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                         (to Athos)
                  What's he doing?

                                ATHOS
                  Last rites. Aramis takes death
                  very seriously.

     Porthos returns in high spirits, stashes the bolo in a
     pouch under his cloak. D'Artagnan sees the other weapons
     there, including a boomerang. Maybe next time.

                                PORTHOS
                         (re: the bolo)
                  Do you know where this bolo comes
                  from?

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                         (a bold jest, given
                          the circumstances)
                  The Queen of America?

                                 PORTHOS
                  Spain.

     Porthos deadpans, then grins acceptance.      All for one,
     and one for all. D'Artagnan beams.

                                ARAMIS
                  Don't encourage him. By killing
                  Jussac, the boy's made himself
                  an outlaw too.

                                ATHOS
                  Not if he leaves Paris. Which is
                  exactly what he's going to do.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  I can't leave. I just got here.

                                PORTHOS
                  Go home, find a wench, live long
                  and prosper.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  Why can't I stay with you?
     Aramis and Porthos look to Athos.      As always, he will
     decide.
                                ATHOS
                  Because I do not want you to.
     It's hard to say whether he's acting out of concern for
     the boy... or he simply doesn't give a damn. Whatever
     the case, d'Artagnan is crestfallen. The Musketeers
     mount their horses, Porthos and Aramis adopt a friendlier
     tone.

                                ARAMIS
                  I know Athos may seem cold and
                  unfriendly, but don't let that
                  fool you.
                                PORTHOS
                  He really is cold and unfriendly.

                                ARAMIS
                  But he's also right. This is our
                  fight, not yours. Go on, get out
                  of here.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  Whatever happened to the motto of
                  the Musketeers? 'All for one,
                  and one for all.'

                                  ATHOS
                  Wake up, boy.    The Musketeers are
                  just a dream.

     Athos spurs his horse, rides away. Aramis and Porthos
     follow. HOLD ON d'Artagnan as he watches the Musketeers
     grow small in the distance. Then, sadly, he steps to his
     horse, climbs into the saddle. It has been both the best
     and the worst day of his young life.

     That's when a group of horsemen come riding around the
     corner of the monastery -- five Cardinal's Guards led by
     Rochefort himself. They see their wounded comrades,
     Jussac dead, and the three Musketeers escaping in the
     distance.

                                ROCHEFORT
                         (pointing)
                  There they go! After them!

     But before Rochefort and the Guards can give chase,
     d'Artagnan rides into the middle of the field to
     challenge them, as if to further prove himself worthy
     of the blue and gold.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                         (defiant)
                  Long live the Musketeers.
     And d'Artagnan draws his saber.


     AT DISTANCE
     The three Muskeeters rein their horses, look back to
     d'Artagnan's bold charge.
                                PORTHOS
                         (with admiration)
                  Do you believe this kid.

     D'Artagnan gallops toward the Guards to engage them.    He
     races through PISTOL SHOTS like a demon possessed.
     Rochefort rides to the lead, draws his sword.

                                ROCHEFORT
                         (shouts to the
                          others)
                  Fall back! I'll take him myself!

     And like two jousting knights, d'Artagnan and   Rochefort
     meet in the middle of the field. Their BLADES    connect
     with a resounding CLASH, d'Artagnan is knocked   clear of
     his saddle. He hits the ground with a painful    thud.
     Rochefort's Guards leap towards him.

                                                            45.

46   ANGLE TO INCLUDE MUSKEERS                                    46
     Porthos and Aramis are greatly moved by d'Artagnan's
     courage.

                              PORTHOS
                Rochefort's got the boy.

                              ATHOS
                       (seemingly unmoved)
                Too bad.
                              ARAMIS
                You can't just leave him.
     Athos spurs his horse, rides away. Aramis and Porthos
     exchange sad looks and hopeful comments.

                              ARAMIS
                He has a plan.
                               PORTHOS
                Definitely.   A plan.
     And with that, they gallop after.

     Meanwhile, d'Artagnan is soon outnumbered, and quickly
     subdued.
                              GUARD
                This boy fights like a wildcat.
                              D'ARTAGNAN
                       (exhausted)
                Thank you.

     The Guard clobbers d'Artagnan with the scabbard of his
     sword. The last thing d'Artagnan sees is the three
     Musketeers riding into the distance. Then the WORLD
     TILTS, GOES SUDDENLY BLACK.

     FADE IN:

48   EXT. BASTILLE - NIGHT                                        48

     The walls and towers of France's most infamous prison
     rise to meet a starless sky. The portcullis is raised
     by men-at-arms, admitting a spectacular crimson carriage
     pulled by a team of snow-white stallions. The emblem of
     the Cardinal of France is emblazoned on the carriage
     door, and THROUGH its WINDOW we see the profile of
     Richelieu.

     Lovingly, he fingers the upholstery of his extravagant
     carriage.

49   INT. DUNGEON - NIGHT                                           49

     A chamber in hell. Spiders the size of rats, rats the
     size of small dogs. A foul stench in the air. D'Artagnan
     is sprawled in a corner, unconscious, on a filthy matted
     floor. The sharp tip of a sword pokes him in the chest.
     D'Artagnan wakes with a start, springs back into action.
     As if he was still battling Jussac at the Carmes-Deschaux.
     He slaps the sword away, leaps to his feet, and reaches
     for his own. But it is gone.

                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                  My sword --
                                ROCHEFORT
                  It's magnificent. Where did you
                  get it?

     Rochefort steps INTO VIEW, the familiar eyepatch, admiring
     d'Artagnan's sword in his hands.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                         (after a beat)
                  It belonged to my father.
                                ROCHEFORT
                  Your father...

     Rochefort studies d'Artagnan for a long moment, then...
                                ROCHEFORT
                  Well now it belongs to me. I
                  collect swords. I take them
                  from the men I kill.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  I'm not dead yet.
     D'Artagnan starts forward. But Rochefort raises the
     sword, points it at his throat. D'Artagnan freezes,
     feels the sharp tip of the blade.
                                 ROCHEFORT
                  Soon enough.

     Rochefort shoves d'Artagnan back to the floor with a
     heavy boot. A beat. D'Artagnan peers at his dismal
     surroundings.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  Where am I?

                                ROCHEFORT
                  I'll give you a hint. It's not
                  the Louvre.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                         (realizing)
                  The Bastille! I'm in the Bastille!

                                ROCHEFORT
                  Well, you're the first person who
                  was ever happy to be here.
                  Unfortunately, your visit will be
                  a short one.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  What do you mean?
                                ROCHEFORT
                  You killed one of the Cardinal's
                  Guards. An offense punishable
                  by death.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  He interrupted a duel I was
                  fighting.

                                ROCHEFORT
                  Also punishable by death.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  It was a long day.
                                ROCHEFORT
                  You know them?

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  Who?

                                ROCHEFORT
                  The Musketeers.
     D'Artagnan says nothing.     He will not betray them.
     Rochefort leans close.

                                ROCHEFORT
                  Tell me where they are, and I
                  will be lenient.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  How?
                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                             48.

49   CONTINUED:    (2)                                             49
                                ROCHEFORT
                         (after a beat)
                  I will give you your father's
                  sword.
     A long beat. D'Artagnan eyes the gleaming saber, forged
     in the Crusades. He nods, gestures for Rochefort to
     come closer. As if to impart a secret. Rochefort tilts
     downward, d'Artagnan rises up... and whispers.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  Give me my father's sword, and
                  I'll cut out your heart.
     Bold words, bad timing. Rochefort snarls, slams the hilt
     of the sword into d'Artagnan's head. The youth slumps
     from the wooden stool to the floor, unconscious.
                                 ROCHEFORT
                  Fool.   Like your father.
     Rochefort storms from the cell. He nods at a grizzled
     jailer on his way out, indicates the chains and manacles
     on the cell wall. The jailer scurries over to d'Artagnan,
     inert in a shallow puddle of foul water. He lifts, drags
     him toward the chains -- but d'Artagnan's eyes pop open,
     the jailer reacts with surprise, and...
                                                   CUT TO:
50   INT. BASTILLE - CORRIDOR - NIGHT                              50
     The jailer exits from d'Artagnan's cell, closes the heavy
     door behind him. A CLOSER look reveals d'Artagnan in the
     jailer's soiled tunic, eyes bright with adventure. He
     looks left and right -- dank corridors, darkness, the
     OCCASIONAL GROAN. And steps lightly into the shadows.

51   ON D'ARTAGNAN                                                 51

     He seeks exit, finds only a labyrinth. Two jailers con-
     verse, step towards him. D'Artagnan leaps into a cell
     doorway, allows them to pass. Suddenly: scabrous hands
     reach from inside the cell, grab d'Artagnan by the throat.
     He shudders, leaps free. And continues.

     D'Artagnan steps     deeper in the labyrinth. Frustrated,
     no way out. Just      then: more FOOTSTEPS heading toward
     him. D'Artagnan      seeks refuge, watches as a cloaked
     figure steps INTO     VIEW, accompanied by a retinue of
     sullen jailers.
     D'Artagnan thinks fast... and joins them.

                                                   CUT TO:

                                                           49.

52   INT. BASTILLE - NIGHT                                       52
     D'Artagnan keeps step with the cloaked figure, the ret-
     inue. He keeps his head down, glances at the corridor
     ahead, looking for a way out. But the cloaked figure is
     escorted up a long stairway, into another hall, and
     toward a pristine wooden door. D'Artagnan watches as
     the door opens, revealing... Cardinal Richelieu, a fear-
     some apparition in red, the most powerful man in France.

     D'Artagnan's jaw drops. The cloaked figure steps inside.
     The jailers disperse. D'Artagnan takes steps as if to
     join them... then turns back, eyes the door, the Cardinal
     and the cloaked figure now behind it.

53   ANGLE TO INCLUDE INTERIOR                                   53

     The cloaked figure bows to the Cardinal. Richelieu
     smiles, concupiscent. Rochefort stands in a corner,
     ignored for the moment.
                             RICHELIEU
               I have an errand that requires
               your singular talents.

     The figure rises. The hood falls back... revealing the
     unforgettable features of Milady de Winter. She answers
     the Cardinal's smile with a seductive expression.
                             MILADY
               I was beginning to think you'd
               forgotten me.
                              RICHELIEU
               Forget you?   Impossible.
     Richelieu and Milady share a look of intimacy, two vipers
     from the same pit.

54   OUTSIDE DOOR                                                54

     D'Artagnan slips closer, reaches for the handle, finds it
     unlocked. He opens the door a fraction, holds an ear
     close...


55   BACK TO SCENE                                               55
     Richelieu produces a sealed document from his sleeve,
     and hands it to Milady.

                             RICHELIEU
               Carry this to the Duke of
               Buckingham.

                         (impressed)
                  You did it. An alliance with
                  Buckingham.
                                RICHELIEU
                  The King left me no choice. Now
                  that he's come of age, the boy
                  believes he should rule France.
                  Instead of me.

     Rochefort knows what this portends.    He steps from the
     corner.
                                ROCHEFORT
                  You're going to go through with
                  ... everything?
                                RICHELIEU
                         (silences him with
                          a glance)
                  Yes. Everything.
                         (to Milady)
                  You're to leave for Calais at
                  once. A ship called the
                  Persephone will carry you to
                  England. It sails Tuesday,
                  midnight. I want Buckingham's
                  signature next to mine before the
                  King's birthday. Friday.
                                MILADY
                  Consider it done.

                                RICHELIEU
                  And doing so, shall earn you the
                  gratitude of... a King.

     Richelieu's not talking about Louis.    He's talking about
     himself.

56   INT. BASTILLE - CORRIDOR - NIGHT                                56

     D'Artagnan leaps back from the door as it opens, head
     down, shuffles to join the retinue of jailers as they
     RETURN TO VIEW. Milady, unrecognizable behind her cloak,
     steps into the corridor, the retinue escorts her forward.
     D'Artagnan falls into place, eyes down, eager for escape.
     Just then: a hand slams down upon his shoulder.
     D'Artagnan looks up into the face of Captain Rochefort.

                                                            51.

     D'Artagnan lands with a thud at Richelieu's feet.
     Rochefort hisses:
                              ROCHEFORT
                On your knees.

     When d'Artagnan fails to respond, Rochefort gives him a
     mighty kick. D'Artagnan scrambles into the correct
     posture of supplication. Rochefort continues:

                              ROCHEFORT
                This is the boy who killed
                Jussac.
                              D'ARTAGNAN
                I can explain that --
                               ROCHEFORT
                Silence!
     Rochefort punches d'Artagnan in the head, knocking him to
     the floor. The Cardinal frowns.

                             RICHELIEU
                Rochefort. Violence solves
                nothing. Leave him to me.
     D'Artagnan reacts to the Cardinal's reasonable tone.
     Rochefort makes a sullen exit. The Cardinal smiles.
                                RICHELIEU
                Please.    Sit down.
     D'Artagnan reacts with perceptible awe, as if seeing his
     first movie star. He sits in a finely brocaded chair,
     looks at the Cardinal, an apparition in red. The Cardinal
     speaks, his manner casual, friendly.

                How much did you hear?

                              D'ARTAGNAN
                       (busted)
                Not a word, Your Eminence. I
                stepped from my cell for a breath
                of air, and became lost in the
                corridors, it's dark as you know,
                but then I saw a light up ahead,
                the light over your door, I...

     Richelieu smiles, dismisses d'Artagnan's tale with a
     wave of his hand.

                                RICHELIEU
                  You may have many talents, my
                  young friend. But guile is not
                  one of them. Do you have a name?

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  D'Artagnan.

                                RICHELIEU
                  I've heard that name before.   Are
                  you a Gascon?

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  Yes, Your Eminence.
                               RICHELIEU
                  Tell me. What brought you to
                  Paris. And don't say 'a horse.'
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  I came to join the King's
                  Musketeers.
                                RICHELIEU
                  Bad timing.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  So I've heard.
                                RICHELIEU
                  D'Artagnan, I like you. I could
                  use a capable young man like you
                  in my Guards.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  I'm honored, Your Eminence, but I
                  don't think I would be very
                  popular with the other men. Not
                  after today.
                                RICHELIEU
                  I suppose not. Your heart is set
                  on being a Musketeer.
                         (off his look)
                  When I was your age, I too had
                  dreams of joining the Musketeers.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                         (surprised)
                  You, Your Eminence?
                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                              53.

                                RICHELIEU
                  Why not? Becoming a Musketeer is
                  the fantasy of every young
                  Frenchman. Or should I say it
                  was...
                         (with seeming
                          kindness, reason)
                  Like the Knights of the Round
                  Table, the Musketeers have
                  outlived their usefulness. They
                  are a thing of the past.
                         (beat)
                  And so have your three friends.
                  Tell me where they are, d'Artagnan,
                  and I will spare your life.

     Richelieu's seeming kindness conceals a heart of ice.
     D'Artagnan sees it now, replies quietly. No longer in
     awe, but in opposition.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  I'm sorry. But I can't tell you
                  what I do not know.

                                RICHELIEU
                  In that case, give my regards to
                  the headsman.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  What about my trial?
                                RICHELIEU
                  You've just had it.

     Richelieu turns for the door, means to dismiss him.
     D'Artagnan calls after.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  Wait --
                               RICHELIEU
                  Why? Do you object to losing
                  your head?
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                  Yes.   I like it where it is.

                                RICHELIEU
                  Then tell me what I want to know,
                  and perhaps you will keep it there
                  a few years longer.
                         (beat)
                  Where are the three Musketeers?
                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                              54.

58   CONTINUED:    (3)                                              58
                                  D'ARTAGNAN
                  I don't know.

                                RICHELIEU
                  And if you did?

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                         (after a beat)
                  I wouldn't tell you.
                                RICHELIEU
                  I admire your courage, young man.
                  You might have made a fine
                  Musketeer after all.

     Richelieu opens the door.       Rochefort waits on the other
     side.
                                RICHELIEU
                  But we'll never know, will we?
     Rochefort steps into the room, grabs d'Artagnan roughly
     by the arm, hurls him from the chair to the floor. This
     time Richelieu does not utter protest. Instead, he
     turns to the Captain, commands:
                                RICHELIEU
                  Find the three Musketeers and kill
                  them.
                                ROCHEFORT
                  They'll be dead by dawn.
                                RICHELIEU
                  A comforting thought. Good night,
                  d'Artagnan. Enjoy it. Morning
                  comes quickly.

     With that, Cardinal Richelieu sweeps into the dark.       HOLD
     ON d'Artagnan for a beat. History's pawn.

                                                    CUT TO:

59   EXT. BASTILLE - MARKET SQUARE - DAY                            59

     BELLS TOLL. A motley crowd gathers around the execution
     scaffold, held back by men-at-arms. A hooded executioner
     mounts the steps of the scaffold in the company of a
     PRIEST. The Priest wears a black cassock and a broad
     black sombrero. The executioner, a large man, raises
     his axe and touches the end of the blade, cutting his
     finger. Razor-sharp. The executioner holds up his
     bloody thumb.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

59   CONTINUED:                                                59
     The crowd roars approval. And turns to regard the day's
     victim as he is rolled INTO VIEW.

     D'Artagnan stands, half-naked, his hands bound behind him,
     in a horse-drawn cart. The driver turns the cart, begins
     a circuit of the square. The blood-thirsty crowd cheers
     and jeers at d'Artagnan. But d'Artagnan keeps his head
     high. If he must die, he will die with dignity.

60   TOWER OF BASTILLE                                         60

     Rochefort watches from a tower overlooking the square.
     Richelieu appears beside him.

                                ROCHEFORT
                  Milady left at midnight.   By
                  private coach.
                                RICHELIEU
                  A remarkable woman. The most
                  beautiful I've ever known. And
                  the deadliest. Which would
                  explain my attraction.
                         (peering down at
                          the scene)
                  How is our young daredevil holding
                  up?

                                ROCHEFORT
                  He's wishing he'd never heard of
                  the Musketeers.
     Down below, the horse cart reaches the scaffold. A man-
     at-arms drops the tailgate, d'Artagnan steps down. He is
     taken into the custody of a CAPTAIN OF THE GUARDS, and
     several men-at-arms carrying muskets.

61   ANOTHER ANGLE                                             61

     The Cardinal's familiar carriage is parked a safe distance
     from the square. The Guards who attend it have wandered
     off to watch the festivities. The coachman remains,
     seated on top, braiding his whip. Suddenly, a gloved hand
     grabs the coachman, yanks him from his seat.

62   SCAFFOLD                                                  62

     D'Artagnan is led by the Captain of the Guards up the
     stairs to the execution platform. The executioner and
     the Priest wait patiently above. D'Artagnan sees the
     bloodstained block where his neck will soon lie; pales.
     The Priest mutters comfort:
                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                             56.

62   CONTINUED:                                                        62
                                PRIEST
                  Fear not, my son...

     D'Artagnan regards the Priest whose face is hidden be-
     neath the brim of his broad black hat. He holds a
     large Bible in his hands.

                                PRIEST
                  For we are with you, always.
     The Priest raises his face, reveals it... and winks.         It
     is Aramis. He whispers:
                                ARAMIS
                  All for one, and one for all...

     D'Artagnan's heart soars. He turns to face the execu-
     tioner. Porthos grins beneath the hood's overhang.
                                CAPTAIN OF THE GUARDS
                  Prepare the prisoner.
     Porthos lays his axe aside, approaches d'Artagnan in a
     threatening manner. He takes him by the scruff of the
     neck, and forces his head upon the chopping block. The
     crowd goes wild.
                                PORTHOS
                         (whispers into his
                          ear)
                  Don't worry, boy. You won't
                  feel a thing.
     The Captain of the Guards gives Aramis a suspicious look.
                                CAPTAIN OF THE GUARDS
                  Where is Father Rostand today?

                                ARAMIS
                  The good father is... all tied up.

                                 CAPTAIN OF THE GUARDS
                  Very well.   Proceed.
     Porthos nods.


63   ANOTHER ANGLE                                                     63
     Meanwhile, on the perimeter of the square, two figures
     ride on horseback, they wear familiar cloaks. A CLOSER
     look reveals Queen Anne and Constance. They ride through
     the city, towards the countryside beyond. But their
     progress has led them here. Anne frowns at the spectacle.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                  Barbarism.

                                CONSTANCE
                  Men call it justice.

                                ANNE
                  Are you surprised?
     She replies   with contempt, reins her horse away from the
     square, the   crowd, the executioner's axe. But Constance
     freezes in   place, eyes wide. As d'Artagnan, upon the
     cart, rolls   INTO VIEW.
                               CONSTANCE
                  It's him.

     For just a moment, their eyes lock. Inestimable space
     between. Constance's eyes fill with tears, she watches
     d'Artagnan. Porthos steps back from d'Artagnan, raises
     his axe. D'Artagnan shuts his eyes, wonders, mutters a
     silent prayer. That's when screams of panic erupt from
     the crowd. D'Artagnan raises his head to see the source
     of this mayhem.


64   MARKET SQUARE                                                64
     The Cardinal's crimson carriage races toward the scaffold,
     scattering the crowd in all directions. Men shout, women
     scream, all leaping to avoid the stallion's sharp hooves,
     the coach's THUNDEROUS spinning WHEELS. In the driver's
     seat, clutching the reins in one hand and CRACKING a WHIP
     in the other... is Athos.
     Porthos uses the heavy blunt end of the axe to topple the
     closest men-at-arms. Aramis opens his Bible, pulls out
     a PISTOL, and BLASTS the saber from the hand of the
     Captain of the Guards. A man-at-arms raises his musket
     to shoot the false priest, but d'Artagnan leaps out of
     nowhere, lands on him with both feet, knocking the man-
     at-arms off the scaffold.

65   CARRIAGE                                                     65

     Athos pulls up alongside the scaffold.
                                ATHOS
                         (the usual dour
                          expression, but a
                          hint of levity)
                  Gentlemen, your carriage.
                  Compliments of the Cardinal.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

65   CONTINUED:                                                     65
     D'Artagnan rushes to the edge of the scaffold, springs
     into the air, landing on the seat beside him. Aramis and
     Porthos shed their disguises, jump after, light upon the
     carriage. The roof fabric tears, they drop into the
     plush interior below. Athos CRACKS the WHIP... and the
     stallions race off through the crowd, towards freedom.


66   SQUARE                                                         66
     Constance watches the escape, transfixed, delighted. As

     Athos produces a dagger, cuts the leather ties that bind
     d'Artagnan's wrists.
                                 ATHOS
                  Hold on!

     Athos cracks the whip, driving the horses onward.

     Aramis and Porthos have settled in comfortably.      Porthos
     spies a wicker hamper on the floor.
                                PORTHOS
                  Well, what have we here?

     Porthos lifts the lid. Inside: bottles of wine, champagne,
     and a wide assortment of foods.

                                PORTHOS
                  How considerate of the Cardinal
                  to provide us with a snack.

     Porthos extracts a bottle of wine, grabs a turkey leg.
     Aramis looks about the interior, spies a small ornate
     box.
                                 ARAMIS
                  Hello.

     Aramis opens the box, reacts.        It is filled with gold
     coins, jewelry.
                                ARAMIS
                  How is it that a man of God
                  becomes a man of gold?
                                PORTHOS
                         (looks on, grins)
                  Trinkets for the ladies.
                                 ARAMIS
                  Let's share.

70   STREETS OF PARIS - CARRIAGE                                     70

     Aramis sticks his head through the hole in the fabric
     roof, hands the ornate box to d'Artagnan.
                                ARAMIS
                  Would you be so good as to
                  distribute these? Your generosity
                  will be greatly appreciated.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                         (open the box, reacts)
                  But...?
                                ARAMIS
                         (to the point)
                  Throw the coins, boy.     The people
                  are hungry.

     D'Artagnan grabs a handful of coins, and tosses them into
     the air. Aramis smiles approval, drops back to the
     carriage interior. Pedestrians see the gold, shout, and
     leap after. Their hurried steps impede the Guards' pro-
     gress, horses rear up, soldiers tumble. But several of
     the Guards manage to avoid the obstacle, pursue the
     carriage with renewed determination. D'Artagnan hears a
     LOUD POPPING sound, ducks.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  They're firing at us!

                                                             60.

     Porthos sticks his head INTO VIEW, offers them a bubbling
     bottle of champagne, the source of the popping sound.

                               PORTHOS
                  Champagne?

                                ATHOS
                  You know I prefer wine.
                                PORTHOS
                  Don't go away.

     Porthos ducks down, returns with a new bottle.
                                PORTHOS
                  May I recommend this find
                  Cabernet?
     Porthos hands   the bottle to Athos. Athos hands the reins
     to d'Artagnan.    D'Artagnan struggles with the reins, tries
     to control the   horses. And beams, taking delight from
     every instant   of adventure. Athos SMASHES the top of the
     BOTTLE, drinks   deeply, settles back to enjoy himself.

                                ATHOS
                  Turn right at the next street.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  The next right...?
                               ATHOS
                  Turn.
     Athos growls, d'Artagnan jerks at the reins. The carriage
     careens around the corner, tipping on two wheels.

     Porthos looks up from his chest, champagne spilled all
     over his tunic... and a brand new sash.

                                PORTHOS
                         (to Aramis)
                  That's it. Next time, you drive.

     The carriage charges up a steep hill. At the summit, Athos
     tosses aside his bottle, takes the reins from d'Artagnan.
                                                   (CONTINUED)

     D'Artagnan sighs with relief. Athos yanks the brake
     lever, brings the horses to a halt, and leaps down from
     the driver's seat. D'Artagnan follows. Athos pulls the
     passenger door open, revealing Porthos and Aramis inside.
     Gold coins on the carpet at their feet, food and drink
     between them.

                                ATHOS
                  Gentlemen, this is the end of the
                  line. I hope you had a pleasant
                  ride.
                         (to d'Artagnan)
                  Unhitch the horses.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  But the Guards.

     D'Artagnan points to the bottom of the hill.       The mounted
     Guards chase after, begin their ascent.
                                 ATHOS
                  Do as I say.
     D'Artagnan hurries to the horses. Porthos and Aramis
     climb from the cab. Porthos emits a contented belch.
                                ATHOS
                         (to Aramis)
                  Your pistol and powder, please.
     Aramis hands Athos a sack of powder, and his pistol.
     Athos tosses the sack into the carriage, takes aim with
     the PISTOL, and SHOOTS it -- igniting the powder inside.

                                 ATHOS
                  Stand back.

     The interior of the Cardinal's carriage bursts into
     flames.

     D'Artagnan and the three Musketeers mount the Cardinal's
     white stallions, race off into the distance. Porthos
     shouts, laughing.

                                PORTHOS
                  I'd give five years of your life
                  just to see the Cardinal's face!

74   RICHELIEU'S FACE                                             74
     The Cardinal's face is contorted in fury. He    steps out of
     a horse cart, approaches the charred remains   of his be-
     loved carriage. He stares at the smouldering    ruin for a
     long beat. Rochefort and a company of Guards    stand near-
     by, wait for him to speak. When he does, his    tone is
     measured and calm.

                             RICHELIEU
               One thousand pistoles on each of
               their heads, dead or alive. The
               boy knows our plans.

     Rochefort reacts with surprise.

     D'Artagnan and the three Musketeers rest against tree
     trunks in a hidden glade, polish off the last of the
     Cardinal's food and drink. Their usual cynicism replaced
     by something approaching camaraderie. Aramis smiles as
     d'Artagnan attacks a turkey wing.
                             D'ARTAGNAN
               I haven't eaten in three days.
               I guess with all the excitement,
               I forgot.
                             ARAMIS
               Your trip from home has been an
               eventful one.

                             D'ARTAGNAN
                      (he can't quite
                       believe it)
               Three days.
                             PORTHOS
               I heard of a d'Artagnan once. He
               was a captain in the Musketeers
               when we were just recruits.
                             D'ARTAGNAN
               He was my father.

                             ARAMIS
               A good man, I'm told.

                             PORTHOS
               I knew there was something
               familiar about this boy.

                         (sadly)
                  He died when I was nine.
     The mention of the elder d'Artagnan's death casts a pall.
     D'Artagnan continues, tentative, the memory still hurts.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  All my mother would tell me is
                  that he died in the service of
                  the King.

     An uncomfortable silence.     It is Athos who finally speaks:
                                ATHOS
                  D'Artagnan, your father and another
                  Musketeer were ambushed and
                  murdered outside the Louvre.
     D'Artagnan pales, stunned and silent.      He manages a
     broken whisper:
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  This other Musketeer -- is he
                  still alive? I'd like to talk
                  to him.
     Athos shakes his head.     Porthos adds:

                                PORTHOS
                  You already have. His name is
                  the Count De Rochefort.
     D'Artagnan isn't listening. He stands suddenly, turns,
     and walks away. He doesn't want the Musketeers to see
     the tears forming in his eyes. Aramis shouts after:

                                ARAMIS
                  D'Artagnan.

     D'Artagnan stands at a flowing stream, wipes the tears
     from his eyes. Aramis appears at his side, offers silent
     comfort, a hand on d'Artagnan's shoulder.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                         (quietly)

                  the man who murdered my father
                  and kill him where he stands.

                                ARAMIS
                  A man is better measured by his
                  life than by his death. Your
                  father was bold, and brave.

                                D'ARTAGNAN

                  He lives in you.
     That's all the evidence Aramis requires.       D'Artagnan
     pauses to reflect. Then wonders:
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  And your father?

                                ARAMIS
                  I was orphaned at a young age.
                  The church took me in.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  You didn't have one.
                                ARAMIS
                  But I did. He was a great man,
                  a leader of the church. And his
                  example inspired me to dedicate
                  my life to God's service.

     Aramis opens his cloak, reveals a priestly cloth.       A
     secret he carries near to his heart.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  You were a priest...

                  betrayed the church, and turned
                  his back on God. To worship power
                  and gold.

                         (quietly)
                  It broke my heart to see it.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  And you became a Musketeer.

                                ARAMIS
                  I joined the Musketeers and a
                  strange thing happened. I got my
                  faith back.

                                D'ARTAGNAN

                  All of France knows him. His
                  Eminence, the Cardinal Richelieu.
     D'Artagnan nearly jumps from his boots.

77   EXT. ROOF OF PALAIS CARDINAL - DAY                             77
     Richelieu stands on the roof   of the Palais, lost in
     thought.  He looks down and   sees, through the smoke and
     mist, the silent rooftops of   Paris, pointed, innumerable.
     Richelieu turns, and crosses   to an elaborate pigeon coop.
     Servants attach messages to   the legs of carrier pigeons.
     Rochefort steps INTO VIEW, anxious, out of breath.
                                ROCHEFORT
                         (bowing)
                  Your Eminence. The Musketeers
                  have been sighted riding north
                  on the road to Calais.

     Richelieu nods, he already knows.       He picks up one of
     the pigeons, strokes it gently.
                                RICHELIEU
                  Don't worry. Thanks to our winged

                  bounty hunter in France will be

     The three Musketeers gather around d'Artagnan, listen to
     his story. In mid-telling:

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  ... I couldn't hear it clearly,
                  I was standing by the door, the
                  voices were low --

                               PORTHOS
                  Go on.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  The Cardinal sent someone to
                  England. With a secret treaty.
                               ARAMIS
                  What?
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  He's made an alliance with a man
                  named, Bucking... Buckingham.
     The Musketeers look at each other with alarm.
                                PORTHOS
                  The Duke of Buckingham?

                         (nodding)
                  Do you know him?
                                ARAMIS
                  He rules England the way Richelieu
                  rules France.

                  A ship called the Persephone waits

                  This messenger and the treaty will
                  prove the Cardinal a traitor. If
                  we can get our hands on them.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  What are we waiting for, let's go.

                               ATHOS
                  Wait.

     Athos stops their exuberant plots and plans with a
     single word. All turn, wonder.
                                ATHOS
                         (as always, the
                          bottom line)
                  Does the Cardinal know you have
                  this information?
                               D'ARTAGNAN
                  Yes.
                                ATHOS
                  Then he knows we have it too. And
                  he'll do everything in his power
                  to stop us.
                                PORTHOS
                  But with three men trying, one
                  of us might be able to make it.
                               D'ARTAGNAN
                  Four.
     Bold words. D'Artagnan matures by leaps and bounds.
     Athos almost smiles.

79   EXT. ROAD TO CALAIS - NIGHT                                   79

     Fog drifts across    a lonely stretch of road. Suddenly:
     pounding HOOFBEATS    come over the scene. MUSIC SWELLS.
     And galloping out    of the fog come d'Artagnan and the
     three Musketeers,    riding hell-for-leather. HOLD ON this
     heroic tableau for    a long beat.

80   EXT. BRIDGE ON ROAD TO CALAIS - NIGHT                         80

     Four rough-looking MERCENARIES crouch on a low bridge
     spanning a shallow stream. They are armed with muskets
     and swords. The Mercenaries wait in the darkness, whisper
     eagerly among themselves.

     One of them hisses for silence, all conversation ends.
     And the sound of HOOFBEATS is heard in the distance.
     Faint, but growing closer.
                                MERCENARY
                  Shoot low. We'll need their
                  heads for identification.

     The Mercenaries raise their muskets, take aim. Right on
     cue, four horsemen come THUNDERING out of the mist. But
     just before they reach the bridge, the four horsemen
     break in half -- one pair rides to the left, the other to
     the right. Before the Mercenaries realize what's
     happened, the horsemen ride on either side, splashing
     through the shallow stream. In a flash, they return to
     the road, and race away. Having avoided the bridge
     completely.
     Cursing, the angry Mercenaries whirl about, FIRE at
     d'Artagnan and the three Musketeers as they ride into
     the night. Porthos' merry laugh drifts back to mock them.

81   EXT. ROAD TO CALAIS - NIGHT                                   81
     An overturned wagon lies in the ditch. Beer kegs litter
     the roadway. The wagon's driver, an old FARMER, sits on
     one of the kegs, holding his head. D'Artagnan and the
     Musketeers gallop INTO VIEW, rein their horses to a stop.
                                FARMER
                         (with relief)
                  Thank God for a friendly face.
                  My horse broke loose. Can you
                  help me move these kegs out of
                  the road?
     D'Artagnan starts to dismount.

                                ATHOS
                  Stay on your horse.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  He needs our help.

                                 ATHOS
                  Don't worry.   We'll help him.

     Suddenly: two other men step before the wagon, pointing
     muskets. The ragged Farmer reaches inside his coat, pulls
     out a pistol, makes a smirking request:
                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                ARAMIS
                  Gentlemen, I beg you. Please put
                  away your weapons and remove these
                  kegs from the road. We'd prefer
                  to ride on without having to kill
                  you.
     D'Artagnan and the "Farmers" gape at Aramis in surprise.

                                FARMER
                  You're threatening us?

                                PORTHOS
                  It's not a threat, it's a fact.
                  If you don't haul those kegs away,
                  you're dead where you stand.
     The Farmer laughs, contemptuously. He raises his pistol
     and aims it at Porthos' head. But before he can pull the
     trigger, THREE EXPLOSIONS ERUPT from under the cloaks of
     Athos, Porthos and Aramis.
     When the smoke clears, d'Artagnan is startled to see the
     three dead "Farmers" sprawled in the road and the three
     pistols emerging from beneath the cloaks of the
     Musketeers.
                                PORTHOS
                  Mine hit the ground first.
                                ATHOS
                  Mine was taller.
     Aramis swings out of the saddle and begins to perform
     last rites over the bodies. D'Artagnan still can't be-
     lieve what just happened. He turns to Porthos. Porthos
     raises the barrel to his lips and blows away the gunsmoke.

                                PORTHOS
                  There's only one rule, d'Artagnan
                  -- stay alive.

     THUNDER RUMBLES and RAINS begins to fall.

     Present are the INNKEEPER, his wife, a few benighted tra-
     velers and THREE BARMAIDS. They turn as the door flies
     open and the Musketeers and d'Artagnan enter from a RAGING
     STORM. They keep their cloaks drawn about them and wear
     the brims of their hats pulled low to cover their faces.

     The occupants of the inn regard the new arrivals with
     suspicion. Outisde, the STORM BLOWS. D'Artagnan closes
     the heavy door. Fearful, the Innkeeper comes forward to
     meet the four ominous travelers.

                                  INNKEEPER
                  Good evening.

                  I'm sorry but we have little to
                  spare. The Cardinal's Guards were
                  here today. They helped
                  themselves to our food and then
                  refused to pay.

                  In the name of God, I'm sure.
     Porthos is on the lookout for danger. He reaches inside
     his cloak for a weapon and, in doing so, accidentally
     exposes his Musketeer tunic.

                                BARMAID #1

                  Musketeers!

     The sound of SLIDING STEEL as Athos, Porthos, Aramis and
     d'Artagnan draw their swords, ready to fight. They stand
     back to back in a circle, ready for attack.

     But there is no attack. Quite the contrary.       The people
     here are thrilled to see them.

                                INNKEEPER

                  Anyone who fights the Cardinal is
                  welcome here.

     The Musketeers lower their swords.

                  I think we've found a home.

     The Musketeers return their swords to their sheathes and
     take off their dripping hats and capes. The pretty
     Barmaids crowd around them to collect their gear and car-
     ry it to the fire.

                                INNKEEPER
                  We don't have much but what we
                  have is yours.

     Porthos rubs his hands together, eager to indulge himself.
     He follows the Barmaids, booming in his loud, friendly
     voice.

                                PORTHOS
                  Ladies, you're in for a treat
                  tonight. Allow me to introduce
                  myself. I'm the Musketeer they
                  call Porthos.
     Porthos beams, waiting for a big response but nothing
     happens. The Barmaids look at each other.

     Still no response.    Aramis and d'Artagnan hide smiles.

                  It's hard to believe they haven't
                  heard of the great Porthos.
                                PORTHOS
                  Oh, shut up, Aramis.

     The three Barmaids perk up.
                                BARMAIDS
                         (with excitement)
                  Aramis? Did you say Aramis?
     And with that, the three Barmaids desert Porthos and
     scurry across the room to attach themselves to Aramis.
     Porthos shakes his head and flops down in a chair.
                                PORTHOS
                  I don't get it. I just don't
                  get it.

                                                   CUT TO:

                                                             72.

83   INT. TAVERN - NIGHT                                           83
     Moments later.   Porthos regales the Barmaids with a tale.

                             PORTHOS
               I said, 'A Queen is no different
               than a barmaid in the dark. Though
               less... practiced in the arts of
               pleasure...'

     The Barmaids accept his leering compliment with glee.
     But d'Artagnan isn't so sure. Porthos, with two Barmaids,
     bellows a reply.

                             PORTHOS
               If you're going to be a proper
               Musketeer, you'll have to learn
               the manly art of wenching. Right,
               ladies?
     The Barmaids heartily concur. D'Artagnan looks over
     Porthos' shoulder, to the dark-haired Barmaid seen previ-
     ously. Porthos follows his gaze, grins.
                             PORTHOS
               Ahh, very good. Your first
               subject. But you'll need
               instruction. Watch closely.
     Porthos pulls one of the Barmaids to his chest, brings
     her lips toward his.
                             PORTHOS
               The secret to wenching is the
               first kiss. For in that kiss, a
               lasting impression is made. If it
               is weak, she will think you are
               weak. And if it is comical, she
               will think you are a clown. With
               me?
                               D'ARTAGNAN
               Weak... weak.    Comical... clown.

                              PORTHOS
               Very good.   And as a Musketeer is
               never weak,  and only rarely a
               clown, your  first kiss must be all
               the things  that you are. Like
               this...
     Porthos gives the Barmaid a powerful kiss.      He breaks it,
     turns to d'Artagnan with a grin.

                  You may speak first if you like,
                  your name, her name, an endearment
                  or two. But words are usually a
                  waste of time.

                                ARAMIS
                  Only if you don't know which words
                  to say.
     All turn to regard Aramis. He'll play along too.
     Porthos reacts with delight. D'Artagnan with interest.
     Aramis continues:
                                ARAMIS
                  Words may make a more lasting
                  impression than a thousand of
                  Porthos' kisses.
                                BARMAID
                         (still reeling)
                  Not likely.
                                ARAMIS
                  I'll demonstrate. Please.   Sit
                  beside me.
     Aramis' courtly behavior is as out of place in these en-
     virons as it is persuasive. The Barmaid slips from
     Porthos' lap, sits down on the bench beside him.
     Aramis does not touch her. He simply looks into her
     eyes... and begins to speak.
                                ARAMIS
                  'Shall I compare thee to a
                     summer's day?
                  Thou art more lovely and more
                     temperate:

                     thou owest,

                  So long lives this, and this gives
                     life to thee.'

     The Barmaid, once skeptical, sits silently. Her face
     covered with tears. Aramis pauses, almost embarrassed by
     the outcome. He turns to d'Artagnan, cites:

                                 ARAMIS
                  Shakespeare.
                                PORTHOS
                  That's cheating.
     The Barmaid on his lap disagrees.

                                BARMAID
                  It's beautiful.
     D'Artagnan looks at the dark-haired Barmaid across the
     room. Porthos urges him on.
                                PORTHOS
                  Come on, d'Artagnan. We haven't
                  got all night.

     D'Artagnan steps forward. The dark-haired Barmaid sees
     him coming and smiles. D'Artagnan stands before her,
     hesitates, not sure where to start. Then, remembering as
     best he can:
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  'Shall I compare thee to a summer's
                    day?
                  Thou are move lovely and more
                     tempest, er, more tempered...'
                         (beat)
                  Ahh, to hell with it --

     D'Artagnan takes the Barmaid into his arms, delivers a
     powerful kiss. As previously demonstrated. Porthos and
     Aramis smile proudly. The Barmaids cheer.

                                PORTHOS
                  The boy's a natural.

                  So little time, so much to learn.

     D'Artagnan drains his flagon, indicates Athos sitting at
     a table by himself, scowling, working on his third bottle
     of Burgundy.

                                ARAMIS
                  In all the years I've know him...
                  I have never seen Athos smile.

                  Why is he sitting by himself?
                                PORTHOS
                  Athos takes his drinking seriously.
                  Ignore him. He'll be his usual
                  warm, charming self by morning.
                         (calls out)
                  Service! My lap is cold!
     A Barmaid scurries INTO   VIEW. Porthos grabs her by the
     waist, adds the Barmaid   to the one already sitting on his
     lap. The chair breaks    beneath them, and all three go
     sprawling on the floor,   laughing heartily.

84   ATHOS                                                         84

     He remains lost in drink. D'Artagnan appears beside him.
     He hides his concern behind a cheerful attitude.
                                  D'ARTAGNAN
                  Come join us.
     Athos pulls d'Artagnan down with a dark smile.     He fills
     his flagon for him.

                                ATHOS
                  You fight like a Musketeer. Let's
                  see if you can drink like one.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  I'll drink anything you put in
                  front of me.

                         (raising his flagon)
                  What shall we drink to?

     D'Artagnan notices the dark-haired Barmaid eyeing him
     across the room.

                  Love?

     The word nearly makes Athos grimace. He stares at
     d'Artagnan for a long beat, then beyond. As if to look
     into another time and place. Finally:

                               ATHOS
                  Love.
                         (beat)
                  Would you like to hear a story,
                  d'Artagnan? A love story?
     Athos' voice reveals unexpected vulnerability, the pain
     he keeps inside. D'Artagnan is fascinated, moved. He
     nearly whispers:

                               D'ARTAGNAN
                  Yes.
     Athos takes a long pull from the bottle of burgundy,
     wipes the blood red wine from his lips.
                                ATHOS
                  I once knew a man... one of the
                  Counts of Berry. My native
                  province. When the good Count was
                  about your age, he fell in love
                  with a visitor from Paris. A
                  breathtaking girl of seventeen.
                  She was more than beautiful,
                  d'Artagnan. She was...
                  intoxicating. And this man, the
                  poor idiot, he married her.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  Isn't that what people do when
                  they fall in love?
                                ATHOS
                         (sharply)
                  Be quiet and listen.
                         (beat)
                  The Count took her to his castle
                  and made her the first lady of the
                  province. They were happy for a
                  time, as happy as a man and a
                  woman can be. Then one day, while
                  riding in the woods, the girl was
                  thrown from her horse, and knocked
                  unconscious. The Count hurried to
                  help her. Her dress was torn.

                  gold band in the shape of a

                  of clothing she refused to remove.
                  The Count's curiosity got the best
                  of him. He reached over and slid
                  down the gold band. He saw
                  something on her arm... something
                  she'd kept hidden 'til then...

     D'Artagnan reacts with shock.
                                ATHOS
                  The Count's angel turned out to be
                  a murderess who escaped the
                  Executioner's blade. She swore
                  that she loved him. Swore that
                  she had changed. And if he would
                  just keep her secret, they would
                  live a long life together.
     Athos pauses, imagines that life.      The Count and his
     angel.
                                ATHOS
                  But the Count was young and he was
                  stupid. He was tormented by the
                  ridicule of his social class. And
                  so he rejected her. For her lies
                  and for her past.
                         (beat)
                  And turned her over to the
                  authorities to be executed for the
                  crime.

     Athos now turns his unflinching gaze on d'Artagnan.
                                ATHOS
                  But you see... his heart did not
                  agree.  The Count soon realized
                  what she had meant to him. And
                  what he had done.

                                ATHOS (CONT'D)
                  That his... betrayal was far
                  greater than her own.
                         (beat)
                  Soon after he foreswore the
                  society that shaped him. Gave up
                  his title. And was never seen
                  again.
                                  D'ARTAGNAN
                  He loved her.

                                ATHOS
                  He killed her. It seemed like the
                  same thing after a while.

     HOLD ON Athos for a long time.       As he gathers up his pain,
     and puts it back again.
     Athos SMASHES open another BOTTLE. But the story has
     made d'Artagnan quite sober and a little sick to his
     stomach. He refuses another drink.
                                 ATHOS
                  Good.   More for me.
                                PORTHOS
                  Aramis -- play something with some
                  blood in it! I feel like dancing!
     Aramis launches into something appropriate. Porthos and
     a Barmaid get up and begin a festive folk dance.
     Porthos is damned good. His joie de vivre is infectious
     and soon everyone in the inn is clapping and encouraging
     him. Every once in awhile, another WEAPON -- a dagger or
     something -- drops out of Porthos' clothing and hits the
     floor with a CLATTER.

     That's when Porthos, dancing with abandon, spins out of
     control, trips and falls on Athos' table, crushing it to
     the floor.

     Porthos lies in the wreckage, staring up. Athos, totally
     unperturbed, looks down and offers him the bottle.

                                PORTHOS
                  Care to dance, Athos?
                                ATHOS
                  Only if I can lead.

     Porthos blinks in amazement at Athos' grim face, then
     breaks out laughing.
                                 PORTHOS
                  Aramis!   Athos made a joke!

     The Innkeeper comes down the stairs wearing a nightshirt
     and a sleepy expression.

                            INNKEEPER
              Excuse me, gentlemen.

                            D'ARTAGNAN
              Were we making too much noise?
                            INNKEEPER
              You told me to wake you at dawn.

                             ATHOS
              Well?

                             INNKEEPER
              It's dawn.
     They turn in disbelief to the shuttered windows. Sure
     enough. Sunlight is peeking in through the cracks.

87   EXT. RURAL LANDSCAPE - DAY                                   87
     The sun rises, casts long shadows across a sparkling dew-
     wet field. D'Artagnan and the Musketeers ride INTO
     FRAME, continuing their journey to Calais. D'Artagnan
     squints ahead, wincing with every bump. Porthos grins.
                            PORTHOS
              Beautiful morning, eh, d'Artagnan?

     D'Artagnan is terribly hung-over from the night's
     carousing. He looks like he could puke at any moment.
     So that's exactly why Porthos shouts to him and says...

                              PORTHOS
              You know,   d'Artagnan, it's not a
              good idea   to travel on an empty
              stomach.    You really should have
              had a big   portion of those sheep's
              brains...

     D'Artagnan covers his mouth.    Porthos laughs good-
     naturedly.
                            D'ARTAGNAN
              My head feels like it's filled
              with the King's marching band.
              Would you please stop whistling?

                  Whistling?   I'm not whistling.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  Well someone is.

                                PORTHOS
                         (to others)
                  The Barmaid's kiss left him dizzy.
                                ARAMIS
                  I hear it too. It sounds like...
                                ATHOS
                         (knows immediatley)
                  A connon ball.

     Athos is cut off by an EAR-PIERCING WHISTLE as a CANNON
     BALL drops out of the sky and STRIKES the ground nearby,
     sending up a tremendous EXPLOSION.
                                PORTHOS
                  I hate cannon balls.

     Another BALL EXPLODES into the ground in front of them.
     Their horses rear up in fear, threatening to dump them
     out of their saddles. As the Musketeers and d'Artagnan
     struggle to control their horses, they look back and see
     an old castle atop a distant hill.
     A group of men operate two rusted cannons, left over from
     some long-forgotten war.
     The Musketeers barely calm their horses, when another
     BALL comes SCREAMING their way, IMPACTING a few feet
     away. As dirt rains upon them:

                                ARAMIS
                         (to d'Artagnan)
                  How's your head now?

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  I'm beginning to wish the Cardinal
                  had chopped if off.

                                ATHOS
                  Stay with us, and you just might
                  get your wish.
     Athos spurs his horse across the field, d'Artagnan and
     the Musketeers follow. But they discover crude battle-
     ments in their path. Athos changes direction, sees six
     horsemen waiting for them in the near distance. He
     changes direction again, as the horsemen charge after.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

     They ride as fast their mounts will carry them. A cross-
     roads up ahead. Athos sizes up the situation, shouts
     command.
                                ATHOS
                  Split in half! D'Artagnan rides
                  with me!

     D'Artagnan nods, thrilled to go with Athos.
                                ARAMIS
                  We'll see you in Calais!
                               ATHOS
                  Or hell!

     Athos and d'Artagnan take off in one direction, Porthos
     and Aramis in the other. The pursuing horsemen soon
     race INTO VIEW, break in half to give chase.
                                                     CUT TO:

     A room heavy with mist and steam. Behind a maze of gauze
     screens, we discover Anne reclining in a large tiled bath,
     Constance attending. Constance replenishes the bath with
     pitchers of hot water drawn from a boiling cauldron.
     In mid-conversation, as confidantes and friends:
                                CONSTANCE
                  But how, your Majesty? How can
                  you tell if you're really in love?
                                ANNE

                  And when he's around, do your
                  knees feel as weak as water?

                               CONSTANCE
                  Yes.

                  And when he looks at you, do you
                  suddenly forget how to breathe?

                           all alone)
                  I am.

     Anne turns to Constance, soap and water swirl about her
     naked body. She wonders:

                                ANNE
                  Who is he?

                  the bandit.

                                ANNE
                  The young man on the scaffold?

                  You're right. I don't believe it.

     A warm beat. Anne and Constance are friends as much as
     they are Queen and subject.

     Wistful, she replies:

                  Of course. As Your Eminence has

                  What do you mean?

                                RICHELIEU
                  The Huguenot rebellion, occupation
                  in the Antilles and Cayenne. The
                  coming war with France. These are
                  not the usual hobbies of youth.
                               ANNE
                  No.

                                RICHELIEU
                  And now he wishes to postpone his
                  birthday celebration.
                               ANNE
                  Why?

                                RICHELIEU
                  He feels it is not... appropriate.
                                ANNE
                  It sounds as though he is
                  concerned with more important
                  matters.

                                RICHELIEU
                  Which is exactly why we must
                  celebrate.
                         (off her look)
                  To show the world that the King of
                  France is strong enough to face
                  any enemy on any field. To show
                  France... that he is King.
                         (beat)
                  He will listen to you. If you
                  will speak.
     Richelieu makes his case with forceful eloquence, seeming
     loyalty. Anne considers, replies, noncommittal:
                                ANNE
                  I will speak to him.
     Anne senses hidden agenda, intrigues below the surface.
     The conversation's conspiratorial tone begins to disturb
     her.

                                ANNE
                  Now, if you'll excuse me, I...
                               RICHELIEU
                  Of course.
     Anne nods, turns back toward the chambers.       Richelieu
     calls after.

                                RICHELIEU
                  Your Majesty?
                         (off her look)
                  Please understand that I do not
                  underestimate the value of your
                  assistance.

                  And that I wish for you to
                  consider -- in fact, to know --
                  all that you and I might
                  accomplish. Together.
                         (quietly, as if
                          to justify)
                  For France.
     Richelieu steps away, his red cape swirling behind him.
     Anne feels a chill, pulls her robe more tightly about
     her body.

     from his encounter with the Queen. Louis looks up,
     greets him with displeasure.


92   INT. THRONE ROOM AND GREAT HALL                                 92
     Louis watches from a balcony. Richelieu appears, fresh
     from his encounter with the Queen.
                                RICHELIEU
                  I'm sorry to be late, Your
                  Majesty, but I was wrestling with
                  an important matter of state.

     Richelieu never allows the mask to slip. Even for an
     instant. Louis glances at the throne room, the increasing
     number of Cardinal's Guards on duty. They make him feel
     uncomfortable. Louis speaks with renewed determination.

                                LOUIS
                  Why is it I don't see any of my
                  Musketeers?

                                RICHELIEU
                  I'm afraid... that's impossible.

                  They have become outlaws. They
                  are terrorizing the countryside,
                  robbing and killing innocent
                  people.

     Louis can't believe it.

                                LOUIS
                  There must be some mistake.

                                RICHELIEU
                  No mistake. I have reports from
                  the local constables involved.

     Richelieu, ever prepared, produces a sheaf of papers. No
     doubt counterfeit. But Louis has no way of knowing. He
     takes the papers into his hands, reacts with sadness.
                                  LOUIS
                  Musketeers...
                                RICHELIEU
                  They are better off disbanded.
     Louis turns back to the balcony, the soldiers marching
     below. His mood glum and lonely. He sighs, moves on to
     another matter of business.

                                LOUIS
                  Your Eminence, I've been hearing
                  some very troubling rumors about
                  you.

     Richelieu nods, not the least bit concerned.
                                RICHELIEU
                  There are so many to choose from.
                  Is it the one about my alleged
                  alliance with Buckingham? Let's
                  see if I remember it correctly.
                  While the English attack from
                  without, I'll undermine the throne
                  from within -- depose you -- and
                  become sovereign of France myself.
                  That rumor, Your Majesty?

     Richelieu smiles, his face a mask of innocence.
                                LOUIS
                  It does seem rather farfetched.

                  birthday celebration.

                                LOUIS
                  I've been thinking about that. A
                  birthday celebration when we're
                  on the brink of war...

                          this as well)
                  Your subjects are eager to
                  celebrate the birth of their King
                  at a time like this.
                                LOUIS
                  I'm not so eager.
                                RICHELIEU
                  I have an idea. Why don't you
                  discuss the matter with your
                  Queen?
     Louis looks up, wonders. As Richelieu draws him deeper
     into his spider's strategems.

93   EXT. FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY                                  93

     Porthos and Aramis ride hard, look back over their
     shoulders. They crest the top of a bluff, rein their
     horses to a stop. They can afford to rest for a moment.
     Their pursuit is at least a mile behind them.
                                ARAMIS
                  My horse will not survive another
                  league.
                               PORTHOS

                  Ten, twenty at the most.

     Porthos looks into the near distance, manages a weary
     smile.

                  Here's just the thing.     A nice,
                  relaxing boat ride.
     At the bottom of the hill: a crude ferry lands at the
     bank of a swift, choppy river.

                                                       CUT TO:

94   EXT. RIVER AND FERRY LANDING - DAY                                94

     The ferry is an open flatboat -- a wooden platform, about
     fifteen-by-twenty feet. It travels from one shore to the
     other by means of a ferry rope. Transport is slow, the
     trip to the other shore takes nearly five minutes.

     As Porthos and Aramis arrive, the flatboat is just re-
     turning, piloted by its FERRYMAN, a hunched and weather-
     beaten gnome. Four passengers wait to be carried across
     -- TWO GENTLEMAN CAVALIERS on horseback, and a country
     WOMAN and her child. As the flatboat enters its slip,
     the two Cavaliers urge their horses on board, rudely
     jostling the Woman and her child to the rear.
     The Ferryman, an experienced boot-licker, bows and
     scrapes to the Cavaliers, collects the coins they toss
     to his way.

                                FERRYMAN
                  A privilege to carry you on my
                  humble boat...
     The Ferryman turns a greedy eye on the Woman and child.
                                  FERRYMAN
                  Two pistoles.

                                WOMAN
                  But I only have one. Couldn't
                  my child ride free? She's so
                  small...
                                FERRYMAN
                         (hand outstretched,
                          demanding)
                  Two pistoles.
     A courtly voice intervenes.

                                ARAMIS
                  Put away your money, madame. You
                  and your child will cross the
                  river under our protection. For
                  free.

     All turn to regard Aramis on horseback, Porthos at his
     side. The Woman reacts with grateful surprise. The
     Ferryman is outraged, spittle flies as he curses and
     protests.
                                FERRYMAN
                  Nobody rides for free! Under
                  your protection bloody well
                  indeed! I'll teach you a thing
                  or two about protection! Apple-
                  cheeked young fools!! -- Just who
                  do you think you are!!
                                ARAMIS
                         (waits for the
                          tirade to cease;
                          simply)
                  Musketeers.
     Two two Cavaliers react to the word. The Ferryman does,
     too -- into cringing, obedient servant.
                                FERRYMAN
                  Musketeers? Well, why didn't you
                  say so? Of course you'll ride for
                  free. I insist on it. This way,
                  pretty madame. My what a lovely
                  little girl...

                               ARAMIS
                  Porthos!
                               PORTHOS
                  What?
     Aramis takes Porthos by the shoulder and turns him so
     he can see their pursuers pouring over the top of the
     hill on their horses.
                               PORTHOS
                  We sail!

     And with that, Porthos takes the sharp edge of his boom-
     erang and brings it down on the dock rope. The rope
     splits and the ferryboat lurches away from the dock.


95   HILL AND SHORE                                             95
     The pursuers charge down the hill and ride to the end of
     the dock but they're too late. Porthos and Aramis have
     gotten away.

                                                          91.
96   FLATBOAT                                                   96
     Porthos laughs and taunts the angry pursuers. Aramis
     ties scarves around the horses' eyes to blindfold them
     for the crossing. Then he turns around and sees what
     Aramis is already seeing -- the two Cavaliers watch them
     with keen interest.
                             FIRST CAVALIER
               You're those Musketeers everyone's
               been looking for.

                              PORTHOS
                Popularity has its price.

     The First Cavalier smiles, produces a flask.
                              FIRST CAVALIER
                I have some excellent brandy here.
                Would you gentlemen care to drink
                a toast with us to the Cardinal?
                              PORTHOS
                We'd be happy to.
     Porthos produces a bottle from under his cloak.
                              PORTHOS
                If you'll drink one with us to
                the King.
                              SECOND CAVALIER
                But the only King we recognize...
                is the Cardinal.
                              ARAMIS
                There are those who would call
                that treason.
                              FIRST CAVALIER
                Happily, no such objections have
                been raised... here.
                               PORTHOS
                All right.   I'll object.

                              SECOND CAVALIER
                I'm listening.

                              PORTHOS
                Let's see. You are, by your dress
                and by your manner, members of a
                bone-lazy class of servile ninnyhammers
                whose slavish allegiance to His
                Eminence the Cardinal is as that
                of a dog who likes nothing better
                than to sniff today where he has
                peed the day before.

                  I was momentarily inspired.

     The Cavaliers are not amused. The first replies in
     measured tones, his lips white with fury.

                                 FIRST CAVALIER
                  May I reply?
                                ARAMIS
                         (courtly)
                  By all means.
                                FIRST CAVALIER
                  Better to be a dog in the service
                  of a great master, than a beef-
                  witted moron so dazzled by the
                  throne that he does not see the
                  true nature of the foolish boy
                  who wobbles atop it. Which is to
                  say, that most muddy-brained of
                  all men... a Musketeer.
     The Cavaliers have already pulled out their swords.
     Porthos and Aramis now reach for their own. Porthos
     deadpans:
                                PORTHOS
                  Maybe there's something  about us
                  that just pisses people  off. At
                  least I'd like to think  so. It's
                  too bad we can only kill  them
                  once.

97   FIGHT                                                       97

     The middle of a river on a rocking flatboat is not the
     best place for a duel. But the combatants make the most
     of it. Slipping, sliding, and falling. They attack with
     everything they've got. The Cavaliers are excellent
     swordsmen. And, as if that were not enough, the
     Musketeers have an additional disadvantage -- they must
     keep the Woman and child clear of the flashing blades.
                                                  (CONTINUED)

97   CONTINUED:                                                     97
     Porthos drives his opponent about the flatboat with a
     devilish grin, chases him between -- and at one point,
     over -- blindfolded horses.
     Aramis duels with the expected artistry, gradually re-
     ducing his opponent to tatters. At one juncture, the
     child loses her footing, slides toward the low end of
     the flatboat, the deep river beyond. Aramis executes a
     neat sidestep, stops the child's desperate progress with
     one arm while continuing to do battle with the other.
     He returns child to Mother with a grin, continues.

     The two Cavaliers are soon vanquished, groaning on the
     flatboat deck. Porthos and Aramis meet at the middle,
     breathless. Porthos complains:

                                PORTHOS
                  I've been called a lot of things
                  in my time...
                                ARAMIS
                         (eyes on the
                          opposite shore)
                  Porthos...
                                PORTHOS
                  But beef-witted is a little more
                  than I can stand, not to mention
                  unfair...
                                  ARAMIS
                  Porthos...
                                  PORTHOS
                  What?
     Aramis indicates the opposite shore as the flatboat
     approaches it. There, waiting patiently, swords and
     muskets already drawn... is a patrol of Cardinal's
     Guards.

                                  ARAMIS
                  Can you swim?
                                 PORTHOS
                          (doesn't like the
                           sound of this)
                  No.   My horse can.
                                  ARAMIS
                  That'll do.

                                  PORTHOS
                  But...?

     Aramis hurries to    his horse, takes off the blindfold.
     Porthos grumbles    after, follows suit. They leap atop
     their mounts, the    horses slip upon the wet deck as they
     guide them to the    edge.
                                ARAMIS
                  You go first and I'll watch your
                  progress.
                                 PORTHOS
                  No, no.   Please. After you.

     Stalemate. Then, they can't help it, Aramis and Porthos
     grin. Life is an adventure, lived to the fullest. They
     count...

                                ARAMIS AND PORTHOS
                  One, two -- three!
     And with that, as the Woman and child, the Ferryman look
     on, Aramis and Porthos guide their horses into the raging
     river. The Woman whispers after:
                                 WOMAN
                  Thank you.   God speed.
     Porthos manages a wink as he floats into the distance.


98   ON SHORE                                                       98
     The Cardinal's Guards react with anger and disbelief.


99   RIVER                                                          99
     A wild ride down the ROARING RIVER. Porthos clinging to
     his horse for dear life. Aramis keeping an eye on his
     fellow Musketeer... and the deep rapids up ahead.
     Through twists and turns, walls of white water, huge
     boulders, and gyrating whirlpools... Aramis and Porthos
     finally reach a quiet pool, a leafy shore beyond. They
     lead their horses from the water, step toward dry land...
     and see yet another (or perhaps the same) patrol of
     Cardinal's Guards. Waiting, swords drawn, for their
     arrival.
     Porthos looks down at his latest sash -- destroyed like
     the others. Aramis draws his saber, mutters.

                                ARAMIS
                  A nice relaxing boat ride...

99    CONTINUED:                                                      99
      And with that, Aramis and Porthos charge towards the
      Guards.

                                                      CUT TO:
100   EXT. DENSE FOREST - DAY                                         100

      Cool, clear water. WIDEN to reveal d'Artagnan and Athos
      at a shallow pond, watering their horses. The forest
      around them is dark and primeval.

                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   Do you think we've lost them?
                                 ATHOS
                   They'll catch up eventually.

      To the point, as always. D'Artagnan pauses to look at
      their beautiful surroundings, remembers:
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   My father used to hunt in a forest
                   like this. He promised to take me
                   on my tenth birthday. I don't know
                   why he picked that year. Something
                   about a boy becoming a man. I'd
                   lay in bed at night and imagine it,
                   just the two of us. But he died
                   before I could go with him.
      Athos is unmoved, or so it would seem.       He replies with
      quiet cynicism:
                                 ATHOS
                   Well. You have your boyhood wish
                   at last. The dark forest. The
                   thrill of the hunt. The nearness
                   of death.
      Only d'Artagnan is the hunted, not the hunter.

                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   I'd be proud to die for my King.
                                 ATHOS
                   I just wanted to save you from the
                   life of a Musketeer. You don't
                   have to go looking for experience,
                   d'Artagnan. It'll find you soon
                   enough. And when it does -- it
                   will mark you forever.

      Athos rides into the forest.    D'Artagnan hurries to
      follow.

                                                      CUT TO:

                                                          96.

101   EXT. FOREST - DAY                                         101
      Athos leads d'Artagnan through the forest. Sunbeams
      shoot down through thick branches like golden bars. A
      pastoral setting, almost peaceful. And then: THUNDERING
      HOOFBEATS. Athos and d'Artagnan turn in surprise, see
      SIX HORSEMEN CRASHING through the glade.


102   ANOTHER ANGLE                                             102
      Athos and d'Artagnan GALLOP through the dense forest.
      The horesmen FIRE PISTOLS as they ride. A SHOT grazes
      d'Artagnan's shoulder, he staggers, retains his mount.
      Athos leads them up a hillside, a series of boulders at
      the top. The climb is fast and treacherous, GUNFIRE all
      around them. Athos' horse is struck by a bullet, stag-
      gers forward... and collapses just as they reach the
      crest. D'Artagnan leaps off his horse, takes cover with
      Athos behind the boulders. Athos takes aim, FIRES a
      SHOT, and kills one of the horsemen below. The others
      curse, leap from their mounts, seek cover. SHOTS WHIZ
      back and forth like angry hornets.
      Stalemate, but not for long. They are badly outnumbered.
      The horsemen creep slowly up the hillside, from tree to
      tree. Athos turns to d'Artagnan as he reloads:
                              ATHOS
                I'll hold them off for as long as
                I can. Go on without me.
                              D'ARTAGNAN
                I can't leave you here. Not like
                this.

                              ATHOS
                Ride to Calais and stop the
                Cardinal's agent.

                              D'ARTAGNAN
                Athos... I can't.

      Athos points his pistol at d'Artagnan.
                              ATHOS
                Go, or I'll kill you myself.

      A few days ago, d'Artagnan would have obeyed without
      question. Fearful, if nothing else. But not here, not
      now.

                               D'ARTAGNAN
                A duel then.
                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                               97.

102   CONTINUED:                                                     102
                                 ATHOS
                   You're insane.

                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   We never finished the first.

                                 ATHOS
                   All right. I'll toss a coin.
                   Tails I stay, heads you remain.
                   Agreed?

      D'Artagnan nods. Athos FIRES off another SHOT. He
      produces a gold coin, flips, slams it between palm and
      hand. And looks between.


103   ATHOS AND HIS POV                                              103
      Heads. D'Artagnan is to remain.       Athos looks up without
      missing a beat.
                                   ATHOS
                   Tails.    I stay.

      Athos returns the coin to his doublet without giving
      d'Artagnan a chance to see.
                                  D'ARTAGNAN
                   But...?
      Athos reloads, FIRES below. D'Artagnan recognizes the
      kindness he has received. That Athos cannot fully express
      it. And that there is no use arguing with him.

                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   At least take my pistol.

      He gives it to Athos.      They clasp hands.
                                 ATHOS
                          (gruff; yet proud)
                   Don't let us down... Musketeer.
      There are tears in d'Artagnan's eyes.       He knows Athos
      hasn't got a chance.

                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                          (a choke of emotion)
                   I'll never forget you.

                                  ATHOS
                   Go!
      Athos turns away, SHOOTS at another horseman.       D'Artagnan
      runs to his MOUNT, GALLOPS away.

      He rides, straining to hear the sounds of GUNFIRE. As
      long as the SHOTS continue, he knows Athos is alive.
      Abruptly... the SHOTS CEASE.
      D'Artagnan swallows his heart, and rides.

                                                     CUT TO:

105   EXT. ROAD TO CALAIS - NIGHT                                    105

      A lonely stretch of road, illuminated by moonlight. A
      signpost announces: CALAI 15 LEAGUES. An exhausted
      HORSE CLOPS INTO VIEW, its rider half-conscious in the
      saddle. It is d'Artagnan. He can barely keep his eyes
      open. Suddenly, d'Artagnan passes out, tumbles from
      his saddle, and lands in the middle of the road. He
      opens his eyes once -- a sky filled with stars -- then
      closes them.
      We hear HORSES, and the CREAK of a CARRIAGE APPROACHING.
      The DRIVER brakes, and the horses are brought to a halt
      just short of trampling d'Artagnan. In the darkness, we
      can make out other shapes, rugged men on horseback,
      bodyguards to the carriage's passenger. Milady de
      Winter.
                                 MILADY (O.S.)
                   What is it, Henri?
                                 HENRI (DRIVER)
                   There's a body in the road, Milady.
                                 MILADY (O.S.)
                   Be careful.
      Pistols are cocked.    Henri's shadow falls across
      d'Artagnan's body.
                                 HENRI
                   It's a young man. He appears to
                   be injured.
      We hear the CARRIAGE DOOR OPEN.     FOOTSTEPS to d'Artagnan's
      side.

                                 MILADY (O.S.)
                   My, what a handsome boy. Put him
                   inside with me.

      Strong hands grasp d'Artagnan and lift him from the cold
      ground.
                                                     CUT TO:

                                                            99.

106   D'ARTAGNAN'S POV - BLACK SCREEN                             106
      Out of the darkness, a face appears,   BLURRY and OBSCURED.
      It FILLS the SCREEN, slowly swimming   INTO FOCUS. It is
      Milady de Winter, even more beautiful   in CLOSEUP.
      Familiar, and no doubt deadly, ivory   combs gleam in her
      hair. She smiles warmly.

                                MILADY
                Welcome back.    Did you dream?

107   ANOTHER ANGLE                                               107

      reveals the interior of a bed chamber at a roadside inn.
      D'Artagnan, regaining his senses, finds himself propped
      up in a large bed. He blinks into the face of Milady
      who sits at the edge. His eyes widen with recognition,
      faint awe.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                You.
                                MILADY
                Have we met?

                              D'ARTAGNAN
                I... saw you in Paris.
      D'Artagnan notices that his shoulder has been bandaged.
      He looks around the large room. A FIRE ROARS in the
      grate. Food and drink have been set upon a table.
      D'Artagnan continues, still groggy, uncertain:
                              D'ARTAGNAN
                Where am I...?
                              MILADY
                This is Calais.

                              D'ARTAGNAN
                       (with a jolt)
                Calais!
                       (muttered; to self)
                The ship... Tuesday at midnight...
      D'Artagnan leaps out of bed. Then realizes he is stark
      naked. Milady smiles. D'Artagnan gathers a bedsheet
      around him.
                              D'ARTAGNAN
                       (frantic)
                Where are my clothes?

                   Filthy. I'm having them cleaned.
                   Is something wrong?
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   What day is it? What time?!

      D'Artagnan runs to a window, and throws open the shutters.
      Beyond: the harbor lights of the Port of Calais.
                                 MILADY
                   It's Tuesday, near nine.
                                  D'ARTAGNAN
                   Nine?   Are you sure?

      Somewhere in the night, a BELL TOLLS the HOUR.        Milady
      smiles.
                                 MILADY
                   Quite sure.
      D'Artagnan relaxes slightly.        Milady rises from the bed.
      She wears a sky blue dressing       gown, something soft and
      silken beneath it. D'Artagnan        reacts perceptibly. En-
      joying his discomfort, Milady       crosses the room, joins
      him at the window.
                                 MILADY
                   Are you in a hurry?
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                          (after a beat)
                   How did I... get here?
                                 MILADY
                   I found you in the road.
                   Discarded. Like an unwanted
                   kitten. Do you have a name or
                   shall I make one up for you?

                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                          (nervous)
                   My name is d'Artagnan.

                                 MILADY
                   D'Artagnan. I like that. I am
                   the Countess de Winter. Milady.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   Countess?

                                 MILADY
                   My husband's dead.

                   I'm sorry.

                                 MILADY
                   I have learned to live with death.

      She manages to combine sympathy, seduction, and just a
      hint of danger. All in a single reply. D'Artagnan
      hesitates, he is not immune to her charms, then:
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   Countess, I'm very grateful for
                   what you've done, but I can't stay
                   here. I've got...

                                 MILADY
                   What...?
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   Important business.
                                 MILADY
                   How mysterious. A handsome young
                   man with 'important business' in
                   the still of night. Does it
                   involve a young lady?
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   No.
                                 MILADY
                   Does it require clothes?
                                  D'ARTAGNAN
                   Yes.   I need my clothes.
                                 MILADY
                   They won't be ready for at least
                   an hour.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   An hour?
                                  MILADY
                   I told the  innkeeper to bring them
                   when they  are dry. Until then,
                   I'm afraid  you are my prisoner.
                   Would the  prisoner care for a
                   drink?

      Milady crosses to the table, food and drink upon it. As
      she passes by the fire, her dressing gown seems to disap-
      pear, revealing a silhouette that makes d'Artagnan's
      heart stop.

                   I am... thirsty.
      Milady pours wine into glasses, turns to face him.      And
      offers a smile that dazzles and burns.

                                 MILADY
                   Good. Then we will sit by the
                   fire, and eat and drink, and you
                   may impress, perhaps even move me,
                   with the story of how you came to
                   lie unconscious, in the middle of
                   the night, on the road to Calais.
                          (soft seductively)
                   I love a good adventure.
      D'Artagnan hesitates, then steps to her.

108   EXT. ROOF OF PALAIS CARDINAL (PARIS) - NIGHT                  108
      A CARRIER PIGEON FLUTTERS out of the dark sky, and enters
      its box. The little door on the other side opens. A
      hand reaches in and removes the bird. Richelieu unpeels
      the message on its leg.

109   INT. CARDINAL'S PRIVATE CHAMBER - NIGHT                       109
      A room as cold as the man who owns it. Behind
      Richelieu's desk, there is a life-sized portrait of the
      King. Rochefort occupies a window seat, cleaning
      d'Artagnan's sword. He lifts it to the light, and
      slashes the air. He stands, duels with an imaginary
      opponent. Richelieu enters with the message.

                                 RICHELIEU
                          (dry; re: Rochefort's
                           fencing)
                   The wonderful thing about an
                   imaginary opponent is that he is
                   always greatly skilled, and always
                   easily defeated. The pride of
                   victory, without the risk of loss.
                   If only life were like that.

      Richelieu sits at his desk, peers at the message.      He
      looks up, pleased.

                   I told you not to worry about the
                   Musketeers. They are dead by now.

                                 RICHELIEU
                   Buckingham's signature will be on
                   the treaty by morning.

                                 ROCHEFORT
                   The King's birthday celebration...?
                                 RICHELIEU
                   Will proceed as planned. Thanks
                   to the kind intercession of Queen
                   Anne.
      Rochefort steps closer, speaks quietly.
                                 ROCHEFORT
                   And our plans...?

                   Will proceed as well.
      Richelieu pours two glasses of port, offers one to
      Rochefort. They turn, raise their glasses to the
      King's portrait. And drink.

110   INT. MILADY'S CHAMBER AT INN - NIGHT                      110

      D'Artagnan and Milady face each other on a rug in front
      of the roaring fire. The plate of food between them is
      empty. They drink wine from goblets. D'Artagnan drains
      his cup, and stares into the burning embers. Milady
      speaks quietly, with seeming compassion:
                                  MILADY
                   You are sad.

                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   I was thinking about my friends.
      Milady knows when to speak, and when to listen. She
      looks at d'Artagnan with gentle expression, allows him to
      continue. The warm room, the wine, her kindness. All
      conspire to loosen his tongue. D'Artagnan speaks
      quietly, from the heart:

                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   The three best friends a man could
                   have. We were separated on our
                   way to Calais. I'm afraid I'll
                   never see them again.

                                 MILADY
                   What brings you here?
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   I'd like to tell you. But I can't.

                                 MILADY
                   'Important business.'

      D'Artagnan nods. He wants to impress her. He wants her
      to know how brave he is. And Milady is well aware of it.
      She looks down, assumes a more vulnerable pose.
                                 MILADY
                   I understand. Men make bold plans
                   in secret. And women wait... to
                   mourn, or to celebrate the outcome.
                   I know from experience, it's a
                   lonely vigil.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                          (after a beat)
                   All I can tell you is... I'm on a
                   mission for the King.
                                 MILADY
                          (looks up; laughs
                           lightly)
                   I've heard that one before.
                                  D'ARTAGNAN
                   I'm serious.
                                 MILADY
                   You are a young man. And young
                   men are given to exaggeration.
                   However, if you would like to
                   entertain me with a story, I'm
                   eager to hear it. And please,
                   make it very brave, filled with
                   handsome knights and beautiful
                   ladies. I know, a dragon --
      There is nothing a man is more loathe to experience than
      a woman who does not take him seriously. D'Artagnan acts
      accordingly, and reveals:

                   I came to Calais to stop a spy
                   from sailing to England.
                                 MILADY
                          (alert; though
                           d'Artagnan doesn't
                           see it)
                   A spy...?
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                   Yes.
                                 MILADY
                   I believe you...
                          (beat)
                   Aren't you afraid?
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   Musketeers are not afraid of
                   anything.
                                 MILADY
                   I knew it. I knew you were a
                   Musketeer the moment I saw you.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                   You did?

                                 MILADY
                   Of course.
                          (with sudden concern)
                   But, d'Artagnan, if this spy was
                   to find out you are here, your
                   life could be in grave danger.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   A Musketeer is not afriad of
                   danger.
                                 MILADY
                   I'm dangerous. You're not afraid
                   of me?
      Her tone heralds a sudden shift. D'Artagnan sees the
      look in her eyes, can almost feel her lips upon him.
      But he resists. There is Constance's memory to consider.
      And midnight as it approaches.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   You're not dangerous.

                                 MILADY
                   Then what am I?

                   You're... beautiful.

      Milady covers him with caresses. D'Artagnan resists
      slightly, but she presses closer, she will not be denied.

      Milady leans close, runs a fingertip along     the line of
      his jaw. Her dressing gown falls open at      the top, enough
      for d'Artagnan to see her breasts as they     press against
      the silk beneath it. Milady speaks as her      finger traces.

                                 MILADY
                   Beauty, danger. They are the same.
      And with that, she reaches up to her hair, an ivory
      comb...


111   ON D'ARTAGNAN                                                  111
      He cannot continue.      Constance, the hour, a confusion he
      cannot deny.
                                  D'ARTAGNAN
                   I'm sorry --
      D'Artagnan pulls back -- just as Milady's arm arcs down
      toward his neck, holding a long sharp stick pin, almost a
      dagger, attached to an ivory comb. D'Artagnan sees it in
      the nick of time, parries with his free hand, knocking
      the dagger to the rug. Milady leaps after it, hands out-
      stretched. D'Artagnan follows, battles for the dagger,
      stunned with fear and surprise:

                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   What're you doing?! Have you lost
                   your mind?!

                                 MILADY
                   You came to Calais to stop a spy
                   from sailing to England.

      D'Artagnan nearly chokes on the knowledge. Milady is the
      messenger he is seeking. He grabs the dagger, rolls to
      the side. Milady staggers after, the shoulder of her
      negligee rips open. D'Artagnan sees the soft white flesh,
      reacts with shock, recognition -- she bears the brand of
      the fleur de lis. The infamous mark of the murderess.
      Just as Athos told it to him.      Not so long ago.

                                  D'ARTAGNAN
                   My God...

                                 MILADY
                          (crying out)
                   Parker!!
      The chamber door flies open. Henri and Parker, the Indo-
      Chinese bodyguard, appear. Parker faces d'Artagnan with
      a half-smile. He holds out his hands, both empty. And
      steps toward him. D'Artagnan looks at the dagger in his
      right hand. Then, unwilling to fight the man with an un-
      fair advantage, he tosses the dagger to the side, steps
      forward to meet him.

      Parker disposes of d'Artagnan with lightning speed. A
      series of unexpected kicks, brutally efficient blows.
      The young man is unfamiliar with, and no match for, the
      martial arts. Parker hoists d'Artagnan to his feet,
      dazed. Henri picks up the dagger with bad intentions.
      Milady straightens her dressing gown, adjusts her hair,
      and commands:
                                MILADY
                   Kill him.
      Parker holds him fast. Henri steps forward.        And
      d'Artagnan thinks fast.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   You can kill me. But a surprise
                   waits for you in England. That
                   even Buckingham can't prevent.
                                 MILADY
                          (stops Henri with
                           a gesture)
                   What... surprise?
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   That's one thing I'll never tell
                   you.
                                 MILADY
                   D'Artagnan. You are young, vain,
                   and foolish. But I do not know
                   if you are clever.

      D'Artagnan's expression reveals nothing. Except to
      suggest the existence of a secret he is bravely keeping.
      Duly deceived, though she doesn't know it, Milady changes
      her mind.

                                 MILADY
                   We'll take him with us.

                   Parker will devise ways to
                   convince you to share your final
                   secret with me. It is a long
                   voyage.
      Milady's eyes show nothing but cold cruelty.

112   INT. INN - UPPER HALL AND LANDING - NEAR DAWN                112

      Milady emerges from her room, dressed for travel. She is
      followed by d'Artagnan, now clothed. He is flanked by
      Henri and Parker. Henri presses the blade of a knife
      against d'Artagnan's side.
                                 HENRI
                   The bodyguards are waiting outside.

      Milady leads them down the hall. But when she reaches
      the landing, and looks at the tavern below... she draws
      back with surprise.


113   ANGLE TO INCLUDE MILADY AND HER POV                          113
      The innkeeper, roused   from sleep, and wearing a night-
      shirt, is engaged in   urgent conversation with Armand de
      Winter -- the son of   the man Milady killed in Paris. The
      innkeeper shakes his   head. Armand grabs him by the
      collar.

      D'Artagnan sees Milady's reaction -- surprise, impatience,
      and just a hint of fear. Milady commands:
                                 MILADY
                   The back stairs. Hurry!
      They change directions. As he is pulled away, d'Artagnan
      catches a glimpse of Armand de Winter below.

                                                      CUT TO:
114   EXT. INN - NIGHT                                             114

      Milady's coach emerges from the carriage house, speeds
      away in the direction of the harbor. In the driver's
      seat, Henri whips the horses, driving them onward.
      Milady's seven bodyguards follow on horseback.

                                                      CUT TO:

115   INT. CARRIAGE - NIGHT                                     115
      D'Artagnan and Parker  sit across from Milady. Her face
      betrays faint doubt,  apprehension. Emotions she is not
      used to feeling, let  alone displaying to the world around
      her. D'Artagnan sees   his opening... and speaks:
                              D'ARTAGNAN
                The man at the inn... what did
                he want?
                              MILADY
                       (hollow laugh)
                Justice. Honor. Revenge.
                              D'ARTAGNAN
                Why?

                              MILADY
                He is the brother of my late
                husband, Lord de Winter. He
                blames me for de Winter's death.
                He thinks I murdered him.
                              D'ARTAGNAN
                Did you murder your husband,
                Milady?
                              MILADY
                What do you think?

      A beat. D'Artagnan studies her pale, beautiful face.
      Remembers Athos' tale of love and loss.
                              D'ARTAGNAN
                I think he's not the first husband
                you killed.
                       (off her look)
                I once knew a man, one of the
                Counts of Berry. He told me a
                story... of beauty and danger.
                He was the bravest man I've ever
                known. And the saddest.

                              MILADY
                I know...

      The truth strikes home. Milady cannot conceal it. But
      she does not react with anger or scorn. D'Artagnan has
      reminded her of the one thing in the world that still
      touches her heart. D'Artagnan looks at her with a steady
      gaze. Milady cannot hold it, she turns to the carriage
      window.

116   EXT. CALAIS - NIGHT                                        116
      Milady's carriage turns down a steep lane that leads to
      the harbor. The fog is so thick that only the masts of
      the schooners can be seen, poking out of the gloom.
      Their lanterns glow gloomily. The carriage comes to a
      stop.

                                                   CUT TO:

117   EXT. HARBOR OF CALAIS - NIGHT                              117

      The lights of the harbor are muted by low-hanging fog.
      We see the outline of a ship waiting at the pier. Henri
      helps Milady out of the carriage. D'Artagnan follows.
      Milady's bodyguards dismount, six of them. A motley
      bunch of sinister killers. They look around the pier,
      ready for any encounter.
      D'Artagnan takes in his surroundings.    There is a mel-
      ancholy air about him.
                              MILADY
                What's the matter, d'Artagnan?
                Still hoping for your friends to
                ride to the rescue?
                              D'ARTAGNAN
                My friends are dead.

                              MILADY
                Well. If it's any consolation,
                you'll soon be joining them.
      Milady's return to form does not surprise. Parker shoves
      d'Artagnan toward the fog-enshrouded ship. A name can be
      made out on her barnacled hull. Persephone.

                                                   CUT TO:

118   EXT. PIER - NIGHT                                          118

      Henri calls out to the ship, which is little more than an
      outline in the fog, her boarding gangplank leading to
      the soupy darkness of her deck.

                              HENRI
                We are the Countess de Winter's
                party, arrived from Paris.
                Permission to come aboard.

      There is no reply.    Closely guarded by Parker, d'Artagnan
      strains to see.

      Milady nods to Henri. He steps up the narrow gangplank,
      followed by Milady, d'Artagnan, Parker, and the six
      bodyguards.

                                                     CUT TO:

119   EXT. DECK OF THE PERSEPHONE - NIGHT                              119

      The deck is filled with swirling fog. Henri peers into
      the gloom as he climbs aboard, followed by the others.
      He addresses one of the crew, a tall figure standing
      nearby.

                                 HENRI
                   Take us to your captain.
      The tall figure does not reply, nor does he move.        Henri
      demands:
                                 HENRI
                   What are you, deaf?
      Henri goes to shake the man. He grabs his arm, and the
      man pitches forward, falling face first on the deck.
      Henri jumps back in alarm. Milady and the others react.
                                   BODYGUARD
                   What is this?
      Milady's Bodyguards rush around the deck, confront the
      other silent silhouettes. They, like the tall figure...
      are dead. The limp bodies topple at their touch. The
      Bodyguards shout alarm and panic:

                                  BODYGUARDS
                   Dead!   They're all dead!

                                 PORTHOS (O.S.)
                   Well I certainly hope so. After
                   all that hard work.

      That's when Porthos, and Aramis -- come swooping down
      from above like avenging angels. They swing on the ends
      of ropes, slicing through the air, then dropping feet
      first on top of Milady's Bodyguards. D'Artagnan stands
      open-mouthed, as his three friends draw their swords.

                                 ARAMIS
                          (calling to him)
                   You look like you've seen a ghost.

                                  D'ARTAGNAN
                   Two of them.

                                 PORTHOS
                   Remind me to tell you the story
                   of horses that could fly above
                   raging waters. A heroic tale of
                   love, death, and Musketeers.
                   Suitable for the general public.
      Porthos wades into the Bodyguards, at play, shouting as
      he goes.
                                 PORTHOS
                   All right then. All those who
                   wish to die, raise your hands!
                   Don't by shy, there's plenty to
                   go around!
      D'Artagnan grabs a sword from the deck, turns to join
      the fray. And finds himself face to face with Parker, the
      Indo-Chinese bodyguard. Parker has two Oriental swords
      spinning in his hands. One knocks d'Artagnan's sword out
      of his hand. D'Artagnan does a back flip but falls on
      the slippery deck. As Parker is about to chop
      d'Artagnan's head off, his face grimaces as he is lifted
      on a sword OUT OF FRAME. In the mist Athos is revealed!
                                 ATHOS
                   Sorry I'm late. Did I miss
                   anything?
      D'Artagnan almost cries with happiness.       He leaps to his
      feet and embraces Athos.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   I thought you were dead.

                                 ATHOS
                   Keep your mind on the mission,
                   d'Artagnan.

      He winks at d'Artagnan, returns to the fray. D'Artagnan
      follows. The Musketeers confront Milady's evil Bodyguards
      in the night and fog. Athos with brutal perfection.
      Porthos with strange weapons and a healthy sense of the
      absurd. And Aramis with familiar grace and artistry --
      and a marked determination to disable, not kill, his
      opponents.

      Milady views the latter with alarm. As the battle rages
      around her, she retreats into the shadows.

      Athos and d'Artagnan find themselves fighting side by
      side. Athos observes d'Artagnan's technique -- the usual
      frenetic windmill of feint and thrust -- with a frown.
                                 ATHOS
                   Boy, it's a miracle you're still
                   alive fighting like that.

                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   What do you mean?

                                 ATHOS
                   First, always find your enemy's
                   weakness. Second, take advantage
                   of it. Watch me.

      One of the Bodyguards, who wears a wooden leg, attacks
      Athos. Athos kicks the false leg out from under him,
      knocks him to the deck. D'Artagnan repeats, even as he
      disables his own foe.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   Find the weakness. Take advantage.
                   Got it.
      Aramis kneels at a dying man, delivers muttered last
      rites. A Bodyguard races INTO VIEW, means to kill him
      where he kneels. Aramis doesn't miss a beat -- he shifts,
      rises, delivers a punch and kick, knocking the man off the
      ship to the water below. A SPLASH is heard. And Aramis
      resumes a priestly pose, continues the litany.
                                                      CUT TO:


120   EXT. PIER - NIGHT                                             120

      Two SAILORS, crew members of the Persephone, return to
      the ship after a night's drunk. They see and hear the
      mayhem ahead.

                                 SAILOR
                   That's our ship...
      The two Sailors pull out daggers, and bound up the
      gangplank.

      The two Sailors find themselves in the middle of a wild
      battle. They look around for someone to assault, see a
      large Musketeer with his back turned. They charge.

      Porthos hears them coming, spins. The two Sailors stop
      in their tracks, eyes popping with horrified recognition.

                                 BOTH SAILORS
                   Porthos the Pirate!!

      With a collective "yah!" the two Sailors drop their
      daggers, and flee into the foggy night. Porthos looks
      about to see if anyone noticed their exit. D'Artagnan
      grins nearby.

                                 PORTHOS
                   I told you I was famous.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   Porthos the Pirate?

                   Privateer.   There's a difference.
      Every Musketeer is running from something or someone.
      D'Artagnan deadpans:
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   I love a good sea story.     Do tell
                   me sometime.
      Porthos reacts to d'Artagnan's jest. But before he can
      reply, the youth has bolted back to the fray.

      Athos drives several Bodyguards back with his sword,
      notices d'Artagnan working his way towards him.

                                 ATHOS
                   Did you find the Cardinal's spy?

                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   Yes.
                                 ATHOS
                   Did you kill him?

                                  D'ARTAGNAN
                   Athos.   The spy... is a woman.

                   What?

      Athos turns to d'Artagnan, wonders. And at that moment,
      sees a figure at the gangplank, swathed in fog and diffuse
      light. Milady. Time stops as they regard each other
      across the deck, the battle between.

                                ATHOS
                   No.

      Milady turns and runs into the night.    Athos races after.

      With the speed and grace of a panther, Milady runs down
      the gangplank, climbs into the saddle of one of her
      Bodyguard's horses, and gallops off. Athos appears
      moments later, leaps into the saddle of another horse.
      And gives chase.

                                                      CUT TO:

125   EXT. HARBOR ROAD - NIGHT                                      125

      Milady whips her horse, drives it onward. But Athos
      overtakes, leaps from his saddle, takes her into his arms.
      They fall to the ground with a crash. Milady grabs the
      deadly comb from her hair, grips the dagger's handle.
      Athos, stunned from breaking their fall, rolls to his
      side. Milady peers at his face, vulnerable in the half-
      light. And lowers the dagger. She will not kill him.

      Milady scrambles to her feet, runs toward a dark forest.
      But Athos stands and shouts:
                                ATHOS
                   Stop!!
      Milady takes a halting step, then turns to face him.
      Athos holds his musket in a steady hand. A very long
      beat. Milady takes a step closer. Finally, she whispers,
      with love, with hate:
                                MILADY
                   Athos.

                                 ATHOS
                   How did you do it, Sabine? How
                   did you come back from the dead?

                   A kind gentleman took pity on me.

                                 ATHOS
                   I did not.

                                 MILADY
                   No, Count. You were too proud to
                   listen to the truth. I learned
                   the value of lies soon after.

      Athos grips the pistol tighter, as if to ward off the
      past and what it brings.
                                 ATHOS
                   Give me the Cardinal's treaty.

                                 MILADY
                   No.
                                 ATHOS
                   Then I will shoot.
      Athos cocks the trigger.     Milady whispers:
                                  MILADY
                   Be kind.   And aim for my heart.
      Athos' face is a mask of contradiction. He tries to pull
      the trigger, but it is not in him. Milady recognizes
      his pain with a nod. She feels it, too. Then, briefly,
      before she leaves him, Milady speaks softly. The past,
      their love, and where it led them.

                                 MILADY
                   I remember... everything.

      She turns and runs away... directly into the arms of
      Armand de Winter. He has ridden, and he has followed,
      and he has finally found her here.

                                 ARMAND
                   Countess de Winter...

      The public room is empty, save for d'Artagnan and the
      three Musketeers. They gather around a table. Aramis
      holds the treaty in his gloved hand. The mood is somber

                   He is not mentioned directly. But
                   the agreement is contingent on a
                   'demonstration' of the Cardinal's
                   power.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN

                   I don't know.
      Athos' face grows dark. He has been silent throughout.
      Now he rises to his feet.

                                 ATHOS
                   I know someone who does.
      D'Artagnan, Aramis, and Porthos watch in grim silence as
      Athos crosses the room to an imposing door.

127   INT. PRIVATE ROOM - NIGHT                                    127
      A fire burns in the grate. Milady sits beside it in a
      chair, staring into the glowing embers. Their hot re-
      flection dances in her pale blue eyes. There is a KNOCK
      at the door. Armand de Winter emerges from a dark corner
      of the room where he has been standing guard with an
      impassive executioner. He crosses to the door, opens it.
      And Athos steps inside.
                                 ATHOS
                   I'd like a word with your
                   prisoner.

                                 ARMAND
                          (a beat, he nods)
                   She dies at dawn.

      Athos nods, and steps to Milady, stands before her.
      Milady stares at the fire, speaks softly, her eyes on the
      flames.

                                 MILADY
                          (quietly sardonic)
                   Did you come to offer me
                   consolation?
                                ATHOS
                   No.

      Milady turns, looks up to face him.
                                 MILADY
                   There was a time when I would've
                   given my life for a kind word.
                                 ATHOS
                   I could not give it, Sabine.
                   I was... a fool.
      Milady hears the regret in his voice, holds his gaze.
      Athos indicates Armand in the corner.
                                 ATHOS
                   Did you kill his brother and his
                   father as he says?
                                 MILADY
                          (a long beat,
                           honest at the
                           last)
                   I have become... the nightmare
                   you once thought me to be.
                                 ATHOS
                   But not before. Not us.
                                MILADY
                   No. The memory will keep me
                   company.
      Athos kneels at her side, near to pleading:

                                 ATHOS
                   Do you know the Cardinal's plans?
                                MILADY
                   Yes.

                                ATHOS
                   Tell me.

                                 MILADY
                   Will you spare my life?
                                ATHOS
                   I can't.

                                 MILADY
                          (remembering another
                           time, another place)
                   Society demands swift justice.
                          (off his look)
                   I'll take the secret to my grave.

                                 ATHOS
                   Sabine. You'll die for your
                   crimes. Nothing can stop that.
                   But how you leave this world is
                   up to you.
      Milady offers a half-smile, takes his hand in hers.

                                 MILADY
                   What did the world ever do for me?
      HOLD ON Athos.       Milady's hand in his.   All that he is
      feeling.

128   EXT. SEASIDE CLIFFS - NIGHT                                   128
      A hundred feet below, waves crash on a rocky shore. On
      the jagged cliff above, a black mass of trees is outlined
      against a stormy sky filled with copper-colored clouds,
      surreal in effect. A sinister procession approaches the
      cliff.
      Porthos leads Milady. She wears a simple white shift,
      her hair pulled back into a long braid. She looks years
      younger, the girl she used to be. The Executioner walks
      behind them. Followed by Armand de Winter, Aramis,
      d'Artagnan. And Athos. He watches every step.

      The procession stops at the cliff's edge.
      THUNDER RUMBLES. Lightning slashes the sky. The
      Executioner ties Milady's hands behind her. The
      Executioner removes a bright scimitar from beneath his
      cloak. Milady catches Athos' eye. He holds her gaze.

      He stares at Milady unflinchingly, as if to burn her
      image into his eyes, so that he might keep it there until
      the day he dies.
      Aramis reaches inside his cloak, removes the sacred
      priestly cloth he carries.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

      The Executioner delivers the formal litany:

                                 EXECUTIONER
                   I forgive you for your crimes.
                   Die in peace.

      Athos repeats, whispers:

                                   ATHOS
                   Die in peace.

      Aramis comes forward, intones:
                                 ARAMIS
                   I am the resurrection and the
                   life, sayeth the Lord. He that
                   believeth in me, though he were
                   dead, yet shall he live; and
                   whosoever liveth and believeth
                   in me shall never die...
      The Executioner's sharp blade shines in the light of
      dawn.

                                 EXECUTIONER
                   On your knees.
      Milady kneels, the Executioner steps closer. The tableau
      silhouetted against a reddish glow on the horizon. The
      Executioner brushes Milady's braid from her neck,
      exposing the soft white skin beneath. He raises the
      scimitar overhead, and just as he is about to bring it
      down... a cry is heard, torn from the heart:

                                   ATHOS
                   No.

      Athos grabs the Executioner's wrist, and twists the
      scimitar loose. It falls to the ground.
                                 EXECUTIONER
                   What's this...?
      Porthos leaps forward, locks his great arms around Athos.

                                   PORTHOS
                   Athos --
      But Athos breaks free.       Milady rises to her feet.   Athos
      rushes to her.

                                 ATHOS
                   Forgive me, Sabine.       Please
                   forgive.

                                 MILADY
                   I do.

      The words he could never say, finally spoken. Milady
      locks eyes with him. Athos' desperate act, the pure
      feeling it signifies, has given her a kind of release.
      And the strength to face her fate.

                                 MILADY
                   The Cardinal intends to assassinate
                   the King at his birthday celebration
                   on Friday.
      And with that, Milady reaches forward, offers a gentle
      kiss. Then, as Athos and the others look on, stunned,
      uncertain... she takes a backward step, finds the
      cliff's edge... and steps over it. The Executioner
      rushes to look after. The others follow. Except for
      Athos, who remains rooted in place, eyes on the
      distant horizon. A long silence. THUNDER RUMBLES.
                                 EXECUTIONER
                   God's justice be done.

      D'Artagnan sadly lowers his head. Porthos puts a
      consoling hand on his shoulder. Aramis stands to the
      other side, mutters:
                                 ARAMIS
                   Amen.
                                 ATHOS
                   Musketeers.

      D'Artagnan, Porthos, and Aramis turn. Athos has regained
      his former self. Stoic, in command. And hiding a broken
      heart.

                                 ATHOS
                   The King's life in danger.   We
                   have work to do.

129   EXT. ROOF OF PALAIS DU CARDINAL (PARIS) - NIGHT            129

      START CLOSE ON the now familiar portrait of King
      Louis XIII, usually found hanging behind Richelieu's
      desk. A SHOT RINGS OUT -- and a blast tears through
      the painting, leaving a smoking hole where the King's
      heart should be.

      roof to the painting, appraise the damage. Thie Cardinal

                               RICHELIEU
                 Impressive.

                               ROCHEFORT
                 He can do it every time.
      Rochefort signals approval to a solitary marksman
      positioned far away on one of the roof parapets. The
      marksman rises from a shooter's crouch, bows curtly,
      and begins to reload his musket.

                               RICHELIEU
                 And he has no qualms about...
                               ROCHEFORT
                 None. He believes that man should
                 honor no Kings before God.
                               RICHELIEU
                 A man of faith. How delightful.
                        (turns back to
                         the painting)
                 Whatever you're paying him, double
                 it. I want the King's birthday to
                 be a memorable event. And rehang
                 this painting in my chamber. Just
                 as it is.
      HOLD ON Richelieu for a beat.   Framed by a sky filled
      with stars. His evil intent.

      horseback. Pedestrians scurry to get out of their way.
      As they ride past, Porthos raises a crossbow and fires
      it. The arrow slices through the air with a terrible
      hum and imbeds itself on the public wall. Attached to
      the arrow is a piece of parchment, like the one in
      d'Artagnan's father's study. It reads: All For One,

                declared outlaws and are sentenced

                or aiding them will be hanged --
      HOOFBEATS interrupt. The Captain turns in irritation.
      And Porthos and Aramis ride to either side, snatch the
      man up by the arms, drag him briefly through the air,
      and deposit him with a thud against a hitching post.
      The Captain, stunned, looks down at the piece of
      parchment now attached to his chest. All For One, And

      The trumpeteers raise their instruments and blow a royal

      Louis, Queen Anne, and their retinue enter from a
      corridor, proceed slowly across the room toward the
      balcony that overlooks the waiting crowd outside.
      Noblemen bow, and their ladies curtsy as the King and
      Queen pass. Constance, dressed for the occasion, looks
      on from the sidelines, smiles. The King and Queen
      proceed, two teenagers with the world at the feet.

                Still, you were right about the
                celebration. And when the Cardinal

                I said nothing.

                The Cardinal expressed in

                would mean to you...
      Both pause to consider the manipulation.


139   INT. ANTEROOM - DAY                                        139
      Richelieu stands in an anteroom just off the procession,
      he watches the King and Queen as they walk, speaks
      quietly, to himself:
                              RICHELIEU
                I'm not sure which is sadder... to
                die so young. Or to die a King.
      Richelieu turns from the procession. Speaks to Rochefort
      who pauses in the shadowy alcove behind him.

                              RICHELIEU
                France will not go wanting. A new
                King will sit on the throne. The
                true King after all...

      He says it quiet fervor, the dream at long last within
      reach. Then, as if to reassure:
                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                             125.

139   CONTINUED:                                                    139
                                 RICHELIEU
                   Is everything ready?

                                 ROCHEFORT
                   Yes, Your Eminence.

                                   RICHELIEU
                   Are you sure?
                                 ROCHEFORT
                   I'd stake my life on it, Your
                   Eminence.
                                 RICHELIEU
                          (a dark beat)
                   Rest assured, Captain. You have.

140   EXT. GROUNDS OUTSIDE LOUVRE - DAY                          140
      The balcony has been colorfully decorated. The crowd
      focuses its attention on the empty space where the King
      will soon appear. Below, the entrance to the Palace is
      protected by a double line of the Cardinal's Guards,
      resplendent in their crimson tunics. It would take an
      army to get past them.

141   EXT. NEAR LOUVRE - DAY                                     141

      The streets leading to the Palace are clogged with
      people, all pushing and straining to get closer.
      D'Artagnan and the three Musketeers arrive on horseback,
      are forced to dismount. They push through the crowd,
      trying to reach the Palace, afraid that they will be too
      late. Athos barks orders as they struggle forward:

                                 ATHOS
                          (to d'Artagnan)
                   Look through the surrounding area.
                   We'll try to reach the King...

                                   D'ARTAGNAN
                   But...?
                                   ATHOS
                   Go!

      Athos and the others press on. D'Artagnan, a little
      disappointed to be left behind, pauses, checks the
      buildings that loom overhead. Then he starts, reacts
      with shock and surprise.

                                                               126.

142   D'ARTAGNAN'S POV                                            142
      The bell tower of the Carmes-Deschaux monastery. A
      figure moving about, dimly-viewed, but this much is
      clear. The man is not a monk. And he is carrying a
      musket in his hands.

143   BACK TO SCENE                                               143

      D'Artagnan turns to alert the Musketeers. Too late, they
      have already vanished into the throng. D'Artagnan takes
      off running for the monastery.

144   BELL TOWER                                                      144

      HIGH ABOVE the swelling scene. The marksman assumes a
      crouching position, raises his musket, and trains it on
      the empty balcony where the King is soon to appear.

      Louis and Anne continue toward the balcony. Richelieu
      trails the royal couple. He nods to Rochefort in
      passing. They exchange significant smiles. Anne spots
      the smirk on Rochefort's face. He resumes a supplicant
      pose. Anne glances back, Richelieu behind them.
                                 ANNE
                   I do not trust him.
                                 LOUIS
                   I'm not sure who to trust.
                                 ANNE
                   Then we will discover the truth
                   together.
      Louis likes the sound of that.     They step side by side
      toward the balcony.

      Bell ropes, hundreds of feet long, dangle down the
      vertiginous shaft. D'Artagnan races up the narrow,
      circular stairs. Above him is the open trap to the bell
      tower. He catches a glimpse of the marksman, back
      turned, taking aim.

      Athos, Porthos, and Aramis push their way through the
      crowd, trying desperately to reach the Palace entrance.
      But the throng is impenetrable. Athos turns, wonders.
      And shoots a worried look at the bell tower of the
      Carmes-Deschaux, looming against the sky, as if to intuit
      the danger lurking there.

      Louis and Anne lead the procession to the doors of the
      balcony. The crowd roars and the TRUMPETS BLARE. The
      King steps into the sunlight. The Queen follows, then
      Richelieu. The three most important people in France
      stand together, acknowledging the clamoring multitudes.


149   EXT. BELL TOWER - DAY                                     149
      The marksman takes careful aim. The cheering down below
      is like a faint whisper at this altitude. The marksman
      cocks the hammer of his flinklock.

      knows he must act now. He  looks around and sees his

      handful of rope, using his weight to RING the BELL
      overhead.

      inch from his head. Louis turns to Richelieu -- sees
      anger and disappointment flash on the Cardinal's face.
      Just for an instant... but it is enough.

153   INT./EXT. LOUVRE - DAY                                    153
      Pandemonium, inside and outside the Palace. Athos,
      Porthos, and Aramis emerge from the crowd at the entrance,
      draw their swords, and prepare to rush the long line of
      Guards protecting the doors. The Guards cannot believe
      what they are seeing. Three men against a hundred. It's
      ridiculous. But then... the looks on Guards' faces begin
      to change, subtly at first, from amusement to horror.

154   THEIR POV                                                   154

      Behind Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, something incredible
      happens. Musketeers appear from every direction. Some
      from the surrounding crowd. Some from buildings, roof-
      tops. Others appear on horseback, a few disguised as
      monks. And all defiantly wearing their blue and gold
      tunics.
      The murmur of the crowd becomes an excited roar. The
      corps of Musketeers line up behind Athos, Porthos, and
      Aramis. Porthos and Aramis exchange a smile. Athos
      keeps his usually dour expression. But his eyes are
      charged with excitement. They raise their arms, and
      face the long line of Guards. A hundred sabers flash in
      the sunlight.
                                ATHOS
                  Save the King!!

      The Musketeers charge.   It is a glorious sight.

      D'Artagnan scrambles up through the trapdoor, and tackles
      the marksman. As the BELL CONTINUES TO CLANG, they fight
      hand-to-hand. The marksman forces d'Artagnan toward the
      edge of the tower. Two hundred feet to the ground below.
      They remain deadlocked for a beat, the marksman inching
      d'Artagnan backward, certain death behind him. And at
      the last moment, d'Artagnan summons up the strength of
      three -- and shoves the marksman backward with a resound-
      ing kick.

      The marksman stumbles, falls through the open trapdoor,
      and plunges to his death.
      D'Artagnan peers down the shaft. There's a faint CRASH
      as the marksman hits bottom. Utilizing the bell ropes
      like a fireman's pole, d'Artagnan grabs hold and slides
      down into the abyss.

156   INT. GREAT HALL AND THRONE ROOM - DAY                     156
      Pandemonium reigns. Rochefort instructs his Guards to
      close the huge door to the great hall. The members of
      the King's royal court run in panicked circles, convinced
      the palace is under seige. Constance pauses amid the
      riot, seeks the Queen.

      But Richelieu has found her first. He steps to Anne,
      assumes an air of priestly innocence.
                              RICHELIEU
                Your Majesty...

      But Louis steps INTO VIEW, puts a protecting arm around
      his wife, speaks stern command:

                              LOUIS
                Leave us... alone.
      That's when a loud BOOM rocks the room.


157   ANOTHER ANGLE                                             157
      The great door shudders under the impact of a terrific
      blow. Another BOOM and the great hall is plunged into
      further chaos. The regiment of Guards rush forward,
      press their bodies against the door to secure it.
      BOOM -- the great door threatens to split in half.
      Richelieu huddles with Rochefort amid the rising panic.
      His eyes narrow to mean slits, he gestures toward Louis
      and Anne across the room.

                              RICHELIEU
                       (a cold whisper)
                Kill him. Kill her, too.

      Rochefort draws d'Artagnan's sword from its sheath. He
      advances on Louis and Anne. Louis has witnessed the
      latter, treason confirmed. He raises his own sword,
      prepared to protect his Queen. To die for her if
      necessary.
                              LOUIS
                       (to Anne)
                Get behind me.
      Rochefort takes confident steps toward the King. But
      one last BOOM and the great DOOR comes CRASHING down on
      the Guards, revealing a tide of Musketeers on the other
      side. Athos, Porthos, and Aramis at the lead.

      Louis breaks into a wide grin. The Musketeers wade into
      the Guards, and the great hall is transformed into a bat-
      tlefield. Rochefort turns, sees Athos charging at him.
                                 ATHOS
                   Greetings, Monsieur Cyclops.   Are
                   we interrupting?

                                   ROCHEFORT
                   Not for long.

      Athos and Rochefort lock swords and duel.

158   BATTLE                                                     158

      Musketeers surround Louis and Anne to ward off attack.
      But the young King has no intention of being protected.
      He wades to the fore, fights side by side with his
      Musketeers. Anne watches him with a host of emotions.
      Respect, admiration... love. Louis pauses to return her
      gaze, then returns to battle.
      Constance dashes through the fray. She sees a Guard
      slip behind a curtain, approach the Queen. She grabs a
      heavy goblet, shouts:
                                   CONSTANCE
                   Look out!
      Anne looks up. Constance tosses the goblet to her. Anne
      catches it neatly, brings it down on the head of the
      hapless Guard. Constance smiles, leaps forward.

      Aramis cuts down a Guard. As another man comes at him
      from behind, Porthos intervenes, runs the man through.
      The two Musketeers pause to exchange deadpan thanks,
      and continue.
      Athos and Rochefort slash at each other. It is a mighty
      confrontation. But Athos soon gains the upper hand.
      Rochefort shouts to a nearby Guard for help. Now it's
      two on one. Athos receives a wound in the shoulder, he
      staggers... and the treaty falls from his tunic to the
      floor. Rochefort reacts with a start, he grabs the
      treaty, stuffs it into his doublet. Athos shakes off
      the sudden pain, disposes of the Guard. Rochefort and
      Athos face each other a second time. Athos wounded,
      Rochefort confident he can finish the injured Musketeer.

      But Athos merely changes sword hands. Rochefort reacts.
      Their SABERS CLASH as they draw together. Rochefort
      grabs a dagger from his belt with his free hand. But
      Athos sees it coming, and smashes Rochefort across the
      face with his fist.

      Rochefort goes sprawling. He loses his sword, it slides
      across the floor until someone's foot stops it.
      Rochefort looks up... and sees d'Artagnan standing on
      the blade.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   This sword belongs to me.

      D'Artagnan stoops to pick up his long-lost sword. He
      tosses his other saber to Rochefort, who catches it
      neatly. Athos watches from a short distance, knows
      this moment belongs to d'Artagnan. He will not intervene.
      But he shouts:
                                  ARAMIS
                   D'Artagnan.   Kill him where he
                   stands.
      These are d'Artagnan's words. A son vowing to avenge the
      death of his father. D'Artagnan wonders. Rochefort
      confirms.
                                 ROCHEFORT
                   By all means. Let's discover if
                   you are as brave a man as your
                   father was. And as foolish.
                                  D'ARTAGNAN
                          (stunned by the
                            revelation as it
                            unfolds)
                   What...?
                                 ROCHEFORT
                   He died for his King and for
                   France. But most of all... he
                   died on the end of my sword.
                          (the final curse)
                   As will you.
      Rochefort smiles a taunt.     D'Artagnan raises his sword,
      whispers to heaven.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   This is for you, Father.

      Then, eyes blazing, d'Artagnan attacks Rochefort with
      everything he's got, driving him into an adjoining
      chamber.


159   ANGLE TO INCLUDE CHAMBER                                     159
      A FIRE ROARS in a great stone hearth. Its light pro-
      jects giant shadows on the wall as d'Artagnan and
      Rochefort duel, slashing at each other.

                                                             132.

160   GREAT HALL                                                    160
      Athos, Porthos, and Aramis take the fight to the
      Cardinal's Guards. Each with his by-now familiar
      tradmarks. King Louis fighting beside them.

161   D'ARTAGNAN AND ROCHEFORT                                     161

      They battle before the blazing fire, sweat covers their
      faces. Rochefort wears a wolfish grin. But d'Artagnan
      has learned his lessons well. He attacks with gusto.
      Rochefort's grin soon turns toward desperation. He
      cannot match the boy's vengeful steel. So he drives a
      knee into d'Artagnan's groin. D'Artagnan falls to the
      floor. Rochefort means to finish him there. But
      d'Artagnan rolls away from the blade, leaps back to his
      feet. Undaunted, he hurls himself at his hated opponent.

      Rochefort sidesteps, throws d'Artagnan against a wall.
      He pins him there, stunning the youth. And hisses with
      superior disdain:
                                 ROCHEFORT
                   One thing's certain. You're no
                   Musketeer.
      But d'Artagnan remembers Athos' advice. "Always find
      your enemy's weakness." He shoves a thumb into
      Rochefort's good eye. Rochefort stumbles backward.
      D'Artagnan plunges his sword into Monsieur Cyclops's
      heart.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   Take it back...?

                                 ROCHEFORT
                   I might... have been... mistaken.

      Rochefort crumples to the floor, dead. D'Artagnan looks
      at Rochefort's blood on his sword. His father's death
      finally avenged. That's when he hears the RUSTLE of a
      SILKEN ROBE. D'Artagnan pivots, sees Richelieu kneeling
      at Rochefort's body... extracting the treaty from his
      doublet.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                   No!!

      Richelieu smiles,   hurls the treaty into the blazing
      fireplace. As the    flames begin to lick at the parchment
      paper, d'Artagnan   flies past the Cardinal, and dives
      after to retrieve   it.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                               133.

161   CONTINUED:                                                      161
      Athos, Porthos, and Aramis enter the room. D'Artagnan
      stumbles out of the fireplace, covered with soot,
      clutching the treaty. He grins. ON d'Artagnan's look
      of triumph...
                                                    CUT TO:


162   INT. GREAT HALL AND THRONE ROOM - DAY                       162
      A short time later. The battle is over. The Musketeers
      have won. On the dais, Louis and Anne confront Richelieu
      who is a prisoner now, guarded by several Musketeers.
      Louis holds the recovered treaty in his hands.

      D'Artagnan and the three Musketeers stand nearby.

                                 RICHELIEU
                   Your Majesty, that document is an
                   obvious forgery. I am clearly the
                   victim of a conspiracy designed
                   and perpetuated by these three
                   Musketeers.

      Richelieu assumes a trustworthy pose, one familiar to
      both King and Queen.
                                 LOUIS
                   This is a complicated matter,
                   Your Eminence, affecting both
                   France and the crown...
      A beat. As all wonder if Richelieu will manage to elude
      blame after all. But Louis continues with quiet author-
      ity, just a trace of humor. As King, and as a man.
                                 LOUIS
                   And so, until such time as I and
                   my advisors --
                          (gestures toward
                           Anne; the
                           Musketeers)
                   -- can determine the whole truth
                   of the matter. I invite you to
                   await our decision in the comfort
                   of... the Bastille.

      Musketeers close in around the Cardinal.     He fumes,
      protests.

                                 RICHELIEU
                   You can't do this to me.   I'm the
                   Cardinal of France.
                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                                  134.

162   CONTINUED:                                                         162
                                 LOUIS
                          (never more certain)
                   And I am its King.
      Shouts of "Long live the King!       Long live the King!"

                                 LOUIS
                   And as King... I hereby reinstate
                   the Musketeers.
      A tremendous cheer is heard from all. Richelieu is led
      from the room. He pauses in front of d'Artagnan.
                                 RICHELIEU
                   Congratulations, Monsieur
                   d'Artagnan. I'll be keeping an
                   eye on you.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                          (unphased)
                   Thank you, Your Eminence.    I'll
                   be watching you, too.
      Richelieu smiles his crocodile smile. Followed by
      guards, he turns and strides away, hands clasped behind
      his back, scarlet robes billowing behind him.
      Louis turns to the Musketeers.       He indicates d'Artagnan.

                                 LOUIS
                   Is this the young man who saved
                   my life?
      Porthos puts a hand on d'Artagnan's shoulder.
                                 PORTHOS
                   His name's d'Artagnan, Sire.

                                 LOUIS
                   Approach, d'Artagnan.

      D'Artagnan's heart pounds as he draws closer to King and
      Queen. Then he remembers, reaches into his doublet. And
      turns to the Queen.

                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   I have something that belongs to
                   ... Your Majesty...
      D'Artagnan produces the bracelet he found on the country
      road. He holds it out to her. The King wonders, the
      Queen smiles.
                                                       (CONTINUED)

162   CONTINUED:    (2)                                            162
                                 ANNE
                   Thank you, d'Artagnan. But the
                   bracelet does not belong to me.
                          (off his look)
                   It belongs to her.

      Anne indicates Constance, who steps forward, INTO VIEW.
      D'Artagnan and Constance lock eyes for the third time.
      The thrill of recognition, the promise of romance,
      charges between. D'Artagnan slips the bracelet around
      her wrist. Constance kisses him on the cheek. Louis
      continues:
                                 LOUIS
                   D'Artagnan, I am in your debt.
                   What can I do to repay the courage
                   you've shown me? Anything,
                   D'Artagnan.  Whatever your heart
                   desires...
      D'Artagnan knows what he wants. But he is tongue-tied,
      unable to ask for it. Athos asks for him.
                                 ATHOS
                   Majesty, his heart has only one
                   desire. To become a Musketeer.
      D'Artagnan looks at Athos, thankful for the intercession.
      Louis answers with pleasure.
                                 LOUIS
                   Then kneel, d'Artagnan.
      D'Artagnan drops to his knees. Louis lays the blade of
      his sword on each of his shoulders.
                                 LOUIS
                   The world is an uncertain realm,
                   filled with danger. Truth
                   despoiled by broken promises.
                   Honor undermined by the pursuit
                   of gold. Freedom sacrificed when
                   the weak are oppressed by the
                   strong. But there are those who
                   oppose these powerful forces.
                   Those who dedicate their lives to
                   truth, honor, and freedom. They
                   are a constant reminder to all of
                   us. That such a life is not just
                   possible, but necessary to our
                   continued survival. As a country,
                   as a King. These men are known as
                   the Musketeers...

      As Louis speaks, D'Artagnan closes his eyes; countless
      images rush through his mind. His home in Gascony,
      Constance and Queen Anne on the country road, his first
      encounters with Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, their
      adventures together, the face of Milady. It's been a
      busy week.

                                 LOUIS
                   Rise, d'Artagnan. And join them.
                   Musketeer.

      D'Artagnan stands, transformed from boy to man. BELLS
      RING in the distance. Constance smiles brightly, tears
      gleam in her eyes. Athos, Porthos, and Aramis surround
      their young friend, and happily present him with the
      bright blue tunic of the Musketeers. They slip the tunic
      over d'Artagnan's head, react with a cheer. D'Artagnan
      hugs each of the three. For each has given him gifts
      more valuable than gold.
      Porthos, Aramis, and last... Athos.       Who, to the surprise
      of all who know him... smiles.
                                 PORTHOS
                   Do my eyes deceive me?
                                 ARAMIS
                   I find it hard to believe myself.

                                 PORTHOS
                   His lips, unused as they are to
                   such a contortion, twisted and
                   stretched... into a smile.

                                 ARAMIS
                   It was spectacular. And what
                   teeth.

      D'Artagnan basks in their company, wonders aloud.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   I know this is a stupid question.
                   But what exactly does a Musketeer
                   do?

      Porthos and Aramis exchange a glance.       They're not so
      sure themselves.
                                 PORTHOS
                   Truth... honor...

               From a secret island in the South Pacific, 
               the courageous Tracy family run an organization               
               called International Rescue. When disaster strikes, anywhere 
               in the world, they are always first on the
               scene. They go by the name they gave their incredible machines, 
               the Thunderbirds.

               So, gentlemen, we all know that A2 plus

               is now standing in front of him.

               theorem. Did any of that happen to sink in?
 
               
                             ALAN TRACY
               I was just...

               
                             TEACHER
               Apparently not (she picks up his notebook 
               which he has been doodling in) "Thunderbirds 
               are go."

               Well, I hope you aren't going anywhere special over spring 
               break, Alan. Because I expect a 10,000 word paper on my desk
               the day you get back. That should keep you busy.
 
               
               Bells rings dismissing the students and Alan and Fermat walk 
               out to their lockers.
 
               
                             ALAN
               (mocking the teacher) "That should keep 
               you busy. Yeah, well you can take your 
               10,000 words 
               and stick them right up your..."

               
                             FERMAT
               Alan!

               
               Both boys turn around to see the headmaster approaching them 
               while walking by with the teacher from before

               
                             ALAN
               Headmaster.

               
                             HEADMASTER
               Mr. Tracy!

               
                             ALAN
               Miss Garrett.

                             FERMAT
               You gotta be more careful Alan.

                             ALAN
               Why can't I tell 'em I'm a Thunderbird 
               Fermat?
 
               
                             FERMAT
               Because technically you're not a Thunderbirds 
               yet. And if your identity was discovered, 
               it would a d-d-di- it could be very bad.

               
                             ALAN
               I know, I know.

               
                             EXCITED KID
               It's the Thunderbirds. They're gonna 
               be on TV. Let's go! They're gonna be 
               on TV.
 
               
                             ALAN
               Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Where are they?

               
                             EXCITED KID
               In Russia, at an oil rig fire.

               
                             ALAN
               Great! I'm stuck at school and my brothers 
               are on another cool mission.
 
               
                             FERMAT
               Wanna watch?

               
                             ALAN
               Yeah!

               
               Boys go into a crowded room with a TV on the news channel

               
                             LISA LOWE
               We are told this super-rig is now in 
               danger of total collapse.

               And there is real concern for the lives of six 
               men who remain trapped on board.

               An emergency call went out to the Thunderbirds just a few minutes 
               ago. They should be here any moment now.

               (pauses and points at the sky while exclaiming excitedly) 
               And here they are!
 
               
               The boys watching the TV begin to cheer

                             SCOTT TRACY
               Thunderbird 2 this is Thunderbird 1. 
               I have visual, south
 
               column, they're trapped on an inspection platform.

               
                             JEFF TRACY
               FAB. We'll take it from here.

               
                             MULLION
               Come on! Come on!

               
                             JEFF
               Scott, get out. That tower's coming 
               down.
 
               
                             SCOTT
               Got it.

               
               A blast of fire hits Thunderbird 1 and sends it a little farther 
               away from the accident zone.
 
               
                             JEFF
               Thunderbird 1 any damage?

               
                             SCOTT
               Negative, Dad.

                             ALAN
               Come on, come on! Swing around. You 
               can't get close enough, taking that 
               approach angle.
 
               
                             JEFF
               This approach angle's no good. Gonna 
               have to swing her around.
 
               
                             SCOTT
               Watch the wind shear Thunderbird 2.
 
               
               
                             JEFF
               Scotty, I was watching for wind shear 
               when you were still wearing diapers.
 
               
               
                             ALAN
               Come on, Dad.

               
               A blast of fire comes toward Thunderbird 2

               
                             JEFF
               Whoa! Hold on!

               
                             SCOTT
               Who needs the diapers now, Dad?

               
                             FERMAT
               What do they do now?

               
                             ALAN
               Probably drop the rescue platform from 
               Thunderbird 2.
 
               
                             VIRGIL TRACY
               Open 'em up. Here we go. Rescue platform's 
               on its way.
 
               
                             JEFF
               Virgil, how's it going?

               
                             VIRGIL
               It's looking good, Dad.

               
                             CREW MEMBER
               Come on! Jump!

               
                             VIRGIL
               Okay, I've got a visual. Hold it there. 
               Targets locked. Firing rescue lines. 
               (Directed toward the
 
               crew members who he just fired the rescue lines toward) Come 
               on, guys, hook 'em up. We gotta get
 
               you out of here.

               
                             CREW MEMBER
               READY

               
                             ANOTHER CREW MEMBER
               HOIST AWAY!

               
                             JEFF
               Alright, let's haul them out.

                             JEFF
               Okay, let's bring 'em home.

               
                             CREW MEMBER
               Look out! (a couple of crew members 
               bump into each other as they are hoisted 
               up)
 
               
                             ALAN
               Man they gotta get 'em out fast. That 
               rig's gonna blow.
 
               
                             CREW MEMBER
               Hang on!

               Boys watching the TV gasp as the crew goes down back toward the 
               water a little bit
 
                             JEFF
               Whoa sorry, boys. Hold on tight. Here 
               we go.
 
               
                             ALAN
               Come on, Virgil.

               
                             VIRGIL
               Hold on guys

               
                             JEFF
               How you doing, son?

               
                             VIRGIL
               Never better

               FAB, Thunderbird 2. (after pressing 
               a bunch of buttons on his control panel) 
               Lining up target.
 
               Fire!

               
                             JEFF
               Bull's-eye! Outstanding shot. All right

               As you can see the fire has been extinguished. 
               The rocket fired from Thunderbird 1 
               has
 
               robbed it of the oxygen it needed to burn. Amazing! The Thunderbirds 
               have done it again, Chuck! '
 
               
               The boys watching the TV with Alan and Fermat begin cheering.
 
               
               
                             CHUCK
               That was great work, Lisa. Thanks a 
               lot.

               day. Thunderturd!

               
               The boys in the room "ooohh" and look at Alan for a response
 
               
               
                             ALAN
               That's another good one, diaper boy.
 
               
               
               All the boys look at the Know It All Kid and laugh

               Tracy! (after finding Alan in the sea 
               of boys he continues) There's someone 
               here for you.
 
               
               Lady Penelope Creighton-Ward, at your service. Alan darling, 
               your father's been unexpectedly detained.
 
               And he's asked me to pick you up. Is that all right?

               
                             FERMAT
               Sure beats the bus!

               
                             ALAN
               Definitely!

               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               Fantastic. Now, will any of these gorgeous 
               young things be joining you?
 
               
               All of the boys raise their hands and shout for Alan to choose 
               them.
 
                             ALAN
               Just Fermat.

                             LADY PENELOPE
               Quite right.

               
                             ALAN
               Lady Penelope, why are you in America? 
               Are you on a mission for my father?

               Hi, Parker.

               
                             PARKER
               Good afternoon, Master Hackenbacker.

                             PARKER
               Less of that attitude, or I shall be 
               obliged to deliver the Parker Haymaker.

               That is good news, milady.

               Brains, I noticed a build-up of vibration

               Oh God. (There is loud beeping coming 
               from the control panel and the boys 
               can't shut down
 
               Thunderbird 1) Oh, could this day get any worse?

               
               Scene briefly changes to Jeff getting an alert in his office.
 
               
               
                             JEFF
               (his face appears on a monitor in Thunderbird 
               1) Alan, my office. Now. (Thunderbird 
               1 shuts
 
               down)

               
                             FERMAT
               It just did.

               The boys walk out of Thunderbird 1 and are walking toward the 
               silo door. Fermat is running his hand
 
               on the nosecone of Thunderbird 1.

                             ALAN
               I can't believe it.

               
                             FERMAT
               We're so b-b-busted.

               
               Fermat's hand touches the goo that Mullion fired at Thunderbird 
               1 earlier.
 
               
                             FERMAT
               Look at this.

               
                             ALAN
               What is it?

               
                             FERMAT
               Looks like some sort of, gallium-electrolyte 
               compound.
 
               
                             ALAN
               We gotta get out of here.

               
               Scene changes to Alan walking into his dad's office.

               
                             ALAN
               Dad, I know you're mad. I shouldn't 
               have been in the ship, but if you just 
               give me a minute to
 
               explain- (Jeff cuts him off)

               
                             JEFF
               You're damn right you shouldn't have 
               been in there!
 
               
                             ALAN
               But, nothing happened Dad. I had it 
               under control.
 
               
                             JEFF
               Under control? Do you have any idea 
               of the importance of secrecy in our 
               operation? You fired up
 
               a Thunderbird without activating the anti-detection shield. You 
               put everyone in danger when you act
 
               selfishly. You want to be part of the team, you have to play 
               by the rules. You understand? (Alan just
 
               looks at him) Do you?

               
                             ALAN
               Yeah, I understand. I understand you 
               don't want me to be a Thunderbird. You 
               don't want me to
 
               do anything. You won't even listen to me when I'm trying to tell 
               you something important!
 
               
                             JEFF
               I've heard enough. You're grounded for 
               the rest of spring break.
 
               
                             ALAN
               But, Dad!

               
                             JEFF
               Bottom line, Alan. You need to grow 
               up.
 
               
                             ALAN
               Then let me. (he stalks toward the door 
               before whispering,) Please!
 
               
               Jeff is starting at two old family photos on his desk when the 
               video phone rings.
 
               
                             JEFF
               Hey, John. I was just about to turn 
               in. What can I do for you?
 
               
                             JOHN TRACY
               I could sure use a pizza. You know a 
               place that delivers?
 
               
                             JEFF
               30 minutes or it's free, right? Anything 
               else on your mind?
 
                             JOHN
               Well, got a forest fire in Vladivostok, 
               a typhoon heading for Singapore. What's 
               happening on
 
               Planet Tracy?

               
                             JEFF
               Alan's home for spring break.

               
                             JOHN
               Yeah, I thought I could see a storm 
               brewing in your region.
 
               
                             JEFF
               Teenagers.

               
                             JOHN
               Well, we've all been there. And Dad, 
               you've done a great job since Mom died.
 
               
               
                             JEFF
               Thanks, John. Keep an eye on that typhoon 
               for us. And, uh, I'll call Vladivostok, 
               see if they need
 
               help with that fire.

               
                             JOHN
               FAB, Dad. Sleep tight.

               
               Fermat is down with his father in the Thunderbirds hanger.

               
                             FERMAT
               Morning, Dad.

               
                             BRAINS
               Hey, son. There's something I'd like 
               to sh-sh-sh- Here, take a look.
 
               
                             FERMAT
               The neural-net control system?

               
                             BRAINS
               It's great to have you back. I bet you 
               didn't think spring break was going 
               to be this w- w-fun.
 
               Watch this.

               
               Brains uses the neural-net control system to lift up the phone 
               in front of him. It also lifts up the Mole
 
               which is stationed behind his workplace.

               
                             BRAINS
               And that tiny phone lifts up, perfect.
 
               
               
                             FERMAT
               Dad?

               
               The neural-net control system short circuits.

               
                             BRAINS
               N-n-n- Almost perfect.

               
                             FERMAT
               There's something I want to talk to 
               you about.
 
               
                             BRAINS
               Oh. Right. Oh. OK, right. You're having 
               problems with a g-g-g-chi-chi-chi-wo-wo-female?
 
               
               
                             FERMAT
               N-no! No. Alan and I found some sort 
               of gallium compound on the nosecone 
               of Thunderbird
 
               1.

               
                             BRAINS
               We should check that out st-st-st-immediately.
 
               
                             FERMAT
               That'd be g-g-g-swell!

               Scene skips to Alan skipping rocks at the beach. The camera 
               follows one rock and it leads to a
 
               telescope coming out of the water. The telescope is connected 
               to the Hood's submarine.
 
               
                             MULLION
               The island is in sight.

               
                             THE HOOD
               Transom, I need you.

               
                             TRANSOM
               Yes, sir. Sir, our cloaking device has 
               evaded their detection
 
               systems. We have a positive visual from the tracking solution 
               on Thunderbird 1.
 
               
                             THE HOOD
               Mullion.

               
                             MULLION
               Sir? Sir, armed and ready. Shall I target 
               the main structure?
 
               
                             THE HOOD
               Why would I want to destroy what will 
               soon be mine? One of the principle tenets 
               of Eastern
 
               martial arts is to use your opponent's strength against him.
 
               
               
               The Hood uses his powers to keep Mullion in place

               
                             MULLION
               (trying to move and realizing that he 
               can't) This is ridiculous.
 
               
                             THE HOOD
               It will be almost impossible to force 
               the Thunderbirds to leave their island. 
               On the other
 
               hand, it requires no effort at all to let them go.

               
               The Hood stops using his powers on Mullion and Mullion falls 
               over.
 
               
                             THE HOOD
               The Thunderbirds' purpose is to rescue. 
               All we need do is give them the victim. 
               (The Hood
 
               looks at Transom) Commence targeting.

               
                             TRANSOM
               Straightaway, sir. Target acquisition 
               of Thunderbird 5 is locked.
 
               
                             THE HOOD
               Fire.

               
               Transom fires a missile at Thunderbird 5.

               
               Scene switches to John on Thunderbird 5 when suddenly alarms 
               start to go off around him.
 
               
               
                             JOHN
               What the?

               
               
                             JOHN
               Thunderbird 5 to Tracy Island. Mayday! 
               Mayday!
 
               
               Missile hits Thunderbird 5 and John is blow back into a wall 
               from the explosion. The scene then
 
               switches over to Tracy Island.

               
               Brains and Fermat run into Jeff's office.

               
                             BRAINS
               Switching to Command and Control Center. 
               (Brains uses a palm scanner to activate 
               Command
 
               and Control)

               
               The submarine is briefly showed getting closer to the island.
 
               
               
               Jeff, Scott, Virgil, and Gordon come running into Command and

                             JEFF

               Scene switches to the submarine.

               
                             THE HOOD
               There goes the cavalry. But who will 
               rescue the rescuers?
 
               
               Scene changes to Alan on the beach looking up at Thunderbird 
               3 launching and heading toward
 
               Thunderbird 5. Tintin runs up beside him and looks up as well.
 
               
               
                             FERMAT
               Alan! Tintin! Thunderbird 5 has been 
               hit! Thunderbird 5 has been hit! Thunderbird 
               5 has been
 
               hit!

               Don't panic.
 
               
               The children look toward the beach when they hear a noise and 
               see the submarine beginning to
 
               surface.

               
                             ALAN
               On the other hand.

               Run!

               
               The kids run and hide behind some trees and shrubs. Scene then

               murder with my allergies.
 
               
               The kids stick their heads back out the vent and look at what 
               is going on in the Command and Control
 
               room.

               
                             THE HOOD
               You left me to die that day. You may 
               have broken my body but you've no idea 
               how
 
               powerful my mind has become. And now you will suffer, as I suffered, 
               waiting for a rescue that will
 
               never come. (Makes a motion for Transom to cut off the call with 
               Thunderbird 5.)
 
               
                             JEFF
               Wait! (Video link cuts dead and then 
               the scene cuts to Thunderbird 5.) Scott, 
               status report.

               CO2 levels are rising.

               
                             JEFF
               Alright, wire the oxygen scrubber to 
               the emergency batteries. Clean the air.

               How long will that give us?

                             JOHN
               About four hours.

               
               Scene switches back to the kids looking into the Command and 
               Control room. Fermat begins to start
 
               sneezing again. Tintin and Alan put their hands over his nose 
               and mouth to try and muffle the sound.)
 
                             MULLION
               Someone's there. (Mullion walks over 
               to the ceiling, he is standing directly 
               below where
 
               they are. The kids are trying to leave the vents when his hand 
               shoots up through the ceiling and grabs
 
               Alan's ankle. He lets go after Tintin bites his hand and he gasps 
               in pain.)
 
               
               The children are now talking loudly and everyone in the Command 
               and Control room can hear them.
 
               
                             TINTIN
               Run! Run!

               
                             ALAN
               No, jump! We can get through to the 
               silos.
 
               
               The children scream as they fall down a tunnel leading to the 
               silos. And the scene switches to the
 
               Command and Control room.

               
                             THE HOOD
               Apparently, the island is not as secure 
               as you thought. (he looks at the old 
               photos that were
 
               on Jeff's desk. Children! Did you find any children?

               
                             TRANSOM
               (Using the security cameras to see into 
               the silos) Here they are. Thunderbird 
               2 silo, in the
 
               loading arm.

               
               Mullion and two other guards run off to get them

               
                             THE HOOD
               (Speaking to Transom) Seal them in.
 
               
               
                             ALAN
               Hold on!

               
                             TINTIN
               The doors! You guys, let's go! C'mon
 
               
               
                             FERMAT
               Go! Go!

               
               The children reach the door that leads to Thunderbird 3's silo 
               just as it closes.
 
               
                             ALAN
               This way. (They run toward the still 
               closing Thunderbird 1 silo door.)
 
               
               
                             FERMAT
               (After the door closes before they can 
               get through it) No!
 
               
                             TINTIN
               They've got us trapped. What now?

               
                             FERMAT
               If we can get to the Thunderbird 1's 
               silo, we can escape through the service 
               tunnel. But we
 
               need a plan, Alan.

               
                             ALAN
               I'll use the Thunderizer on the door.
 
               
               
               guards are in the elevator heading down to come get them)

               
                             ALAN
               You guys get the goons with the Firefly!
 
               
                             FERMAT
               Alan! This equipment is only to be used 
               in an emergency. (Alan and Tintin give 
               him looks) I
 
               guess this qualifies.

               
                             ALAN
               Yeah.

               
                             TINTIN
               Here they come. Fermat, can you drive 
               this thing?
 
               
                             FERMAT
               Uh, no.

               
                             TINTIN
               Hey, watch it!

               
                             FERMAT
               I took microbiology, not driver's ed. 
               Set the pressure to maximum.
 
               
                             TINTIN
               Got it.

               (The guards walk out of the elevator 
               and see Tintin pointing the Firefly 
               at them) Retreat!
 
               (They fall over and have trouble getting up due to the slipperiness 
               of the stuff fired at them)
 
               
                             TINTIN
               Let's move it.

               
                             ALAN
               That's it. Time to thunderize. (After 
               the door has a hole cut in it.) Yes!
 
               
               
                             ALAN
               Come on, let's go!

               
                             MULLION
               Get 'em!

               
                             ALAN
               Where's Fermat?

               
                             TINTIN
               Fermat!

               
                             ALAN
               Fermat!

               
                             FERMAT
               Coming!

               
                             ALAN
               Hurry up. (the children are now in Thunderbird 
               1's silo) What were you doing back there,
 
               
               Fermat?

               
                             FERMAT
               I had an-n-n idea.

               
                             ALAN
               Just try and keep up, okay? I'll open 
               the tunnel. We gotta keep moving. (Alan 
               types in a pass
 
               code)

               
                             ALAN
               (To Tintin and Fermat) Go back. Yell 
               when you see them coming. (tries another 
               pass code)
 
               
               Alan turns away from the door for a moment and the camera can 
               see The Hood on the other side of
 
               the door. Alan turns back and sees him.

               
                             THE HOOD
               Alan. You can run if you want. Were 
               you surprised to hear what your father 
               did to me? It is
 
               frightening when we realize our parents aren't perfect. But perhaps 
               you already suspected that about
 
               your father. Why did he build these magnificent machines? Do 
               you suppose it was guilt? Because he
 
               let your mother die. (Alan shakes his head no) Open the door, 
               Alan. (Alan continues to shake his head
 
               no) (The Hood chuckles at his refusal) Open, the, door. (He tries 
               to use his powers on Alan but nothing
 
               happens)

               
                             ALAN
               (Shouting to Tintin and Fermat) We can't 
               go this way. He's there.
 
               
               The Hood uses his powers to open the door and Mullion and the 
               other guards appear at the other
 
               doorway, leaving the children trapped.

               
                             FERMAT
               No! (he falls slightly) Ow. What are 
               we gonna do, Alan?
 
               
                             ALAN
               I don't know. I'm thinking, okay? (Alan 
               looks at the control panel behind the 
               Hood and sees a
 
               button that will open part of the floor under Thunderbird 1. 
               Keep backing up. I've got an idea. (Alan
 
               takes his rock launcher from the pouch it is in on the back of 
               his pants. and fires it at the button, but
 
               misses.)

               
                             TINTIN
               That's your idea?

               
                             THE HOOD
               It's not me you're angry at, Alan.
 
               
               
                             ALAN
               It's not you I'm aiming at. (Alan fires 
               another rock and this time hits the 
               button and the floor
 
               drops out from underneath Tintin, Fermat, and Alan. Tintin, Fermat, 
               and Alan scream as they fall.)
 
               
                             THE HOOD
               Get them!

               
                             MULLION
               Transom, fire up Thunderbird 1. And 
               set it on broil!
 
               
               The kids look behind them while they are falling down the tunnel 
               and see the flames coming from
 
               Thunderbird 1 behind them. Tintin screams even louder. The tunnel 
               opens up and leads to the ocean.
 
               
               Back in Command and Control

               
                             TRANSOM
               No sign of them.

               
                             MULLION
               Of course not, the little brats went 
               up like firecrackers. Pop, pop, pop! 
               (laughs at Brains and
 
               Brains moves to punch him.)

               
                             THE HOOD
               Don't, give him the satisfaction, Professor. 
               This is taking too long. Pick out the 
               equipment
 
               you need to get into those banks and load it into Thunderbird 
               2. No more delays.
 
               
                             MULLION
               Yes, sir.

               Scene switches to the children trying to get onto the beach, 
               they are getting knocked over by a couple
 
               of waves. Fermat is coughing and spluttering.

               
                             FERMAT
               How about a little warning next time 
               you pull a stunt like that?
 
               
                             ALAN
               Relax, Fermat. It's just a little water.
 
               
               
                             FERMAT
               I could have drowned.

               
                             ALAN
               You mean you can't swim?!

               
                             FERMAT
               I repeat, I could have drowned.

               
               Scene switches to the boys ringing out their shirts, they are 
               both in their boxers.
 
               
                             ALAN
               I said I was sorry, Fermat. Just put 
               this behind us, Okay? We gotta watch 
               each other's backs.
 
               Nice drawers.

               
                             FERMAT
               Thank you.

               No, c'mon Tintin, stay there.

               
                             TINTIN
               You're worse than a couple of girls. 
               Hurry up and get dressed. (To Fermat) 
               Those are nice
 
               drawers!

               Right.

               
                             FERMAT
               So, there's a miniscule possibility 
               that if we reach the satellite station, 
               we could
 
               
                             ALAN
               Blow it up!

               
                             FERMAT
               No, we could hack in to it and give 
               control back to Thunderbird 5.
 
               
                             ALAN
               Good thinking, Fermat. Alright, let's 
               do it. (Alan starts drawing the plan 
               in the sand) Here's the
 
               plan. We're here, right?. So, we go along the shore around the 
               base of the mountain to the access road,
 
               here. And then up to the transmitter. So what do you think?
 
               
               
                             TINTIN
               Good. Except that we're here, not there, 
               and the transmitter is there, not here. 
               We have to go
 
               through the jungle.

               
                             FERMAT
               But that's f-f- off limits.

                             TINTIN
               It's gonna be dangerous.

               
                             ALAN
               I'm in. (All three of them put their 
               hands together) We gotta get up there 
               fast! All our folks are
 
               in trouble and if The Hood gets off the island

               
                             FERMAT
               Actually, he's not going anywhere for 
               now.
 
               
                             ALAN
               The guidance processor for Thunderbird 
               2. You can't take off without it. Fermat 
               you're a genius.
 
               How'd you get this?

               
                             FERMAT
               Alan, my friend, what you don't know, 
               can't hurt you.
 
               
               Scene switches to Lady Penelope's Country Mansion in England, 
               where Parker is out cleaning a car
 
               when the car phone rings.

               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               Parker?

               
                             PARKER
               Milady?

               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               We have an emergency.

               
               Scene switch to Lady Penelope's bathroom

               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               What a charming fellow.

               
               Someone knocks on the door.

               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               Come in.

               
               Parker enters Lady Penelope's bathroom, with tea, where she is 
               up to her shoulders in bubble bath.
 
               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               Have a look at this, Parker. (There 
               is a computer monitor near her feet.) 
               He, and this
 
               woman, poor girl, both work for this man, known as The Hood.
 
               
               
                             PARKER
               Sounds like an alias, milady.

               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               Quite right, Parker. Real name: Trangh 
               Belagant. Assumed dead when
 
               
               his illegal diamond mine collapsed in the jungles of the Malaya. 
               (takes a sip of tea) Oh, perfect, Parker.
 
               The Thunderbirds rescued over 500 mine workers, including Mr. 
               Belagant's brother.
 
               
                             PARKER
               Milady, that's Mr. Tracy's loyal manservant, 
               Kyrano.
 
               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               How's my schedule, Parker?

               
                             PARKER
               You have clay pigeon shooting with Lord 
               Marlborough, a benefit gala for the 
               Institute of the
 
               Blind, and incidentally there's a typhoon bearing down on Singapore.
 
               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               I suppose that's urgent.

               
                             PARKER
               Yes, milady. There was also a bridge 
               collapsed in Buenos Aires and a volcanic 
               eruption in
 
               Jakarta.

               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               The Thunderbirds haven't responded?
 
               
               
                             PARKER
               No, milady. And the media is awash in 
               speculation vis-à-vis their whereabouts. 
               Parker turns on
 
               the news.

               
                             CHUCK
               Over to Lisa Lowe.

               
                             LISA LOWE
               Chuck, disaster after disaster around 
               the world today and still no sight of 
               the Thunderbirds.
 
               Typhoon Jago hit land in Singapore just one hour ago and thousands 
               have been left homeless by a
 
               volcano in Jakarta. Only the Thunderbirds have the incredible 
               machines
 
               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               I think it's time to send the emergency 
               signal, Parker.
 
               
                             PARKER
               I fear you're not wrong, milady.

               
                             LISA LOWE
               Lisa Lowe. Back to you, Chuck.

               
               Parker hits the top of the tea pot and a light pops out and begins 
               to blink and beep. Back on Tracy
 
               Island a similar light begins to flash and bleep but Brains is 
               unable to get up to get to it because he is
 
               tied up.

               
               Scene switch to the kids walking through the jungle.

               
                             ALAN
               I'm telling you, Fermat, it was like 
               The Hood was inside my head back there.
 
               
               
                             FERMAT
               What do you mean, Alan?

               
                             ALAN
               Maybe he can read minds or control minds 
               or something.
 
               
                             FERMAT
               Don't be silly, Alan. Everything can 
               be explained by science.
 
               
                             ALAN
               I'm just trying to figure out his weakness. 
               Everybody has an Achilles heel, right?
 
               
               
                             FERMAT
               My Achilles heel is actually my Achilles 
               heel. It's got a blister the size of 
               a basketball. Tintin!
 
               Can we s-s-

               
                             TINTIN
               Stop?

               
                             FERMAT
               Yes!

               
                             TINTIN
               No!

               
                             FERMAT
               (sighs) Okay.

                             ALAN
               (Helping Fermat up the hill) No more 
               cheeseburgers for you, Fermat.
 
               
               Scene change back to Lady Penelope's house.

               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               Any word?

               
                             PARKER
               Nothing, milady.

               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               Right. You will have to tell Lord Marlborough 
               that I've broken my shooting arm. We
 
               
               shall send the Institute for the Blind a dozen guide dogs. And 
               bring the car around.
 
               
                             PARKER
               Yes, milady.

               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               The Thunderbirds appear to be in a spot 
               of trouble. And I don't like that. Let's 
               go,
 
               Parker.

               
               They get in the car and it takes off flying toward Tracy Island. 
               Scene switches to Mullion and the Hood
 
               in the Thunderbirds hanger.

               
                             MULLION
               Ready for launch. We'll use this to 
               get into the vaults.
 
               
                             THE HOOD
               Subtle, as usual, Mullion.

               
                             MULLION
               I didn't realize we'd be getting points 
               for style. We're robbing banks, remember.
 
               
               
               The Hood uses his power on Mullion and Mullion gasps.

               
                             THE HOOD
               Don't worry. You'll get your money.
 
               
               
                             MULLION
               (Looks over toward Thunderbird 2 and 
               speaks into headset) Transom, initiate 
               pre-flight
 
               diagnostics.

               
               An alarm suddenly goes off in Thunderbird 2.

               
                             MULLION
               What's going on?

               
               
                             TRANSOM
               It's the guidance processor.

               
                             MULLION
               What's wrong with it?

               
                             TRANSOM
               There isn't one.

               
                             MULLION
               Aaargh!

               
                             THE HOOD
               Clever Alan. It's the children. They 
               have it.
 
                             MULLION
               No way. They're dead. No one could live 
               through something like that.
 
               
                             THE HOOD
               I did. Get them, Mullion. Take whatever 
               you need. And make sure you get the 
               guidance
 
               processor before you lose your temper.

                             ALAN
               Blossoming?! What's that supposed to 
               mean?
 
               
                             FERMAT
               Come on, Alan. You've a c-crush on her.
 
               
               
                             ALAN
               You've got to be kidding. I mean, she's. 
               She's not that bad, I guess.
 
               
                             TINTIN
               (Reaches the top of the mountain) Okay, 
               guys, take five.
 
               
                             FERMAT
               (Still finishing climbing up the mountain)Five

                             TINTIN
               Guys?

               
               Alan and Fermat reach the top of the mountain, they are both 
               puffing and panting. Tintin smiles at
 
               them before she sees a scorpion on Alan's shoulder.

               
                             TINTIN
               Don't move.

                             ALAN
               What is it?

               
                             TINTIN
               Hexdrotilous scorpion.

               
                             ALAN

               So, dangerous is in fact an understatement.
 
               
               
               Tintin uses powers just like her uncle, The Hood, to lift the 
               scorpion off of Alan's shoulder and lets it
 
               fall to the ground.

               Just because I s-s-stutter doesn't mean 
               that I'm wrong. If we're a team, we 
               should make
 
               decisions as a team.

               a vote? Or do you want to get out of

               You can be a real jerk sometimes.

               
               Scene changes to Mullion looking up and seeing the kids escaping 
               on the hoversled.

               I need more speed to get above the trees. 
               Hang on!
 
               
               Tintin and Fermat fall off the hoversled screaming and at Mullion's 
               feet.
 
               
                             ALAN
               What'd I tell you guys? (looks down 
               and sees Fermat and Tintin being captured.) 
               Oh, no.
 
               
               Scene switches to Mullion walking Tintin and Fermat to a door 
               in the Tracy house.

                             FERMAT
               Oh, no! Not the fridge!

               
               Fridge door opens to reveal Kyrano, Onaha, and Brains.

                             KYRANO
               Sweetheart, are you okay?

               
                             TINTIN
               I'm fine, Dad.

               him sit down on a container) Cool off, 
               kid! (he
 
               laughs evilly as he walks out of the fridge and closes the door 
               on the way out)

               What is it?

               
                             TRANSOM
               We have an unidentified craft approaching 
               the island at high speed.
 
               
               Scene switches to Alan climbing over a hill and seeing Lady Penelope's 
               car approaching.

               Come on, Dad. The situation's hopeless.
 
               
               
                             JEFF
               No, it's not. There's still time. We've 
               got people on the ground working for 
               us.

               Alan? He's just a kid!

               
                             JEFF
               He's a Tracy.

               
               Scene switches quickly to Alan running through the forest and 
               then to Lady Penelope and Parker
 
               walking up to the Tracy house

               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               This doesn't look good, Parker.

               
                             PARKER
               No, milady.

               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               That bougainvillea is absolutely parched, 
               and someone should do something about
 
               
               that hideous hammock.

                             THE HOOD
               (After seeing Lady Penelope and Parker) 
               Whom do we have here? Mullion.
 
               
                             MULLION
               I must warn you that I know judo, krai 
               magna, and tae kwon do.
 
               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               And I know Parker.

               
                             PARKER
               Milady.

               
                             MULLION
               (After Parker punches him in the face) 
               You've broken my nose.
 
               
                             PARKER
               Yes, that was very much the intention 
               of the maneuver.
 
               
                             TRANSOM
               (After she tries to attack Lady Penelope 
               and Lady Penelope pushes her over) Whoa!
 
               
               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               One tries so hard in life to sort things 
               out on an intellectual-slash-conversational 
               level.
 
               sometimes it's just not possible.

               
               Lady Penelope continues to fight Transom and Parker continues 
               to fight Mullion, the Hood is watching
 
               them.

               
                             PARKER
               (after Mullion threw him against a metal 
               cabinet) Shall I bring the car around, 
               milady?
 
               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               Parker, have a bit of a lie-down.

               
                             PARKER
               (Sees Mullion behind Lady Penelope) 
               Excuse me, milady. (punches him and 
               after that has no
 
               effect he picks up a frying pan and hits Mullion)

               
               Transom goes back to fighting Lady Penelope and Mullion is fighting 
               Parker.
 
               
                             THE HOOD
               Ah, Lady Penelope! Of course he has 
               his palace. Why not his princess?
 
               
               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               Flattery will get you nowhere. (after 
               she blocks the metal bar that Transom 
               was trying
 
               to hit her with) Ow! Have you any idea what a manicure costs 
               these days?
 
               
                             PARKER
               (Is pushing Mullion forward) Coming 
               through, milady.
 
               
               The camera quickly pans a little bit outside to show Alan hidden 
               behind some shrubs watching the
 
               fight.

               
                             PARKER
               (After the Hood uses his powers to throw 
               a sofa at them) Duck, milady!
 
               
                             ALAN
               He's weak. Using his power makes him 
               weak. (The Hood, having heard something 
               looks over
 
               toward where Alan)

               
                             THE HOOD
               You're formidable opponent Lady Penelope. 
               More than a match for most men.
 
               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               That's not saying much, then, is it?
 
               
                             THE HOOD
               (uses his powers to stop the punch that 
               Parker was about to throw at him) I 
               suggest you
 
               let us pass.

               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               Don't try your parlor games on me you 
               sad, little man. You've committed a 
               serious
 
               crime trespassing on this island. And in about (looks at Parker's 
               watch) four seconds, I'm going to get
 
               quite cross with you. (the Hood uses his powers to stop her foot 
               which was about to come up and kick
 
               him.)

               
                             THE HOOD
               (with his back still to Alan) How are 
               you, Alan? (he uses his powers on Parker 
               and Lady
 
               Penelope and they cry out in pain) (Alan moves to run back into 
               the jungle) I hope you don't think I'm
 
               going to chase you. (he uses his powers on Parker and Lady Penelope 
               and they cry out in pain again)
 
               You can make it stop, Alan. (Parker and Lady Penelope cry out 
               again) You have something that belongs
 
               to me.

               
                             PARKER
               Really, sir, don't mind me. This isn't 
               the first time my head's been pulverized. 
               And it's never
 
               done any real harm before. (The Hood once again uses his powers 
               on them and they cry out in pain
 
               louder this time)

               
                             ALAN
               (comes out of his hiding place) Stop! 
               Stop! I'll give it to you. (throws the 
               guidance processor
 
               toward the pool) Fetch! (the Hood uses his powers to bring it 
               over to him before it can hit the water)
 
               
                             THE HOOD
               You made a match of it, Alan, I'll give 
               you that. (to Mullion and Transom) Put 
               them with the
 
               others. (Transom grabs Parker)

               
                             MULLION
               (To Lady Penelope and Alan) You're coming 
               with me. (Grabs Alan's arms and throws 
               Lady
 
               Penelope over his shoulder)

               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               Put me down! This outfit is couture.
 
               
               
               Scene switches to Thunderbird 5.

               
                             JEFF
               Don't go to sleep. John, look at me. 
               Keep your eyes open.
 
               
               Scene switches back to the fridge where Mullion and Transom are 
               taking Alan, Lady Penelope, and
 
               Parker.

               
                             MULLION
               You need to cool off, milady.

               
                             TINTIN
               Lady Penelope!

               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               (To Mullion) Big oaf! (The fridge door 
               closes leaving them trapped) Right, 
               that's quite
 
               enough losing for one day.

               
                             ALAN
               (To Fermat) So, how does it feel to 
               be right all the time?
 
               
                             FERMAT
               Not b-bad, actually.

               Thunderbird 2 lands in a park near the London Eye and causes

               We're getting reports of some kind of 
               incident in London involving the Thunderbirds. 
               Lisa, are
 
               you there?

               
                             LISA LOWE
               Chuck, I'm here in Jubilee Gardens where 
               Thunderbird 2 has made an impromptu 
               landing,
 
               causing total panic in Central London. As far as we know there 
               has been no emergency call from this
 
               area so it's unclear why Thunderbird 2 would be active here at 
               all. I don't know if you can see this Chuck
 
               but Thunderbird 2 seems to be unloading some kind of machine.
 
               
               
               Scene changes to inside the Mole with Transom, Mullion, and The

                             TRANSOM
               Sir, if we continue on our present course, 
               we'll sever the monorail's subterranean 
               supports.
 
               Shall I correct our position?

                             THE HOOD
               Stay on course.

               
                             TRANSOM
               But sir, we'll cause a major disaster.
 
               
               
                             THE HOOD
               No, we won't. The Thunderbirds will.
 
               
               
               The Mole severs the subterranean support leaving one monorail 
               car stranded in the air. Scene then

               who delegates the important jobs. (sees 
               the
 
               look Mullion is giving her) Oh, dream on, sad act. (Mullion chuckles 
               and walks away.)
 
               
               Scene switches to Jeff, Alan, Tintin, and Fermat about to enter 
               the Bank of London when Parker pulls
 
               up.

                             JEFF
               Good timing, Parker.

               
                             PARKER
               Good afternoon Mr. Tracy.

               
                             JEFF
               Come with us.

               
                             PARKER
               My pleasure, Mr. Tracy.

               
               Scene switches to The Hood talking to Mullion and Transom.

               
                             THE HOOD
               The Thunderbirds. They're here. Kill 
               them all.
 
               
               Scene switches to Jeff, Alan, Parker, Tintin, and Fermat inside 
               the Bank of London.
 
               
                             JEFF
               Alan, you guys stay here with Parker. 
               I'm gonna go find Lady Penelope.
 
               
                             ALAN
               But what about The Hood? (Alan points 
               behind Parker) Look out, Parker! (When 
               Parker turns
 
               away Alan runs after his dad.)

               
                             PARKER
               Master Tracy!

               
                             FERMAT
               Look out, Parker!

               
                             PARKER
               Alright, that's enough of that.

               
                             MULLION
               (from behind Parker) Don't move. (Parker 
               motions for the kids to run forward 
               but Transom
 
               blocks them. Parker puts his hands up as if to punch her)

               
                             TRANSOM
               Go on, then.

               
                             PARKER
               No, sorry. I can't hit a lady.

               
                             TINTIN
               Allow me. (she kick Transom and runs 
               off, Transom chases her)
 
               
                             MULLION
               (To Fermat) I've been waiting to get 
               my hands on you brats.
 
               
                             PARKER
               And I've been waiting to get my hands 
               on you.
 
               
               They brawl for a few seconds before Mullion lands a good punch 
               on Parker.
 
               
                             PARKER
               Ow, now that was a punch.

               
                             FERMAT
               Parker, can we wrap this up?

               
                             PARKER
               What did you have in mind, Master Hackenbacker?
 
               
               
                             FERMAT
               Strategically speaking, the best odds 
               of success lie with the Parker Haymaker.
 
               
                             PARKER
               I concur. (they knock Mullion out)
 
               
               
               Scene changes to Jeff running into the room that Lady Penelope 
               is being held captive in
 
               
                             JEFF
               Penny!

               
                             PENNY
               Jeff, no!

               
                             THE HOOD
               Did you save them all this time, Jeff? 
               Or did you leave someone behind?
 
               
                             JEFF
               I didn't make you what you are.

               
                             THE HOOD
               It's not me you have to convince. (motions 
               his head toward the entrance of the 
               room
 
               where Alan is standing)

               
                             JEFF
               Leave my son out of this- (the Hood 
               uses his powers to throw Jeff into the 
               cage that Lady
 
               Penelope is handcuffed in)

               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               Jeff!

               
                             ALAN
               Dad! (Alan runs toward the closing cage 
               door and reaches it right as it slams 
               shut) Dad! Dad!
 
               
                             THE HOOD
               I'm disappointed in you, Alan. I thought 
               we were kindred spirits.
 
               
                             ALAN
               Well, we're not. I'm Jeff Tracy's son.
 
               
               
                             THE HOOD
               You certainly are. (Alan runs at him)
 
               
               
                             JEFF
               No!

               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               Alan no! (The Hood uses his powers to 
               throw Alan off to the side where he 
               slams
 
               into a wall)

               
                             JEFF
               Alan!

               
               The Hood looks dazed but then uses his powers to fly up to the 
               catwalk above the Mole. The scene
 
               then switches to Tintin being chased by Transom running into 
               a cage.
 
               
                             TRANSOM
               Come here, you little minx! (Tintin 
               jumps up on a bar and flips to the other 
               side while
 
               Transom runs into the wall) Ow!

               
                             TINTIN
               (Closing the cage door) Bye-bye.

               
               Scene switches back to the room with The Hood, Alan, Jeff, and 
               Lady Penelope.
 
               
                             JEFF
               Alan, stay back.

                             THE HOOD
               You want so desperately to walk in Daddy's 
               footsteps. (uses his powers to lift 
               Alan off the
 
               floor and makes him start choking himself with his own hands)
 
               
               
                             JEFF
               Let him go.

               
                             THE HOOD
               Did you really think you could challenge 
               me?
 
               
                             JEFF
               Let him go, please.

               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               Let him go.

               
                             JEFF
               Please! Let him go! (the Hood tightens 
               his hold of Alan and then releases him)
 
               
               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               Alan! Are you all right?

               
                             JEFF
               Alan, get out. Run!

               
                             ALAN
               He's getting weaker. He can't last much 
               longer.
 
               
                             JEFF
               Neither can you! (Alan begins to climb 
               up the Mole to reach the Hood) Alan, 
               no! Look out! (The
 
               Hood starts the Mole with his powers and Alan has to jump and 
               grab the railing of the catwalk) Alan!
 
               
                             THE HOOD
               I'm glad you could be here to see this, 
               Jeff. (steps on one of Alan's hands 
               until he cries in
 
               pain and lets go)

               
                             THE HOOD
               Goodbye, Alan! (Steps on the other hand 
               and Alan yells in pain) (Tintin runs 
               into the room)
 
               
                             TINTIN
               No!

               
                             THE HOOD
               Ah, (uses his powers on her) (She uses 
               her powers on him as well) Oh!
 
               
               (The catwalk flips over making Alan safely on top and the Hood 
               dangling above the still active Mole.
 
               
                             THE HOOD
               Leave me, Alan. Leave me to die. (releases 
               one hand from the railing) Like your 
               father did.
 
               
                             ALAN
               I don't want to save your life. (the 
               Hood lets his other hand go, but Alan 
               grabs it) But it's what we
 
               do.

               
               Scene switches to The Hood, Mullion, and Transom being led to 
               a police car outside the Bank of
 
               London when Thunderbirds 1,2, and 3 fly above them.

               
                             THE HOOD
               See you soon, Jeff.

               
                             PARKER
               (To Lady Penelope as she climbs in the 
               car) Now, that was definitely showing 
               off.
 
               
               Scene changes to back at Tracy Island. Scott, Virgil, John, and 
               Gordon are playing in the pool. Jeff is
 
               grilling with Lady Penelope standing next to him. Fermat is getting 
               swimming lessons from his dad
 
               and Alan is watching.

                             VIRGIL
               Hey, Scott.

               
                             SCOTT
               Get him!

               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               (To Jeff) What did you put in these 
               margaritas?
 
               
                             JEFF
               It's a Tracy secret.

               
                             BRAINS
               (To Fermat) That's my boy! One more 
               week and you're gonna be swimming like 
               a F-f-f-D-d-d-
 
               Sha-sha- sha-Aquatic creature.

               
                             ALAN
               Good job, Ferm.

               
                             TINTIN
               (To Alan as she spins around) So, what 
               do you think?
 
               
                             ALAN
               He's getting there. (Looks at Tintin) 
               Whoa, Tintin! You're just really, um, 
               blossoming.
 
               
                             TINTIN
               Ew! Did you say "blossoming"? (smiles 
               at him)
 
               
                             JEFF
               (rings a triangle) Gather around everybody. 
               I have an announcement to make. Tonight 
               is a special
 
               night. We're all together because of three very special people. 
               Fermat, Tintin, Alan. The world needs
 
               Thunderbirds and the Thunderbirds need you. (gives each of them 
               International Rescue pins)
 
               
                             FERMAT
               Mr. Tracy!

               
                             TINTIN
               Thank you, sir. (Camera pans quickly 
               over to Parker who is tearing up)
 
               
               
                             JEFF
               Congratulations, Alan. No short cuts. 
               You earned it. You all did.
 
               
                             PARKER
               (To Onaha and Kyrano) I'm not usually 
               an emotional man, but sometimes even 
               the toughest
 
               nut must crack.

               
                             VIRGIL
               (As all four of Alan's brothers walk 
               over to ruffle his hair and congratulate 
               him) Hey, way to go,
 
               sprout!

               
                             JOHN
               That's my boy, Alan! That's my brother. 
               (Fermat and Alan are thrown into the

               Scene switches to all five Tracy boys lined up in their uniforms 
               about to go on a rescue mission. The

          1   EXT.   METROPOLITAN CITY - DOWNTOWN - LATE NIGHT              1
          
              Hot summer night. The flesh district - hookers working the
              sidewalks, stopping cars.
          
              MIKE REILLY, 20s, paces a corner, restless, looking for
              action ... wet hair, three-day beard, trenchcoat, sneakers,
              heat-seeking weary eyes. He flashes a wad of bills in an
              effort to get some attention... no one notices.
          
              Across the street, BILL RICE, 50's, a ragged transient,
              strolls over.
          
                                   RICE
                      Know what the problem is, kid?   You're too
                      ugly to get propositioned.
          
                                   REILLY
                      Look who's talking, old man.
          
                                   RICE
                      C'mon, it's a quiet night.
          
              Rice starts away.   Reilly pauses, then trudges after him.
          
          2   EXT.   SIDESTREET - NIGHT                                     2
          
              Rice and Reilly pull donuts and coffee out of a bag, talk
              with their mouths full as they walk.
          
                                   RICE
                      Next week we work the park.
          
                                   REILLY
                      I gotta get back on top.   Get off the sleaze
                      detail.
          
                                   RICE
                      You will, one day at a time.   I'll be old and
                      grey when it happens...
          
                                                                11/10/97   2.
          
          
          
          
          They share a grin, pass a BAG LADY who wears a pie-tin crown,
          holding her hand out to a PIMP getting into a Cadillac.
          
                              BAG LADY
                 A small gift, sir, for the Queen ...
          
          The Pimp ignores her, screeches off. The Bag Lady pulls out
          a pad, adds his license number to a list, glances up at Rice
          and Reilly.
          
                              BAG LADY (cont.)
                 I keep a record, see? They don't
                 pay, I don't forget.
          
          Rice fishes some change out of his pocket.
          
                              RICE
                 Here you go, your Highness.
          
                              BAG LADY
                 Thank you, officer.
          
          She pushes her shopping cart away. Rice and Reilly look at
          each other, crack up, surprised she knew he was a cop.
          
                              REILLY
                 So what'll you do? After they give you the
                 gold watch.
          
                              RICE
                 Hell, I got a gold watch... it just don't
                 work. Maybe they'll give me a new fishing
                 pole, or something useful.
          
                              REILLY
                 You don't fish.
          
                              RICE
                 How hard can it be? The grand kids been
                 buggin' me about taking them camping.
          
                                                                     11/10/97     3.
          
          
          
          
                                  REILLY
                     You outta the city... that's a fish out of
                     water. What's with all this family talk
                     lately, anyway?
          
                                  RICE
                     One of these days you're gonna get tired of
                     fighting the shit. When that happens, you'll
                     wish you had family.
          
                                   REILLY
                     No thanks.   I got close but it never woulda
                     worked.
          
              They stop beside a dirty, beat-up Studebaker parked in the
              alley, climb in, Reilly behind the wheel.
          
          3   INSIDE THE STUDEBAKER                                           3
          
              Cluttered with debris - clothes, boxes, personal items.
              Reilly jiggles the ignition - the engine coughs and sputters,
              finally turns over.
          
                                  RICE
                     Why don't you just shoot it and put it out of
                     its misery?
          
                                  REILLY
                     What are you talking about, it's purring like
                     a kitty.
          
                                  RICE
                     I thought you said what's-her-name's brother
                     was going to fix it.
          
                                  REILLY
                     She didn't work out, had to cut her loose.
          
                                  RICE
                     What was it this time?
          
                                  REILLY
                     She wanted to cook me breakfast.
          
                                                                      11/10/97    4.
          
          
          
          
              The White Van appears up ahead and turns into a seemingly
              deserted building's garage.
          
              Reilly and Rice exchange a glance as they wait to see lights
              come on in the building. They don't.
          
              Two flashlight beams criss cross through the windows of the
              building briefly, then disappear. They hear a brief heated
              argument, that is cut short abruptly. Then silence.
          
                                   REILLY (cont.)
                      C'mon, let's check it out.
          
                                   RICE
                      We're vice, I didn't see no pimps or hookers
                      in that van. But if you're so gung-ho, we'd
                      best call it in for some back-up.
          
                                   REILLY
                      Nah, let's just take a look-see.
          
              Reilly jumps out and heads for the building.   Rice rolls his
              eyes, follows.
          
          4   INT.   BUILDING - NIGHT                                         4
          
              A huge, old, battered machine shop. Spooky darkness, dead
              quiet. Moonlight filters in through dirt-smeared windows.
          
              The door CREAKS as Reilly and Rice slip in, stop, eyes scan.
              Nothing.   Just rows of glistening machines.
          
              Rice gestures for Reilly to spread out. They head in,
              footsteps echoing, shadows washing over them.
          
              Still nothing...deeper, deeper... then, glancing over, Reilly
              sees a shape hiding behind a machine. He steps towards it.
              The shape whirls - a beautiful spitfire of a GIRL with
              piercing blue eyes.
          
              She tries to bolt. Reilly grabs her. She struggles, pulls a
              knife, slashes his arm, drawing blood through his trenchcoat.
          
                                                                   11/10/97   5.
          
          
          
          
                               REILLY
                 Ow!   Son-of-a-bitch.
          
          He punches her full force in the face - she collapses,
          knocked out cold. Rice rushes over.
          
                              RICE
                 You okay?
          
                              REILLY
                 Yeah, just a nick ...
          
          Then, over Reilly's shoulder, Rice sees a dark SILHOUETTE
          emerging from behind a machine. Rice draws his pistol.
          
                               RICE
                 Freeze!   Police!
          
          As Reilly whirls, the Silhouette raises a Mac-11.
          
          Rice shoves Reilly aside as the Silhouette OPENS FIRE...
          
          Diving for cover, Reilly flings back his trenchcoat, whips
          out his 9mm and RETURNS FIRE at the Silhouette, blowing the
          shit out of windows behind, sparks showering off machines.
          
          Silence for an instant, Reilly looks for Rice and finds him
          bleeding to death on the floor nearby - he is completely
          exposed to the line of fire.
          
          The Silhouette and another FIGURE OPEN FIRE on Reilly.
          
          SWAN, 40s, crazy-brilliant, manic eyes... and one of his men,
          pale, sweaty, wearing an EARRING, 30s, continue the barrage.
          
          Swan fires ONE SHOT at a time at Rice, deliberately aiming
          not to kill him, trying to flush Reilly out.
          
          Rice screams as BULLETS RIP into his legs. Reilly tries to
          reach him but can't, shots forcing him back.
          
          A dark-eyed man with a BEARD appears in the b.g. and stealths
          towards Reilly from behind.
          
                                                                   11/10/97   6.
          
          
          
          
          Reilly' face is in agony as Rice moans in pain. He glances
          urgently from the gunmen to the exit behind them, to The Girl
          lying next to him -- what's keeping them there? Obviously
          The Girl.
          
          She stirs. Desperate, Reilly grabs her by the hair, shoves
          his 9mm to her head. Using her as a shield, he drags her in
          front of Rice to protect him.
          
                              REILLY
                        (to gunmen)
                 Drop it!
          
          Swan's eyes flare. He steps out into the open, gun aimed at
          Rice, eyes locked murderously on Reilly.
          
                                SWAN
                 Let her go.
          
          Reilly cocks his hammer, fingers trembling.   The Girl
          stiffens, terrified.
          
          Beard emerges behind Reilly. Deadly silent, he raises an
          automatic, trying to get a clear shot between machines...
          
                              SWAN (cont.)
                 No, the girl!
          
          Reilly whirls, sees Beard, shrinks back to stay covered.
          
                              EARRING
                        (to Swan)
                 We gotta get outta here!
          
                              REILLY
                        (to Swan)
                 Tell them to drop it - now!
          
          A deadly stalemate.   Faraway SIRENS WAIL.
          
                                                                  11/10/97   7.
          
          
          
          
                              SWAN
                 You have no idea how sorry you're going to be.
                        (to The Girl)
                 Don't worry.
          
          Beard smolders, Earring sweats. Keeping their guns up, the
          three men grab tool bags, work their way to the alley door
          and slip out.
          
          The moment they're gone, Reilly quickly handcuffs The Girl to
          a machine, kneels, cradles Rice.
          
                               RICE
                 Mike...
          
                               REILLY
                 Don't talk.
          
                              RICE
                 Take your time... one day at a time, kid...
          
          Rice takes Reilly's hand and pats it on his wristwatch.
          
                              RICE (cont.)
                 It's all I got... it's yours.
          
                              REILLY
                 It don't work-
          
                              RICE
                        (grinning)
                 Ain't that a shit--
          
          Rice's eyes go blank, he exhales his last breath.
          
          Reilly winces, eyes welling up. His gaze moves at the Girl.
          
          The Girl stares uncomfortably, a blink of sympathy stealing
          past her hard exterior ...
          
                                                                      11/10/97    8.
          
          
          
          
          5   INT.   POLICE HEADQUARTERS - MORNING                            5
          
              Looking numb, out of place, Rice's blood still on his
              trenchcoat, Reilly walks in, weaves through a chaos of
              ringing phones, overworked cops, suspects being booked.
          
              Cops look up, whisper about him.
          
              Turning a corner, Reilly bumps into a bulldog of a cop,
              HARRY, hustling The Girl out of a booking room. She's got a
              shiner where Reilly hit her.
          
              The Girl and Reilly make eye contact, intimate somehow, a
              flash of vulnerability and fear in The Girl's face...
          
                                   HARRY
                      Hey, Reilly, Captain's looking
                      for you.
          
              Reilly snaps out of it, continues on.    Reilly nods as Harry
              hustles the girl away.
          
          6   INT.   CAPTAIN'S OFFICE - DAY                                   6
          
              Behind his desk, a work-weary captain, WINTERS, 50s, sucks
              coffee as he grills ARTIE PLUCHINSKY, 40s, a slick suit-and-
              tie homicide detective.
          
                                   WINTERS
                      Prints?
          
                                   PLUCHINSKY
                      Nothing so far.
          
                                   WINTERS
                      What about the ballistics report?
          
                                   PLUCHINSKY
                      Lab's backed up, we're still waiting
                      for it.
          
              Reilly walks in.
          
                                                                   11/10/97   9.
          
          
          
          
                              REILLY
                 Captain...
          
                              WINTERS
                 Reilly, what the hell happened out there?   Why
                 didn't you call for back-up?
          
                              REILLY
                        (at a loss, sad)
                 Sir, I--
          
          
          Reilly looks at his watch (we notice he's now wearing Rice's
          watch). He taps it, listens to see if it's ticking.
          
                              WINTERS (contíd)
                        (softening)
                 Dammit, Rice was a good man,
          
                              REILLY
                 I want to work this.
          
                              PLUCHINSKY
                 You're vice, not homicide. Besides, you don't
                 have the experience and you're too personally
                 involved.
          
                              REILLY
                 But sir--
          
                              WINTERS
                 You know the rules. You're off the street
                 `til I.A.D. clears the investigation. Now go
                 home and clean yourself up, get some rest...
          
          Harry barges in, dumps a bag of personal effects on the desk.
          
                              HARRY
                 She won't talk. Look at this shit, no I.D.,
                 nothing...
          
          Reilly picks up a twisted plastic-wire bracelet.
          
                                                                   11/10/97       10.
          
          
          
          
                                     PLUCHINSKY
                      What's that?
          
                                   HARRY
                      Bracelet she was wearing.
          
                                   REILLY
                      Looks like the stuff my dad used to use to
                      blow up tree stumps back in Scranton.
          
                                   PLUCHINSKY
                      Maybe she knows your old man.
          
              Reilly sears into Pluchinsky.
          
                                   WINTERS
                      Take it down to the Bomb Squad, Artie-
          
                                     REILLY
                      I'll do it.
          
              Winters eyes him for a beat, relents...
          
                                     WINTERS
                      Okay, kid.    Run this down to the Cave.
          
              Reilly spins and exits quickly.
          
          7   INT.   POLICE STATION - BASEMENT - DAY                          7
          
              Emerging from a dingy back staircase, Reilly enters a hallway
              and moves to a door a door marked "BOMB SQUAD."
          
          8   INT.   POLICE STATION - "THE CAVE" - DAY                        8
          
              Reilly enters into another world - a dungeon cluttered with
              bomb paraphernalia, defusing equipment, a dog house, ping-
              pong table, Sheryl Crow pin-up, Chicago Bears posters, Yassir
              Arafat dartboard, a photo-shrine to dead Bomb Squaders.
          
              A plain, fresh-faced assistant, BEV, 30s, looks up from her
              computer station.
          
                                                                      11/10/97       11.
          
          
          
          
                                    BEV
                       May I help you?
          
                                    REILLY
                       I'm looking for the Bomb Squad.
          
                                    BEV
                       They're not here.
          
                                    REILLY
                       Where are they?
          
                                    BEV
                       And you are...?
          
                                    REILLY
                       Officer Reilly, vice.
          
                                    BEV
                       There out on a call, perhaps I can help you-
          
                                     REILLY
                       -Where?
          
                                    BEV
                       2600 block of Lakefront.   A limousine.   But, I-
          
                                     REILLY
                       Thanks.
          
               Reilly sprints out.   Bev tries to finish but he's gone.
          
          9    EXT.   CITY STREETS - DAY                                         9
          
               The Studebaker coughs and smokes in and out of traffic.
          
          10   EXT.   LAKEFRONT STREET - DAY                                  10
          
               A young, uniformed police OFFICER stops Reilly in front of a
               cordoned-off section of the street.
          
                                                               11/10/97   12.
          
          
          
          
                              REILLY
                        (flashes badge)
                 Bomb Squad.
          
          The Officer nods and moves the barricade out of the way,
          Reilly hits the gas, rumbles through.
          
          The Studebaker swings past a fire truck, an ambulance, and
          two squads cars.
          
          Two OFFICERS stand near a building with a worried BUSINESSMAN
          and his CHAUFFEUR.
          
          Reilly parks 50 yards from a limo stopped in the middle of
          the street. A Bomb Squad van and sleek black Harley Davidson
          parked beyond it.
          
          Reilly hops out, heads cautiously for the limo
          
          POOCH, 50s, a barrel-chested ex-football player is on his
          hands and knees looking under the limo. Red rubber ball in
          hand, Hawaiian shirt half-tucked in, he leads around an
          equally scruffy Labrador Retriever, SCHNOZ.
          
                              POOCH
                 Smell anything, Schnoz?    Me, neither.
          
          T.J., 20s, a country boy inspects the open trunk.
          
          GLASS, 40s, clean-cut, straight-laced, easy-going smile,
          brilliant leader of the team, steps lightly around the open
          driver's door.
          
                              POOCH (contíd) (cont.)
                 Schnoz, come here, boy.
          
                              T.J.
                 Shhh, I hear something....
          
          Reilly stands off 25 feet.    Glass notices him.
          
                              GLASS
                 Who the heck're you?
          
                                                                  11/10/97   13.
          
          
          
          
                              REILLY
                 You the Bomb Squad?
          
                              T.J.
                 No, we're terrorists, stay back or we'll blow.
          
                              GLASS
                 We're a bit busy at the moment, I'll give you
                 a statement in a few minutes if we're still
                 alive.
          
                              REILLY
                        (flashes badge)
                 Reilly, Vice. I-
          
                              T.J.
                 Quiet!
          
          Glass and Pooch step lightly to the rear of the limo where
          T.J. has discovered a shoebox wedged next to the spare tire.
          T.J. leans down, puts his ear to it, nods.
          
                              T.J. (cont.)
                 Ticker.
          
          Pooch lifts up Schnoz and holds him over the trunk.    Schnoz
          sniffs the shoebox, whines.
          
                              POOCH
                 Schnoz says it's loaded.    Good boy,
                 Schnozzie.
          
          Pooch lowers Schnoz back to the ground throws him the red
          ball, and trots back to the van, climbs up inside and sits,
          watching.
          
                              GLASS
                 Alright boys, look close.   Let's assess.
          
          Glass, Pooch and T.J. take a beat just to look at the
          shoebox. Then, Glass nods for Reilly to move away.
          
                                                                      11/10/97        14.
          
          
          
          
               Reilly takes a few steps back, watching as the team works
               together - Glass in charge - a psychic connection between
               them as they pass tools back and forth like surgeons.
          
                                   POOCH
                      Whadaya think, "boy" or "girl"?
          
               Glass puts on magnifying spectacles -- precise, organized, a
               detail freak as he uses a wooden probe to test the box for
               wires, sensors.
          
               As the others watch, Glass rubs his fingertips
               ritualistically and carefully eases the top off the box.
          
               He reaches in...   Grabs something...   Slowly pulls it out ...
          
               It's a Mickey Mouse alarm clock doll, a clump of unlit
               firecrackers taped between Mickey's legs.
          
               The Bomb Squaders whoop and howl - all except Pooch who pulls
               out a pack of Tums, shoves half of it in his mouth.
          
                                   GLASS
                      It's a "girl" !
          
               They all crack up, hysterical.   Reilly stares in disbelief --
               these guys are nuts!
          
          11   MOMENTS LATER - AT THE BOMB SQUAD VAN                             11
          
               In the b.g., the Officers finish getting a statement from the
               Businessman as the still-worried Chauffeur inspects the limo.
          
               T.J. and Pooch load their equipment into the van as Glass
               fills out paperwork.
          
                                   T.J.
                      That guy's wife must be pretty pissed off to
                      play a trick like that.
          
                                                                 11/10/97   15.
          
          
          
          
                               POOCH
                 No shit.   I better send Meg flowers just in
                 case.
          
          T.J. and Pooch share a laugh as Reilly approaches...
          
                              REILLY
                 Who's in charge here?
          
          Pooch points to Schnoz.
          
                               POOCH
                 He is!
          
                              REILLY
                 Look, it's important.
          
                              T.J.
                 Make an appointment.
          
                              REILLY
                 It's about this.
          
          Reilly holds up the bracelet.    Glass takes it, frowns.
          
                              GLASS
                 Where did you get this?
          
                              REILLY
                 Off a girl's wrist.    A suspect...
          
                               T.J.
                 P.E.T.N ...
          
                               REILLY
                 What?
          
                              GLASS
                 High-grade det cord. This girl, either she's
                 got strange taste in jewelry or she's into
                 serious demolition.
          
                                                               11/10/97   16.
          
          
          
          
                              REILLY
                 What do you mean?
          
          Glass whips out a blasting cap from his utility belt, cuts
          off a piece of the bracelet, plugs it in.
          
                              POOCH
                 Fire in the hole!
          
          Glass tosses it into a sewer drain. A beat, then a small
          EXPLOSION, smoke billows out of the gutter drain. The nearby
          Officers jump, alarmed. The Bomb Squad guys laugh. Glass
          waves to the Officers.
          
                              GLASS
                 Sorry about that.
                        (to Reilly)
                 That's an inch of the stuff, imagine
                 what the whole thing'd do.
          
                              REILLY
                 Thanks.
          
          He grabs back the bracelet, turns to leave.
          
                              GLASS
                 Hey wait a minute-
          
          Reilly jogs back to his Studebaker, climbs in and roars off
          in a cloud of dirty smoke.
          
                              T.J.
                 Vice... Jesus.
          
                              POOCH
                 That'd be some explosive pussy he's got his
                 hands on.
          
          Pooch and T.J. share a laugh as Glass shakes his head, climbs
          on his Harley. The others pile into the van.
          
          Glass kicks-starts his hog and rumbles away, van following.
          
                                                                       11/10/97       17.
          
          
          
          
          12   INT.   BAR - DAY                                                  12
          
               Thin crowd of day-time drinkers. Earring walks in, moves to
               a booth where Swan and Beard are eating. Earring pulls out a
               Gallois (French) cigarette, lights up from a book of matches.
          
                                    EARRING
                       They're holding her downtown.
          
                                    SWAN
                       What about the cop?
          
          
               Earring shrugs.
          
                                    BEARD
                       If you'd let me waste him.
          
                                    EARRING
                       What if she talks?
          
                                    SWAN
                       She won't.
          
                                    BEARD
                       I say we split town. Come back to this job
                       when things cool. We've got other contracts -
                       Denver, Seattle...
          
               Swan slams his fist down, spilling food.     No one in bar even
               looks up from their drink.
          
                                    SWAN
                       I want her back and we do the job.
          
                                    BEARD
                       I thought we agreed, the personal can't
                       interfere with the professional.
          
                                    EARRING
                       Besides, we're on a schedule and the cops
                       won't let her go.
          
                                                                     11/10/97        18.
          
          
          
          
                                    SWAN
                       Unless we make them.
          
                                    EARRING
                       Hey...
          
               Earring stares uneasily. Swan and Beard look up, freeze.     A
               pair of PATROL COPS are heading directly towards them.
          
               Earring reaches under his jacket...   Swan grabs Earring's
               arm, calming him.
          
               The Cops keep coming, then at the last moment, they veer left
               and slide into a booth.
          
               Swan nods, they get up and casually slip outside.
          
          13   INT.   POLICE STATION - SQUAD ROOM - DAY                         13
          
               Reilly hurries in, interrupts Winters and Pluchinsky talking
               over Pluchinsky's desk.
          
                                    REILLY
                       Captain-
          
               An OFFICER shouts from across the room, holding up a phone.
          
                                    OFFICER
                       Captain, line one!
          
                                    WINTERS
                              (to Reilly)
                       I thought I told you--
          
                                    OFFICER
                       He says it's important, something
                       about the Rice shooting.
          
               Winters snatches up the nearest phone.
          
                                    WINTERS
                       Winters.
          
                                                                 11/10/97   19.
          
          
          
          
          He listens, facial expression changing, getting tight.
          
                              WINTERS (cont.)
                 What...?
          
          He punches an intercom button - the whole room stops, looks
          up, as Swan's voice comes over the squawk box.
          
                              SWAN'S VOICE
                 I said release the girl or alot of
                 people are going to die.
          
          Winters signals frantically for the call to be traced -- cops
          spring into action.
          
                              SWAN'S VOICE (contíd) (cont.)
                 It's exactly two o'clock. If she's not
                 released in one hour, people die.
          
                              WINTERS
                 Wait, what do you mean--?
          
          Click, the line goes dead.    Winters slams down the phone - no
          chance of a trace.
          
                              WINTERS (cont.)
                 Shit!
          
                              PLUCHINSKY
                 What the hell was that?
          
                              REILLY
                 A ticking bomb...
          
                              WINTERS
                 What?
          
                              REILLY
                        (holds up bracelet)
                 It's detonation cord, for a bomb.
          
                                                                       11/10/97     20.
          
          
          
          
                                    PLUCHINSKY
                       It's a bluff. The guy's full of
                       crap.
          
                                    WINTERS
                       We can't take the chance. Ring down to the
                       Bomb Squad. I want them on alert.
          
                                       REILLY
                       I'll do it.
          
                                    WINTERS
                       Goddamit, Reilly--
          
                                    REILLY
                       Look, I saw these guys, I can i.d. them.
          
                                    WINTERS
                       I know you're anxious to get back but... just
                       stay out of homicide's way or I'll have you
                       classifying fingerprints, understand?
          
                                       REILLY
                       Yes, sir.
          
               Reilly takes off, Pluchinsky glares.
          
          14   INT.   THE CAVE - DAY                                           14
          
               T.J. is hunched over a twisted mess of wires, untangling
               them.   Pooch taste-tests dog biscuits for Schnoz, then feeds
               them to him, as he talks to his wife on the phone.
          
               Glass is dissecting the Mickey Mouse clock.
          
                                    POOCH
                       No, honey, I'm fine. Yeah, well, you're
                       welcome. You deserve flowers more often.
          
               Bev glances longingly at T.J. as she gives Glass a neck rub.
          
                                    GLASS
                       Bev, you're the greatest...
          
                                                                  11/10/97   21.
          
          
          
          
                              T.J.
                 Hey, I'm next.
          
          T.J. winks as Bev turns away, hard to get.
          
          Reilly bursts in.
          
                              BEV
                 Hey, that's the guy-
          
                              REILLY
                 We just got a bomb threat upstairs.
          
          This gets everyone's attention.
          
                              REILLY (cont.)
                 A cop was killed last night interrupting a
                 robbery. One of the gang was grabbed, a girl.
                 The one I told you about with the detonation
                 cord. Well, her friends just called in,
                 they're threatening to waste people unless
                 she's released in the next hour.
          
                              GLASS
                 Alright, let's check it out.
          
                              REILLY
                 We can start in the area where the robbery
                 occurred.
          
                              T.J.
                 Vice cop on a homicide?
          
                              REILLY
                 Captain assigned me to assist you.
          
                               POOCH
                 Assist?   What the hell you know about tickers
                 anyway?
          
                              GLASS
                 Easy, guys.
                        (to Reilly)
                              (MORE)
          
                                                                 11/10/97   22.
          
                              GLASS (cont.)
                 Look, nothing personal, but you can't just
                 waltz in here and expect to join the team.
          
                              REILLY
                 What're you talking about?
          
                              GLASS
                 When you need us, you love us, when you don't,
                 we're shunned by the rest of the department.
          
                              REILLY
                 We've got one hour.     Are you coming
                 or not?
          
          The Squad just stands there.
          
                              REILLY (cont.)
                 Okay, fuck you.
          
          Reilly walks out.   The guys look at each other.   Glass frowns
          at the bracelet.
          
                              T.J.
                 Those vice cops, around all that pussy, so
                 pent up.
          
          Bev smirks at T.J.'s language, he lowers his eyes.
          
                              POOCH
                        (to Glass)
                 What do you think?
          
                              GLASS
                 Call upstairs, see what you can find out.
          
                               POOCH
                 Right.
          
                              GLASS
                        (re: bracelet)
                 T.J., run a trace on this, see if
                 you can pin down where it came from. Whoever
                 these people are, let's hope they're all talk.
          
                                                                    11/10/97       23.
          
          
          
          
          15   EXT.   ALLEY - DAY                                             15
          
               Reilly's Studebaker is parked next to the machine shop
               building.
          
          16   INT.   BUILDING - MACHINE SHOP - DAY                           16
          
               Reilly enters and slowly re-walks his steps from the shoot-
               out, pausing over the chalk outline of Rice's body.
          
               Two FORENSICS OFFICERS silently comb over the crime scene.
          
               Reilly pauses, sadness overwhelming him. One of the Officers
               nods at him, he has to turn away as the emotions come.
          
          17   INT.   SUNCREST MOTEL - ROOM - DAY                             17
          
               Sophisticated detonation equipment and weapons cover the
               beds. Beard scowls, Earring sweats as Swan puts the
               finishing touches on a computerized briefcase bomb.
          
                                    SWAN
                       What time is it?
          
                                       EARRING
                       Twenty after.
          
                                    BEARD
                       Swan, it's no use. Look, we can
                       still make Houston--
          
                                    SWAN
                       Shut up!
          
               He sets a timer, closes the briefcase, smiles.
          
          18   EXT.   SUNCREST MOTEL - DAY                                    18
          
               Sleazy area. Briefcase in hand, Earring slips out and blends
               into pedestrian traffic.
          
                                                                    11/10/97        24.
          
          
          
          
          19   EXT.   BUSY STREET - DAY                                        19
          
               Earring walks on, just a man with a briefcase.
          
          20   EXT.   ANOTHER STREET - DAY                                     20
          
               Earring slows and passes a bus stop where a group of giggly
               TEENAGE GIRLS are waiting.
          
               He notices a raven-haired KNOCKOUT going into the pub up
               ahead. He grins and follows her in.
          
          21   INT.   PUB - DAY                                                21
          
               A trendy Irish Pub, a sparse lunch crowd. Earring enters,
               spots the Knockout ordering a drink at the bar, slides onto a
               stool next to her, and deposits the briefcase on the floor.
          
                                    EARRING
                       Hey, beautiful, can I buy you some bangers and
                       mash? Pint of Guiness?
          
               She gives him a once-over, turns up her nose, nods a `thanks'
               to the Bartender delivering her white wine. Earring's smile
               doesn't change.
          
                                    EARRING (cont.)
                       Last chance. You know, even the smallest
                       choices in life could change everything.
          
                                    KNOCKOUT
                       Fuck off, pal.
          
               Earring grins and shrugs an `oh well'. He slides off the
               stool, steps back, and exits... leaving the briefcase behind.
          
               EXT.   BAR - DAY
          
               Earring walks out and strolls off. He checks his watch,
               picks up the pace. He disappears around a corner.
          
               Cars pass.   People stroll by.   Nothing happens.
          
                                                                          11/10/97    25.
          
          
          
          
               An ordinary scene on an ordinary day.     The silence is
               screaming.
          
               Suddenly - the bar EXPLODES. A FIREBALL BURSTS OUT the front
               window, showering the street with wood and BROKEN GLASS.
          
          22   EXT.   BAR - DAY - LATER                                          22
          
               Chaotic aftermath of the bombing... sirens, flashing red
               lights. Police hold back onlookers, Firemen clean up,
               Paramedics carry corpses and moaning Victims out of the
               charred, smoking ruins, into waiting ambulances.
          
               A black-and-white tears up. Capt. Winters leaps out, pushes
               through to a dirt-covered FIRE CHIEF.
          
                                    FIRE CHIEF
                       Eight dead, so far.
          
               Winters looks grim.
          
          23   AT THE BARRICADE                                                  23
          
               Reilly SCREECHES up in his Studebaker, jumps out, pushes
               through, flashes his badge, enters the police zone.
          
               He stops as he sees a bloody FEMALE VICTIM being loaded into
               an ambulance. Suddenly a voice snaps him out of it.
          
                                    PLUCHINSKY
                       What're you doing here?
          
               Reilly faces him.
          
                                    PLUCHINSKY (cont.)
                       You're offsides. Beat it.
          
               Reilly ignores them, starts towards the ruins.    Pluchinsky
               shoves him back.
          
                                    PLUCHINSKY (cont.)
                       I said get the fuck outta here.
          
                                                                  11/10/97   26.
          
          
          
          
                              REILLY
                 You touch me again and--
          
                              PLUCHINSKY
                 And what, you'll shoot me? Hey, don't mistake
                 me for one of your partners, I'd like to make
                 retirement in one piece.
          
          Pluchinsky starts to laugh as Reilly pops him once hard in
          the face. Pluchinsky staggers backwards, grasping his
          bleeding nose. Reilly is ready for more as Pluchinsky starts
          at him. They exchange a few body shots before several cops
          swarm in and pull them apart.
          
          Winters hustles over.
          
                              WINTERS
                 What the hell's going on?
          
                              PLUCHINSKY
                 Son-of-a-bitch... my nose...   This fuck-up is
                 interfering with-
          
                              WINTERS
                 Reilly, what're you doing here?
          
                              REILLY
                 Sir...
          
                              WINTERS
                 I thought I told you--
          
                              GLASS (O.C.)
                 He's with us.
          
          They all turn.
          
          Glass and T.J. stand there, soot-smeared, wearing utility
          belts.
          
                              GLASS (cont.)
                 We asked him to come.
          
                                                                11/10/97   27.
          
          
          
          
                              T.J.
                 Yeah, he's helping us work up a profile on
                 this thing.
          
                              GLASS
                 Hope you don't mind, Captain, might help us
                 catch these guys that much sooner.
                        (to Reilly)
                 Coming?
          
          Reilly looks at the Captain awkwardly.
          
                              WINTERS
                 Go ahead, kid.
          
          Reilly marches after Glass and T.J., leaving Pluchinsky
          fuming, holding closed his bloody nose.

                 Can it, Pluchinsky. And shove some cotton up
                 your nose.
          
          ANGLE - ON THE BOMB SQUAD
          
          Reilly follows Glass and T.J., bewildered.
          
                               REILLY
                 What was-?   Why...?
          
                              GLASS
                 That cop who bought it... you didn't
                 tell us he was your partner.
          
                              T.J.
                 We've lost brothers too, we know
                 what that's like.
          
                                                                     11/10/97      28.

                       Let's get something straight. We're doing you
                       a favor. You're not exactly a guy we want
                       around explosives.
          
                                      REILLY
                       What?
          
                                    GLASS
                       This isn't bumper cars, it's brain surgery.
                       You wanna work with us, you do it our way,
                       understand?
          
                                    REILLY
                       Now wait just a fucking-

                       Be cool around my men, they don't trust
                       strangers. And try not to swear so much, it's
                       unattractive.
          
               Reilly glares, tongue-tied, as they walk past the Bomb Squad
               van and Glass' Harley, enter the wreckage.

               Smoky hell. Two Firemen drag out a fire hose. Glass, T.J.
               and Reilly approach a taped-off area where Pooch is on his
               hands and knees, wet and dirty as he searchs for clues.
               Schnoz sits nearby, red ball in his mouth.
          
                                    GLASS
                       By the way, I'm Glass.   This is T.J., and

               Reilly avoids the hand.

                 sniffer. Say hi, Schnozzie.
          
          Schnoz ignores them, sniffing a charred beam in a corner.
          
          T.J. points out burn patterns to Glass.
          
                              T.J.

          Schnoz whines and paws at something under the beam.   They
          scramble over.
          
                              T.J.
                 Pooch, can you move it?
          
                              POOCH
                 I don't know...
          
          Pooch positions himself like a weight-lifter preparing to
          dead-lift. He growls as he strains to lift the beam out of
          the way. Glass and T.J. jump in and go to work with
          toothbrushes and tweezers.
          
          As Reilly watches, fascinated, they uncover a scorched
          fragment of a briefcase handle.
          
                              T.J.
                 Yes, baby, yes ...
          
          Pooch throws Schnoz the red ball.

                 Scorch marks... looks like they used
                 silly putty.
          
          Reilly looks to Glass for an explanation.

               Something glitters in the ashes. Pooch picks it up with
               tweezers. A tiny chip. The guys stare at it, puzzled.
          
                                    GLASS
                       Lemme see that.
          
               Glass takes it, puts on his magnifying spectacles, holds it
               up to the light, frowns.
          
                                    GLASS (cont.)

                       something.
          
               Pooch and T.J. go back to searching.

               Glass turns to see Reilly on his way out.
          
                                    REILLY
                       I'll get back to you.

               Phones are ringing off the hook. Reilly bursts in, notices
               Winters directing an army of cops setting up sophisticated
               tracing equipment.
          
                                    WINTERS
                       Let's go, we gotta jump on him the second he
                       calls again.
          
                                                                11/10/97   32.
          
          
          
          
          Reilly discreetly crosses the room but is intercepted by
          Pluchinsky.
          
                              PLUCHINSKY
                 You were lucky today, vice boy. Captain said
                 to leave it alone, but just remember, I'm
                 watching you.
          
                              REILLY
                 I'm sorry, detective, but you're just not my
                 type.
          
          Pluchinsky's face turns red with rage as...
          
          An OFFICER holds up a phone urgently.
          
                              OFFICER
                 Captain, it's him!
          
          The room scrambles into action as Winters grabs the phone.
          Swan's voice crackles over the squawk box.
          
                              WINTERS
                 Winters here.
          
                              SWAN'S VOICE
                 Don't make me send another.
          
                              WINTERS
                 Look, we're prepared to talk, what
                 do you want--?
          
          Click, dial tone.
          
                               WINTERS (cont.)
                 Hello?   Hello?
          
          Winters slams down the receiver. Cops pull off their tracing
          headphones, glance at each other uneasily.
          
                              WINTERS (cont.)
                 Section commanders, in my office, now.

               As the room erupts, Reilly turns to the BOOKING OFFICER.
          
                                    REILLY
                       Where's the girl? The one I brought in.
          
                                    BOOKING OFFICER
                       Upstairs, interrogation.
          
               Reilly takes off.
          
          26   INT.   POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION VIEWING BOOTH - DAY      26
          
               Wearing headphones connected to a tape recorder, a BORED COP
               flips wearily through a comic book in front of a one-way
               mirror. Through it can be seen a bare interrogation room
               where The Girl sits stubbornly at a table across from Harry.
          
               Stubbing a butt into an overflowing ashtray, Harry rubs the
               back of his neck, gets up and goes through a door, into the
               viewing booth. The Bored Cop looks up, shuts off the tape
               recorder.
          
                                   BORED COP
                       Three hours. She's tough.
          
                                   HARRY
                       Tough? Tough is "Fuck you, where's
                       my lawyer?". This chick doesn't
                       say boo.
          
               The outer door opens, Reilly walks in.
          
                                     REILLY
                       Any luck?
          
          
                                      HARRY
                       Bupkiss.    Sorry about Rice.
          
               Reilly nods, accepts the condolence.
          
                                    REILLY
                       Captain said I could give it a crack.
          
                                                                      11/10/97      34.
          
          
          
          
                                    HARRY
                       She ain't no hooker.   This is a murder
                       investigation.
          
                                    REILLY
                       She was my collar. Maybe I'll get lucky.
                       But, if you got a problem with that, talk to
                       the Captain.
          
                                    HARRY
                       I'll be in the can.
          
               Harry exits. The Bored Cop eyes Reilly suspiciously as
               Reilly crosses to the other door, yanks it open.
          
          27   INT.   INTERROGATION ROOM                                       27
          
               As Reilly enters, The Girl stiffens at the sight of him.
          
                                    REILLY
                       You remember me.
          
               Reilly shuts the door, she doesn't respond. The Girl catches
               a glimpse of his 9mm under his trenchcoat, she's unfazed. He
               paces, circling her.
          
          
          
                                    REILLY (cont.)
                       You know, your boyfriend just killed a ten
                       year old at a bus stop, blew her head clean
                       off.
          
               The Girl puts up a good front but we can see she's listening.
          
                                    REILLY (cont.)
                       You're scared. You're just caught in the
                       middle. But, we've got a guy out there
                       wasting people just to get you back. Why? It
                       can't be because of your looks. So, I'll be
                       honest with you -
          
               Reilly goes to the table, flicks off the mic.
          
                                                                     11/10/97       35.
          
          
          
          
          28   INT.   VIEWING BOOTH                                            28
          
               The Bored Cop doesn't notice, he's engrossed in his comic.
          
          29   INT.   INTERROGATION ROOM                                       29
          
               Reilly sits, the Girl eyes him like a trapped prey. They're
               enemies, yet there's a strange chemistry between them.
          
                                    REILLY
                       Let me be very clear about this. The police
                       won't let you go. When your boyfriend
                       realizes this, I have a feeling a lot of
                       innocent people are going to die. Kids,
                       families. I know you don't want that to
                       happen.
          
               She stares, eyes dark, barely registering any emotion at all.
               A flicker of fear, indecision. Her lips part, fighting it,
               then she looks away, letting the fear win. Reilly flushes
               with anger, frustration.
          
          30   INT.   THE CAVE - DAY                                           30
          
               Glass squints through a microscope. Pooch sniffs and fumbles
               dirt samples. T.J. rocks to a Walkman as he inspects the
               charred briefcase handle fragment. Bev is at her computer
               searching luggage websites on the Net.
          
               Reilly comes in, still frustrated.
          
                                    POOCH
                       We missed you, where'd you go?
          
               Before Reilly can answer, T.J. rips off his headphones.
          
                                    T.J.
                       Fuckin A, I think I got two partial

                                     POOCH
                       Awright!   How bout you, Glass, how's that chip
                       shaking?
          
                                                                11/10/97   36.
          
          
          
          
          They all look over.   Glass stares back darkly.
          
                              T.J.
                 Glass, what is it?
          
                              GLASS
                 I was wrong... this didn't come from
                 any cash register.
          
                              POOCH
                 Whadaya mean?

                 It's from an IRA.

                 A what?
          
                              T.J.
                 IRA - instant retirement account.
          
                              GLASS
                 I.R.A. device. Deadliest class of tickers in
                 existence. Computerized, multiple sensors,
                 booby traps, the works. First showed up in a
                 series of I.R.A. bombings in London couple
                 years ago. One of their boys tripped it on
                 himself and they went back to a less
                 complicated timers. The Girl, is she Irish?
          
                              REILLY
                 She's not talking. But, she could be. So,
                 obviously, you've seen one of these devices
                 before?
          
                              GLASS
                 Only once, at Redstone.
          
                                REILLY
                 Where...?
          
                                                                11/10/97   37.
          
          
          
          
                              T.J.
                 That's one more time than any of
                 the rest of us have seen it.
          
                              POOCH
                 Shit.   We're fucked.
          
                              GLASS
                 Relax, Pooch, it's just a ticker,
                 it's not personal.
          
                              T.J.
                 Let's face it, we all knew it would happen
                 sooner or later. The guy who can build a
                 mousetrap that's better than we are ...
          
                              BEV
                 Stop it...
          
                              T.J.
                        (points to Reilly)
                 And what's he doing to help?
          
                              POOCH
                 Shut up, T.J.!
          
                              BEV
                 Be nice Pooch!
          
          They all explode into a SHOUTING MATCH (except Glass who is
          in his own world inspecting the microchip an inch from his
          eyes). A moments mayhem until-
          
                              REILLY
                 All of you, shut the fuck up!
          
          They all go silent, stare at Reilly (except Glass).
          
                              REILLY (cont.)
                 No wonder the rest of the department doesn't
                 want to work with you. You're nothing but a
                 bunch of... punks.
          
                                                                           11/10/97    38.
          
          
          
          
               Reilly walks out.
          
          31   EXT.   POLICE PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON                              31
          
               Reilly goes to his Studebaker, climbs in.
          
          32   INT.   STUDEBAKER                                                  32
          
               As he starts it up, the passenger door rips open.        Glass
               jumps in, slams the door, furious.
          
                                    GLASS
                       Nice performance back there. Where'd you
                       learn that, Mike Ditka Sensitivity Seminar?
          
                                         REILLY
                       Hey, look--
          
                                    GLASS
                       No you look, mister! First, you don't go
                       calling my men names. It's bad for morale.
                       Second, us "punks" happen to know a heck of
                       alot more about police work than any vice cop
                       ever did.
          
                                      REILLY
                       Oh yeah?     Prove it.
          
                                         GLASS
                                (beat)
                       Drive.
          
               Glass glares, a challenge.         Glaring back, Reilly guns the
               engine, screeches away.
          
          33   EXT.   ALLEY - AFTERNOON                                           33
          
               The Studebaker rumbles up to the machine shop, parks in the
               same haunting spot as the night before.
          
               Glass and Reilly climb out of the car, flashlights in hand.
               Reilly glances around, bad memories stirring up.
          
                                                                      11/10/97     39.
          
          
          
          
                                    REILLY
                       The place has already be combed. Forensics
                       pulled over a hundred sets of prints inside.
          
                                    GLASS
                       Then let's go see what they missed.
          
               Pulling out a tool kit, Glass quickly picks the door lock,
               yanks open the door, ducks inside. Reilly follows.
          
          34   INT.   MACHINE SHOP - AFTERNOON                                34
          
               Nearly pitch dark inside, shafts of late afternoon sunlight
               glistens on the battered machines. Shadows wash over Reilly
               and Glass as they retrace the path Reilly and Rice took the
               night before, Glass searching intensely, Reilly getting more
               and more uncomfortable.
          
                                    GLASS
                       So what were they doing here?
          
                                    REILLY
                       I don't know. You tell me?
          
                                    GLASS
                       An abandoned machine shop... nice place to
                       build devices. Low rent, too. But, you and
                       Rice ruined their perfect hideout.
          
                                    REILLY
                       You mentioned something called Redstone.
          
                                    GLASS
                       Redstone's the army training center in Alabama
                       where they send the cream of the crop to learn
                       about tickers.
          
                                    REILLY
                       Cream of the crop, huh?   You?
          
                                                                 11/10/97   40.

                 Top of my class at West Point, thank you very
                 much. Then off to Redstone. First half of
                 the course we learned how to build devices...
                 second half, we'd take them apart. Everything
                 from firecrackers to hydrogen bombs.
          
                              REILLY
                 Sounds like terrorist heaven.
          
                              GLASS
                 There were a few guys in my class with names
                 like John Smith, Bill Jones. I'd see them up
                 ahead in the hall, call their name, but they
                 wouldn't turn around. C.I.A. Funny thing,
                 they'd always disappear after the first half
                 of the course.
          
                              REILLY
                 Just how easy is it to build a... device?
          
                              GLASS
                 With a little training, you could go into a
                 house and just from stuff in the bathroom and
                 kitchen make something that'd finish off that
                 alleged car of yours. Heck, didn't you ever
                 watch MacGyver?
          
          Reilly looks at Glass strangely until he realizes they've
          stopped where Rice died.
          
                              GLASS (cont.)
                 So this is where it happened.
          
          Reilly fights the memory... eyes well up, his hand trembles
          ever so slightly as he points out...
          
                              REILLY
                 Girl was here. The guy in charge was over

                              T.J. (cont.)
                 Boss, you're buying the next round.
          
          T.J. sets his empty Root Beer bottle on the bar.
          
                              POOCH
                 How're you guys doing?
          
                                                               11/10/97   48.
          
          
          
          
                              REILLY
                 Still waiting for a miracle.   Go ahead.
          
          Pooch and T.J. head back to the pool table where two comely
          Gals have begun putting the balls back onto the table. T.J.
          turns on his smile and chats them up.
          
                              REILLY (cont.)
                 Quite a team you've got, where'd you find
                 them?
          
                              GLASS
                 It's a small fraternity, everyone knows
                 everyone. I'm always recruiting. Pooch is ex-
                 D.O.D., military expert... claymores,
                 grenades. He played linebacker at Boston
                 College, worked a K-9 unit - that led him to
                 the Bomb Squad... great nose, lousy fingers,
                 we try to keep him away from the tickers.
                 T.J. is a heck of chemist, Texas A&M
                 engineering degree. Found him in a Militia
                 chat room - turns out we were both monitoring
                 the same groups. Bev is the natural born
                 hacker, we stole her from dispatch. She had
                 the Cave reorganized and ultra-high-tech in
                 two months. Captain has no idea how much
                 hardware she's "found" for us.
          
                              REILLY
                 You guys seem pretty tight.
          
                              GLASS
                 We've gotta be. In this business, you don't
                 exactly make alot of outside commitments.
          
                              REILLY
                 Why do you do it?
          
                              GLASS
                 I don't know, it's strange... it's not the
                 best career path, but when you get the bug,
                 there's nothing you can do about it.   See,
                 when you beat one of these things...

                              GLASS (cont.)
                 there's that one second when you realize you
                 saw something you weren't supposed to see...
                 this beautiful naked woman... Death... and
                 then the rush comes, the high, cuz you realize
                 you got away with it.
          
          T.J. returns, shrugs.
          
                              T.J.
                 Lesbians.
          
          Pooch is still with the girls, showing one of them how to
          line up a shot.
          
                              REILLY
                 Looks like Pooch's doing okay.
          
                              T.J.
                 He's married, he don't even know what a
                 lesbian is.
          
          T.J. waves over the Bartender. He and Glass orders fresh
          drinks as Reilly eyes pretty Blonde across the bar. She
          picks up two beers and grabs a pack of matches off the bar.
          
          She turns and moves to the booth in the corner.   The bodies
          part and Reilly catches a glimpse of Earring.
          
          Reilly nearly chokes on his coke as Earring takes the matches
          from the Blonde. Earring checks his watches, rises. He
          looks up and catches Reilly's eye - he smiles--then bolts.
          
          Reilly coughs up his drink and tries to get a word out,
          pointing as Earring slips out the exit door next to the
          booth.
          
          Glass pats Reilly's back as he gags, eyes blazing.
          Finally...
          
                              REILLY
                 There he goes. He was here the whole time.
          
                                                                     11/10/97       50.
          
          
          
          
               Reilly pushes his way through the crowd with Glass on his
               heels. T.J. rushes over and grabs Pooch away from the Girls
               at the pool table.
          
               Reilly runs into a pair of enormous Rednecks, spilling their
               beer on them.
          
               The Rednecks grab him by the collar and prepare to fight as
               Pooch arrives and body-blocks the Rednecks away from Reilly.
          
               Reilly is released and he continues after Earring as Pooch
               and the Rednecks mix it up.
          
               A brawl breaks out with Pooch and T.J. in the middle as
               Reilly and Glass make it to the exit door. Reilly flies out-
               but Glass FREEZES dead in his tracks. He spins back to look
               at the corner booth.
          
               THE SHOPPING BAG sits on the floor under the table.
          
               Glass tenses.
          
               The fight escalates quickly, but Pooch employs his linebacker
               skills and cuts down his assailant... and T.J. a natural
               streetfighting-rabbit-puncher. They quickly dispatch the
               Rednecks, leaving them bruised and bloodied... they rush for
               Glass and the doorway--then lock on Glass' reaction and stop.
          
          40   EXT. STREET - LATE AFTERNOON                                    40
          
               Reilly runs out into the middle of the street.
          
               At the end of the block, Earring is rushing for the corner.
          
               Reilly draws his 9mm, aims thru the pedestrian--and fires.
          
               Earring is blown off his feet...
          
               He hits the pavement hard...
          
                                                                    11/10/97       51.
          
          
          
          
          41   INT.   BAR                                                     41
          
               Reilly enters and sees Glass, TJ and Pooch gathered around
               the booth in back.
          
                                    REILLY
                       Say, thanks for the back up--
          
               The bomb squad ignores Reilly, who now realizes something is
               wrong. He pushes his way through the bar patrons to the
               booth.
          
               Glass glances up at Reilly.
          
                                    GLASS
                       He set one, the son-of-a...
          
               TJ and Pooch exchange looks--they've never heard Glass so
               close to swearing before.
          
               T.J. notices a small crowd starting to gather around the
               booth.
          
                                    T.J.
                              (calmly)
                       Clear the area, please.
          
               Nobody moves.
          
                                    REILLY
                              (loudly)
                       You heard him, get the fuck away,
                       it's a bomb!
          
               That does it, the crowds shriek and scatter.
          
               Rolling eyes at each other, the Bomb Squaders turn their
               attention to the shopping bag sitting on the floor.
          
                                     GLASS
                       Alright.   Let's assess.
          
               The team eyes the package for a moment...
          
                                                               11/10/97   52.
          
          
          
          
          Glass makes a determination, whips out a knife, slashes the
          bag open, revealing a computerized nightmare of a bomb
          inside.   T.J. rubs his temples with dread.
          
                              TJ
                 IRA.
          
          Glass puts on his magnifying spectacles, starts to probe.
          
          Reilly returns.
          
          Pooch tests hinges with his tweezers. T.J. hands Glass a
          crimp. Pooch pries off a back panel, fingers shaking, lifts
          it every so slightly, sees complex circuitry inside, the red
          glow of a digital readout counting down.
          
                              POOCH
                 Oh shit...
          
                              T.J.
                 Fuck factor ten.
          
                              GLASS
                 Okay, I'm going in, nobody breathe.
          
          Synchronizing his chronometer to the counter, Glass begins
          disengaging sensor switches.
          
                              GLASS (cont.)
                 Altimeter... choking coil... mercury switch...
          
          He clips off circuits and booby traps with bloodcurdling
          care, peeling away layer after layer of death... shakes his
          head with awe, respect, fear.
          
                              GLASS (cont.)
                 Triple V.O.M... brilliant... this guy's a
                 master...
          
          Finally he comes to the heart of the bomb, a pair of tiny
          wires leading to the blasting cap, one yellow, one red.
          Precious seconds tick away.
          
                                                                 11/10/97   53.
          
          
          
          
                              GLASS (cont.)
                 It's one of these wires.
          
                                REILLY
                 So cut both.
          
                              GLASS
                 One shuts it down, one turns arms it.
          
                              REILLY
                 Which one's which?
          
                              GLASS
                 I don't know. There's an old saying, when in
                 doubt, cut the yellow wire.
          
          Reilly gulps. The device teeters, slightly, alarming T.J.
          and Pooch. Glass nods. T.J. and Pooch each grab a corner of
          the device to steady it. Reilly follows their lead and
          kneels, goes to reach for a corner as well, one hand starts
          to tremble.
          
                              GLASS (cont.)
                 You can go back to the van if you like.
          
                              REILLY
                 No, I'm with you.
          
          Reilly focuses and wills his hands to steady.    He grabs a
          corner and closes his eyes, mind over matter.    Sweat streams
          as he concentrates like never before.
          
          Pooch and T.J. stare at the wires with intensity.
          
          15 seconds, 14, 13,... Glass pulls out a clipper.
          
          12, 11, 10... He eases the clipper into position.
          
          9, 8, 7... He draws in a breath.
          
          Closing his eyes, he clips the yellow wire.    Reilly's eyes
          snap open.
          
                                                                     11/10/97       54.
          
          
          
          
               The counter stops on 4 - no explosion.
          
               Pooch and T.J. whoop and hug like drunk madmen.   Glass steps
               away, stone-faced. Reilly follows him, wobbly.

               Two squad cars have appeared, Officers cordon off the crime
               scene.
          
               Glass watches Reilly kneeling over Earring's body digging
               through Earring's pockets, finding nothing but cash,
               cigarettes and matches.

                         Nothing. Nothing traceable.
          
               INT BAR
          
               Pooch and T.J. have the device on the ground a few feet away
               from the Earring's body. They delicately continue to take it
               apart so it can be transported safely. Schnoz sits nearby,
               watching. Pooch is on the phone with his wife...
          
                                      POOCH
                         I don't know, honey. I'll see. No,
                         everything's fine, it was nothing.
          
               As he says this, he lifts a chunk of C4 and sets it aside.
               Pooch hangs up his phone.

                                   POOCH (cont.)
                      You guys hungry? The wife's got a heap of
                      lasagna leftover.
          
                                   T.J.
                             (at Reilly)
                      What do ay say?
          
                                   GLASS
                      Meg's lasagna. Good eats, Reilly.      C'mon.
          
               Glass notes Reilly's hands.
          
                                   GLASS (cont.)
                      Good meal would go a long way to steady your
                      system.
          
                                   REILLY
                      Got work to do, don't we?
          
               Pooch scribbles down an address on a scrap of paper from the
               device's shopping bag, hands it to Reilly, offering a smile.
          
                                   POOCH
                      In case you change your mind.
          
               Reilly looks at it awkwardly, then walks away as a News van
               arrives on the scene...
          
          43   EXT./INT. DOWNTOWN - STUDEBAKER - EARLY EVENING                43
          
               Reilly cruises into the bowels of downtown.    Makes a few
               turns and parks.
          
               In the shadows of a burned out building, Reilly observes
               several JUNKIES getting a fix from their CONNECTION.
          
               Reilly watches with scared, tempted eyes.
          
               He looks at his hands... they're trembling... catches his
               reflection in the rear view mirror. Checks Rice's watches on
               his wrist, taps it. Still not ticking. Ashamed, he
               screeches away.
          
                                                                      11/10/97     56.
          
          
          
          
          44   INT. POLICE STATION - OFFICE - NIGHT                           44
          
               A quiet Squad Room. Reilly bangs out something on a computer
               terminal. He blazes away, typing as fast as he can. He
               holds out his hands. Almost steady. He takes a drink from a
               Protein Shake, returns to typing.
          
          45   INT.   WINTERS' OFFICE - NIGHT                                 45
          
               A weary Winters looks up from coffee and paperwork as Reilly
               knocks, walks in. Reilly drops a sheaf of papers on his
               desk.
          
                                      WINTERS
                       What's this?
          
                                    REILLY
                       Report on the case so far.
          
                                    WINTERS
                       You know after a shooting I would normally
                       take your badge and weapon, but Glass called
                       in already and confirmed it was clean.
          
                                      REILLY
                       Yes, sir.
          
                                    WINTERS
                       But from now on, any leads on this case go to
                       Pluchinsky. He's primary investigator and you
                       are unofficially assigned to the Bomb Squad...
                       you and your new friends are not to be playing
                       detective any more. Got it?
          
               Reilly nods, accepting.
          
                                    WINTERS (cont.)
                       I imagine as soon as they find out one of
                       their's is dead, we'll be getting another
                       call. So get some sleep, alright.
          
               Reilly nods, turns and exits.
          
                                                                       11/10/97    57.
          
          
          
          
          46   INT.   SUNCREST MOTEL - ROOM - NIGHT                           46
          
               TIGHT on a TV - a pretty Reporter reports live from the
               scene...
          
                                    REPORTER
                       To recap, a gunman carrying what police
                       described as a phony bomb was shot and killed
                       less than an hour ago.
          
               THE ROOM
          
               Swan watches the TV report with Beard, eyes narrowing as he
               sees Reilly in the crowd behind the Reporter.
          
                                    REPORTER (cont.)
                       While the man's motives and identity remain a
                       mystery, police are denying the incident is
                       related to the explosion that ripped through a
                       bar earlier today, killing 15 and wounding
                       more than 30...
          
               Swan kicks in the TV, destroying it.
          
                                     BEARD
                       She talked.
          
               Swan flips open a suitcase full of bomb-making materials and
               begins to sort through...
          
          47   EXT.   POOCH'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                   47
          
               Quiet, cozy, middle class. The Harley and the Bomb Squad van
               are parked out front. Also the Studebaker.
          
          48   INT.   POOCH'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT                         48
          
               Reilly exits the bathroom, returns to the dining room where
               the Bomb Squad is laughing, hoeing and haying over dessert.
               Pooch's faithful wife, MEG, pours coffee. TOMMY and JANIE,
               Pooch's kids, sit on Pooch's and T.J.'s knees, in their
               pajamas.
          
                                                               11/10/97   58.
          
          
          
          
                              MEG
                 More coffee, T.J.?
          
                              T.J.
                 No thanks, Meg. Hawed Pooch ever get so
                 lucky?
          
                               MEG
                 Mr. Reilly?
          
                               REILLY
                 Mike.   No thanks, I'm fine.
          
                              POOCH
                 Time for bed, kiddos.   Say goodnight.
          
                              TOMMY
                 Can Uncle Teej tuck us in?
          
                              T.J.
                 C'mon, champ, I'll even give you
                 a piggyback.
          
                              JANIE
                        (to Glass, Reilly)
                 Goodnight Uncle Charlie, goodnight Uncle Mike.
          
          Janie surprises Reilly with a shy kiss, scurries upstairs
          with after Pooch, T.J. and Tommy.
          
                               REILLY
                 `Night...
          
          Meg clears the dishes, Schnoz is asleep on the floor. Glass
          and Reilly are left alone.   Reilly takes a sip of coffee,
          hand trembles ever so slightly.
          
                              GLASS
                 How long were you hooked?
          
                               REILLY
                 What?
          
                                                                 11/10/97   59.
          
          
          
          
                              GLASS
                 You don't have to talk about it.
          
          Reilly stares, then opens up slowly.
          
                              REILLY
                 Pittsburgh, two years ago. Partner died, no
                 back-up, I was too gung-ho. As usual.
          
                              GLASS
                 Take a tip from the Bomb Boys, always assess,
                 if only for a second.
          
                              REILLY
                 I know. I was working a drug ring, deep
                 cover. Played the part too well. When they
                 pulled me out, I wasn't a cop anymore. My
                 fiance had dumped me. Next thing I knew, I
                 was out here on the street, doped up,
                 auditioning for the morgue when this tough old
                 vice cop found me, cleaned me up, gave me a
                 second chance. He promised Captain Winters
                 he'd look out for me.
          
                              GLASS
                 Your partner?
          
                              REILLY
                        (nods sadly)
                 I guess I didn't realize how much I needed
                 him. He kept me straight. It's been tough
                 every second since.
          
          Reilly holds up his wristwatch.
          
                              REILLY (cont.)
                 This was his. Doesn't work for shit, but it's
                 keeping me straight.
          
                               GLASS
                 Let me see.
          
                                                                    11/10/97       60.
          
          
          
          
               Reilly gives him the watch. Glass pulls out a mini tool kit,
               pries off the back of the watch examines the works.
          
                                    GLASS (cont.)
                       Main spring's stuck. All you have to do is
                       free the palate and realign the balance wheel.
                       Here, you try.
          
                                    REILLY
                       I terrible with mechanical things.
          
                                    GLASS
                       No you're not, you just don't understand them.
                       Here, do what I tell you.
          
               He holds out the mini-kit. Reilly takes it uncertainly, but
               follows Glass' instructions.
          
                                    GLASS (cont.)
                       Okay, first push the pin back with this.
                       Good. Now while you keep it there, stick this
                       in here and turn it slowly. Easy, that's it.
                       Now let the pin go and line up the wheel.
                       That should do it.
          
               Reilly gives it a tweak, looks at the watch, surprised.
          
                                    REILLY
                       It's working.
          
                                    GLASS
                       Congratulations, you just built your
                       first ticker.
          
               Reilly throws Glass a surprised look.

               Sunrise breaking. Reilly and Glass have their heads under
               the hood of the Studebaker, covered in grease, tools
               everywhere. T.J. sits behind the wheel. Pooch and Schnoz
               stumble out of the house to watch.
          
                                                                    11/10/97        61.
          
          
          
          
                                   REILLY
                      Okay, hit it.
          
               T.J. guns the engine, the Studebaker purrs like a tiger.
          
                                      GLASS
                      Alright!
          
                                   T.J.
                      We've created a monster.
          
               Glass glances at Pooch.
          
                                      GLASS
                      Any word?
          
                                     POOCH
                      Nothing.    Maybe they gave up, split town.
          
                                   REILLY
                      Don't bet on it.

          51   INT. THE CAVE - MORNING                                         51
          
               Reilly enters to find Glass, Bev, T.J. and Pooch busy at work
               at each of their work stations. Glass moves over to watch
               Bev's computer screen.
          
                                   REILLY
                      How's the print coming?
          
                                   BEV
                      One partial from the handle matches the
                      suspect from last night. Name's Carl Taylor.
                      Long record of arson, assault, the works. The
                      other print - we got nothing from our data
                      base or the FBI or CIA... still waiting for
                      Interpol.
          
                                                                    11/10/97        62.
          
          
          
          
                                    REILLY
                       Damn.
          
               Bev enters another command... the computer goes to work as
               she turns to Reilly.
          
                                    BEV
                       Coffee, Mike?
          
                                    REILLY
                       No thanks, Bev.
          
               She smiles warmly. He smiles back, T.J. eyes them, slightly
               jealous of the moment.
          
               A phone rings.   Bev answers it...
          
                                     BEV
                       Yes, sir.   He's here.   I'll tell him.
          
               Bev hangs up the phone.
          
                                    BEV (cont.)
                       Mike, Captain wants to see you
                       right away.
          
               Reilly heads for the door.
          
          52   INT.   POLICE HEADQUARTERS - MORNING                            52
          
               A strange, uncomfortable silence hangs over the squad room as
               Reilly weaves past cops smoking, drinking coffee, waiting.
               They all stare at him. Especially Pluchinsky.
          
          53   INT.   WINTERS' OFFICE - MORNING                                53
          
               Reilly walks in. Winters gestures for him to take a seat as
               he talks on the phone.
          
                                    WINTERS
                       Yes ... no, of course not but ... yes,
                       sir, I understand.
          
                                                               11/10/97   63.
          
          
          
          
          Winters hangs up.
          
                              WINTERS (cont.)
                 I got a call from upstairs. They say you
                 questioned the girl.
          
                                REILLY
                 Yes, sir.
          
                              WINTERS
                 She's refused to say a word to anyone. What
                 made you think you could get her to talk?
          
                                 REILLY
                 I didn't.     But I had to try.
          
                              WINTER
                 Reilly, I think I've shown that I'm a patient
                 man. Rice was your biggest fan and I've tried
                 to honor him by giving you some slack. But
                 you are very close to running out of slack.
          
                                REILLY
                 Yes, sir.
          
          Winters lets this sink in, then holds up Reilly's report.
          
                              WINTERS
                 I read your report. Impressive. I'd say it's
                 got detective written all over it. But... you
                 cross the line one more time... you're gone.
                 Are we clear?
          
          Reilly, nods, shifts uncomfortably.
          
                              WINTERS (cont.)
                 Now, that out of the way. The girl wants to
                 talk to you, alone.
          
          Reilly is shocked.
          
                              WINTERS (cont.)
                 So get going, let's close this thing.
          
                                                                       11/10/97    64.
          
          
          
          
                                    REILLY
                       Yes, sir.
          
               Reilly bolts off.
          
          54   INT.   POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY               54
          
               Reilly enters to find Harry and the Girl waiting for him.
               Harry looks the Girl over, nods at Reilly.
          
                                    HARRY
                       I'll be outside.
          
               Reilly nods, Harry exits.     Reilly sits down at the table
               opposite her.
          
                                    THE GIRL
                       Hello.
          
                                    REILLY
                       Hello.
          
                                    THE GIRL (MARY)
                       My name is Mary Jordan. We were hired to take
                       out some industrial sites. Insurance.
          
                                    REILLY
                       But they weren't all insured.
          
                                    MARY
                       Cover.
                              (slowly, ashamed)
                       It was suppose to be abandoned buildings,
                       y'know. No one was suppose to get hurt. The
                       night you busted us...We were checking to make
                       sure there weren't any vagrants around. Scare
                       them away.
          
                                    REILLY
                       Who is he?
          
                                                                     11/10/97        65.
          
          
          
          
                                    MARY
                       Alex Swan. My brother.
                       The other two are called Taylor and
                       Leveau.
          
                                    REILLY
                       Taylor's dead.
          
               She seems relieved.
          
                                    REILLY (cont.)
                       Where are they, Mary?
          
          
               Mary takes a deep breath, eyes welling.
          
                                    MARY
                       There is a motel downtown, near the Machine
                       Shop... the Suncrest. Room 138.
          
                                     REILLY
                       Thank you.
          
                                    MARY
                       He's my brother...
          
               Reilly rises and moves to her.   Their eyes linger a moment, a
               bond between them.
          
                                    REILLY
                       Then why tell me?
          
                                    MARY
                       People are dying.
          
               Reilly nods and touches her shoulder, a light squeeze.   He
               turns and exits.
          
          55   EXT.   SUNCREST MOTEL - ROOM 138 - DAY                           55
          
               An army of cops and squad cars out front, Pluchinsky silently
               directs a SWAT team to the door. Reilly and the Bomb Squad
               watch from a distance as they break down the door.
          
                                                                 11/10/97   66.
          
          
          
          
          SHOUTING, mayhem as the team floods into the room.
          Pluchinsky brings up the rear. After a beat, Pluchinsky re-
          emerges, shaking his head.
          
          AT THE FAR END OF THE MOTEL
          
          Swan and Beard watch from behind a car. Beard gives Swan a
          dirty look and they quietly move off around the corner.
          
          AT THE BOMB SQUAD VAN
          
          Reilly and Glass are visibly disappointed.
          
          As the others grumble about it, Reilly notices someone across
          the street - the Bag Lady with the pie-tin crown, holding her
          hand out to a MAN getting into his car. The Man ignores her,
          screeches off. The Bag Lady scribbles down his license
          number in her pad. Glass follows Reilly's stare.
          
                              GLASS
                 Ex-girlfriend?
          
                              REILLY
                 Be right back.
          
          Reilly crosses the street, intercepts the Bag Lady as she's
          pushing her cart away.
          
                              REILLY (cont.)
                 Excuse me... I'm looking for two men who were
                 staying at the hotel over there - one has a
                 beard, the other's tall, thin. You wouldn't
                 happen to have seen them, would you?
          
                              BAG LADY
                 No.
          
                              REILLY
                 No, of course not... well, thanks
                 anyway. Here you go, Your Highness.
          
          He fishes some change out of his pocket, hands it over,
          starts away.
          
                                                                      11/10/97    67.
          
          
          
          
                                    BAG LADY
                       On second thought, maybe I did.
          
               He turns back. The Bag Lady flips through her pad, stabs an
               entry with her finger.
          
                                    BAG LADY
                       Lemme see... yeah, here it is, 11:18 this
                       morning. Very disrespectful. He used to
                       drive a van, but he got a new car. You want
                       the license number?
          
               She tears off the page, holds it out.
          
                                    REILLY
                       You're beautiful!
          
               Reilly gives her a big kiss, races back to the Bomb Squad
               who've been watching.
          
                                    REILLY
                       We're back in business!
          
               They all look at him like he's nuts.
          
          56   INT.   POLICE SQUAD ROOM - DAY                                56
          
               Buzzing with action.   Harry and Pluchinsky attack Winters
               with printouts.
          
                                    HARRY
                       Ran the license plate - car was rented early
                       this morning from a Hertz office downtown.
          
                                    PLUCHINSKY
                       Alex Swan - demolitions expert, trained at
                       Redstone, dropped out, freelanced in the
                       middle East for awhile, then disappeared, no
                       criminal record. The other one, Leveau, is
                       French Canadian, he's a mercenary, record in
                       half a dozen countries.
          
                                                                     11/10/97      68.

                       Get out an APB, now!
          
               Harry moves off to the DISPATCHER as a fax machine comes to
               life on the desk next to PLUCHINSKY. A fax spews out...
          
               "WINTERS.   LET HER GO NOW... OR A BOMB'S COMING CLOSE TO
               HOME."
          
                                    WINTERS (cont.)

               Cops race to their cars. An armada of black-and-whites
               scream out of the parking lot. Winters appears and jumps
               into his Ford Sedan and tears out.

               Squad cars roar up and down the streets.
          
               Two cars are parked out in front of one house in particular.
          
          59   INT. POLICE STATION - SQUAD ROOM - DAY                         59
          
               In the squad room, Pluchinsky and some men wait anxiously by
               phones, computer-consoles, radio switchboard.
          
                                                                     11/10/97     69.

               Reilly idles in his Studebaker. T.J. and Pooch come out of
               the parking lot in the Bomb Squad Van, Glass motors along
               side Reilly. He guns the bike and takes the lead, followed
               by Reilly, then the van.
          
               They pull out into traffic and head towards the suburbs.
          
          61   EXT. STREET - DAY                                             61
          
               Beard drives, Swan rides shotgun.   A briefcase lies on the
               seat between them.
          
               As he makes a left, Beard notices the Bomb Squad Van coming
               the other direction.
          
                                   BEARD
                      We've got company.
          
               Swan whirls, pulls a gun as Glass and Reilly pass them.
          
               Reilly double-takes...
          
          62   INT. STUDEBAKER                                               62
          
               Reilly grabs his radio mic, yells into it...
          
                                   REILLY
                      Glass, there they are. Pooch right in front
                      of you, you got `em, you got `em.
          
          63   EXT. STREET - DAY                                             63
          
               Reilly SKIDS to a dead stop. Glass, up ahead tries to
               maneuver around slowing cars as...
          
               The Grenada speeds down a street right in front of the Bomb
               Squad Van.
          
               Pooch cranks into a turn and gives chase. Reilly and Glass
               are pinned in by other cars. They both finally squeeze out
               of their jams in different directions...
          
                                                                    11/10/97        70.

               An excited T.J. jumps on the radio.
          
                                   T.J.
                      Dispatch, this is Bomb Squad. Suspects

               Beard speeds around another corner, the lumbering Van has
               difficulty keeping up and loses sight of the Grenada for a
               moment.
          
          66   EXT. ANOTHER STREET - DAY                                       66
          
               The Grenada speeds up, heading towards the Police Station up
               ahead.
          
               The Bomb Squad Van appears and speeds up.
          
               ON THE SIDEWALK
          
               Swan stands discreetly in a phone booth, watching as...
          
               ON THE STREET
          
               Beard steers towards a parked Squad Car next to the Station -
               on collision course. At the last second, Beard dives from the
               moving car, hits the pavements and rolls.
          
               The Grenada CRASHES into the Squad Car... but no explosion.
          
               The Bomb Squad Van SKIDS to a stop as two uniformed Officers
               rush out of the Station.
          
               Beard has rolled to his feet and is now sprinting off down
               the street.
          
                                                               11/10/97   71.
          
          
          
          
          Pooch and T.J. jump out of the Van (leaving a BARKING Schnoz
          inside) and sprint towards the Grenada, guns drawn. Pooch is
          quickly huffing and puffing. T.J. continues after Beard as
          Pooch moves towards the Grenada. The uniforms follow T.J.
          
          Glass on his Harley appears from behind the Van. At the far
          end of the street the Studebaker rumbles into view, followed
          by a Squad Car, lights flashing. Everyone closing in on
          Beard.
          
          T.J. aims and yells at Beard.
          
                              T.J.
                 Police, freeze!
          
          Beard whirls around, SPRAYING automatic weapon FIRE at T.J.
          and the Uniforms - they hit the pavement.
          
          A few nearby Pedestrians SCREAM and drop to the ground.
          
          Reilly jumps out of his Studebaker as Beard turns his FIRE on
          him, BLOWING OUT his windshield.
          
          Back at the Grenada, Pooch ducks for cover by the open
          driver's door.
          
          Glass runs his Harley behind a parked car.
          
          The Squad Car behind Reilly SKIDS to a stop and as Beard
          shifts his aim, T.J. and Reilly each PUMP TWO SHOTS into
          Beard's torso.
          
          Beard spins around, drops - dead silence on the street.
          Relief all around. Everyone stands back up. T.J.'s jaw
          drops at the sight of actually having hit the suspect with
          his bullets.
          
          AT THE GRENADA
          
          Pooch exhales in relief, then hears BEEPING coming from the
          front seat of the car. He looks in to see the briefcase
          open, countdown ticking away.
          
                                                                      11/10/97      72.
          
          
          
          
                                     POOCH
                       Oh... damn.
          
               KA-BOOOOOM!!!
          
               The Grenada explodes in a massive FIRE-BALL, throwing nearby
               Glass off his feet. Everyone else drops back to the ground,
               covering their heads.
          
               DOWN THE STREET - AT THE PHONE BOOTH
          
               Swan grins and walks away down an alley.
          
               We can hear the CRY of Schnoz, WAILING from the front seat of
               Van.
          
          67   INT.   POLICE STATION - WINTERS' OFFICE - EARLY EVENING         67
          
               Reilly stares off into space. Surreal silence, like a
               dream... Reilly looks at his watch, keeps his eyes low as he
               steals a glance at Glass in the other chair, face wracked
               with pain, loss.
          
               They both look through the glass office at the squad room
               outside, the sounds of reality fade in... phones ringing,
               voices shouting... a tense, chaotic emergency atmosphere.
          
               Reilly and Glass rise as Winters walks in, closes the door.
          
               He sits behind his desk, lights a cigarette.
          
                                    WINTERS
                       Glass, sorry about Pooch, he was a good man.
                       We don't have time to give you a break right
                       now, we're going ahead and-
          
                                    REILLY
                       My God, you're going to use her, aren't you?
          
                                    WINTERS
                              (ignoring Reilly)
                       Glass, you're to stand by with your team.
          
                                                                      11/10/97     73.
          
          
          
          
                                   REILLY
                      I promised her she'd be safe.
          
                                   WINTERS
                      It's our only option.
          
                                   REILLY
                      It won't work, he'll know it's a trap...
          
                                   WINTERS
                      Reilly, you're done for now. What the hell
                      were you thinking directing the Bomb Squad
                      Team into hot pursuit. They had no business-
          
                                   REILLY
                      I know.
          
                                   WINTERS
                      You've been at the center of two suspect
                      fatalities and two Police Officer fatalities.
                      I'll need your badge and your weapon.
          
               Reilly looks at Glass, there'll be no stepping in this time.
               He glares at Winters, reaches into his jacket, pulls out the
               badge and tosses it on Winter's desk. He pulls out his 9mm,
               pops out the clip and open the chamber, sets it down.
          
          68   INT. POLICE STATION - SQUAD ROOM - EARLY EVENING               68
          
               Reilly and Glass trudge out, both profoundly disturbed as
               they head across the squad room. Glass veers off.
          
                                   REILLY
                      Glass--!
          
               Reilly stares, eyes wet, watching him disappear.
          
               Glancing over, he notices Bev and T.J. sitting with Meg down
               the hall, Tommy and Janie asleep in her lap. Schnoz walks up
               to Meg, whimpering.   Bev wraps her arm around her. T.J.
               puts his hand on Bev's shoulder.
          
                                                                       11/10/97      74.
          
          
          
          
               Pluchinsky brushes roughly past Reilly, snapping him out of
               it. He turns, walks dejectedly out.
          
                                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

               An armored van screeches up. Doors fly open. Metro SWAT
               Team jumps out with equipment, helmets, rush into the
               building.
          
          70   INT.   POLICE STATION - SQUAD ROOM - MORNING                     70
          
               Thundering silence. Winters and his men wait by phones.
               Their watches tick. So does the clock on the wall. Nothing.
               SWAT Team Captain BENSON, huddles with his men.
          
               A phone rings, shattering the quiet.   Harry answers it, holds
               it up urgently.
          
                                     HARRY
                       It's him!
          
               Winters takes it. A new high-tech TRACER flicks on a new
               piece of equipment.
          
                                    WINTERS

               Swan's voice comes over the squawk box, growling low.
          
                                    SWAN'S VOICE

               Click, dial tone.
          
               Winters flashes a look at the Tracer.   The Tracer yanks off
               his headphones in utter frustration.
          
                                    WINTERS
                              (to his men)
                       Okay, let's move!
          
               The room erupts into action. Benson and the SWAT Team are
               the first ones out the door...
          
          71   EXT.   ALLEY - DAY                                              71
          
               Hauntingly familiar. An unmarked police car pulls up and
               stops behind the machine shop.
          
          72   EXT./INT. ALLEY - CAR                                           72
          
               Harry sits behind the wheel.    Mary sits in the back,
               handcuffed to Pluchinsky.
          
               Pluchinsky unlocks the cuffs.   Mary's eyes flare
          
                                                                    11/10/97        76.

                      Get out and go to the machine shop -
          
          
               Mary steps out of the car. She glances around--then heads in
               the opposite direction of the Machine Shop. Pluchinsky
               curses. He starts to go after her, but realizes he'd better
               clear the area. He peals out.
          
          73   EXT. STREET - DAY                                               73
          
               Undercover Men in various disguises track her from cars, and
               on foot, communicating by hidden mics. A WINO eyes her
               carefully, lifts a bottle to his mouth and whispers...
          
                                   WINO
                      She's out of the bag.
          
               Mary exits the alley onto the street, searching where to go.
               She turns down the street and moves fast, eyes darting about.
          
          74   EXT. STREET                                                     74
          
               The SWAT van is tucked into an alley...
          
               INSIDE THE SWAT VAN
          
               Winters, Benson and Team monitor the radio communication.
          
                                   WINO (O.C.)

               Mary crosses the street, a Camero nearly clips her. She
               makes it safely to the sidewalk and passes a TRUCK DRIVER
               eating a hot dog. After she moves off...
          
                                    TRUCK DRIVER
                              (speaks into sleave)
                      Six.   She's crossing to Main.
          
                                                                        11/10/97      77.
          
          
          
          
               Mary looks around quickly, blends into a crowd coming out of
               a store and ducks inside.
          
                                   TRUCK DRIVER (cont.)
                      She just went into a department store.    She's
                      out of sight.

               Winters grabs the mic...
          
                                   WINTERS
                      Seal the building!

                      Let's move.
          
               The SWAT van RUMBLES to life.
          
          77   INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY                                       77
          
               Mary bolts through the store, ducks through a service door.
          
          78   EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - SERVICE ENTRANCE - ALLEY - DAY            78
          
               Mary bursts out, runs like a spooked horse.
          
               As she dashes to the mouth of the the alley, she runs smack
               into the Camaro that almost hit her. It SCREECHES to a stop.
               The passenger door flies open.
          
               Mary leans down and looks in, flushes. It's Swan.    He
               reaches over and yanks her inside, TEARS away.
          
               The Truck Driver runs into the other end of the alley.
          
               He starts to give chase as Swan tosses a small package out of
               the car. The Truck Driver dives for cover as...
          
               KA-BOOOOM!!!   A dumpster EXPLODES.   The Truck Driver jumps to
               his feet...
          
                                                                    11/10/97        78.

               From every direction, unmarked cars, squad units and the SWAT
               Van converge on the area.

               Swan drives with deadly confidence, glances at Mary tenderly.
          
                                     SWAN
                       You okay?

                       I know.   I warned them.
          
               He swerves left, then right, pulling a transmitter out of his
               pocket.
          
                                    MARY
                       What is that?

                       Security.
          
               He sets a dial to 10, pushes a button.
          
               The transmitter counts down... 9, 8, 7...
          
                                                                      11/10/97     79.

               The Camaro tears down a one-way alley going the wrong way.
          
               INTERCUT WITH TRANSMITTER COUNTDOWN - 6, 5, 4...
          
               Undercover vehicles race after the Camero, seconds behind.
          
               5, 4, 3 ...
          
               They swerve into the alley.
          
               Then just as Swan whooshes out, a charge EXPLODES a stack of
               55 gallon drums. They fall down into the path of the
               pursuers who crash into the FLAMING DRUMS.
          
               The lead car EXPLODES...

               Drunk, dejected, looking like shit, Reilly waits for a fix
               with a couple other JUNKIES. The TV in the bar drones in the
               background.
          
               The Dealer appears and gestures to Reilly.

                       C'mon, cowboy, you're next.
          
               Reilly trudges over.
          
                                    DEALER
                       Okay, what's it gonna be? I got China White,
                       Snow Flake, Ivory Pearl...

               Reilly looks up sharply as he hears the TV, visible through
               the doorway.

                       that latest, explosion that ripped through a
                       downtown alley less than half an hour ago.
          
               Something clears behind Reilly' eyes.
          
                                    DEALER

                       Despite growing fears and talk of a coverup,
                       police have sealed off the area and are
                       refusing to comment about fatalities, or the
                       rumor that terrorists may be involved.
          
               Reilly's eyes shift, mind racing.
          
                                    DEALER
                       Hey, I'm talking to you--
          
               Suddenly himself again, Reilly bolts up, sending the Dealer
               and his equipment scattering, and streaks off. He bursts out
               of the front door of the bar into the glare of sunlight... we
               can hear SIRENS not too far off.

               Driving like a maniac as usual, Reilly grabs the radio mike
               with one hand, pulls his back-up .357 out of the glove-box.
          
               He listens out the window for the SIRENS, he looks up at the
               sound of approaching HELICOPTERS.

               In the service bay, a MECHANIC raises the black Camaro on a
               hydraulic lift, out of sight from the street.
          
                                                                       11/10/97    81.
          
          
               Out front, Swan pays an ATTENDANT, climbs into an orange U-
               Haul truck with Mary, drives off.
          
               A beat, a squad car and an unmarked speed past the Gas
               Station.

               Swan brushes Mary's hair from her face.
          
                                      SWAN
                      You hungry?     We could get something to eat.
          
               Mary shakes her head, scared.
          
                                   SWAN
                      What's the matter?
          
                                   MARY
                      Nothing... just tired.
          
               She forces a smile. Swan frowns suspiciously as he turns
               down a service road, pulls into...

                      We're moving' on. I have to pick up the
                      supplies. Just two little boxes.
          
               Mary turns white.
          
                                    MARY
                      No...   No more killing.
          
                                      SWAN
                      Stay here.
          
                                                                  11/10/97   82.
          
          
          
          
                              MARY
                 Alex, please.
          
                              SWAN
                 Stay in the truck.
          
          He gets out, disappears into the building.
          
          Mary glances around desperately, sees a phone booth at the
          corner. She looks back at the warehouse, the phone again,
          terrified.
          
          LOADING DOCK
          
          Yanking her door open, Mary dashes to the booth, searches her
          pockets. Empty. She dials zero... it rings and rings, then
          finally...
          
                              OPERATOR (O.C.)
                 Operator.
          
                              MARY
                 Get me the police!
          
                              OPERATOR (O.C.)
                 Is this an emergency?
          
                              MARY
                 Yes! Please, hurry!
          
          Mary's back is to the warehouse as she waits forever.
          
                              SERGEANT'S VOICE
                 Police, Sergeant Doyle speaking.
          
                              MARY
                 Please, I need help, my name is--
          
                              SERGEANT DOYLE'S VOICE
                 Whoa, slow down, lady. Now what's
                 that again?
          
                                                                11/10/97   83.
          
          
          
          
          Suddenly Mary sees the reflection of a face in the phone
          booth glass. She whirls - Swan is standing behind her!
          
                              SWAN
                 Who are you calling, sis?
          
                                MARY
                 What?    Nobody, I-
          
          She tries to hang up.   Swan grabs the receiver.
          
                              MARY
                 Alex, please-
          
                               SWAN
                 Shut up!
                        (into phone)
                 Who is this?
          
                              SERGEANT DOYLE'S VOICE
                 Sergeant Doyle, Metro P.D. Look, what's going
                 on--?
          
          Swan's eyes turn cold, SLAMS down the phone.
          
                               MARY
                 Help!
          
          Swan grabs Mary, dragging her with him.   A pair of TEENAGE
          BOYS on skateboards notice, veer over.
          
                               BOY
                 Hey--?
          
          Swan whips out his Mac-11. The Boys skate for cover as Swan
          drags Mary back to the U-Haul.
          
          The open back door reveals a number of 55 gallon drums, some
          boxes and two milk crates of C4. He SLAMS down the sliding
          door, moves around front and shoves Mary inside.
          
                                                                       11/10/97     84.

               Caught in traffic, map spread out in his lap, Reilly slams on
               his horn.
          
                                    REILLY
                       C'mon, move it.
          
               His police radio crackles.

                       Suspect is a Caucasian male, armed with an

                       female hostage in a U-Haul truck ...
          
               Reilly perks up, checks his map.
          
               Jamming the wheel, he crashes out of traffic, ripping the
               bumper off the car in front of him, and rockets away.
          
               He grabs his mic, thinks, disguises his voice.

               Rounding the rear of a huge glass luxury hotel, Reilly
               catches a glimpse of orange disappear around a corner.

               Reilly throws down his mic, aims at the alley ahead and
               speeds up, then cranks into the alley, SCREECHES to a stop.

               The U-Haul barrels down the alley. Swan sees Reilly up ahead
               get out of his car and aim his .357
          
               Swan SLAMS on the brakes. Throws the vehicle into reverse.
               Checks his mirror to see the Bomb Squad Van appear at the end
               of the alley. He's completely pinned in.
          
               Glass and T.J. jump out, they are in bullet-proof vest,
               aiming shotguns, using the van as a shield. Bev jumps out
               with Schnoz and slips behind the van entirely.

          Reilly throws done the mic, takes aim again.
          
          THE U-HAUL
          
          idles.   Swan's rage erupts.       He climbs out with Mary in tow.
          
          ALLEY
          
          Reilly aims carefully...
          
          Swan keeps his Mac-11 to Mary's head. Reilly is frozen by the
          move. Swan backs to the rear of the van. He slides up the
          door, revealing the drums and explosives to the Bomb Squad.
          He reaches in and grabs a remote control.
          
          SIRENS are coming closer, only a block or two away...

          ALLEY
          
                                REILLY
                          (yelling)
                   Glass, you guys take cover, goddammit!
          
                                SWAN
                   I want out, right now.      Or the whole city
                   block is gone.
          
                                                                11/10/97   89.
          
          
          
          
                              GLASS
                 Reilly, he's got enough to do it.
          
          Reilly leaves the cover of his car and scurries along the
          side of the alley, escaping Swan's view.
          
          Swan rages.   He moves around the van, pulling Mary along.
          
          Swan SPRAYS a FLURRY of bullets over Reilly's head... Reilly
          dives for cover as bullets rip the alley wall inches from his
          face.
          
          Swan whirls and SPRAYS the Bomb Squad Van, dropping T.J. with
          a shot to the leg. Bev drops to his aid. Glass grimaces,
          having been hit in the shoulder.
          
          Reilly moves forward about to take the shot.
          
                              GLASS (cont.)
                 Reilly, don't. He's got a pressure switch.
                 He releases it, we're done for.
          
          Swan turns back to Reilly, rams his Mac-11 to her throat.
          
                               SWAN
                 Drop it.
          
                              MARY
                        (to Reilly)
                 Take him!
          
          Mary jerks away from Swan.
          
          Reilly fast FIRES.
          
          Swan takes Reilly's SHOTS in the chest. He smiles as he
          starts to fall, his hand starts to open up to release the
          detonator...
          
          Mary dives onto Swan and grabs at the remote, clasping it in
          her hands. Swan collapses, Mary on top of him.
          
                                                                11/10/97   90.
          
          
          
          
          Reilly and Glass sprint at the U-Haul, reaching a trembling,
          bleeding Mary.
          
          She clinches her jaw, fighting the grief, holding on to the
          remote.
          
          Reilly reaches Mary first and puts his hands over her's - she
          looks up into his eyes--distraught.
          
                              GLASS
                 Hold on to that thing tight.
          
          Glass goes to the explosives and looks over the set-up.
          
                              GLASS (cont.)
                 Jesus Fucking H. Christ...
          
          Reilly has never heard Glass swear before...
          
                                 REILLY
                 Fuck factor?
          
                              GLASS
                 Off the scale.
          
                              REILLY
                 What do we do?
          
          Glass turns to Mary.
          
                              GLASS
                 Can you hold it?
          
          She nods.   Reilly releases her gently, joining Glass at the
          van.
          
                                 REILLY
                 Talk to me.     Let's assess.
          
                                 GLASS
                 Right.
          
                                                                 11/10/97   91.
          
          
          
          
          Glass stares at the digital read-out on the device anchored
          in one of the C4 crates. It reads: "1:30, 1:29..."
          
                              REILLY
                 C'mon, talk to me! We can do it!
          
                               GLASS
                 He has a timer going as back-up, in case we
                 got a hold of the remote.
                        (beat)
                 Okay... first, run your fingers along
                 the edges, feel for a sensor.
          
          Reilly does it the way he saw Glass do it before.
          
                              GLASS
                 Good, now the other side.
          
                              REILLY
                 Nothing.
          
                              GLASS
                 Okay, let's go in.
          
          
          1:18, 1:17, 1:16 ....
          
          Reilly feels around, finally finds an access hole.
          
          Reilly works the hole bigger.
          
                              GLASS (cont.)
                 Not enough time ... gotta go for the
                 blasting cap. Only one chance... hand
                 entry.
          
                              REILLY
                 Keep talking.
          
                              GLASS
                 Close your eyes, feel your fingertips.   Tell
                 me everything you feel.
          
                                                               11/10/97   92.
          
          
          
          
          Reilly' hand disappears into the hole.
          
          CLOSE-UP - INSIDE THE BOMB
          
          His fingers snake through complex circuitry as he describes
          each layer.
          
                              REILLY
                 Wires... metal, cold... something soft...
          
                              GLASS
                 Don't touch that.
          
          BACK TO SCENE
          
          The red digital numbers keep counting down: 0:38, 0:37, 0:36
          
                              REILLY
                 More metal... sharp edge...
          
                              GLASS
                 Stay to your left.
          
          Deeper, deeper.
          
          AT THE BOMB SQUAD VAN
          
          The SWAT Van and a unit arrive, Winters and Benson jump out,
          the SWAT Team is about to follow-
          
                              T.J.
                 Get outta here, Swan's down, but they're
                 chilling a device.
          
          Winters looks to the action at the U-Haul, sees Reilly and
          Glass busy at work. He nods at Benson.
          
          0:30, 0:29, 0:28...
          
          Finally Reilly' fingers touch a button object. We hear the
          SWAT Van and the unit retreat at the end of the alley.
          
                                                                11/10/97   93.
          
          
          
          
                              REILLY
                 Something round, two wires ...
          
                              GLASS
                 That's the blasting cap - good! Okay, now
                 grab it by the base and pull it straight up.
                 No, Wait...
          
                              REILLY
                 What's wrong?
          
                              GLASS
                 Too easy. There's gotta be something else in
                 there, another cap maybe.
          
                              REILLY
                 Make up your mind, trigger.
          
          0:19, 0:18, 0:17...
          
                              GLASS
                 Ease your thumb over to the right - feel
                 anything?
          
          Reilly eyes shift as his hidden fingers feel around...
          
                              REILLY
                 Yeah, another round thing.
          
                              GLASS
                 Okay, one of the caps turns it on,
                 the other shuts it down.
          
                              REILLY
                 Which one's which?
          
                              GLASS
                 I don't know.
          
                                REILLY
                 What... ?
          
                                                               11/10/97   94.
          
          
          
          
                              GLASS
                 When in doubt, pull the yellow wire.
          
                              REILLY
                 How the hell do you feel yellow?
          
                              GLASS
                 No excuses, just do it!
          
          10... Reilly glares at Glass.
          
          9... His face is dripping with sweat.
          
          8... His fingers shift back to the first cap.
          
          7... They close over it, ready to pull.
          
          6... But then they stop.
          
          5... Reilly frowns.
          
          4... Glass stabs him with a look.
          
          3... 2... Lightning-quick, Reilly' fingers fly back and yank
          the second cap out of its base.
          
          The counter stops.    0:01.
          
          Reilly and Glass and stare at it, holding their breath,
          hardly daring to believe it's true. They whoop and explode
          with relief.
          
          It's over... it's finally over.
          
                              GLASS (cont.)
                 Not bad, for a rookie.
          
                                REILLY
                 Thanks.
          
          
          
          Reilly and Glass turn to Mary who has lost consciousness but
          is still holding the remote tightly.
          
                                                                       11/10/97      95.
          
          
          
          
                Glass looks up to see T.J. and Bev peeking from around their
                van.
          
                                    GLASS
                       All clear, but we need an ambulance!
          
                Bev jumps into the van to make the call as T.J. starts
                limping towards the U-Haul. Schnoz yelps and drops from the
                van and runs for the U-Haul.
          
                Reilly cradles Mary in his lap as Glass kneels and removes
                the remote - the red light stops flashing, then turns off.
          
                T.J. arrives and looks down at Reilly and Mary, then at the
                device in the U-Haul.
          
                                    T.J.
                       Nice work.
          
                                                                    DISSOLVE TO:
          
          100   INT. POLICE STATION -SQUAD ROOM - DAY                          100
          
                The room is back to its usual bustling activity.
          
          101   INT. POLICE STATION - WINTER'S OFFICE - DAY                    101
          
                Winters is going through reports on his desk as Reilly
                enters. Reilly is cleaned up, shaven, haircut, new suit... a
                new man.
          
                Winters look up, impressed with the change.
          
                                    WINTERS
                       Mayor loves a hero.
          
                Winters hands Reilly an envelope and a new badge.
          
                                    WINTERS (cont.)
                       Just want you wanted. Your promotion, and
                       transfer.
          
                                                                        11/10/97      96.
          
          
          
          
                                    REILLY
                       Thank you, Captain.
          
                Winters nods and goes back to his paperwork.
          
          102   INT. THE CAVE - DAY                                             102
          
                T.J. and Bev work closely together on a mock-device. T.J. is
                teaching her the job. They smile warmly at each other.
                Glass is on the computer.
          
                Reilly enters.
          
                                    BEV
                       Hey, you look great.
          
                T.J. flinches, but she winks at him to calm him down.    T.J.
                smiles... no longer threatened.
          
                Glass doesn't look up from his computer.
          
                                      GLASS
                       You're late.
          
                Glass points to the work station next to him where a Bomb
                Squad Protocol Program is waiting on the screen.
          
                Reilly smiles and he sits next to Glass, hands him the
                transfer papers envelope.
          
                                    GLASS (cont.)
                              (softening)
                       Welcome to the family.
          
                Glass accepts the papers and shakes Reilly's hand.
          
                                    REILLY
                       Nice to be here.
          
                                    T.J.
                       That feeling won't last long.
          
                                                                11/10/97   97.
          
          
          
          
          T.J., Glass and Bev start laughing.   After a beat, Reilly
          joins in heartily.
          
                                                               FADE OUT.

     GLIDING OBJECTS IN A WIDE DARK VOID - (ANIMATION)

             Out of the SILENT darkness a short white       A
             fluted column surmounted by a SUNDIAL
             appears.  It floats in, waveringly, until
             it becomes clearly visible, then drifts
             off as though moving in some huge orbit.

             Next an HOURGLASS floats in from the left      B
             of the screen.  The faint HISSING OF
             RUNNING SAND breaks the stillness of space.

             As the hourglass glides across the screen,     C
             it is met by a GREEK WATER CLOCK accompanied
             by the sound OF DRIPPING WATER.

             A MEDIEVAL CLOCK with weights arises as its    D
             horizontal escapement TICKS LOUDLY.  Mean-
             while the sundial, hourglass and water clock
             return, drifting at diverse angles across
             the screen.

     THE SOUND of the various devices continues to MOUNT.

             A FIGURE wheels past, with the face of a       E
             clock and the body carved like a drummer
             of the 14th century, BEATING the hour.

             A SMALL CLOCK bears a golden angel with        F
             hammer in hands as it STRIKES A BELL.

             ANOTHER TIMEPIECE, with CHIMES, floats in      G
             to mingle with all the drifting objects.

             The BIG BEN is TOLLING                         H

             Then a GREAT BELL.                             J

     DEAFENING SOUNDS NOW COME FROM ALL DIRECTIONS, as the time K
     devices weave across the screen and, reaching CRESCENDO,
     STOP abruptly.  A mellow VOICE begins to SING THE THEME of L
     the picture, "The Land Of The Leal".  Simultaneously, the
     screen reveals the MAIN TITLE:                             M

                        "THE LAND OF THE LEAL"

                      Words & Music by Peggy Lee

         When I was a wee lad                               L
         And dark was the night
         Afraid I would be
         Til the bright morning light
         And sometimes...for comfort
         Away I would steal Away
         I would go to the Land of the Leal.

         And soon I would be there
         It took me no time
         My heart would be soaring
         As I made the climb
         And there was the green grass
         So cool and so sweet
         So good to be run through
         With happy bare feet!

         And who was my teacher
         And how did I know?
         Just when to be going
         And which way to go?
         But always when wishing
         Away I would steal
         Away I would go to the Land of the Leal.

         And now that I'm older
         I try to be wise
         But when I am troubled
         I still close my eyes
         And just like the wee lad
         Away I will steal
         Away I will go to the Land of the Leal.

         For there are no questions
         And there are no lies
         And never a storm there
         To darken the skies
         The birds who are flying
         No freer they feel
         Than I
         When I live in the land of the Leal.

     EXT. COTTAGE - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT) - (MATTE)

     Warm lights pour through the windows, spreading
     over the snow-patched countryside.  Only the
     laboratory, a converted greenhouse, is dark, shaded
     from the moonlight by a majestic, leafless oak.
     A two-horse carriage, in the style of the turn of
     the century, lingers in the driveway.  Beyond all
     this, the River Thames takes a sharp curve.

     A lonely figure hurries up to the front door and
     KNOCKS on it impatiently.



     AT THE DOOR                                            2

     The knock is answered by MRS. WATCHETT, the house-
     keeper, a thin, tense woman with iron gray hair.
     The CAMERA ENTERS the HALL with DAVID FILBY, an
     amiable red-haired young man of science, who hastily
     hands her his rumpled cloak and hat, then rushes
     toward:



     INT. LIBRARY                                           3

     A pleasant Edwardian room, the shelves are stacked
     tightly with volumes of books, many of ancient
     Vintage.

     Three men are seated in a rough circle, motionless,
     obviously awaiting the arrival of occupants for the
     two empty chairs.  The silence is accentuated by the
     merry CRACKLING of logs in the fireplace and the
     capricious TICKING of innumerable timepieces about
     the room.

     Filby enters, pauses to glance down, then embarrassedly
     takes his chair.



     SERIES OF CLOSE SHOTS                                  4

               DR. PHILIP HILLYER is an imposing            (a)
               businessman, wearing full sideburns.
               He stares stonily at the last empty
               chair, then at Filby with annoyance.

               ANTHONY BRIDEWELL, a man of the world,       (b)
               impeccably attired in the latest fashion,
               welcomes Filby the only way he knows, by
               lifting his glass of whiskey.

               WALTER KEMP, a middle aged man with keen     (c)
               black piercing eyes, angrily chews on
               his Havana.

               Filby fidgets uncomfortably in his chair     (d)
               as

               Hillyer glances impatiently at his           (e)
               watch, comparing time with a GRAND-
               FATHER CLOCK behind him, then snaps
               it shut and glares at:



     EMPTY CHAIR - MED. SHOT                                5

     Conspicuously unoccupied.



     GRANDFATHER CLOCK - CLOSE SHOT                         6

     Reaching the hour of eight, it begins to STRIKE ITS
     YELLOW CHIMES.  Other timepieces JOIN IN the announce-
     ment.



     GROUPSHOT                                              7

     The men look at each other until the CHIMES, BELLS
     ETC. FADE away.  Dr. Hillyer angrily slaps on the
     arm of his leather chair.

                         DR. HILLYER
               I say, this is outright rude of the man!

                         FILBEY
               He's undoubtedly been detained.  That's
               all.

     Bridewell, filling his glass, is trying to say some-
     thing but is interrupted by

                         KEMP (unscrews the cigar from
                    his tight lips)
               This is such a confounded waste of
               time!  If he's not coming, I've any
               number of more important things to do.

     All heads turn as Mrs. Watchett enters, closing the
     door quietly behind her.  With an envelope in her
     hand she stands there, hesitating.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Speak up -- what is it, woman?

     She is taken aback for a moment, then walks over
     to Filby and hands him the open envelope.  He
     takes his time in extracting the note.

                         BRIDEWELL
               Well...are we or are we not invited
               to dinner?

                         FILBY (reading)
               Apparently we are.
                    (to Mrs. Watchett)
               How long has he been gone?

                         MRS. WATCHETT (nervously)
               I can't rightly say, sir. - Several
               days...I hardly catch a glimpse of
               him lately.  He never leaves the
               laboratory and comes out only to
               nibble at his meals...but he did tell
               me days ago about dinner tonight and
               left these instructions.
                    (pointing to note)

                         FILBY
               Thank you, Mrs. Watchett.

     A faint, nervous smile is her acknowledgement and
     with that she retreats toward the door.

                         DR. HILLYER (indicating the
                    note)
               What does it say, Filby?  What's
               wrong?

                         FILBY
               Nothing really. - George merely says
               that if he is not here by eight we're
               to begin without him.

     Kemp tears the note out of Filby's hand and reads it
     hurriedly.  Meanwhile, Mrs. Watchett swings the door
     open and turns around.

                         MRS. WATCHETT
               Dinner is served, gentlemen!

                         BRIDEWELL (puts his glass
                    down)
               First sensible thing I've heard all
               evening.

     He rises and starts for the dining room.  The others
     follow.



     FILBY, HILLYER & KEMP - MOVING SHOT                    8

     As they walk toward the DINING ROOM.

                         FILBY
               This is peculiar.  He is usually very
               prompt, precise and punctual.

                         DR. HILLYER
               He's making fools of us by inviting
               us here and then not showing up.
               It's not the behavior of a gentleman.

                         KEMP
               To say nothing of the waste of
               time.

                         DR. HILLYER (agreeing)
               To say nothing of the waste of
               time.

     Bridewell, already seated at the heavily laden dining
     table, pours a glass of wine for himself while the
     others settle down.  This time the chair at the head
     of the table is conspicuously unoccupied.

                         BRIDWELL (arises, lifting
                    his glass)
               One thing I will say for George, he
               keeps the best cellar in the south of
               England...and Mrs. Watchett is the
               finest cook in the world. - I think
               I'll drink to that!

     The glass barely touches his lips as he freezes at
     the SOUND OF DROPPING TRAYS and a PIERCING SCREAM.
     All look in the direction of another door across
     the room.



     THE DOOR - FULL SHOT                                   9

     It bursts inward and Mrs. Watchett, her hair flying,
     dashes down the steps panic-stricken into the room.
     The CAMERA RUSHES with her to the table where the
     men have come to their feet.  Clutching Filby's arm,
     she points toward the long corridor now revealed by
     the open door.

                         MRS. WATCHETT (frightened)
               There!...there...

     All stare o.s., Hillyer with the carving knife
     clasped in his hand.



     CORRIDOR THROUGH DOORWAY - FULL SHOT                   10

     We see the figure of a man approaching, a black
     silhouette against the pale glow at the end of
     the passage.  He is bent with exhaustion and
     sways as he moves forward, limping.  The man comes
     closer, his features still blacked out by shadows,
     but as he nears the doorway, the light from the
     room strikes first his legs, then his body and
     finally his face.  Here he stops.

     This is our first meeting with the TIME TRAVELLER
     (for so it will be convenient to speak of him).  At
     this instant he is in a sorry state.  His clothing
     is tattered and dirty, his face pale, bruised and
     scratched and his eyes glazed with fatigue.  For
     a moment he hesitates as if dazzled by the light
     and then takes another swaying step into the room.



     FILBY AND BRIDEWELL - MOVING SHOT                      11

     They come to life.  Bridewell, noticing the glass
     of wine still in his hand, quickly gulps it down
     before rushing with Filby toward the Time Traveller.

                         FILBY
               Good lord! - What's happened?

     Reaching him, each seizes an elbow to support him.
     Bridewell throws a frantic glance at Dr. Hillyer
     back at the table.  The Time Traveller, however,
     moves forward under his own power.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I'm all right...just some food...a
               drink...

     He reaches the table and sinks into his chair.  With
     trembling hands Bridewell tries to pour him a glass
     of wine, spilling most of it over the tablecloth.
     The Time Traveller looks up at him with a wry smile.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Are you all right?

     A stunned Bridewell is unable to speak while the Time
     Traveller empties his glass.

                         BRIDEWELL (a delayed
                    answer)
               Of course.  I'm...all right...

     Meanwhile, Mrs. Watchett hovers over the Time Traveller
     like a mother hen.

                         MRS. WATCHETT (half
                    apology, half concern)
               I didn't recognize you!...it was
               so dark...

     The CAMERA MOVES IN as she dishes up a bowl of soup
     for him, but he pushes it away.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Meat...I'm hungry for meat!

     Mrs. Watchett grasps the carving knife from Dr.
     Hillyer and, with a single slash, cuts off a huge
     portion of beef and loads it onto his plate.



     GROUPSHOT                                              12

     The Time Traveller eats, the men watching him
     curiously.  Finally Dr. Hillyer leans forward.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Well, can't you speak, man?  What
               happened to you?  Aren't you going
               to tell us...

                         BRIDEWELL
               Leave him alone, can't you?

                         TIME TRAVELLER (swallowing)
               It's all right. - I want to tell.

                         FILBY
               It will keep, George.  Eat, rest a
               little.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               No!  I must tell it now... while I
               still remember.

                         FILBY
               Relax, try to relax a bit.  You've
               all the time in the world.



     CLOSE ON THE TIME TRAVELLER                            13

     As he looks up, amused.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               You're right, David.
                    (almost to himself)
               That's exactly what I have. -
               All the time in the world!...
               ever since we were all together
               five days ago, the last day of
               Eighteen Hundred Ninety Nine.

     Slowly the CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSER while everyone
     listens so intensely that, aside from the Time
     Traveller's VOICE, only the TICKING of a pendulum
     CLOCK is heard.

                                         SLOWLY DISSOLVE:



     INT. - EBONY BOX ON TABLE - CLOSE SHOT (AFTERNOON)     14

     (NOTE:  The Slow Dissolve from the previous shot
             should give the effect of the Ebony Box
             emerging from the Time Traveller's brain.)

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               There in that box rests the result
               of two years' labor.

     The CAMERA DRAWS BACK to reveal the LIBRARY.  The Time
     Traveller, wearing casual tweeds and smoking a pipe,
     sits in his favorite chair behind the Ebony Box.
     Across from him in another chair sits Dr. Hillyer
     puffing his cigar.  Bridewell and Filby have glasses
     in their hands -- Kemp nothing.  All are looking at
     the box.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
                    (continues)
               I wanted to finish the job before
               the new century began. - I barely
               made it.

                         BRIDEWELL
               Marvelous.

                         DR. HILLYER (stands up)
               What is it?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Well, it has to do with time.

                         DR. HILLYER
                    (steps to box)
               I've always maintained what this
               nation needs is a reliable timepiece.
               The Navy needs one. The Army needs
               one. - For the artillery you know.

                         KEMP (leaning forward)
               Couldn't do better, George.  So
               that's why you've been in hiding. -
               Clever of you, indeed!

                         FILBY (studying the Time
                    Traveller's reaction)
               I don't believe George is referring
               to a new kind of timepiece.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               When I speak of time, I'm referring
               to the fourth dimension.

     A perplexed look comes over Bridewell's face.
     Dr. Hillyer registers concern.  Kemp looks troubled.
     Only Filby expresses avid interest.

                         FILBY
               Go on, George.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Now, as you know, the difficulty
               in explaining the fourth dimension
               is that it cannot be seen or felt -
               it must be thought of.

                         FILBY
               If you don't mind, George, would
               you refresh me on the first three
               dimensions.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Really, Filby, they must have
               taught you something at school!

                         BRIDEWELL (baiting
                    Dr. Hillyer)
               Suppose you explain it, Doctor.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Certainly!
                    (he demonstrates
                     pompously)
               When I move in a straight line,
               forward or backward, that's one
               dimension. - When I move to the
               left or right, two dimensions. -
               When I move up and down, three
               dimensions.
                    (a bright idea lights up
                    his face.  At last he can
                    get ahold of the box, but
                    Filby interferes before
                    Dr. Hillyer can get his
                    fingers on it and he has
                    to be satisfied with merely
                    pointing)
               For instance, this box has three
               dimensions:  length, breadth, and
               height.

                         BRIDEWELL (amazed)
               Well, then, what's the fourth
               dimension?

                         DR. HILLYER
               Well, that's...that's mere theory!
               No one can really say what the
               fourth dimension is or even that
               it exists.



     THE TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                         15

     Leaning forward in his chair.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               On the contrary, Doctor!  The
               fourth dimension is as true and as
               real a dimension as any of the
               other three.  In fact, they couldn't
               exist without it.

                         DR. HILLYER (enters the SHOT)
               How do you mean?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Well, take that box.  It has the
               first three dimensions, as you said.
               But what if it didn't exist in Time?
               It wouldn't exist at all, would it?

                         DR. HILLYER
               No.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               So - for an object to exist at all,
               it must exist in the fourth dimen-
               sion....and that fourth dimension
               is duration....Time!

                         DR. HILLYER (impatiently)
               All right!  But what's in that box?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I'm coming to that.  But first,
               consider!  Why is it that we usually
               ignore the fourth dimension?  Because
               we have no freedom to move in it.  We
               can move in the other three -- up,
               down, forward, backward, sideways.
               But when it comes to Time, we are
               prisoners.  Do you follow me, Anthony?



     GROUP SHOT                                             16

     In the f.g., Bridewell who has been sitting with a
     glazed, dreamy look, suddenly jumps.

                         KEMP
               George!  You've given a most lucid
               explanation and all that!  But I
               don't think I entirely understand.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Look!  There are a lot of things in
               the world you don't understand,
               aren't there?

                         KEMP
               Of course!  Quite a number.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               But you don't refuse to believe
               in them because of that?

                         KEMP
               Not if I can see the proof with
               my own eyes.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Good!  All I'm asking you to do
               now is to witness a demonstration
               of the possibility of movement in
               the fourth dimension.
                    (to Dr. Hillyer)
               Philip, will you please hand me
               that box?

     All eyes turn to Dr. Hillyer as he eagerly rushes to
     the table, lifts the box with surprise at its lightness,
     and takes it to the Time Traveller.  George opens it
     with great care and brings forth a mechanical device

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I've told you.  The larger model
               can carry a passenger on a journey
               through Time. - Not through Space,
               mind you, but through Time.

                         BRIDEWELL
               Oh, I say George!  If you start
               floating around in the future, aren't
               you likely to mess things up for the
               rest of us?

                         DR. HILLYER
               The future is already there.  It's
               irrevocable and cannot be changed.

     He answers thoughtfully.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               That's the most important question
               to which I hope to find an answer.
               Can Man control his destiny?  Can he
               change the shape of things to come?



     [PAGE 16 MISSING FROM HARD COPY]



                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               Imagine that this cigar is the Time
               Traveller.  Now, this lever in front
               of him controls movement.  Forward
               pressure sends the Machine into the
               future, backward pressure into the
               past.  And the harder the pressure
               the faster the Machine travels.



     GROUPSHOT - LOW ANGLE                                  24

     All eyebrows are raised.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               This experiment can be performed
               only once.  If it succeeds, I lose
               my model forever.  That is why I
               need witnesses.

     They look at each other, uncertain whether he is
     joking or not.  Bridewell stoops with difficulty to
     examine the table.

                         KEMP
               Go ahead.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               You're ready then?

     Despite disbelief, there is a tense silence as he puts
     his finger on the lever.  Then he pauses.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Doctor Hillyer, would you care
               to lend me your hand?

     Dr. Hillyer extends his hand hesitantly, smiling
     weakly.



     INSERT OF MODEL                                        25

     Using Dr. Hillyer's forefinger, the Time Traveller
     presses the lever forward.  A LOW-PITCHED HUM is
     heard.



     CLOSE ON THE MEN - LOW ANGLE                           26

     The men stare in fascination as the CAMERA PANS
     and the HUMMING INCREASES.



     INSERT:  GLASSES - CHANDELIER - VASE                   27

               The glasses on the silver tray rattle        (a)
               and clink against each other.

               The gas lights of the chandelier             (b)
               flicker rapidly.

               A vase shudders and moves slightly on        (c)
               the mantelpiece.



     INSERT OF MODEL                                        28

     As the vibration increases, the outline of the model
     is blurred and gradually becomes transparent, until
     the Machine with the cigar has vanished utterly.
     The HUMMING HAS REACHED A HIGH SHRIEK and STOPS
     abruptly.



     BACK TO CLOSE ON MEN - LOW ANGLE                       29

     The sudden silence is almost unbearable.  They
     stare at the empty table.  The CAMERA PANS.

                         DR. HILLYER (touches his
                    cigar pocket)
               I'll be damned!

                         TIME TRAVELLER (almost
                    to himself)
               It worked!

     Filby swallows.

     Bridewell, with his mouth open, stares at the table.
     Now he looks at the glass of champagne in his hand
     and places it on the mantelpiece as far out of
     reach as he can.  Then, suddenly reversing his
     decision, he retrieves the glass and gulps it down.

     TWO SHOT                                               31

     Dr. Hillyer slowly turns to the Time Traveller.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Where did it go?

                         TIME TRAVELLER (recovering)
               Go?  Nowhere in the usual sense.
               It's still here.
                    (indicating space where the
                    Machine stood)
               But it's no longer in the present.
               It's traveling through time - to
               the future, to be precise.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Do you seriously expect us to
               believe that?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Certainly.

                         DR. HILLYER
               But you just said it hasn't
               really moved.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               That's correct.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Then why can't we see it?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Because we're in this room on
               December 31st, 1899, while the
               model you saw is perhaps a hundred
               years away.  This room, or even
               this house, may no longer exist a
               hundred years from now.  But the
               Time Machine is occupying the same
               space it did a moment before it went
               off on its journey.

     Dr. Hillyer runs his hand over the top of the table.

                         DR. HILLYER (exasperated)
               If it occupies the same space, I
               should be able to feel it.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               You must remember that the space
               you've just put your hand through
               is today's space.  You can't put
               your hand into the space of
               tomorrow.

                         DR. HILLYER (getting angry)
               Space is space!  It doesn't change!
               The same space that is here now should
               be here a hundred or even a thousand
               years from now.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               No!  Time changes space.  This flat
               ground we're standing on now could
               have been at the bottom of the sea
               a million years ago.  And a million
               years from now it could be the
               interior of a huge mountain.

     Dr. Hillyer turns away, speechless.

     Kemp steps forward.

                         KEMP
               Suppose what you say is true.
               Exactly what do you suggest we do
               with such a contraption?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               For my part, I intend to take a
               journey into the future. - Unless
               someone else prefers to volunteer.

     There is no response.

                         BRIDEWELL (chuckling)
               I say, George.  Suppose you go off
               and get lost in the fiftieth century!
               How will you find your way back?

                         TIME TRAVELLER (quite
                    serious)
               That's a calculated risk I'm prepared
               to take.

     Dr. Hillyer, having controlled his fury, now exchanges
     significant glances with Kemp and turns back with an
     air of reasonableness.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Now listen, George!  I don't
               know what you take us for, but
               we're not fools.  There are a
               number of ways of doing a
               disappearing trick!  But a man of
               your ability should not bother
               with such nonsense.



     CLOSE ON DR. HILLIER - MOVING SHOT                     33

     He gets up from his chair.

                         DR. HILLYER (unable to
                    resist the temptation for
                    sarcasm)
               There's a war on, you know!  The
               Boers are putting up a pretty stiff
               fight in South Africa and our
               country needs inventors like you.
               I can put you in touch with the
               War Office if you wish.

     He walks over to the Time Traveller who is sitting
     near the table on which stands the empty Ebony Box
     with its lid open.  Filby is in the b.g.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (looks
                    up at Filby)
               What do you think?

                         FILBY (hesitating
                    slightly, and then)
               I think Dr. Hillyer has a point,
               George.

     Lazily the Time Traveller toys with the lid of the
     Ebony Box, then closes it with a SNAP.  He looks up
     and nods.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Now you're being sensible.  I'll
               take care of it first thing in
               the New Year.



     BACK TO GROUP SHOT                                     34

     Everyone rises.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Well, time to go.

                         KEMP
               Yes, we all have our plans for
               tonight.

     Dr. Hillyer and Kemp head toward the door.  Bridewell
     lingers at the table where the model of the Time
     Machine disappeared.

                         BRIDEWELL (concerned)
               Are you all right, George?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Of course, I am.

                         DR. HILLYER'S VOICE
               Coming, Bridewell?

     Reluctantly Bridewell leaves the library followed
     by the Time Traveller.



     INT. ENTRANCE HALL - FULL SHOT                         35

     While his guests put on their capes, overcoats, scarfs,
     gloves and hats, preparing for the cold weather
     outside, the Time Traveller steps to the door and
     grasps the handle.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Thanks for coming.

     He opens the door and they file past him, Bridewell
     at the rear.

                         AD LIBS
               Happy New Year. - Goodbye, George -
               Happy Twentieth Century. - Etc.

     Bridewell clasps the Time Traveller's shoulder,
     reassuringly.



     EXT. COTTAGE - LONG SHOT - (DUSK) - (MATTE)            36

     In contrast to the previous SHOT (Sc.l) this is a snow-
     less wintery day.  The visitors are boarding the
     carriage that awaits them in the drive.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Come on, Bridewell.

     Bridewell glances back to the Time Traveller, then
     submits and, with a CRACK OF A WHIP, the carriage
     moves off.



     EXT. ENTRANCE - FULL SHOT                              37

     The Time Traveller, a silhouette framed in the door-
     way, waves to them.



     THE CARRIAGE                                           38

     As it pulls away, Bridewell leans out, waving.  From
     the opposite direction another carriage full of NOISY
     YOUNG PEOPLE THUNDERS by.  In early New Year's Eve
     REVELRY they TOOT their toy HORNS at the Time Traveller.



     BACK TO THE TIME TRAVELLER                             39

     Unmindful of their salutations he turns and enters the
     cottage.



     INT. ENTRANCE HALL - MED SHOT                          40

     The Time Traveller slowly closes the door and leans his
     back against it, staring into space.  Thinking. - He
     spots a newspaper on a nearby table, apparently left by
     one of his guests, and picks it up.



     INSERT: NEWSPAPER                                      40-A

     A ROLL OF DRUMS in military fashion ACCENTS the headline
     that the Boer Army has won another victory.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                40-B

     He closes his eyes and, added to the DRUMS, we HEAR
     the call to battle by a DISTANT BUGLE.  Then more
     BRASS, FIFES and HORNS join the BUGLE and DRUMS to take
     up a MILITANT OVERTURE.

     He loosens his collar, then with sudden resolution
     strides toward:



     OMITTED                                                41-56



     INT. LIBRARY - LONG SHOT                               57

     The Time Traveller crosses to his writing table in
     the f.g.  He stands there and even in the darkness
     WE CAN OBSERVE that he is an angry man.  He strikes
     a match and lights the overhead gas fixture.  The
     light comes up and the MUSIC STOPS as he stares
     across the room to see:



     FILBY - MED. SHOT                                      58

     sitting in a chair near the fireplace.

                         FILBY
               I thought I'd better stay.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               You needn't have troubled yourself.
               I'm all right.

                         FILBY
               No you're not. - You've been
               behaving oddly for over a month
               now.
                    (and then)
               I'm not leaving until you tell me
               what's on your mind.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                             59

     Deep in thought, he goes to the fireplace and stirs
     the coals.  The CAMERA FOLLOWS.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I appreciate your gesture, David,
               but if you don't mind I'd rather
               you left me alone.

                         FILBY
               You have changed, George.
               Enormously.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I'm sorry.

                         FILBY (looks up to him
                    directly)
               Will you answer me one question
               honestly?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I'll try.

                         FILBY
               Why this preoccupation with Time?

                         TIME TRAVELLER (sharply)
               Why not?

                         FILBY
               Don't go simple on me, George!

                         TIME TRAVELLER (a beat,
                    then calmly)
               If you want to know the truth, I
               don't much care for the time I was
               born into. - It seems people aren't
               dying fast enough these days.  They
               call upon science to invent new,
               more efficient weapons to depopulate
               the earth.

                         FILBY
               I quite agree with you.  But here
               we are and we have to make the best
               of it.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               You may have to.  I don't.

                         FILBY (making a half-
                    hearted attempt at levity)
               All right.  Take a journey on your
               contraption.  What would you become?...
               A Greek?  A Roman?  One of the
               Pharaohs?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I prefer the future.

                         FILBY
               You're not seriously saying you can
               do it?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               You saw the experiment this afternoon,
               didn't you?

                         FILBY
               I saw a toy machine vanish.  But
               I'm certain there are a number of
               ways of doing that trick.  Any
               magician at the Hippodrome could
               probably do it.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (angrily)
               It was no trick! - Would you care
               to see the full-scale model?

                         FILBY
               No, I would not!  I have no desire
               to tempt the laws of Providence and
               I don't think you should.  It's not
               for man to trifle with.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Now you sound like Hillyer and Kemp.

                         FILBY
               There is something in their common
               sense attitude to life.
                    (and then)
               George, I speak to you as a friend.
               More, as a brother.  If that machine
               can do what you say it can...destroy
               it.  Destroy it, George, before it
               destroys you.

     Distant SOUNDS of NEW YEAR'S CELEBRATIONS are HEARD.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               You must have plans for New Year's
               Eve.  Don't let me keep you.

                         FILBY
               Mary isn't well.  We decided to
               stay home with the baby.  But why
               don't you come home with me.  You
               haven't seen little Jaime for a
               long time.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I can't.

                         FILBY
               What's stopping you?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I just want to see the old century
               out by myself.

                         FILBY (rising)
               Have it your own way.

     He goes to the door.



     AT THE DOOR                                            60

     Filby stops, then turns around.

                         FILBY
               Will you promise me that you won't
               leave the house tonight?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I promise you, I won't walk out of
               the door.

     Filby, a little puzzled by this strange promise, turns
     to go as the Time Traveller puts down the poker and
     steps up to him.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               David!  Please don't think me un-
               friendly! - Come over to dinner -
               next Friday.  Won't you?

                         FILBY
               Very well.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Fine...and will you bring the others
               with you?

                         FILBY (with a warm smile)
               Whatever you say, George. - Happy
               New Year.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (shaking hands)
               And a very happy New Year to you, David.

     Filby pats his arm before he leaves.  The Time Traveller
     stands there until he hears the FRONT DOOR SHUT.  Then,
     FOLLOWED BY THE CAMERA, he goes to the writing table
     and sits down.



     AT THE WRITING TABLE                                   61

     The Time Traveller opens a drawer and takes out the
     new calendar that reads:  "1900, Welcome New Century."
     He flips a few pages to find the next Friday and jots
     down the dinner engagement.  At this point Mrs. Watchett,
     with his velvet smoking jacket over her arm, appears
     in the doorway and walks up to him.

                         MRS. WATCHETT
               Will you be having supper in this
               evening, sir?

                         TIME TRAVELLER (while ex-
                    changing jackets with Mrs.
                    Watchett's help)
               I don't think so, Mrs. Watchett.  Why
               don't you take the evening off and
               celebrate.

                         MRS. WATCHETT
               Thank you, sir, but if you won't be
               needing me I think I'll turn in early
               and get some sleep...
                    (indicating revelers outside)
               ...it I can. - Goodnight, sir.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Goodnight.

     She turns to go as the Time Traveller calls after her.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Oh, Mrs. Watchett!
                    (as she responds)
               I've invited Mr. Filby and the others
               to dinner next Friday.
                    (and then)
               Happy New Year, Mrs. Watchett.

                         MRS. WATCHETT
               Happy New Year, sir.

     Mrs. Watchett exits, closing the door after her.  Once
     again the Time Traveller is alone.  He looks at the
     old calendar that reads:  "December 3l. 1899," rips
     the final sheet from the pad, crumples it into a tight
     little ball and tosses it into the hearth where it
     burns.  With slow and deliberate movements he replaces
     the old calendar with the new one.  Then, he hastily
     scribbles a note which he puts into an envelope and
     places it prominently on the table.  He rises and
     mounts the steps that lead to:



     INT. CORRIDOR - MOVING SHOT                            62

     The Time Traveller walks slowly toward a closed door
     at the end of the passageway.  Here he pauses momentarily,
     removes the key from his pocket, unlocks the door, then
     slowly swings it open as the MUSIC STARTS the THEME of
     the picture.



     INT. LABORATORY - FULL SHOT - (NIGHT)                  63

     The laboratory has the appearance of having once been
     a greenhouse.  Only a few potted plants remain.  The
     glass walls are obscured from view from the garden by
     rows of tall growing plants.  Only the glass skylight
     is clear.  Thick, dark, low-hanging clouds are pass-
     ing beneath the moon, dimming its light and leaving
     the interior a maze of dark shadows.  As the slow mov-
     ing clouds pass overhead, a shaft of moonlight seeps
     through and we SEE workbenches, numerous tools, sheets
     of drawings and scientific instruments situated around
     the perimeter.

     But the most conspicuous object in the room is the
     Time Machine.  It is a duplicate of the miniature model
     already seen.

     However, its size gives it a majestic quality.  Nickel,
     ivory and crystalline quartz gleam and sparkle.  While
     the miniature possessed a delicate, appealing note, the
     full size Machine has an ominous look.  The wavering
     moonlight seems to render it alive and give it the
     power of movement.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                  64

     Staring at the Machine, hypnotized by his own crafts-
     manship, he locks the door with accustomed movement,
     then crosses to a workbench and lights a candle.  Here
     a crystalline lever is attached to a polishing buffer.
     The Time Traveller sets it in motion, polishing the
     crystal lever until its rough edges disappear and it
     sparkles like a fine cut diamond.  As he works, his
     lips purse and he softly STARTS TO WHISTLE the melancholy
     strains of "The Land Of The Leal."  A clock near him on
     the workbench reads:  "9:30."

     Satisfied with the buffing, he removes the gleaming
     handle and crosses to the Machine.  He settles into the
     saddle and affixes the crystalline lever.  There is no
     sign of urgency in his movements to betray that his
     settling himself into the saddle is any more than a
     routine position he has taken before to work on the
     Machine.

     Then he leans back in the saddle and gazes up at:



     INSERT:  SKYLIGHT - (STOP MOTION OR ANIMATION)         65

     Passing clouds.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 66

     He looks upwards for several moments.  Then his hand
     slowly reaches forth and his fingers encircle the
     lever. - Gently he urges it forward.

     A HUMMING SOUND, similar to the one made by the model,
     but MORE RESONANT starts and a soft glow wells up from
     within the Machine.

     The luminous dials show:  "31 December 1899."  The
     meters and indicators start to BUZZ and whirl.  The
     glow increases.

     His expression is taut as he looks around, then down
     to the control panel.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               I started...and the laboratory grew
               faint around me...

     The figures spin, the needles vibrate.  Then almost
     at once the Time Traveller's hand reaches for the
     lever and jerks it over to halt the Machine.  The
     HUMMING LESSENS and FADES.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 70

     As he starts to look up and around, slowly.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               ...I stopped.



     WHAT HE SEES - MOVING SHOT                             71

     Starting at the WINDOW with frost around the edges
     and icicles outside, we move around the room PASSING
     THE WORKBENCH over to the DOOR.  During this we HEAR the:

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               No change; everything exactly as it
               bad been before. - But no!

     THE CAMERA SWINGS BACK TO THE WORKBENCH, CLOSE, where
     the clock now shows "11:09" and the candle has burned
     shorter.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE (excited)
               The clock said 9:31 when I started and
               now it was 11:O9...and the candle,
               shorter by inches.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 72

     He looks amazed, then pulls his old fashioned watch
     from his pocket by its gold chain.  It flips open
     showing almost "9:32."

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               And yet by my watch which was in the
               machine with me, only a few seconds
               had passed.

     Pleased, he puts his watch away and reaches for the
     lever, looking off toward the:



     WORKBENCH - (ANIMATION)                                73

     The HUMMING SOUND STARTS again and, while the hands
     of the clock circle the dial, the flame of the candle
     flickers with the speed of a bee's wing, melting the
     candle down.  The CAMERA MOVES to the window where the
     frost has spread and the icicles continue to grow.
     Light comes up behind so that the crystals glitter like
     gems and the sun starts to rise.



     TIME TRAVELLER IN THE MACHINE - MED. SHOT              74

     The rays of the early Morning sun slide down the lab-
     oratory wall and sweep across the Time Traveller and
     his Machine.  A trace of a smile -- and then, he looks
     up and squints.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               It was disconcerting to see the sun...

               for the night, changes that normally
               took hours, occuring in seconds, was
               beautiful.

     During this it has turned into night and a little SNAIL
     rushes across the ground beneath the plant, and then
     the flowers start to open again.  Light begins to flood
     the scene.

     In the b.g. Mrs. Watchett leaps into the garden, pauses
     the briefest instant to sprinkle the flowers, then with
     the speed of wind streaks away.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 77

     A trace of a smile, then apprehension.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               And as yet I was travelling very slowly!
                    (challenging)
               What if I went faster?!

     His hand shoves the lever farther over toward the
     future position.

     THE HUMMING SOUND RISES TO HIGHER PITCH.  The Time
     Traveller lurches in his seat, clings to the controls
     and looks at the dials.

     The sun soars across the sky, night falls.  Pin points
     of stars streak by and dawn comes.  The sun is chased
     by the stars again and again.  Faster and faster.



     VERY CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                           81

     His eyes gleam with a mad light, half pleasure, half
     pain.  His face is illuminated by the alternating
     flashes of light, each one indicating the passage of
     another day.

     He turns toward the:



     WINDOW - FULL SHOT - (ANIMATION, STOP MOTION & STOCK)  82

     Without a trace of frost or icicles.  The snow has
     disappeared, replaced by the lush green of Spring.
     While the vines of a morning Glory grow up and around
     the window like a snake and the flowers open and close,
     we see the following through repeated fast flashes.

                    The sun hops swiftly across the sky.    (a)

                    The night falls and the stars circle    (b)

                    tumultuous clouds.

                    On the following day the sky darkens    (e)
                    with thunderheads.  There is a
                    cataract of lightning and THUNDER.



     BACK ON TIME TRAVELLER                                 83

     Quick flashes of lightning on the Time Traveller's
     face followed by a series of SHORT THUNDERCLAPS.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               It became intoxicating.  To see an
               entire storm in a few seconds. -
               So I pushed the lever on toward
               even greater speed.

     He applies greater pressure on the lever.  The
     HUMMING INCREASES.  The alternate flashes of light
     become a flicker almost too fast for the eye to
     follow.  He looks o.s. and sees:



     EXT. TREE IN GARDEN - FULL SHOT - (ANIMATION)          84

     Its shadows, cast by the sun and the moon, dance
     around the trunk, faster and faster -- the moon
     passing through its phases and the sun shifting
     its position with the seasons.



     BRANCHES - CLOSE SHOT - (ANIMATION)                    85

     Leaves grow quickly.  Flowers appear and turn into
     small green apples.  Growing larger, they turn red
     and fall.  The leaves gradually become amber and
     disappear.  Suddenly the bare branches are covered
     with snow for a few seconds, then again burst into
     green leaves and blossoms.



     EXT. DISTANT HILLSIDE - FULL SHOT - (ANIMATION)        86

     Through the window we see the trees grow and
     change like puffs of vapor -- now brown, now
     green; they spread, shiver and pass away.  Snow
     flashes across the country, vanishes and is
     followed by the brief bright green of Spring.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               Thirteen years had passed...fourteen...
               fifteen...sixteen...and then...

     Gradually soot, dirt and grime has built up on the
     windows from the outside and darkness prevails.

     The hand of the Time Traveller quickly pulls back
     the lever.

               In the year nineteen hundred seventeen...
               I stopped.

     The flickering of passing days and nights slows and
     the HUMMING SOUND GRADUALLY DIMINISHES.  The dial
     stops on "13 September 1917".



     TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                             89

     The CAMERA PULLS BACK as he steps out of his Machine
     and glances with astonishment around the interior
     of the laboratory.  The once clear windows are now
     dirty and boarded up.  The world outside is
     completely obscured from view.  Only faint light
     penetrating cracks indicates that it is day out-
     doors.  He crosses to the door.  Dust falls as he
     opens it and enters the corridor.



     INT. LIBRARY                                           90

     The dim light and the protective sheets covering
     the furnishings previously seen, lend the room a
     ghostly appearance.  Tilted paintings reveal
     faded spots on the walls and the dust is inches
     thick here, as well as in the dining room seen
     in the b.g.  Cobwebs are everywhere.

     The floor SQUEAKS on every footfall as the Time
     Traveller, coming down the steps from the
     corridor, enters the room and looks about.



     THE SHELVES - TIME TRAVELLER'S P.O.V.                  91

     Among his books still rest the clocks, his once
     prized possessions.  There is NO TICKING now.
     The hands of the clocks, each pair indicating a
     different time, seem to guard the past.

     Curiosity takes the Time Traveller from the
     library, through the ENTRANCE HALL, to the front
     door.  It refuses to respond to his attempt to
     open it.  Even when he uses his shoulder it does
     not budge.  He steps back and flings his full
     weight against it and with a WRENCHING SOUND it
     gives slightly.  Under continued pressure the
     nailed boards outside give way and a flood of
     daylight illuminates the dusty interior.  The
     Time Traveller moves into the open driveway that
     is now taken over by weeds.



     EXT. COTTAGE - LONG SHOT - DAY                         93

     The Time Traveller takes a deep breath and looks
     curiously around.  Everything is overgrown with
     vines and flowers.  The house is boarded up.  He
     starts to wander around, thinking, investigating.

     (NOTE:  The house is situated upon a site with
             distinctive landmarks that will stay
             recognizable during his journey into
             the future, thereby giving a clear
             conception that time-travelling does
             not involve geographical movement.
             For instance, the sharp curve of the
             River Thames in the distance will
             remain even after the house itself
             has disappeared.)

     Suddenly the SOUND OF AN APPROACHING ENGINE
     catches his attention.  He looks puzzled toward:



     EXT. ROAD - LONG SHOT - (DAY)                          95

     Coming up the hill on a narrow dusty road is a
     car of 1916 vintage, with the HORN HONKING.  The
     CAMERA PANS with it, up to a SMALL STORE across
     the street.  The sign above the entrance reads:
     "Filby's Department Store".  A MANNEQUIN,
     dressed for the period, is in the window.  The
     driver, in the uniform of a Second Lieutenant of
     the First World War, steps out of the car.  The
     Time Traveller walks over to see his old friend,
     sans moustache.

               Going to a masquerade, David?  You

                         FILBY (puzzled)
               Were you addressing me, sir?

                    (positively)
               Filby!  I expected more of an
               enthusiastic greeting from...

                         FILBY (smiles as he
                    interrupts)
               I'm afraid you have me confused
               with my father, sir.  There was a
               remarkable resemblance. - I'm
               James Filby.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Was?

               Were you a friend of father's?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Yes...yes...I've been away.

                         JAMES FILBY
               He was killed in the war...a year
               ago.

               No!...it can't be...
                    (then, as he realizes its
                    truth)
               I'm sorry to hear that.
                    (pause, then hesitantly
                    points)
               And the gentleman who used to live
               across the street?

                         JAMES FILBY
               Oh, him.  Some inventor who
               disappeared around the turn of the
               century. - If you're interested in
               that house, forget it.  You can't
               buy it or even go inside.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Why is that?

                         JAMES FILBY
               My father was executor of the
               inventor's estate and he refused to
               liquidate it.
                    (adds with a smile)
               I often chided him on that account,
               but he felt positive that the owner
               would return some day. - Some people
               hereabouts think it's haunted.
                    (stares at Time Traveller
                    curiously, studying the
                    strange cut of his clothes)

               Just a stranger who once knew your
               father.

                         JAMES FILBY
               I see.
                    (still curious at the Time
                    Traveller's abstract attitude)
               Have you been at the front, sir?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Front?  What front?

                         JAMES FILBY
               Why the war, of course.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               What war?

                         JAMES FILBY
               Great heavens, man, don't you know
               we've been at war with Germany
               since nineteen fourteen?  I thought
               perhaps you had seen action in
               France...or maybe...
                    (noticing confusion, adds
                    with a note of compassion)
               Perhaps a cup of tea would make
               you feel better.  Won't you come in?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               No...no, thank you.

                         JAMES FILBY
               You're sure you're alright, sir?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Yes, I'm quite alright.

                         JAMES FILBY (hesitantly)
               Then...goodbye, sir.

     The Time Traveller nods and James Filby slowly
     turns and, glancing back repeatedly, enters the
     Department Store.

               As I went along, I gained experience

               Good heavens, that's a dress?

     From her pretty face with the funny hat, the
     CAMERA PANS DOWN to the hem line of her skirt,
     twelve inches from the floor.

     A smile appears on his face.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               This was intriguing.  I wondered
               just how far women would permit
               this to go.

     He pushes the lever ahead.  Flashes and HUMMING
     INCREASE and we:

     (ANIMATION)

     As the years speed by INTERRUPTED BY SHORT BLURS,
     the dresses of the mannequin change.  The skirts
     get shorter and shorter, then drop inch by inch
     while the hair styles vary.  The bosom appears to
     swell with the sinking neckline and flattens as
     the neckline rises.  During this:

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               I began to grow fond of that
               mannequin.  Maybe because, like me,
               she didn't age.



     THE TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                         106

     Suddenly he hears the SOUNDS OF AIRPLANES and
     EXPLOSIONS in a strangely ACCELERATED manner.
     He looks down at the instruments.

     December of 1939 and January, February, March,
     April, May of the year 1940 are peeling off.

     The instruments vibrate erratically.

     He stares at the dials with much concern as he
     is PITCHED back and forth in his Machine.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               Suddenly, in nineteen forty I began
               to be buffeted from side to side.
               My first thought was that the Machine
               had a mechanical defect or a part
               had worn out.

     The Time Traveller HEARS the SCREAMS of DIVING
     PLANES.  He stops the Machine and looks up at:



     SKYLIGHT - MED. SHOT - (NIGHT) - (STOCK)               109

     Through the panes of broken glass we see a clear
     but limited glimpse of the night sky that is
     swept by beams of searching lights.

     ANTI-AIRCRAFT batteries are FIRING as a squadron
     of Nazi fighter planes are caught in the criss-
     cross beams of light.  The sky is pierced with
     ack ack.  Then, following the sound OF APPROACHING RAF.
     FIGHTER PLANES, a dog fight ensues.  Several of the
     planes are hit and plummet earthward, balls of
     streaking flame and fire.

     Gazing up at the grim spectacle.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               The last time I had stopped was in
               nineteen seventeen, twenty three years
               ago.  And the war with Germany was
               still waging - now in the air with
               flying machines.  It didn't seem
               possible they could go on fighting
               all these years and still have the
               means of fighting.  Then I realized
               the truth of the matter.  This was a
               new war.  There must have been an
               interval of peace in between these
               wars.  Yet they had learned nothing
               but to prepare even more effective
               means of destroying one another.  I
               decided to push on into time and see
               the outcome.

     He looks down at:

     Denoting the movement of the Machine through time.
     The dials spin from 1940 to 1959 where the HUMMING
     NOISE SUBSIDES and the dials again come to a stop.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               The fighting in the sky lasted only
               a few moments.  By nineteen forty five
               it was over, but I continued on a
               few more years before pausing for
               another glimpse of my silent, never
               aging friend.

               It vas reassuring to find that she
               hadn't changed.  Only her costume.
               Provocative to say the least.  I
               wondered what she would look like
               ten years hence.

     With a grin he throws the lever forward.

     and so on until it finally STOPS on 1966.

     His smile becomes a puzzled stare at what he sees.



     EXT. STREET IN 1966 - LONG SHOT - (DAY)                117

     People are racing along the sidewalk.  The SOUND
     OF MORE DEEP-THROATED SIRENS from all directions
     comes over.  Drivers leave their cars of the period
     in disorder.

     The running is purposive, however.  All are entering
     particular buildings or, like those closest to the
     Time Traveller, are descending a stairway from the
     sidewalk down below street level.  Some glance sky-
     ward.

     A LITTLE GIRL picks up the doll she has dropped
     as her FATHER returns from the shelter.  He gathers
     her up in his arms and rushes back to safety.

     In a few seconds the streets are deserted.



     TIME MACHINE AT EDGE OF PARK - FULL SHOT               118

     The Time Traveller gets out and looks around,
     confused.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               At first I wondered if my Machine and
               I were the cause of the panic.  I was
               to soon find out we weren't.

     He starts off toward the sidewalk, the CAMERA
     MOVING with him.  At the descending subway stair-
     way he stops and peers downward, but sees no one
     below.  Meanwhile, through a loudspeaker o.s.,
     a melodious SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA is heard softly,
     until a BURST OF CHORDS attracts the Time Traveller's
     attention.



     EXT. STORE WINDOW - FULL SHOT                          119

     A TELEVISION CABINET on display.  The set is
     operating, showing a huge symphony orchestra
     led by one of the popular conductors of tomorrow.
     The CAMERA SWINGS to the modern ENTRANCE of FILBY'S
     DEPARTMENT STORE just as the Time Traveller reaches
     the two broad glass doors.  As he steps forward he
     intercepts the rays of electronic eyes and the doors
     fly wide open.

     He stops startled, looking about to see who opened
     them.  Seeing no one, he starts slowly forward.



     INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - LONG SHOT                      120

     From the TV set BLARES MUSIC that gradually becomes
     the UNDERSCORE for the SCENE.  The Time Traveller
     enters and turns his attention to other products
     of tomorrow -- refrigerators, vacuum cleaners,
     reducing belts, etc.  As his keen mind grasps the
     significance of each, he smiles with approval, proud
     of his fellow man.  His delight increases until he
     is interrupted by APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS.  He looks
     off.



     REVERSE SHOT                                           121

     Coming from the office is THE WARDEN, dressed in a
     plastic suit.  He also wears an armband and a white
     crash helmet, both bearing the insignia of "Civilian
     Defense."  MUMBLES are heard from beneath his mask
     as the CAMERA PANS him to the Time Traveller.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
                    (shakes his head)
               I can't understand you.

     The warden takes off his helmet.  He is David
     Filby's son, James, whom we saw in 1917 as a young
     man.  He is now in his mid-sixties.

                         WARDEN
                    (looking at helmet)
               Confounded radio in this thing.
               Makes more noise than it does sense.

                    (recognizing him)
               Filby!

                         WARDEN
               My name is Mister Filby. - Didn't
               you hear the air raid siren?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               You mean that horrible screeching?

                         WARDEN
               It wasn't constructed for its
               aesthetic values, you know, but to
               warn silly young fools like yourself
               to get down into the shelter.  Now
               go on.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               But I'm perfectly comfortable and
               I find your store magnificent.  What
               splendid achievements, what gigantic
               strides mankind has taken, what...

                         WARDEN
                    (interrupting)
               Come on, young man.  We'd better be
               going before the mushrooms start
               sprouting.
                    (looks at Time Traveller
                    with renewed interest)
               You do look familiar.  Haven't
               we met somewhere before?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Indeed we have.  Right here.  Many
               years ago.

                         WARDEN
               I was sure of that, but the exact
               time escapes me.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               It was two wars ago, I believe.
               Nineteen seventeen.

                         WARDEN (awed)
               Why now I recall.  The chap who
               inquired about my father -- and
               the house that used to be across
               the way.
                    (stops and stares at
                    the Time Traveller)
               But no...that's impossible.  You
               haven't changed.  You're not a day
               older.  And your clothes...

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I'm afraid it's going to take me
               a little time to explain... You see...

     There is an insistent, EAR PIECING SIREN.  It
     lasts for three seconds.

                         WARDEN
               The last alert...hurry!

     He grabs the Time Traveller by the arm and drags
     him out.

               Listen to me!  It's important.

                         WARDEN (points to sky)
               Look!  An atomic satellite zeroing
               in!  That's important!!

     The Warden runs, looks back over shoulder, calling.

                         WARDEN
               Hurry!  Hide 'til the All Clear!

     He descends into the air raid shelter.

               All clear?
                    (yells)
               I've got to talk to you.

     The Time Traveller looks up as he hears the
     APPROACHING SIRENS OF AN AMBULANCE.  Alarmed,
     he runs across the street directly in the path
     of the ambulance that threads its way between the
     cars left in disorder on the road.  The driver
     spins the steering wheel and the ambulance tilts
     crazily in trying to avoid the Time Traveller.
     Suddenly there is a BLINDING FLASH.  He stops and
     looks startled.

     to the ground.  He looks back, desperately.



     THE CITY - LONG SHOT - (MINIATURE)                     126

     Through the thick cloud of smoke and dust we see
     the once proud city of the future in ruins.  Only
     a single, large structure in the f.g. remains stand-
     ing for a moment, then it also collapses in an instant.

               instant.

     The ground shudders with an OMINOUS sound and sudden
     a great rent appears in the wide street ahead, as
     though the earth were being torn apart.  It zig-zags
     down the street and from the widening fissure clouds
     of smoke and steam rise.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               But then Mother Earth, aroused by man's
               violence, responded with volcanic
               violence or her own!



     CHASM IN THE GROUND - (STOCK)                          127

     The smoke and steam give way to a spluttering of

     rising tide and then spilling over begins to
     EXPLODE into the air.

     ures in the f.g. dissolve into smoke and flame and
     the upper parts come tumbling down into the rising
     red flood.  Then the incoming rush of the river
     meets the flowing tide of lava.  The two opposite
     elements, molten rock and cold green water, dwarf
     the ruined city as they leap toward each other, and
     meet with explosive fury.  The air is rent with the
     SINGING HISS of water and the CRACKLING of cooling
     rock.  Steam whitens the sky.

     Out of the tumult a flow of red hot lava turns

     In the pitch darkness there are only the sounds of

     100,000.  Then the matchlight flickers and goes
     out leaving only the dial's own faint glow.



     BACK ON TIME TRAVELLER                                 138

     Once again there is darkness and the MONOTONOUS HUM
     of the Time Machine.  He breathes heavily and tries
     to calm himself.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               I wondered if there was still war
               being waged on the ground above me...
               if man would still exist on earth,
               when I saw the sun again.

     As he speaks, the Time Machine goes faster and faster.
     HIGH PITCHED HUMMING INCREASES.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               The centuries rolled by. - I put
               my trust in time and waited for
               the rock to wear down around me.

     A white light from above begins to permeate the dark-
     ness.  The Time Traveller looks up, his face showing
     immense relief.



     WHAT HE SEES - (ANIMATION)                             139

     Rocks deteriorate and a bright blue sky bursts into
     view.  ACCENT ON MUSIC.



     EXT. TIME MACHINE AND GROUND NEARBY - LONG SHOT        140
     (SPLIT, ANIMATION)

     Everything is a blur except the Time Machine with its
     passenger.  The black rock on the surface slowly melts
     away and the flickering sunlight returns.  The Machine
     is now finally entirely above ground, the only distinct
     object in the whirling transparent landscape.



     EXT. TIME TRAVELLER - CLOSE SHOT                       141

     As he smiles gratefully up at the sky.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               I was free again!

     He looks o.s.



     INDISTINCT COUNTRYSIDE - LONG SHOT - (ANIMATION)       142

     There is an impression of several great buildings
     set wide apart by green landscape -- a landscape
     which no longer changes color even though trees
     spring up like plumes of green smoke.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               Thousands of centuries passed, but
               the earth stayed green!  There was
               no winter!  No wars! - Had man finally
               learned to control both the elements
               and themselves? - I had to stop and
               find out.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                             143

     As he eagerly pulls hard on the lever, the HUMMING
     DECREASES and the dial freezes on:  "23 November
     802,701".  THERE IS A CRASH LIKE THUNDER and the
     Time Machine suddenly goes into a spin.  The CAMERA
     ZOOMS BACK TO A FULL HIGH SHOT as the machine keels
     over.  The friction caused by the intrusion creates
     a pitiless HAIL, and we

                                    SLOWLY DISSOLVE TO:



     EXT. TIME TRAVELLER - CLOSE SHOT - (DAY)               144

     Thick mist eddies about his face, undulating
     dreamily, revealing enough to see that he is
     unconscious.  Blood seeps from a gash across his
     forehead.  He dazedly opens his eyes to find that
     he is gazing across the dewey, green turf.  Then
     he looks up.



     EXT. THE SPHINX - FULL SHOT - LOW ANGLE - (MATTE)      145

     The vapor rises like a curtain to disclose a great
     bronze pedestal, green with verdigris, whereon
     clawed feet support the white marble figure of an
     immense Sphinx.  The figure has the face of a
     woman, the body of a huge cat and the tail of a
     serpent.  A weeping birch tree barely touches its
     outspread wings.



     THE TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                         146

     He shakes the cobwebs out of his head and, FOLLOWED
     BY THE CAMERA, rises with difficulty.  Still half-
     dazed he presses a handkerchief to his temple, as
     he loosens his collar, then reaches into the Machine,
     pockets the lever and surveys his surroundings.



     LANDSCAPE - LONG SHOT - (MATTE)                        147

     It looks like a garden untended for centuries.  The
     trees and shrubs are laden with strange blossoms or
     exotic fruits.

     In the distance there is a building that might once
     have been a temple.  Vines mat the ancient walls,
     seemingly holding them together.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 148

     He smiles.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (to himself)
               At last I've found a Paradise.

     He starts off toward the building WHISTLING his
     favorite tune, "The Land Of The Leal".  The CAMERA
     ACCOMPANIES him as he looks about with interest.



     WHAT HE SEES - MOVING SHOT                             149

     Strange, exotic fruits bend the branches of the
     TREES, some purplish and gourd-shaped, others
     suggesting giant raspberries, mangoes, etc.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               Nature tamed completely and more
               bountiful than ever before.



     VARIETY OF FLOWERS - MOVING SHOT                       150

     The CAMERA PANS under boughs laden with orchids and
     a multitude of other gorgeous blossoms.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               Flowers everywhere...the whole landscape
               one vast garden with no sign of weeds or
               briars.



     EXT. ENTRANCE TO GREAT BUILDING - LONG SHOT - (DAY)    151

     The Time Traveller pauses and looks up at the building.



     ACROSS FACADE - PAN DOWN - (MINIATURE?)                152

     Vines creep up the crevices.  The ornamental stone
     work, while rich in detail, is weathered and
     broken with age.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
                    (surprised)
               Unrepaired for centuries!  Maybe
               unlived in for as long.
                    (then)
               It would be no Paradise if it
               belonged to me alone.



     INT. ENTRANCE - MED. SHOT                              153

     Shooting through the ARCHWAY we see the Time
     Traveller mount the steps and enter the building.



     INT. THE GREAT HALL - FULL SHOT - (MATTE) - (DAY)      154

     In the background across the hall, the Time Traveller
     halts.  He is dwarfed by the height of the vaulted
     ceiling.  Although ancient in appearance, everything
     is ultra modern in design.  Sunlight streams through
     windows where half the panes of stained glass are
     broken.  Faded curtains droop in dusty folds along
     the walls, and at random about the floor are low
     tables, some heavily fractured, loaded with bowls
     of fruit.

     His FOOTSTEPS ECHO through the great hall as the
     Time Traveller crosses to:



     A TABLE - MED. SHOT                                    155

     The Time Traveller glances down at the spread of
     exotic fruit.  Everything looks fresh and clean as
     though newly prepared.  Yet there is no indication
     of life or sound, either human or animal.  The air
     hangs in a deathlike stillness.  Slowly the Time
     Traveller turns and looks around the walls, his
     eyes searching, scrutinizing for some clue to
     this strange place.  There is none.

     Then he picks up an empty marble plate and POUNDS
     with it on the top of the table.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (shouting)
               Anyone here?

     But an ECHO is his only answer.  Curiously he re-
     traces his steps and leaves the great hall.



     EXT. LANDSCAPE - FULL SHOT - (DAY)                     156

     Pick up the Time Traveller as he walks slowly along.
     Every sense he possesses is on the alert.  His eyes
     probe every bush and tree and object that could
     possibly conceal some person or thing.



     SERIES OF SHOTS                                        157-161

     As the Time Traveller takes this long, slow walk,
     INTERCUT INSERTS of the various innocent objects
     he looks at with CLOSEUPS of Time Traveller as he
     reacts to the bewildering SILENCE and lack of life
     or movement.

     The continued stretch of emptiness builds up a wave
     of apprehension in the Time Traveller which grows
     as he moves along.  The apprehension mounts into
     tension and gradually but inevitably approaches
     the state of horror that a human being would
     experience in a strange place where he had just
     come from an innocent freshly set table of ripe
     fruits and stepped outside into a beautiful but
     weird vacuum.



     EXT. WOODED AREA - LONG SHOT                           162

     As the Time Traveller reaches the edge of the trees,
     he hesitates, then moves into the forest.



     SERIES OF SHOTS                                        163-166

     The trees are thick and deep shadows cut patches of
     darkness through the bright sunlight which struggles
     to penetrate the maze.  The Time Traveller walks
     with continued wariness through the trees, glancing
     from left to right and occasionally stopping dead
     still and quickly darting a glance behind him at
     what he imagines to be some sound of movement.
     But all this is imaginary on his part.  There is
     nothing that moves or makes a sound in this forest.

     Suddenly he stops as he distinctly hears a familar
     and quite HUMAN combination of NOISES.  The SOUND
     SPLASHING WATER and LAUGHTER.  He hurries to some
     dense foliage where he stops to cautiously peer out.



     EXT. THE POOL - LONG SHOT - (DAY)                      167

     The Time Traveller's VIEW is partially obscured by
     the leaves.  At considerable distance upstream, the
     PEOPLE OF THE FUTURE are swimming in a natural pool
     and sunning themselves on a beach of white sand.
     They are small, but delicately formed.  Their grace
     and beauty fits perfectly into this splendid new
     world.  The spot is also extremely lovely, surrounded
     by fern trees, and with the water plunging into it
     from a high waterfall.  Below the pool the stream
     emerges in a swift torrent.



     ANOTHER, CLOSER SHOT                                   168

     A beautiful GIRL, dressed in a silken robe of white
     and gold, starts running.  As she runs, she loosens
     her robe which drifts to the sand and she dives deep
     into the crystal water.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                169

     He smiles philosophically and leans back against a
     tree trunk, watching the distant swimmers, reassured.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (musingly,
                    to himself)
               So this is man's future...



     GROUP SHOT                                             170

     The people, apparently without any cares of the
     world, play, romp and swim.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (o.s.)
               ...to bask in the sunlight, bathe in
               the clear streams and eat the fruits
               of earth with all knowledge of work
               and hardship forgotten.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 171

     He pauses, thinking back on what he has just said.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Well, and why not?

     Suddenly a SHRILL SCREAM COMES OVER from the pool.
     He turns.



     THE POOL - LONG SHOT                                   172

     The Girl has swum out too far and is caught by the
     swift torrent.  She CRIES OUT PITEOUSLY.

     The other people turn their heads toward her, but
     make no move to help.



     CLOSE ON GIRL                                          173

     She has caught a ledge of rock and clings.  Two
     little men, their bare feet dangling in the water,
     sit nearby but ignore the Girl's plight.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                           174

     He jumps out from the foliage, rushes to the bank,
     points toward the Girl and tries to attract the
     attention of those near her on the bank.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Help her!...

     No one moves.  He runs toward the ledge.



     BACK TO THE GIRL                                       175

     Her grasp on the ledge grows weaker.  She is at
     the point of letting go.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                           176

     Reaching the ledge, he pushes past the people nearby
     and grasps the Girl's wrist just as her fingers
     slip.  Quickly, he pulls her out of the river's
     turbulent current and lifts her up in his arms.



     GIRL - EXTREME CLOSE UP                                177

     Looking up at the Time Traveller bewildered, she
     shows neither fear nor gratitude.



     TIME TRAVELLER - EXTREME CLOSE UP                      178

     Gazing back at the Girl thoroughly puzzled.  He
     turns and glances down at the two little people
     on the ledge.



     CLOSE TWO SHOT                                         179

     These two men will later be known as the YOUNG MAN
     and the MAN IN WHITE.  They return the Time Travel-
     ler's look of scorn with pleasant smiles as if they
     do not know the meaning of a mean look.



     TIME TRAVELLER & GIRL - EXTREME CLOSE, MOVING SHOT     180

     Trying to avoid looking at the dripping, robeless
     Girl - after all he is a Victorian - he carries her
     to the safety of the bank and sets her down on the
     sandy beach beneath the trees.  The CAMERA FOLLOWS
     him as he straightens, then quickly takes off his
     jacket and throws it around her.

     He looks at her for the first time sees the almost
     ultimate in feminine beauty.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Are you all right?



     TIME TRAVELLER & GIRL - FULL SHOT                      181

     Wearing his velvet jacket very appealingly, she
     calmly rises, turns and, without a word, walks
     away.  The Time Traveller stares after her in
     astonishment.

     The disconcerned people, now all dressed in multi-
     colored robes, are leaving the pool.  They walk
     past the Time Traveller as though he was a part of
     the scenery, merely adding to his confusion.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                182

     Perplexed.

                                      DISSOLVE TO:



     EXT. ENTRANCE TO THE GREAT BUILDING - (SUNSET)         183

     Shooting toward the ARCHWAY.  The sun is sinking as
     the last stragglers of the little people enter the
     great hall.  The Time Traveller slowly follows them.
     He pauses on the steps to see if any will turn back
     to either welcome him or resent his intrusion, but
     they move on with lack of interest, completely.  He
     sits down on the steps, thoroughly perplexed at this
     utter indifference.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                             184

     Seated on the steps leaning against a column.  He
     senses another's presence, looks about, sees no one,
     then turns to glance over his shoulder.  The Girl, now
     wearing her robe and holding his jacket over her arm,
     appears from behind the column.  He looks at her and
     smiles reassuringly, but makes no move toward her. -
     She comes closer, then sits on the step above him and
     returns his jacket.  While he slowly slips it on,
     she slides down a step to sit alongside him.

                         THE GIRL
               Why did you?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Why did I what?

                         THE GIRL
               Come after me.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (ironic)
               I did it to save your life, young
               lady, which I'm afraid doesn't hold
               much meaning for you or anyone else.

                         THE GIRL (simply)
               It doesn't.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Must have been fifty of your friends
               watching you drown.  Not one of
               them so much as lifted a finger. -
                    (shakes his head)
               A curious attitude - in a curious
               world.
                    (a pause, then a
                    smile)
               Aren't you the least bit interested
               in what I am...where I come from?

                         THE GIRL (innocently)
               Should I be?

                         TIME TRAVELLER (smiles)
               Perhaps you'd better take me to
               someone a bit older I can talk to.

                         THE GIRL
               There is no one older.

     The Time Traveller is suddenly struck by the truth
     of her words.  All of the little people seem to be
     of the Girl's age or younger.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Doesn't anyone age in this land
               of yours?

     The Girl makes no reply.  Instead she gazes off at the
     sun which is low in the heavens.  Shadows have already
     fallen over the distant hills.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               What's your name?

                         THE GIRL
               Weena.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               How do you spell that?

                         WEENA
               Spell?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Write!  - Can't you write?  Look!

     He bends over, picks up a stick and starts to draw
     on the ground.



     INSERT: DUST                                           185

     As the stick writes out: " W E E N A "



     BACK TO SCENE                                          186

     She shows little interest.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               And what are your people called?

                         WEENA (as if he ought to know)
               Eloi.



     INSERT OF DUST                                         187

     The stick now writes in the dust: " E L O I "



     BACK TO SCENE                                          188

     A shadow crosses her face.  Suddenly she springs
     to her feet, concerned.

                         WEENA
               Come.  We must go in.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (rising)
               Why?  What's wrong?

                         WEENA (anxiously)
               It is getting dark.

     She grabs his hand and pulls him toward:



     INT. THE GREAT HALL - LONG SHOT - (MATTE?) - (DAY)     189

     Crowded now.  The people of the future are sitting
     on cushions around the tables, having their evening
     meal.  The glowing orange light of the setting sun
     pierces the broken windows, lending a curious at-
     mosphere to the place.  No one pays attention to
     Weena or to the Time Traveller as they enter in the
     b.g.



     AT THE MAIN TABLE - MED. SHOT                          190

     A score of attractive young men and young women are
     enjoying their dinner.  There is a general atmos-
     phere of bubbling good humor.  They don't even look
     up as Weena and the Time Traveller sit down at the
     table.  She hands him an orange-sized raspberry.  He
     takes it, looks at the Young Man and the Man in White
     who sit across the table from him and tries to engage
     them in conversation.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (directed to
                    Young Man, but meant for the
                    entire group)
               I don't mind telling you, I'm quite
               hungry.  I've come a long, long way.

     Looks around for some kind of a reaction.  There is
     none.

     He bites into the fruit.  It's good.  While he is
     eating he searches for another way to bring up the
     subject.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               In my time a berry this size would
               have made news in every civilized
               country.



     GROUP SHOT                                             192

     There is no reaction, so he addresses the Young Man
     again.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Sir, perhaps curiosity has died.
               Perhaps even courtesy has died, but
               I have come a long way and there are
               things I would like to know.

                         YOUNG MAN (considers a
                    moment, then)
               Why?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Because I shall return to my time
               and they will ask questions such as
               what kind of government rules your
               world.

                         MAN IN WHITE
               We have no government.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (speaking
                    as though to a child)
               You must have a body of men who pass
               and enforce laws.

                         MAN IN WHITE
               There are no laws.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (taken aback,
                    then)
               How do you get your food and clothing?

     The Man in White looks at the Young Man beside him.
     They both shrug their shoulders.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Doesn't anyone work?

                         MAN IN WHITE
               No.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (picks up
                    fruit)
               Then where does this come from?

                         MAN IN WHITE
               It grows.  It always grows.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               But it must be planted, cultivated,
               nurtured...unless...
                    (with mistaken insight as he
                    observes no reaction to this
                    last query)
               Unless you have an economy so well
               organized that you can devote all your
               time to study and experimentation.
               Am I right?

                         MAN IN WHITE
               You ask many questions.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (annoyed)
               Yes!  And I'm not ashamed of it.
               That is how man has learned and
               bettered himself.  I must learn about
               you and your civilization.  You have
               books, don't you?

                         YOUNG MAN (recognizing a
                    half-forgotten word)
               Books. - Books!  Yes, we have books.

     He rises and beckons.  The Time Traveller's brow
     clears.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Books will tell me what I want to
               know.  Books will tell me all about
               you.

     He too gets up and follows the Young Man.



     AT THE WALL - LONG SHOT                                193

     The Young Man leading.  He reaches the wall and
     seizes an ancient curtain which covers it.  A
     cloud of dust rises as he tugs it aside and the
     curtain falls, almost crumbling.  Shelves and
     shelves of books are disclosed.  The books are
     old even though many of them have futuristic de-
     signs.  The bindings of once proud volumes hang in
     brown tatters.  The Time Traveller steps to the
     books.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                194

     The realization of the true state of affairs shows
     on his face.  He is appalled.  Carefully he pulls
     a volume from the shelf.  Its binding breaks as
     he opens it and, when his hand touches the pages,
     they crumple like ashes and drift to the floor.
     He drops the book.  His voice is a shocked WHISPER.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Yes...they do tell me all about you!

     With sudden violence he slams his fist into a whole
     shelf of books.  His hand plows through them and
     the dust swirls into the air.  He turns back in
     anger.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               What have you done?  Thousands of
               years of building and rebuilding
               creating and re-creating so that
               you can let it crumble to dust.

     With one hand he grabs the Young Man and shakes him.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               A million yesterdays of sensitive
               men dying for their dreams.  For
               what?  So you can swim and dance
               and play.

     He releases him and leaves.



     THE HALL - MOVING SHOT                                 195

     The Time Traveller stomps among the Eloi, hating
     them for their dissipation.

     Without emotion they watch him walk toward the
     entrance.  Only Weena jumps to her feet.  Her
     former indifference is gone.



     AT THE ENTRANCE                                        196

     From the top step, the Time Traveller looks down
     at them.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I am returning to my time!  Not to
               tell of the uselessness of the
               struggle - not to tell of the
               hopeless future - but only so that
               I can die among men!

     He turns and strides toward the door.



     EXT. ENTRANCE - MED. SHOT - (DUSK)                     197

     The Time Traveller bursts out of the building.  A
     moment later Weena appears in the archway.  She
     stands there, looking after him.

                                           DISSOLVE TO:



     EXT. FOREST - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT)                      198

     There are patches of mist and haze between the
     trees.  With a blazing torch the Time Traveller
     strides across.



     EXT. TIME TRAVELLER ON THE PATH - (NIGHT)              199

     Coming from the distance the CAMERA PANS HIM TO
     THE EDGE OF LAWN, where he stops short, jerking
     the pipe from his mouth, his eyes wide with con-
     sternation.  He raises the torch high to see:



     EXT. THE LAWN - FULL SHOT - (NIGHT)                    200

     There is no Time Machine.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                201

     In stunned shock.



     THE PATH - FULL SHOT                                   202

     Holding his torch high, the Time Traveller hurries
     toward the bushes around the edge of the lawn
     looking for his Machine, beating the branches with
     his free hand.  After he passes one of the bushes,
     a white indistinct creature dashes out of it and
     disappears in the darkness.  Unaware of this, the
     Time Traveller stops in the mindle of the lawn
     where the Machine was last seen.

     (NOTE:  The surrounding is suggestive of the spot
             where the Time Traveller's house once stood.)

     He looks about, slowly turning in a complete circle.
     Meanwhile the CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSE.  Then, sud-
     denly remembering, he digs his free hand into the
     pocket of his trouser, drawing out the lever he
     had removed and looks at it with self-assurance.
     Returning the lever to his pocket, he drops to his
     knees and by the light of his torch, scrutinizes
     the grass.



     THE GROUND - TIME TRAVELLER'S P.O.V.                   203

     The turf has been ripped in parallel grooves as
     though some heavy object had been dragged across.
     CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY FORWARD following these grooves
     and HALTS where small misshapen, half-human foot-
     prints stand out clearly in the freshly turned
     earth.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                           204

     He straightens slowly, his eyes narrowed.
     Nervously he looks around, then steps on follow-
     ing the grooves.



     BACK TO THE FOOTPRINTS                                 205

     THE CAMERA CONTINUES TO FOLLOW the grooves
     straight across the lawn to the flagstones around
     the white sphinx.  There are dark scratches on the
     stones leading to the wide panel in the base of
     the pedestal.  Here the marks end.



     AT THE PEDESTAL - MED. SHOT                            206

     The Time Traveller pauses, then gives the panel an
     exploratory KNOCK.  It responds with a HOLLOW SOUND.

     The Time Traveller thrusts his torch between the
     claws of the sphinx.  With both hands now free,
     he tries unsuccessfully to push the panel either
     to right or left or up or down.  Taking a penknife
     from his pocket, he runs the blade around the panel's
     edge hunting for a secret latch.  No success.

     Then he pauses, searching for a tool, and sees a
     loosened flagstone.  He picks it up.  With this
     heavy weight he batters the panel.  At each blow
     it RESOUNDS LOUDLY, not unlike a gong.  Four times
     he strikes, and then on the fifth blow the rock
     shatters in his hands.  He stops in despair.

     He senses he is under observation by an unseen
     presence.  Alarmed, he whips around then looks up
     to:



     THE SPHINX - LOW ANGLE - (MINIATURE OR MATTE)          208

     The marble face looks baleful, almost smiling in
     the torch light.



     BACK ON TIME TRAVELLER                                 209

     He turns and peers toward:



     THE BUSHES                                             210

     In the shadows, beyond reach of the light, is a
     wide semi-circle of luminous eyes, reflecting the
     flame of the torch.



     TIME TRAVELLER - FULL SHOT                             211-213

     He grabs his torch from the pedestal and slowly
     paces toward the nearest bush.  But as he ap-
     proaches, the glowing eyes vanish in the haze,
     followed by a ghostly impression of pale,
     fleeing creatures.

     The Time Traveller halts and turns in another
     direction.  The same thing happens.

     Then he has an idea.  Bending, he beats the torch
     against the moist soil and extinguishes it.  Now
     in the darkness he straightens and waits, peering
     around until he hears a twig CRACK, then moves
     into the deep shadow of a tall bush, looking off.



     THE PATH                                               214

     Through the mist in the foliage a pale figure
     approaches slowly.  It emerges onto the lawn.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                             215

     The CAMERA FOLLOWS as he leaps forward, grapples the
     other figure and bears it to earth.  For a moment
     there is a struggle and then the other figure lies
     perfectly still.  The Time Traveller rears back to
     get a look at it.



     THE FIGURE ON THE GROUND - EXTREME CLOSE SHOT          216

     It is Weena.  The moving shadow of the Time Traveller
     reveals her pale face, with closed eyes, wearing an
     expression of helpless terror.  She appears to be
     waiting for the inevitable end, but when it does
     not come, she slowly opens her eyes.  She sees the
     Time Traveller and her face records a wave of
     relief.

     The CAMERA WITHDRAWS TO TWO SHOT as the Time
     Traveller, embarrassed, helps her sit up.

                         WEENA
               I heard you pounding...I came to
               tell you...

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               How do you open that panel?

                         WEENA
               No one opens it.  Only the Morlocks.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Morlocks? - Who are the Morlocks?

     A look of fear comes into her eyes.  She drifts
     her gaze away from his, too frightened to answer.
     Gently he takes her by the shoulders and turns
     her to face him.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Why are you afraid of the Morlocks?

     Again Weena drops her eyes from him, but he cups
     his hand beneath her chin and tenderly turns her
     head back so that her eyes meet his.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Tell me.

                         WEENA
               When they call, we must go below.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Do the Morlocks live beneath the
               earth?
                    (Weena nods)
               Why must you obey their command?

                         WEENA
               They give us the food we eat, the
               clothes we wear.  We must do as
               they command.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               What happens to your people when
               they go below?

                         WEENA (repressing an in-
                    voluntary shudder)
               No one knows.  No one has ever
               returned.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (smiling
                    at her warmly, reassuringly)
               It won't happen to you.

     Weena looks up at him, her fears dwindling, find-
     ing comfort in this strange being whom she cannot
     understand.  Then she glances high into the dark sky
     and the old fear returns.

                         WEENA
               It is night.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Only children are frightened by
               the dark. - But then you are a
               child, aren't you?
                    (Weena glances around
                    warily into the shadows,
                    her anxiety mounting)
               I'll build a fire.

                         WEENA (taking his
                    hand, rises)
               Let us go from here.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (getting
                    up)
               I can't, child.
                    (walking toward the sphinx)
               My Machine is inside there, I
               intend to wait here 'til morning,
               then find some way of getting
               inside.

                         WEENA (catching up)
               No, you must not.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (stops,
                    then)
               Help me gather some wood.

     Reluctantly she helps him collect a few twigs which
     she hands over to him.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (picks
                    up dry branches)
               As a matter of fact, I'm from
               right here.
                    (gesturing)
               There's where my house stood many
               thousands of years ago.  Here - to
               that monument, was my laboratory.
               About there was my library where I
               once sat talking with friends about
               my Time Machine.

     Meanwhile, Weena has seated herself near the
     bushes in the f.g.

                    (continuing)
               I hoped to learn a great deal.  I

               the advancement, mankind made...
               instead what do I find?  Vegetables!

     Meanwhile a pair of pale, hairy hands rise slowly
     from behind her.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                             219

     With his back turned, he is piling up the sticks.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (continuing)
               The human race reduced to living
               vegetables!



     BACK TO WEENA                                          220

     The hairy hands grab her shoulders.  The fear
     paralyzes her.  She is unable to scream.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 221

     He is about to light a match, but finds he needs
     more wood.  Without turning he calls back to Weena.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Get me a few more twigs.

     When there is no answer he turns and looks.



     AT THE BUSHES                                          222

     Weena is gone.  The CAMERA ZIPS TO LEFT, then to
     RIGHT and finally STOPS on the limp legs of Weena
     slowly disappearing under the brush.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                           223

     We hear the RUSTLING OF BRANCHES and quick DIMINISHING
     FOOTSTEPS as the CAMERA RUSHES with the Time Traveller
     toward the bush.  He helps Weena to her feet and draws
     her to the pile of dry branches.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
                    (after calming her)
               What was it?

                         WEENA (low)
               Morlocks.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (strikes
                    match and holds it to twigs)
               This seems to keep them away.



     CLOSE ON WEENA                                         224

     She gazes into the fire, with fascination.  Slowly
     she raises her hand and reaches out to grasps the
     flame.



     TWO SHOT                                               225

     The Time Traveller grabs her hand.  It is almost
     too late.  She looks at her burned hand with more
     amazement than pain.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (while
                    examining her hand)
               What ever made you put your hand in
               the fire?

                         WEENA
               I never saw it before.

     Apparently no harm done, the Time Traveller releases
     her hand.  He shakes his head in amazement and sits
     down beside her.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
                    (after a long silence)
               Do you know that the first thing
               which separated man from the rest
               of the mammals was his knowledge of
               fire?
                    (he looks at her)
               No, I suppose you don't.
                    (pokes at fire)
               The next great stride came with
               the discovery of the wheel.
                    (turns to her)
               Do you know what that is?
                    (she shakes her head)
               I'm sorry I was angry with your
               people.  I had no right to be.
               No more than if I had visited the
               Island of Bali in my own time.
               You were safe inside your great
               house, yet you came out into the
               night to warn me.  The one
               characteristic which distinguished
               man from the animal kingdom was the
               spirit of self sacrifice.  You have
               that quality, Girl.  I'm sure all
               of your people have it.  All it
               requires is someone to reawaken it.
               I shall try if you'll let me.  Will
               you?

                         WEENA
               I do not understand you, but I
               believe you.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               That's a good start. - Now try to
               tell me...who or what are the Morlocks?
                    (Weena looks at him blankly)
               Are they people or animals?
                    (her expression remains unchanged)
               What do you know about yourself?  The
               past?  Don't your people ever speak
               of the past?

                         WEENA
               There is no past.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Don't you ever wonder about the future?

                         WEENA
               There is no future.



     ANOTHER ANGLE                                          226

     The Time Traveller is staring into the fire stirring
     the glowing embers as he speaks slowly and with
     compassion, hoping to arouse some feeling within
     her, even though she may not grasp the meaning of
     the words.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Man's past is mainly a grim struggle
               for survival, but there have been
               moments when a few voices have spoken
               up.  These rare moments have made the
               history of man a glorious thing.  I
               refuse to believe it is dead and gone.
               We've had our dark ages before and
               this is only another of them.  All
               you need is for someone to show you
               the way out. - I'm only a tinkering
               mechanic, but there must be this
               hidden spark in one of your people.
               If I can only kindle that spark, my
               coming here will have some meaning.

     During his speech Weena has cuddled close to him,
     her cheek touching his knee.  He looks down at her
     and sees he has made a friend.  He places his hand
     gently on her hair.  She looks up, her eyes no
     longer showing fear.  Their faces are illuminated
     by the dancing flames.



     THE FIRE - CLOSE SHOT                                  227

     It CRACKLES reassuringly.

                                     SLOW DISSOLVE TO:



     EXT. WELL - FULL SHOT - (DAY)                          228

     The ring of flames from the previous scene is
     seemingly replaced by a dark, circular shaft from
     which comes the low THROBBING of some GIANT
     MACHINES, pounding, beating monotonously.  The
     CAMERA MOVES BACK to include the LANDSCAPE
     where more wells are visible in the distance,
     each surrounded by a low, porcelain wall.  Their
     roofs are shining brass-like disks.

     Across the field, from the direction of the sphinx,
     approach the Time Traveller, carrying his jacket
     over his shoulder, and a few steps behind, Weena.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               My efforts next morning to open the
               panel were fruitless.  I had to find
               another way to retrieve my Machine.

     Weena, concerned, stands back as the Time Traveller
     walks up to the well in the f.g. and peers down into:



     THE SHAFT - HIGH ANGLE                                 229

     It descends into darkness, but near the top can be
     seen handholds in an irregular pattern.  The
     THROBBING OF MACHINES is ominous.



     AT THE MOUTH OF WELL - FULL SHOT                       230

     The Time Traveller in the f.g. turns back to Weena.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Listen!
                    (pause)
               Do you hear?

                         WEENA (fearfully)
               Yes.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Machines!

                         WEENA
               No...Morlocks.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
                    (straightening, amazed)
               You mean those animals run machines?

                         WEENA
               They are Morlocks.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
                    (as he walks to her)
               I know, but have you seen the
               machines?



     CLOSE ON WEENA                                         231

     She shakes her head.

                         WEENA
               No, only heard of them.

     The CAMERA EASES BACK to include the Time Traveller
     as he reaches her.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Who told you?

                         WEENA
               The talking rings.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
                    (moves closer to her)
               What sort of rings?

                         WEENA
                    (with a shrug)
               Rings that talk.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Can you show me these rings?

     Weena nods and starts off.  He follows her.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:



     INT. GREAT HALL - FULL SHOT - (DAY)                    232

     Deserted, until Weena leads the Time Traveller past
     the tables toward the shelves of crumbling books
     that the Young Man had previously shown him.

     She enters an archway and walks up a dark stone
     corridor.  He follows.



     INT. STONE CORRIDOR - MED. SHOT                        233

     Weena leading the Time Traveller up the corridor
     where it veers sharply to the right.  They disappear
     around the corner.



     INT. GREEN MUSEUM - LONG SHOT - (DAY) - (MATTE)        234

     The Time Traveller and Weena stop at the threshold of
     a huge museum-like room, all done in a greenish
     colored porcelain-like substance.  There are no
     windows, but the vaulted ceiling has a transparent
     dome where the sun's rays, changing with the course
     of day, illuminate the entire museum.  It is
     evidently a place that no one bothers to visit.



     TIME TRAVELLER & WEENA - MOVING SHOT                   235

     Their feet kick up small flurries of dust as they
     walk among exhibitions of a long bygone era still
     existent behind plastic.  Some of the cases are
     broken and their contents, exposed to the atmos-
     phere, have decayed, crumbled to dust.  We recognize
     objects and machines, some belonging to the early
     part of the twentieth century and still others take
     on the forms and shapes that the audience of today
     will recognize as contemporary.  Then they pass
     cabinets that hold objects of a time far beyond
     comprehension.

     Weena finally leads the Time Traveller to a broken
     case which contains several boxes of golden rings
     a few inches in diameter and one inch wide, lined
     with minutely spaced grooves.  He picks up the
     nearest box and examines its contents.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
                    (picking up a ring)
               Are these the talking rings?

                         WEENA
               Yes.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               They speak?

                         WEENA
               Yes.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Of what?

                         WEENA
               Things no one here understands.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               How do you get it to talk?

     Weena takes the ring from the Time Traveller and
     lays it on a smooth topped porcelain block on its
     edge, like a coin, and spins it like a top.



     INSERT:  WHIRLING RING                                 236

     A VOICE emerges from the spinning ring as the current
     of air flows through its grooves, much like a phono-
     graph needle evokes sound as it plays through the
     surface of one of our records.

                         VOICE FROM RING
               Whomsoever chances upon these rings
               will probably hear the last recorded
               voice of civilized man.  This is the
               year four thousand eight hundred and
               twenty-nine.



     TWO SHOT                                               237

     The Time Traveller is listening in fascination and
     Weena in disinterested detachment.

                         VOICE FROM RING (cont'd)
               The war between the East and West,
               which is now in its three hundredth
               and twenty-sixth year has at last
               come to an end.  There is nothing
               left to fight with and few of us
               left to fight.  The atmosphere has
               become so polluted with deadly
               germs that it can no longer be
               breathed.  There is no place on
               this planet that is immune.  The
               last surviving factory for the
               manufacture of oxygen has been
               destroyed.  Stockpiles are rapidly
               diminishing and when they are gone,
               we must die...

     The last few WORDS DECREASE IN VOLUME and FADE AWAY.
     The Time Traveller eagerly reaches into the case for
     the second ring and spins it.

                         ANOTHER VOICE FROM RING
               This is the last day.  We, the last
               to survive, have had our final meeting.
               We have decided to split into two
               groups.  Each man and woman has made
               his own decision.  Some have chosen
               to take refuge in the great caverns
               and find a new way of life far down
               below the earth's surface.  The rest
               of us have decided to take our chances
               in the sunlight, small as those chances
               may be.

     The VOICE from the ring DWINDLES and is heard no
     more.  The Time Traveller quickly picks up the
     third and last ring and spins it.  NO WORDS are
     heard -- only the SOUND of MARCHING FOOTSTEPS over
     floors of stone -- then a deadly SILENCE.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                238

     As he watches the last ring spin to a standstill.
     Over this:

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               From the talking rings I learned how
               the human race divided itself and
               how the world of the Eloi and Morlocks
               began.

     He turns.



     GREEN MUSEUM - LONG SHOT                               239

     The Time Traveller paces across the hall.  Weena
     hurries after him.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               By some quirk of fate the Morlocks
               had become the masters and the Eloi
               their servants.  The Morlocks main-
               tained them and bred them like cattle
               only to take them below when they
               reached maturity, which explained why
               there were no older people along them.

     They exit.



     GREAT HALL - FULL SHOT                                 240

     The Time Traveller, followed by Weena, walks from
     the book shelves toward the entrance.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               Now I knew I must go below.  It was
               the only means of finding a way up
               into the sphinx to reach my Machine
               and to find out what happened to the
               little people when they went below.

     They leave the Great Hall.



     EXT. LANDSCAPE - FULL SHOT - (DAY)                     241

     The Time Traveller strides toward one of the wells.
     Weena senses his intention and catches up with him
     to grasp his arm.

                         WEENA
               No...don't go...please.

     He shakes her off.



     AT MOUTH OF WELL - MED. SHOT                           242

     The Time Traveller places his jacket on the wall.
     Then into the well he drops a dry leaf which, instead
     of fluttering slowly down, is at once sucked out of
     sight by the current from the shaft.  Then he looks
     around and finds a pebble, drops it down the well and
     listens.

     After a PLOP is heard he puts his arm down the
     shaft as far as it goes, feeling its surface, then
     throws his leg over the porcelain wall and starts
     to descend.  Weena rushes to his side to stop him.

                         WEENA
               You will not come back.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I'll be back.

     Weena shakes her head and, as though giving him
     a farewell gift, thrusts a large blossom into his
     pocket.  The Time Traveller smiles as he dis-
     appears.



     FROM THROAT OF WELL - LOW ANGLE                        243

     Locking from below, the top of the well appears
     like a small blue disk with Weena peering down.
     The Time Traveller gropes his way.

     Suddenly from the far distance comes the SOUND of
     LOW but POWERFUL SIREN.  Weena straightens.



     CLOSE ON WEENA                                         244

     An expression of fear comes slowly over her face
     as the LOW SIREN is joined by ANOTHER of HIGHER
     PITCH.  The Two make a grating dissonance.  Slowly
     she turns in the direction of the sound.



     BACK WITH TIME TRAVELLER                               245

     He looks up, concerned, pausing in his descent.



     BACK TO WEENA                                          246

     As the THIRD DISCORDANT BLAST joins the other two,
     Weena's fear is gone.  In its place is an expres-
     sion of utter resignation.  Like someone in a
     trance she opens her eyes and stares straight
     ahead.  Then, as though she is summoning all her
     strength to go through some ordeal, she starts
     walking away.  The CAMERA PANS and we see the breeze
     ripple her silken robe about her as she moves.

     (NOTE:  During the above and throughout the follow-
             ing sequence the dirge-like WHISTLES
             CONTINUE, ECHOING mournfully.)



     REVERSE SHOT                                           247

     Weena is walking forward and disappears behind the
     trees as the Time Traveller emerges from the well
     in the b.g.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                248

     Looking for Weena.  She is nowhere to be seen.
     His face shows exasperation, bewilderment.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Weena!  Where are you, Girl?



     WEENA - FULL SHOT                                      249

     She continues to walk toward the source of the
     SIRENS.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                           250

     The DIRGE-LIKE MELODY becomes LOUDER, pulsating,
     as he pauses to watch:



     EXT. EDGE OF FOREST - LONG SHOT - (DAY)                251

     Emerging from the forest are two Eloi, a man and
     a woman.  They are several paces apart and pay no
     attention to one another.  Both have exactly the
     same manner as Weena.  They walk along, eyes
     straight ahead, faces expressionless.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                252

     As he looks ahead, then left and right, searching.



     VARIOUS GROUPS OF ELOI - (SPLIT?)                      253-254

     In the open country now, the forest behind them.
     In their colorful robes, the Eloi march slowly
     across the green landscape.

     All are converging toward a single point somewhere
     ahead.



     WEENA AMONG ELOI                                       255

     They walk close together, paying no attention to one
     another, following the command of the MELANCHOLY
     STRAINS OF THE SIRENS.



     BACK ON TIME TRAVELLER                                 256

     His concern has turned to apprehension as he tries
     to grasp the meaning of what he observes.



     EXT. THE SIRENS ON THE SPHINX - FULL SHOT - (DAY)      257
     (MINIATURE)

     It is the source of the sound.  There are little
     bursts of vapor from the tops of the sirens as
     they repeat their tones, like a fantastic pipe
     organ behind the Sphinx.



     TIME TRAVELLER AND ELOI                                258

     All of them walk in the same direction.  The Time
     Traveller looks this way and that, bewildered.
     But the Eloi disregard him and march straight
     ahead, eyes forward.

     The Time Traveller breaks into a run.



     TWO SHOT                                               259

     The Time Traveller overtakes the Young Man, seizes
     his arm and jerks him to a halt.  Around them pass
     the shadows of the marching Eloi.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               What's happening?  Tell me!

     The Young Man shows no emotion as he struggles to
     free himself.  His movements are almost mechanical.
     This unnerves the Time Traveller.  He stares at
     him, releasing his grip.

     The moment the Young Man is free, he faces about
     and continues his march.  The Time Traveller re-
     mains motionless, watching him go.  The ECHOING
     SIRENS are now getting on his nerves.



     EXT. ENTRANCE TO THE GREAT BUILDING - LONG SHOT -      260
     (DAY)

     The Eloi pour out of the Great Hall, walking in
     a trance-like state.



     EXT. LANDSCAPE - EXTREME LONG SHOT - (DAY) - (SPLIT?)  261

     From all directions the Eloi in their bright robes
     are moving, singly and in long files.  The impres-
     sion is one of vastness -- a feeling that mankind
     is marching to some unknown doom.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                           262

     He spots a girl, rushes up, grabs her from behind.
     But it is not Weena.  Disappointed, he releases
     her, then goes on again, covering his ears with
     his palms, fighting to retain command of his own
     reason.



     SEVERAL SHOTS OF THE SIRENS - (MINIATURE)              263-265

     At various angles -- up, sideways, tilted.  The
     WAILING is DEAFENING.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                266

     He still strives to control himself, moves forward,
     then pauses in amazement, looking straight ahead.



     EXT. THE SPHINX - FULL SHOT - (DAY) - (MATTE)          267

     It is toward the white sphinx that the Eloi have
     been marching.  But now the panel, upon which the
     Time Traveller had pounded so hard, is wide open,
     revealing a dark entrance into the pedestal.

     And despite their previous repugnance to the
     Sphinx, all of the people are now marching across
     the lawn resolutely to it.



     AT THE PEDESTAL - LONG SHOT                            268

     The Young Man is the first to reach it.  He enters
     the wide opening and starts descending into sub-
     terranean darkness.  Others follow, Weena among
     them.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (o.s.)
               Weena!

     Without hearing him she passes through the entrance.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                           269

     He desperately pushes forward, elbowing his way
     past others in his haste to overtake Weena.  The
     crowd impedes his progress and he shoves the
     Eloi impatiently aside as he fights on.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (shouts in
                    despair)
               Weena!



     THE PANEL                                              270

     Slowly closing and the sound of the SIRENS gradually
     DIES AWAY.  The Time Traveller reaches the panel as
     it shuts tight before he can touch it.  He spreads
     his palms against it in despair, then turns to face
     those Eloi who, like him, are locked outside.  What
     he sees astonishes him.



     GROUP OF ELOI                                          271

     They no longer approach the sphinx.  The ceasing of
     the sirens seems to have released them from their
     hypnotic spell and now, awake again and frightened,
     they are retreating.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 272

     As he goes after them to the edge of the flagstones
     and calls out angrily.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Stop!



     BACK TO ELOI                                           273

     Featuring the Man in White in the f.g.  They halt
     and stare back.  The Time Traveller's voice comes
     over like a whip.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (o.s.)
               What are you running from?

     None of the Eloi answer.



     TOWARD THE SPHINX - FULL SHOT                          274

     Beyond several Eloi the Time Traveller stands in
     the shadow of the white sphinx.  He steps slowly
     forward onto the lawn, looking around the big
     semi-circle of his audience.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (sharply,
                    gesturing back toward the panel)
               Where have they gone?
                    (no answer)
               What happens to them?
                    (no answer)
               Don't stand there like a fatted
               cattle grazing contentedly in lush
               pastures. - Answer me!  What's
               wrong?

                         MAN IN WHITE (calmly)
               There is nothing wrong.  It is all
               clear.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               What do you mean, all clear?

                         MAN IN WHITE (repeating)
               All clear!

                         TIME TRAVELLER (thinking
                    rapidly, talking to himself)
               Once....in the middle nineteen
               hundreds I heard a man...
                    (it bursts upon him)
               The falling bombs!
                    (to the Man in white
                    and the crowd)
               That's over.  Gone.  Dead for
               hundreds of thousand of years.
               There are no more flying machines.
               No bombs.  No wars!

                         MAN IN WHITE
               Yes, the rings have told us that
               story.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MED SHOT                              275

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               But you didn't listen.  You didn't
               learn anything.  All that is left
               is fear...a blind animal fear.
               Ages ago men were taught to hide in
               the ground when the sirens blew...
               taught to run from a raining death...
               but those men are dead!  And so are
               the men who slaughtered them.  Don't
               you understand?
                    (looks around pleadingly)
               You are slaves of a dead past... You
               don't even own your souls.  You're
               led to slaughter like sheep!

                         MAN IN WHITE (o.s.)
               But there is nothing to fear now,
               it's all clear.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               What about those who went below?
               How are they to come back?



     MAN IN WHITE                                           276

     He looks ominously at the Time Traveller.

                         MAN IN WHITE
               They never come back.  Nobody can
               bring them back.

     Unimpressed, the crowd begins to disperse, the Man
     in White following them.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 277

     Calling after them.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               You can try.  Won't any of you
               even try?

     He sees that the situation is hopeless.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (almost
                    to himself)
               Well, someone has to try!

     He runs off.



     SERIES OF SHOTS                                        278

     The Time Traveller running through the forest.         (a)

     He is laboring up the open hillside.                   (b)

     The Eloi in a semi-circle silently watch.  A few       (c)
     of them hesitantly start after the Time Traveller.



     EXT. THE WELL - FULL SHOT - (DAY)                      279

     Arriving, the Time Traveller pauses to catch his
     breath, picks up a piece of wood that could serve
     as a torch, then jumps over the wall and starts
     to descend.

     Over this a faint THROBBING OF MACHINES can be
     heard.



     SHOOTING INTO SHAFT - HIGH ANGLE                       280

     The Time Traveller climbs down, gripping the walls
     with his hands and feet.  The depth beneath him is
     dizzying.  THROBBING LOUDER.



     IN THE WELL - FULL SHOT                                281

     As the Time Traveller descends, the CAMERA FOLLOWS
     him, step after step.  The deeper he goes, the darker
     it becomes and the THROBBING OF MACHINES INCREASES as
     well.

     Suddenly a rock gives beneath his weight.  He barely
     saves himself.  Not without fear he pauses to rest,
     glancing upward.



     FROM THE THROAT OF WELL - LOW ANGLE                    282

     A couple of the curious Eloi peer downward, watching
     the Time Traveller's progress.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 283

     A metal ladder affixed to the wall brings him finally
     to the opening of a transverse passageway.  In almost
     complete darkness he steps from the ladder into the
     tunnel and pauses to take the piece of wood from his
     belt, but decides not to light it.  He bends and peers
     ahead.



     INT. GREAT CAVERN - FULL SHOT                          283X1

     The Time Traveller emerges onto the bridge in the b.g.,
     pausing for a moment to survey the surroundings, then
     starts slowly down the staircase carved along the wall.
     The gloom is relieved only by puffing smoke and waver-
     ing lights, revealing occasionally vague shapes and
     grotesque shadows.

     (NOTE:  DRIPPING WATER from the walls and THROBBING OF
             MACHINES punctuate the desolation of this
             scene as well as the following sequence.)



     CLOSE ON T.T. - MOVING SHOT                            283X2

     Walking, he notices an opening ahead and cautiously
     moves toward:



     INT. ENTRANCE TO FEASTING ROOM - FULL SHOT             283X3

     At the threshold of this dark, silent cell the T.T.
     pauses, then slowly enters.  Behind him, across the
     cavern, an indistinct figure watches, but quickly
     disappears as the T.T. strikes a match.  The sight
     that the T.T. beholds fills him with revulsion and
     horror.



     THE FEASTING ROOM - T.T.'S P.O.V.                      283X4

     This is obviously a feasting place of the Morlocks.
     In the flickering light we see stone tables and
     scattered around the floor far below the unmistak-
     able remains of human bones after the flesh has been
     carnivorously picked away.

                         T.T.'S VOICE
               So, this was the destiny of the
               Eloi.



     CLOSE ON T.T.                                          283X5

     His features twisted in horror in the flickering
     light of his match.

                         T.T.'S VOICE
                    (continuing)
               They were being bred like cattle
               by the Morlocks who had degenerated
               into the lowest form of human
               life...cannibalism.

     The match dies between his fingers.  Suppressing a
     shudder, the T.T. turns and as he leaves this chamber
     of horror, the rock behind him comes to life.  A pale,
     spectral Morlock crosses the screen in the f.g.
     descending.  Another in the b.g. does likewise.



     MACHINES - FULL SHOT                                   283X6

     Morlocks, their indistinct bodies obscene in their
     mockery of the human form, labor endlessly tending
     the needs of their machinery.  They look up toward the
     intruder as they HEAR his APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS, then
     hide.



     STAIRWAY - MOVING SHOT                                 283X7

     The T.T. slowly descends the slender stone stairway
     that hugs the sheer wall.  Meanwhile at the base of
     the feasting room under the stairway on which the T.T.
     is moving a Morlock moves a curtain aside and reveals
     itself.  It silently watches as another Morlock
     appears at the top of the stairs and follows.

     Passing near the T.T.'s hiding place.  Weena and the
     Young Man are side by side.



     AT THE MACHINES                                        283X16

     The Morlocks who followed the T.T. are closing in.



     BACK TO T.T. - MOVING SHOT                             283X17

     He is unaware of the Morlocks behind him.  Hugging
     the rock, he makes his way to the closest possible
     point where he can still remain unobserved by the
     herding Morlocks and get Weena's attention.  He
     reaches out.

                         T.T.
               Weena!

     But she continues on with complete resignation to her
     fate.  Unmindful of his own safety, he leaves his hid-
     ing place and grasps her by the shoulders.

                         T.T.
                    (shaking her)
               Girl!
                    (he turns and grasps the
                    passing Young Man)
               Come to your senses!  All of you!

     As the T.T. pulls Weena toward the staircase, the
     Young Man follows.



     FOOT OF STAIRWAY                                       283X18

     The CAMERA MOVES with the T.T., Weena and the Young
     Man as they are forced to retreat.



     AT ENTRANCE OF FEASTING ROOM                           283X20

     Where other Morlocks with CRACKING WHIPS herd the Eloi
     into the chamber of horrors.

     One of the Morlocks spots the T.T., Weena and the
     Young Man.  He swings his whip.



     BACK TO THREE SHOT                                     283X21

     The CAMERA MOVES with them as vicious CRACKING
     WHIPS drive them back to the entrance of the
     feasting room.



     TWO SHOT                                               283X22

     The T.T. tries to protect Weena.  Suddenly a long
     lash of a whip strikes like a serpent and coils
     about the T.T.'s neck.  He drops his unlit torch
     and whirls in pain.

     Another whip scares Weena into the chamber of
     horrors, while several other whips land on the T.T.'s
     shoulders.  Finally he grabs the whip from around
     his neck and jerks it, wrenching it free.



     AT THE ENTRANCE OF FEASTING ROOM                       283X23

     The T.T., wielding the whip fiercely, drives the
     Morlocks back several paces, then suddenly from
     above a pale body of a Morlock lands on him,
     knocking him down, causing him to drop the whip.
     On the ground the cowardly Morlock stumbles
     away leaving the T.T. a prey to the battery of
     CRACKING WHIPS.  He crawls in pain into the
     chamber of horrors.



     GROUPSHOT INSIDE FEASTING ROOM                         283X24

     The T.T. comes to his feet among the Eloi.  The
     WHIPS HAVE STOPPED, then the silence is broken by
     the GROWL of approaching MORLOCKS.  Through the
     curtains, dark shapes swarm toward them.  Then
     suddenly the T.T. pulls out his matchbox from his
     pocket.  A match flares!



     GROUP OF MORLOCKS                                      283X25

     In the glare of yellow light we see the leprous
     figures of blinded Morlocks, dropping their whips,
     shielding their eyes.



     THROUGH MORLOCKS'S EYES - (OPTICAL EFFECT)             283X26

     The T.T.'s hand with the burning match rapidly zooms
     into the center of the picture in a BLINDING FLASH
     turning the screen momentarily white, then yellow
     and red.  Then the CAMERA MOVES BACK indicating the
     Morlocks' retreat.  Slowly the normal colors
     reappear.



     BACK TO THE GROUP OF MORLOCKS                          283X27

     Regaining their sight in the darkness, they start
     to close in.



     THROUGH MORLOCKS'S EYES - (OPTICAL EFFECT)             283X28

     Followed by the Eloi the T.T. exits the feasting
     room and again lights a match.  A BLINDING FLASH
     starting from the flame as a center engulfs the screen,
     momentarily white again, then yellow, finally red.
     Once more the CAMERA RETREATS, then still seeing
     through the Morlocks' eyes the CAMERA ZOOMS CLOSE
     ON THE MATCH BOX and the scaley hand of a Morlock
     slaps all the matches except one to the floor.



     T.T. - MED. SHOT                                       283X29

     He lights his last match and moves forward, looking
     for his lost torch.



     GROUPSHOT                                              283X30

     The T.T. leads the Eloi toward the stairway, the
     light of the match his only weapon in keeping the
     Morlocks away.  Finally he spots his torch and
     picks it up hurriedly.



     CLOSE ON T.T.                                          283X31

     His face streams with sweat and is taut with appre-
     hension while he applies the dying match to the
     intended torch.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (muttering)
               Burn, will you!

     He holds the match steady, but it burns lower and
     lower without starting the wood.  In despair he
     turns to Weena.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Quick, something to burn!  It's
               my last match!



     BACK TO THE MORLOCKS                                   283X32

     As they are closing in.



     CLOSE ON WEENA                                         283X33

     With a fierce gesture she rips open the loose sleeve
     of her robe, tears off a piece of cloth and holds
     it out.



     BACK TO T.T.                                           283X34

     As match is about to die, he holds it beneath the
     cloth.  It flames up and he seizes it, dropping the
     dead match.

     He holds the burning cloth beneath the wood and
     in this hotter flame it begins to burn.  Once it
     starts he again attempts to make his way by blind-
     ing the Morlocks and leads the Eloi to the stairway.



     GROUPSHOT                                              283X35

     As the Eloi slowly make their way toward the stairway,
     one Morlock gains courage, and with his long whip
     strikes the torch out of the T.T.'s hand.



     A CORNER                                               283X36

     The torch rolls in and begins to sputter.



     BACK TO SCENE                                          283X37

     The Eloi huddle against the wall in terror as other
     Morlocks gain courage and move forward toward the
     T.T.  As they face one another, the fight begins.



     [PAGE 90 MISSING FROM HARD COPY]



     Eloi below him.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Weena!  Weena, get the torch!



     CLOSE SHOT - WEENA AND YOUNG MAN                       351X5

     Huddled against rock - React to fight - Weena
     looks quickly toward the Time Traveller, then
     turns searching for the flickering torch.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 351X6

     As he turns to fight with Morlock on ledge.
     Morlock swings at him.  He ducks and almost
     falls off ledge.  He grabs Morlock, and hangs
     on until he can scramble up on ledge again.
     He clutches at Morlock's throat, banging his
     head against the rock wall, finally throwing
     him off ledge.  At the same time another Mor-
     lock appears on ledge, while the Morlock he
     had previously kicked rises to menace him from
     the other side.  The Time Traveller jumps across
     cavern to ramp and starts down toward the floor,
     trying to get back to his torch, his only weapon
     against the Morlocks.



     CLOSE SHOT - THE TIME TRAVELLER                        351X7

     He pauses momentarily against Rock Wall.  He
     sees Eloi, still huddled in a group, apparently
     too confused to move.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Weena!  Go on!  Go on the
               steps!



     CLOSE SHOT - AT ROCK - WEENA AND YOUNG MAN             351X8

     Weena spots the still flickering torch and
     starts toward it.



     INSERT OF TORCH                                        351X9

     Lying on ground, still burning, Weena bends
     down to pick up torch, when suddenly a Morlock
     appears facing her.  She screams and jumps back,
     watching in terror, as the Morlock comes toward
     her.



     MED. SHOT                                              351X10

     The Time Traveller comes down ramp to meet several
     Morlocks converging on him.  He tries to fight his
     way past them.



     CLOSE SHOT - WEENA AND YOUNG MAN                       351X11

     Morlock rushes in, grabs Weena and carrying her
     over his shoulder starts across toward Feasting
     Cave.



     MED. SHOT - TIME TRAVELLER                             351X12

     JUMPS up on ramp, kicks back at Morlocks - sees
     Morlock carrying Weena - JUMPS through Morlocks
     and runs toward her.



     FULL SHOT                                              351X13

     The Time Traveller runs to Weena, pulls her away
     from Morlock, knocks him against rock.  In the
     meantime another Morlock runs up on rock and
     jumps at Time Traveller, knocking him down.
     The second Morlock rebounds from rock and leaps
     on the Time Traveller and starts to choke him.



     CLOSE SHOT - TIME TRAVELLER                            351X14

     Looks up toward YOUNG MAN - silently appeals for
     help.



     CLOSE SHOT - YOUNG MAN                                 351X15

     Stancing in front of group of Eloi returns the
     Time Traveller's silent plea for help.  Slowly
     raises his right hand, stares at it as he
     gradually clenches it into a fist.  Then, making
     up his mind, raises both hands and strikes Mor-
     lock hard on the back of his neck.



     MED. SHOT                                              351X16

     As Morlock relaxes his grip the Time Traveller
     kicks him back to rock, scrambles up and runs
     to get his torch.  Several Morlocks try to herd
     Eloi back into Feasting Cave, but led by the
     Young Man and his newly discovered strength, the
     Eloi resist them.  The Time Traveller runs back
     in with torch, and herd the Eloi toward stairs.



     FULL SHOT                                              351X17

     The Time Traveller urges the Eloi up the stairs
     pushing Weena ahead of him.  They climb up past
     Cauldron.  Morlocks come in after fleeing Eloi,
     shielding their eyes from the light of the Time
     Traveller's torch.



     CLOSER SHOT                                            351X18

     The Time Traveller looks ahead to be sure the
     Eloi are all on their way out.  Then turns back
     and drops his torch into the oil flowing into
     the Cauldron.



     FULL SHOT                                              351X19

     The burning torch catches the Cauldron on
     fire, which quickly spreads across the floor
     of the Cavern, to the steaming Machine on
     the right, which explodes.  The Time Traveller
     herds Eloi out across Stone Bridge.



     MED. SHOT                                              351X20

     Pursuing Morlock runs up steps in back of
     burning Cauldron hiding his face from the
     flames.  He bumps into the Pipe coming down
     the wall, loses his balance and falls into
     the burning Cauldron - Flames shoot higher.



     PAN SHOT                                               351X21

     Another Morlock comes from behind machine, as
     fire creeps across floor, almost reaches machine
     at same time as fire - and it explodes.  Morlock
     catches fire and runs across into Feasting Cave.



     PASSAGEWAY - LONG SHOT                                 352

     Smoke is thick as the Time Traveller and Weena
     run toward a circle of light on the floor far
     ahead.



     CIRCLE OF LIGHT - HIGH ANGLE                           353

     Weena and the Time Traveller reach the light
     that comes straight down from above, and look
     up the shaft.  Smoke belches from the passage-
     way as he helps her start up the ladder and
     then he, himself, follows, clambering out of
     sight.



     IN THE WELL                                            354

     The CAMERA FOLLOWS Weena and the Time Traveller
     climbing up, COUGHING from smoke.  The light
     becomes slowly brighter and he looks up.



     FROM THROAT OF WELL - LOW ANGLE                        355

     Gradually the top of the well becomes visible
     through the swirling smoke.  The Young Man is
     peering down.  He reaches to help Weena and the
     Time Traveller.



     SHOOTING INTO SHAFT - HIGH ANGLE                       356

     Weena and the Time Traveller are both dark with
     soot, near exhaustion.  Far below them red flames
     pierce through the smoke.  They each in turn grasp
     the helping hand of the Young Man and climb up out
     of the well.



     EXT. THE WELL - MED. SHOT - (SUNSET)                   357

     As their eyes meet, the Time Traveller grips the
     Young Man's shoulder and gives it a brief shake
     of approval.

     The Time Traveller then grabs up branches and twigs,
     carries them to the mouth of the well, ignites the
     pile of kindling with his torch and drops the burn-
     ing wood down in to the well.



     SHOOTING INTO SHAFT - HIGH ANGLE                       358

     The burning wood drops to the bottom where it ignites
     the oil with a burst of flame that shoots up the well.



     BACK TO SCENE                                          359

     The Time Traveller picks up his jacket and points to
     the other wells.  The Young Man first, then the rest of
     the Eloi grasp the idea.  They also light branches
     from the torch and dash for the various wells to
     duplicate the Time Traveller's action.



     VARIOUS SHOTS OF ELOI                                  360-362

     Carrying bundles of burning wood to the mouths of
     wells and dumping the fire below.



     TWO SHOT                                               363

     With Weena at his side, the Time Traveller gazes on
     with approval at the Eloi's work.



     EXT. LANDSCAPE - FULL SHOT - (SUNSET)                  364

     It is dotted with wells, each of which has been
     turned into a fiery furnace shooting flames and
     smoke up from the burning oil below, preventing
     the Morlocks from any avenue of escape to the
     surface of the Earth.



     A WELL - (MINIATURE)                                   365

     It falls with a CRASH to the ground and begins to
     spew smoke and flame into the undergrowth of the
     forest nearby.



     EXT. ENTRANCE TO GREAT BUILDING - LONG SHOT -          366
     (SUNSET)

     Smoke drifts out of its windows.  The Eloi hurry
     out, led by the Man in White.  They stop and stare
     at the sight of the Morlock world being destroyed
     below.



     EXT. THE BLAZING FOREST - (SUNSET) - (STOCK)           367-368

     The sun on the horizon is a dim red ball through
     the smoke.  Several trees fall over, blazing.  LOW
     UNDERGROUND RUMBLING is heard.



     WEENA AND THE TIME TRAVELLER                           369

     They start down the hill after the Eloi, seeking
     safety together.  Suddenly a DISTANT RUMBLE OF THE
     EARTH makes them pause and look o.s.



     EXT. LANDSCAPE - FULL SHOT - (DUSK) - (MINIATURE)      370

     Then comes a SERIES OF TREMBLORS, each more powerful
     than the one before.  The earth shudders and the
     blazing forest begins to collapse.  It does
     not explode into the air.  Rather, the solid
     earth seems to give way so that the entire
     surface of the ground begins to fall into the
     subterranean chambers.



     ANOTHER ANGLE - (MINIATURE)                            371

     A section of the earth sheers away and falls
     in an ever widening rift.



     A WELL - (MINIATURE)                                   372

     As it is swallowed by the earth, followed by a
     belch of steam.



     BACK TO LANDSCAPE - (MINIATURE)                        373

     Leveled off by the earthquake.  There are no more
     flowers, no more buildings, wells, smokestacks or
     obelisks.  There is no movement -- only the
     flickering of low flames and the smoke driven by
     the gentle breeze.



     GROUP OF ELOI                                          374

     Staring into the vast destruction.



     TIME TRAVELLER AND WEENA                               375

     He holds her hand.  The CAMERA MOVES IN SLOWLY and
     we begin to hear the

                      TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
                 (calmly)
             The underworld of the Morlocks was
             gone...and so was the life of leisure
             for the Eloi.

     He looks o.s.



     GROUP OF ELOI                                          376

     The Man in White, with others, approaches the group
     headed by the Young Man.  The two men look at each
     other, their gestures and expressions showing their
     joy at release from centuries of fear.

                      TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
             From now on they would have to work
             to survive.  And looking at their
             faces, I somehow knew that they could
             start over again.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER AND WEENA                       377

     He looks down to Weena and we HEAR:

                      TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
             Another night was coming, but this
             night no Eloi needed to fear.

     The CAMERA MOVES CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER who looks
     up in concern.

                      TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
             But what of me? - I was imprisoned
             in a world in which I did not belong.

                                  DISSOLVE TO:



     EXT. THE POOL - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT)                    378

     This is the same pool where the Time Traveller
     saved Weena's life.  The peaceful SOUND of the
     RUSHING STREAM is occasionally interrupted by a
     REMOTE RUMBLE of EXPLOSION from the earth below.

     There is no sign in the sky of old constellations,
     only the face of the full moon looks familiar.
     The Time Traveller, wearing his velvet jacket,
     relaxes on the white sand, playing with the
     blossom Weena gave him earlier that day, and
     WHISTLING "The Land Of The Leal".

     Weena sits on a large rock nearby at the edge of
     the pool, washing the soot from her face and hands.
     She glances over to the Time Traveller.

                      WEENA
             Are you sorry?

     He STOPS WHISTLING, but the MUSIC CONTINUES.
     He turns.

                      TIME TRAVELLER
             Sorry? - Sorry for what?

                      WEENA
             That you have to stay.

                      TIME TRAVELLER
                 (gazing into the night)
             Yes. - I am sorry because I could
             tell so much to the people of my
             own time... I could tell them about
             the happiness and sorrow the future
             has in store for them.  They could
             learn from it...or would they?

                      WEENA
             You don't want to stay, do you?

                      TIME TRAVELLER
             It isn't that, but I don't fit here
             anymore than you would in my time.

                      WEENA
                 (a pause, and then)
             I would like to see your time.

                      TIME TRAVELLER
             No, Girl, you wouldn't be very
             happy there.

                      WEENA
             Do you have someone like me -
             there?

                      TIME TRAVELLER
             No.  No one like you.  But there
             are friends who will miss me. - As
             a matter of fact, I'm probably late
             already.

                      WEENA
                 (stealing a glance,
                 then quietly)
             Women?

                      TIME TRAVELLER
             No, men.
                 (teasing)
             There is a woman too, of course!
                 (noticing her disappointment,
                 he relents)
             She looks after my house for me.
             She is sixty-two years old. - Much
             older than you are.

     Weena, relieved, starts to comb her wet hair
     into a new arrangement.

                      WEENA
                 (suddenly)
             How do they wear their hair?

                      TIME TRAVELLER
             Who?

                      WEENA
             The women in your time.

                      TIME TRAVELLER
                 (after a thought)
             Up!

                      WEENA
             Up? - How?

                      TIME TRAVELLER
                 (with awkward gesture)
             Like this.

                      WEENA
             Show me.

     The Time Traveller puts the flower back into his
     pocket, gets up and walks over to Weena.



     WEENA - MED. SHOT                                      379

     The Time Traveller appears behind her.  He first
     hesitates, then gently lifts her hair into a fair
     imitation of the upswept Edwardian style.  She
     smiles, then with an impulsive move turns her face
     toward him.

                      WEENA
                 (innocently)
             Would I be pretty?

     The gesture brings her eyes and lips close to his.
     He still holds her upswung hair and, as he gazes
     into her young eyes, he feels her warm breath on
     his cheek.

                      TIME TRAVELLER
                 (slowly)
             Yes...you would be.  More than
             pretty.
                 (his voice sinks to a whisper)
             I wish we could go back together,
             Weena, back to my own time...or to
             times before that when the world
             was young.  We could...

     EXCITED VOICES o.s. interrupt this interlude.  They
     both look in the direction of the voices.



     EXT. HILL - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT) - (MATTE)              380

     A group of Eloi, led by the Young Man and the Man
     in White, approach them, talking excitedly,
     pointing to the ruins of the white sphinx just
     revealed by the rolling smoke.  The face is
     broken and the pedestal partly in shambles.  The
     panel is open.



     TIME TRAVELLER & WEENA                                 381

     Joyfully he grabs her hand and, pulling her,
     breaks into a run.



     GROUP OF ELOI                                          382

     The Young Man steps forward, pointing o.s.  The
     Time Traveller and Weena run through the haze,
     then the Eloi follow them.



     EXT. THE WHITE SPHINX - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT) -          383
     (MATTE)

     The face is broken in half.  It is left with only
     a half a smile and thin smoke drifts through the
     remaining eye.  The rest of the statue and the
     sirens are on the ground beside the partial ruins
     of the pedestal.  Beyond it the hill is gone and
     gray haze covers the once green world.  The Time
     Traveller and Weena come through the charred
     bushes onto the lawn.  Here they stop.



     THE OPEN PANEL - THEIR P.O.V.                          384

     The Time Machine sits in the midst of the swirling
     smoke.  The flames, licking at the inside walls,
     have not yet reached the Machine.



     TIME TRAVELLER & WEENA - MED. SHOT                     385

     He releases her hand to reach into his jacket pocket
     and bring forth the lever without which the Machine
     will not function.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (without
                    looking at her)
               Come, Girl!

     He walk, toward the panel.  Weena follow,
     hesitantly, but the long habit compels her to
     halt before the threshold.  Unmindful of this,
     the Time Traveller enters.



     INT. PEDESTAL - LONG SHOT                              386

     Shooting from inside the pedestal, the Time
     Traveller and his Machine are black silhouettes
     in the foreground, while beyond him Weena stands
     on the lawn outside, the moonlight flooding her
     radiant features.

     Inside, black smoke still rises and whirls around
     as the Time Traveller examines his Machine and
     starts to fit the lever into place.



     REVERSE ANGLE                                          387

     The Time Traveller working eagerly.  A shadow
     starts sliding across his figure, moving more
     swiftly until darkness falls and the panel closes
     with a CLANG.



     OUTSIDE THE PANELS                                     388

     Weena, seeing the panels close, runs up to them
     and POUNDS her fists vainly on the metal doors.



     INSIDE THE SPHINX - MOVING SHOT                        389

     The Time Traveller leaps to the panels and struggles
     to open them.  From without he hears Weena's
     POUNDING and CRIES.  Suddenly he senses a living
     presence within the sphinx.  For a moment there is
     silence.  Then from the right comes a hacking,
     weak COUGH.  Another from the left.  Then some-
     thing STUMBLES OFF, down the stairway.  He whirls
     around, GASPING and COUGHING, to see three of the
     enmaddened Morlocks rising before him.  Avoiding
     them, he stumbles to his Machine and gets into
     the saddle.  The suffocating smoke blinds him as
     he gropes for the lever.  Morlocks seize his legs and
     try to wrest him off the Machine.  The fire and
     smoke become dense, half obliterating the struggling
     bodies.



     INSERT:  THE CONTROL PANNEL                            390

     The Time Traveller's hand gropes for the lever and
     finally grasps it.



     OMITTED                                                391-403



     INSERT OF DIALS                                        404

     Spinning backwards.  Suddenly, a gloomy shade falls
     over the instruments, followed by a burst of
     whirling smoke and the twinkling red light of fire.
     There is a flash of sunshine, then finally total
     darkness.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                             405

     Passing back in time through his captivity beneath
     the lava.  He reels in the saddle, then coming
     from darkness a red glow quickly engulfs the scene.
     As the red hot lava leaps away from him and the
     daylight returns, we can see that his face is
     covered with perspiration.  He looks off to see:



     SERIES OF SHOTS - (ANIMATION, MINIATURE, SPLIT)        406

     (NOTE:  These shots seen previously are now printed
             backward.)

             The red hot lava withdraws through the         (a,b,c)
             street ruins and the great rents in the
             ground gulp it up quickly.  Out of the
             ruins building are molded and then
             atomic explosions in reverse flash
             across the screen.  The SOUND OF
             EXPLOSIONS, RUMBLING ETC.  IN REVERSE
             AND SPEEDED UP join the HUMMING of the
             Time Machine.

             The sun and the moon chase each other          (d,e)
             alternately across the sky, gradually
             slowing.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 407

     INTERCUT his reaction to the previous scenes until
     he straightens and readjusts the lever.  The
     HUMMING DECREASES, then walls rise about him.
     Watching the dials, he carefully moves the lever.
     The flickers of the days and nights decelerate
     and, with a sudden pull, he halts the Time Machine.
     The HUMMING ABRUPTLY CEASES.



     INSERT:  DIAL                                          408

     It stops on:  "5 January 1900".



     INT. LABORATORY - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT)                  409

     The Time Machine has returned, but it is resting
     in the far corner of the room instead of in the
     spot where we originally saw it.

     In the gloom, the Time Traveller clambers pain-
     fully from the Machine.  Then, FOLLOWED BY CAMERA,
     he staggers to the workbench and sinks onto it.
     His eyes explore the room and finally come to rest
     on the clock.  It is "8:04".

                                        SLOW DISSOLVE TO:



     PENDULUM CLOCK - CLOSE SHOT                            410

     Now showing "9:22".  For a long while only its
     MONOTONOUS TICKING is heard. - A welcome change
     from the cacophony of time traveling.

     The CAMERA MOVES slowly to reveal the DINING ROOM
     where the five men, their meal finished, are
     sitting silently around the table.  Mrs. Watchett
     is quietly serving the liqueur.  The Time Traveller
     is puffing on his pipe.  Kemp is chewing on his
     cigar and Hillyer's face is red with indignation.

                         DR. HILLYER
               It is ridiculous!  Simply preposterous!

     Filby is bent over his coffee playing absorbedly
     with the spoon which CLINKS loudly in the room's
     silence.  Bridewell, of course, takes a big gulp
     from his brandy.

                         BRIDEWELL
               Well, there's one thing I'll say
               for you, George.  You always could
               tell a good story.  Best adventure
               yarn I've heard for years.
                    (loudly)
               You're a truly fine inventor,
               George!

     He alone starts to laugh at his 'joke', but a
     hiccup quickly puts a period to that.  Mrs. Watchett
     steps to the Time Traveller to pour him a bit of
     brandy.

                         MRS. WATCHETT
               I'll turn down your bed for you!

     As she exits Kemp looks up.

                         KEMP
               Truthfully, where have you been
               for the past week?

     Bridewell examines the remaining brandy in his glass.

                         BRIDEWELL
                    (voice of experience)
               Now, we shouldn't ask such questions,
               Walter.  It's not hard for a man to
               lose a week now and then.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (smiling)
               I understand your doubt.  Take it
               as a lie if you wish.  Now that
               I'm back I scarcely believe it
               myself.
                    (a flash of memory)
               Except that...
                    (groping in pocket)
               ...here are the flowers Weena gave
               me.

     He places the blossoms on the table before Filby.
     They are actually less than a day old and fairly
     fresh.



     FILBY AND THE BLOSSOMS - CLOSE SHOT                    411

     As he picks them up to examine.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (o.s.)
               A present for you, David.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                             412

                         TIME TRAVELLER (to Filby)
               You were always interested in
               botany. - Try to match them with
               any species known today.



     BACK TO FILBY                                          413

     As he looks up, puzzled.

                         FILBY
               I don't think I can.



     GROUP SHOT                                             414

     A still unimpressed Hillyer slams his hands on
     the table, stands up, looks around and then down
     to Kemp.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Are you coming, Kemp.

     Rising hesitantly, Kemp turns to the Time Traveller.

                         KEMP
               It's getting late and you look
               exhausted.  You had better get
               some rest.

     Everyone gets up, Bridewell with difficulty, and
     starts to leave.



     COTTAGE - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT) - (MATTE)                415

     The snow falls softly, big flakes wobbling down
     from the sky.  The front door opens letting out
     the four guests wearing hats, capes and overcoats.
     They walk toward a waiting carriage, Kemp helping
     the staggering Bridewell.  Filby is the last to
     leave.  He pauses at the step of the carriage
     looking back to the Time Traveller who stands
     motionless in the doorway.

                         FILBY
               Goodnight, George.



     AT THE ENTRANCE                                        416

     The Time Traveller lifts his hand and waves.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Thank you, David, for being such
               a good friend - always.

     With this he turns and goes into the house, closing
     the door slowly.



     AT THE CARRIAGE                                        417

     Those inside are waiting for Filby to get in,
     but he, deep in thought, still stands gazing back.
     Kemp thrusts his head from the window.

                         KEMP
               What do you think, Filby?

                         FILBY (after a pause)
               One thing is certain.  Those
               flowers couldn't have possibly
               bloomed in the winter-time.

                         HILLYER (in the b.g.)
               You don't really think that story
               was true?

     Filby reaches a decision.

                         FILBY
               Look, you chaps go on.  It's
               just a short walk home for me.

                         HILLYER (o.s.)
               Go on, driver!

     The WHIP CRACKS.



     THE DRIVEWAY                                           418

     As the carriage rolls off leaving Filby standing
     in the falling snow.  He waits until the carriage
     disappears, then retraces his steps to the front
     door and raps on it.  He pauses a moment, then
     uses the heavy knocker.  There is still no answer.
     He steps back and looks off toward the:



     EXT. LABORATORY WING - FILBY'S P.O.V.                  419

     No light shines through its windows.



     BACK TO FILBY                                          420

     He raps once more, and getting no reply tries the
     door.  It is unlocked.  He steps into the house.



     INT. LIBRARY - FULL SHOT                               421

     The coals still glow in the grate as Filby enters
     the fully lit room, looking for his friend.
     Suddenly a clock from the neighboring room CHIMES
     ONCE.  Filby turns, goes toward it and stops at
     the doorway.



     DINING ROOM - FILBY'S P.O.V.                           422

     The table is cleared, candles extinguished.  The
     pendulum clock is TICKING lazily.  The time is
     "9:30".



     FILBY - PANSHOT                                        423

     He calls into the darkness.

                         FILBY
               George!...

     No answer.  Then an odd HUMMING sound brings
     him to stiff attention.  The SOUND INCREASES in
     VOLUME and PITCH until the entire house seems
     to tremble.  Then a violent gust of wind blows
     open the door that leads to the laboratory.

     Filby pivots and runs up the steps, through the
     corridor.



     AT THE DOOR OF LABORATORY - FULL SHOT                  424

     Filby, dishevelled and out of breath, arrives
     and tries the door -- it is locked.  The NOISE
     is almost DEAFENING.  He puts his shoulder to
     the door and finally bursts it open.  At the
     very instant he does so, the SOUND CEASES abruptly.
     He stops short, gazing aghast.



     THE LABORATORY - FILBY'S P.O.V.                        425

     The Time Traveller with his Machine FADING,
     leaving the present.

     Then the CAMERA MOVES ACROSS the workbench to the
     corner where we last saw the Time Machine.  It is
     not there!  The CAMERA WHIPS to the other corner.
     Nor is it there!  A few sheets of paper whirl
     desolately in the center of the floor.



     CLOSE ON FILBY                                         426

     He looks tense, ignoring the APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS
     behind him.  Mrs. Watchett hurries in.

                         MRS. WATCHETT (nervous,
                    breathless)
               Oh, Mr. Filby...what...
                    (her eyes widen)

                         FILBY (with finality)
               He's gone!

     The CAMERA FOLLOWS Mrs. Watchett as she slowly
     approaches the center of the room.  Here, with
     squinting eyes, she leans down to observe the
     floor.

                         MRS. WATCHETT (to
                    Filby)
               There's something funny here, sir!

     Filby steps aside her to investigate.



     WHAT THEY SEE                                          427

     The CAMERA MOVES ALONG parallel grooves resembling
     the ones the Time Machine left in the lawn at the
     front of the sphinx.  They are scratched deep in
     the floor leading from the spot where the Machine
     was last seen to the other corner of the laboratory
     where it originally stood.  Here, not only its
     imprint, but also the color and finish of the
     floor is preserved.



     TWO SHOT                                               428

     They straighten.  Mrs. Watchett looks at Filby,
     puzzled.

                         FILBY
               I think I understand. - Look!



     LABORATORY - FULL SHOT                                 429

     Mrs. Watchett listens as Filby moves to the imprint
     in the floor where the Machine first stood and
     explains.

                         FILEY (pointing)
               See the imprint?  This is where
               the Time Machine originally
               stood.
                    (he paces across to the
                    end of the grooves)
               But the Morlocks moved it.
               They dragged it across the lawn
               right into the sphinx...right
               here.
                    (turns and points)
               And Weena was standing there when
               he last saw her...the same space -
               in a different time. - So he moved
               back his heavy Machine from here,
               across the room, scratching this
               floor...
                    (indicating the grooves
                    that lead to the imprint)
               So that he can appear outside the
               sphinx again and help the Eloi
               build a new world...and build a
               new world of his own.

                         MRS. WATCHETT (faintly,
                    sentimentally)
               Where he left her!..

     Filby doesn't answer.  He looks about the labora-
     tory for the last time, then takes Mrs. Watchett's
     arm and leads her from the room.  The MUSIC STARTS
     THE THEME:  "The Land Of The Leal".



     INT. LIBRARY - FULL SHOT                               430

     Filby and Mrs. Watchett come into the room.

                         FILBY
               But it isn't like George. - To
               return empty handed.  To try to
               rebuild a civilization without
               a plan.
                    (to Mrs. Watchett)
               He must have taken something
               with him.

                         MRS. WATCHETT
               Nothing.

     She looks around and discovers three empty spaces
     on the tightly packed book shelves.  She walks to
     them.

                         MRS. WATCHETT
               Nothing except three books.

                         FILBY
               Which three books?

                         MRS. WATCHETT
               I don't know. -- Is it important?

                         FILBY (smiles)
               No, I suppose not. - Only...what
               three books would you have taken?

     She looks at him, pondering the question as they
     leave the library.



     INT. ENTRANCE HALL                                     431

     They stop at the door and Mrs. Watchett stands
     beside Filby as he opens it.  Outside the snow
     is falling softly.

                         MRS. WATCHETT
               Mr. Filby, do you think he will
               ever return?

                         FILBY (quietly)
               One cannot choose but wonder. -
               You see...he has all the time in
               the world!

     With these words, Filby turns up his collar, pulls
     the brim of his hat over his eyes and walks into
     the night.  Mrs. Watchett looks after him.  She
     hears the SOUND of his DIMINISHING FOOTSTEPS
     SQUEAKING in the virgin snow.  Slowly she closes
     the door.



     EXT. COTTAGE - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT) - (MATTE)           432

     Drifting like a curtain, the snow falls quietly
     as Filby, a solitary figure in the night, pauses
     a moment to look up at the sky, then selects a
     path and starts walking the long way home.

                                            SLOW FADE OUT.

     GLIDING OBJECTS IN A WIDE DARK VOID - (ANIMATION)

             Out of the SILENT darkness a short white       A
             fluted column surmounted by a SUNDIAL
             appears.  It floats in, waveringly, until
             it becomes clearly visible, then drifts
             off as though moving in some huge orbit.

             Next an HOURGLASS floats in from the left      B
             of the screen.  The faint HISSING OF
             RUNNING SAND breaks the stillness of space.

             As the hourglass glides across the screen,     C
             it is met by a GREEK WATER CLOCK accompanied
             by the sound OF DRIPPING WATER.

             A MEDIEVAL CLOCK with weights arises as its    D
             horizontal escapement TICKS LOUDLY.  Mean-
             while the sundial, hourglass and water clock
             return, drifting at diverse angles across
             the screen.

     THE SOUND of the various devices continues to MOUNT.

             A FIGURE wheels past, with the face of a       E
             clock and the body carved like a drummer
             of the 14th century, BEATING the hour.

             A SMALL CLOCK bears a golden angel with        F
             hammer in hands as it STRIKES A BELL.

             ANOTHER TIMEPIECE, with CHIMES, floats in      G
             to mingle with all the drifting objects.

             The BIG BEN is TOLLING                         H

             Then a GREAT BELL.                             J

     DEAFENING SOUNDS NOW COME FROM ALL DIRECTIONS, as the time K
     devices weave across the screen and, reaching CRESCENDO,
     STOP abruptly.  A mellow VOICE begins to SING THE THEME of L
     the picture, "The Land Of The Leal".  Simultaneously, the
     screen reveals the MAIN TITLE:                             M

                        "THE LAND OF THE LEAL"

                      Words & Music by Peggy Lee

         When I was a wee lad                               L
         And dark was the night
         Afraid I would be
         Til the bright morning light
         And sometimes...for comfort
         Away I would steal Away
         I would go to the Land of the Leal.

         And soon I would be there
         It took me no time
         My heart would be soaring
         As I made the climb
         And there was the green grass
         So cool and so sweet
         So good to be run through
         With happy bare feet!

         And who was my teacher
         And how did I know?
         Just when to be going
         And which way to go?
         But always when wishing
         Away I would steal
         Away I would go to the Land of the Leal.

         And now that I'm older
         I try to be wise
         But when I am troubled
         I still close my eyes
         And just like the wee lad
         Away I will steal
         Away I will go to the Land of the Leal.

         For there are no questions
         And there are no lies
         And never a storm there
         To darken the skies
         The birds who are flying
         No freer they feel
         Than I
         When I live in the land of the Leal.

     After the CREDIT TITLES, the MUSIC SUBSIDES and we slowly

                                                 FADE OUT:

     EXT. COTTAGE - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT) - (MATTE)

     Warm lights pour through the windows, spreading
     over the snow-patched countryside.  Only the
     laboratory, a converted greenhouse, is dark, shaded
     from the moonlight by a majestic, leafless oak.
     A two-horse carriage, in the style of the turn of
     the century, lingers in the driveway.  Beyond all
     this, the River Thames takes a sharp curve.

     A lonely figure hurries up to the front door and
     KNOCKS on it impatiently.



     AT THE DOOR                                            2

     The knock is answered by MRS. WATCHETT, the house-
     keeper, a thin, tense woman with iron gray hair.
     The CAMERA ENTERS the HALL with DAVID FILBY, an
     amiable red-haired young man of science, who hastily
     hands her his rumpled cloak and hat, then rushes
     toward:



     INT. LIBRARY                                           3

     A pleasant Edwardian room, the shelves are stacked
     tightly with volumes of books, many of ancient
     Vintage.

     Three men are seated in a rough circle, motionless,
     obviously awaiting the arrival of occupants for the
     two empty chairs.  The silence is accentuated by the
     merry CRACKLING of logs in the fireplace and the
     capricious TICKING of innumerable timepieces about
     the room.

     Filby enters, pauses to glance down, then embarrassedly
     takes his chair.



     SERIES OF CLOSE SHOTS                                  4

               DR. PHILIP HILLYER is an imposing            (a)
               businessman, wearing full sideburns.
               He stares stonily at the last empty
               chair, then at Filby with annoyance.

               ANTHONY BRIDEWELL, a man of the world,       (b)
               impeccably attired in the latest fashion,
               welcomes Filby the only way he knows, by
               lifting his glass of whiskey.

               WALTER KEMP, a middle aged man with keen     (c)
               black piercing eyes, angrily chews on
               his Havana.

               Filby fidgets uncomfortably in his chair     (d)
               as

               Hillyer glances impatiently at his           (e)
               watch, comparing time with a GRAND-
               FATHER CLOCK behind him, then snaps
               it shut and glares at:



     EMPTY CHAIR - MED. SHOT                                5

     Conspicuously unoccupied.



     GRANDFATHER CLOCK - CLOSE SHOT                         6

     Reaching the hour of eight, it begins to STRIKE ITS
     YELLOW CHIMES.  Other timepieces JOIN IN the announce-
     ment.



     GROUPSHOT                                              7

     The men look at each other until the CHIMES, BELLS
     ETC. FADE away.  Dr. Hillyer angrily slaps on the
     arm of his leather chair.

                         DR. HILLYER
               I say, this is outright rude of the man!

                         FILBEY
               He's undoubtedly been detained.  That's
               all.

     Bridewell, filling his glass, is trying to say some-
     thing but is interrupted by

                         KEMP (unscrews the cigar from
                    his tight lips)
               This is such a confounded waste of
               time!  If he's not coming, I've any
               number of more important things to do.

     All heads turn as Mrs. Watchett enters, closing the
     door quietly behind her.  With an envelope in her
     hand she stands there, hesitating.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Speak up -- what is it, woman?

     She is taken aback for a moment, then walks over
     to Filby and hands him the open envelope.  He
     takes his time in extracting the note.

                         BRIDEWELL
               Well...are we or are we not invited
               to dinner?

                         FILBY (reading)
               Apparently we are.
                    (to Mrs. Watchett)
               How long has he been gone?

                         MRS. WATCHETT (nervously)
               I can't rightly say, sir. - Several
               days...I hardly catch a glimpse of
               him lately.  He never leaves the
               laboratory and comes out only to
               nibble at his meals...but he did tell
               me days ago about dinner tonight and
               left these instructions.
                    (pointing to note)

                         FILBY
               Thank you, Mrs. Watchett.

     A faint, nervous smile is her acknowledgement and
     with that she retreats toward the door.

                         DR. HILLYER (indicating the
                    note)
               What does it say, Filby?  What's
               wrong?

                         FILBY
               Nothing really. - George merely says
               that if he is not here by eight we're
               to begin without him.

     Kemp tears the note out of Filby's hand and reads it
     hurriedly.  Meanwhile, Mrs. Watchett swings the door
     open and turns around.

                         MRS. WATCHETT
               Dinner is served, gentlemen!

                         BRIDEWELL (puts his glass
                    down)
               First sensible thing I've heard all
               evening.

     He rises and starts for the dining room.  The others
     follow.



     FILBY, HILLYER & KEMP - MOVING SHOT                    8

     As they walk toward the DINING ROOM.

                         FILBY
               This is peculiar.  He is usually very
               prompt, precise and punctual.

                         DR. HILLYER
               He's making fools of us by inviting
               us here and then not showing up.
               It's not the behavior of a gentleman.

                         KEMP
               To say nothing of the waste of
               time.

                         DR. HILLYER (agreeing)
               To say nothing of the waste of
               time.

     Bridewell, already seated at the heavily laden dining
     table, pours a glass of wine for himself while the
     others settle down.  This time the chair at the head
     of the table is conspicuously unoccupied.

                         BRIDWELL (arises, lifting
                    his glass)
               One thing I will say for George, he
               keeps the best cellar in the south of
               England...and Mrs. Watchett is the
               finest cook in the world. - I think
               I'll drink to that!

     The glass barely touches his lips as he freezes at
     the SOUND OF DROPPING TRAYS and a PIERCING SCREAM.
     All look in the direction of another door across
     the room.



     THE DOOR - FULL SHOT                                   9

     It bursts inward and Mrs. Watchett, her hair flying,
     dashes down the steps panic-stricken into the room.
     The CAMERA RUSHES with her to the table where the
     men have come to their feet.  Clutching Filby's arm,
     she points toward the long corridor now revealed by
     the open door.

                         MRS. WATCHETT (frightened)
               There!...there...

     All stare o.s., Hillyer with the carving knife
     clasped in his hand.



     CORRIDOR THROUGH DOORWAY - FULL SHOT                   10

     We see the figure of a man approaching, a black
     silhouette against the pale glow at the end of
     the passage.  He is bent with exhaustion and
     sways as he moves forward, limping.  The man comes
     closer, his features still blacked out by shadows,
     but as he nears the doorway, the light from the
     room strikes first his legs, then his body and
     finally his face.  Here he stops.

     This is our first meeting with the TIME TRAVELLER
     (for so it will be convenient to speak of him).  At
     this instant he is in a sorry state.  His clothing
     is tattered and dirty, his face pale, bruised and
     scratched and his eyes glazed with fatigue.  For
     a moment he hesitates as if dazzled by the light
     and then takes another swaying step into the room.



     FILBY AND BRIDEWELL - MOVING SHOT                      11

     They come to life.  Bridewell, noticing the glass
     of wine still in his hand, quickly gulps it down
     before rushing with Filby toward the Time Traveller.

                         FILBY
               Good lord! - What's happened?

     Reaching him, each seizes an elbow to support him.
     Bridewell throws a frantic glance at Dr. Hillyer
     back at the table.  The Time Traveller, however,
     moves forward under his own power.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I'm all right...just some food...a
               drink...

     He reaches the table and sinks into his chair.  With
     trembling hands Bridewell tries to pour him a glass
     of wine, spilling most of it over the tablecloth.
     The Time Traveller looks up at him with a wry smile.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Are you all right?

     A stunned Bridewell is unable to speak while the Time
     Traveller empties his glass.

                         BRIDEWELL (a delayed
                    answer)
               Of course.  I'm...all right...

     Meanwhile, Mrs. Watchett hovers over the Time Traveller
     like a mother hen.

                         MRS. WATCHETT (half
                    apology, half concern)
               I didn't recognize you!...it was
               so dark...

     The CAMERA MOVES IN as she dishes up a bowl of soup
     for him, but he pushes it away.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Meat...I'm hungry for meat!

     Mrs. Watchett grasps the carving knife from Dr.
     Hillyer and, with a single slash, cuts off a huge
     portion of beef and loads it onto his plate.



     GROUPSHOT                                              12

     The Time Traveller eats, the men watching him
     curiously.  Finally Dr. Hillyer leans forward.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Well, can't you speak, man?  What
               happened to you?  Aren't you going
               to tell us...

                         BRIDEWELL
               Leave him alone, can't you?

                         TIME TRAVELLER (swallowing)
               It's all right. - I want to tell.

                         FILBY
               It will keep, George.  Eat, rest a
               little.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               No!  I must tell it now... while I
               still remember.

                         FILBY
               Relax, try to relax a bit.  You've
               all the time in the world.



     CLOSE ON THE TIME TRAVELLER                            13

     As he looks up, amused.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               You're right, David.
                    (almost to himself)
               That's exactly what I have. -
               All the time in the world!...
               ever since we were all together
               five days ago, the last day of
               Eighteen Hundred Ninety Nine.

     Slowly the CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSER while everyone
     listens so intensely that, aside from the Time
     Traveller's VOICE, only the TICKING of a pendulum
     CLOCK is heard.

                                         SLOWLY DISSOLVE:



     INT. - EBONY BOX ON TABLE - CLOSE SHOT (AFTERNOON)     14

     (NOTE:  The Slow Dissolve from the previous shot
             should give the effect of the Ebony Box
             emerging from the Time Traveller's brain.)

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               There in that box rests the result
               of two years' labor.

     The CAMERA DRAWS BACK to reveal the LIBRARY.  The Time
     Traveller, wearing casual tweeds and smoking a pipe,
     sits in his favorite chair behind the Ebony Box.
     Across from him in another chair sits Dr. Hillyer
     puffing his cigar.  Bridewell and Filby have glasses
     in their hands -- Kemp nothing.  All are looking at
     the box.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
                    (continues)
               I wanted to finish the job before
               the new century began. - I barely
               made it.

                         BRIDEWELL
               Marvelous.

                         DR. HILLYER (stands up)
               What is it?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Well, it has to do with time.

                         DR. HILLYER
                    (steps to box)
               I've always maintained what this
               nation needs is a reliable timepiece.
               The Navy needs one. The Army needs
               one. - For the artillery you know.

                         KEMP (leaning forward)
               Couldn't do better, George.  So
               that's why you've been in hiding. -
               Clever of you, indeed!

                         FILBY (studying the Time
                    Traveller's reaction)
               I don't believe George is referring
               to a new kind of timepiece.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               When I speak of time, I'm referring
               to the fourth dimension.

     A perplexed look comes over Bridewell's face.
     Dr. Hillyer registers concern.  Kemp looks troubled.
     Only Filby expresses avid interest.

                         FILBY
               Go on, George.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Now, as you know, the difficulty
               in explaining the fourth dimension
               is that it cannot be seen or felt -
               it must be thought of.

                         FILBY
               If you don't mind, George, would
               you refresh me on the first three
               dimensions.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Really, Filby, they must have
               taught you something at school!

                         BRIDEWELL (baiting
                    Dr. Hillyer)
               Suppose you explain it, Doctor.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Certainly!
                    (he demonstrates
                     pompously)
               When I move in a straight line,
               forward or backward, that's one
               dimension. - When I move to the
               left or right, two dimensions. -
               When I move up and down, three
               dimensions.
                    (a bright idea lights up
                    his face.  At last he can
                    get ahold of the box, but
                    Filby interferes before
                    Dr. Hillyer can get his
                    fingers on it and he has
                    to be satisfied with merely
                    pointing)
               For instance, this box has three
               dimensions:  length, breadth, and
               height.

                         BRIDEWELL (amazed)
               Well, then, what's the fourth
               dimension?

                         DR. HILLYER
               Well, that's...that's mere theory!
               No one can really say what the
               fourth dimension is or even that
               it exists.



     THE TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                         15

     Leaning forward in his chair.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               On the contrary, Doctor!  The
               fourth dimension is as true and as
               real a dimension as any of the
               other three.  In fact, they couldn't
               exist without it.

                         DR. HILLYER (enters the SHOT)
               How do you mean?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Well, take that box.  It has the
               first three dimensions, as you said.
               But what if it didn't exist in Time?
               It wouldn't exist at all, would it?

                         DR. HILLYER
               No.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               So - for an object to exist at all,
               it must exist in the fourth dimen-
               sion....and that fourth dimension
               is duration....Time!

                         DR. HILLYER (impatiently)
               All right!  But what's in that box?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I'm coming to that.  But first,
               consider!  Why is it that we usually
               ignore the fourth dimension?  Because
               we have no freedom to move in it.  We
               can move in the other three -- up,
               down, forward, backward, sideways.
               But when it comes to Time, we are
               prisoners.  Do you follow me, Anthony?



     GROUP SHOT                                             16

     In the f.g., Bridewell who has been sitting with a
     glazed, dreamy look, suddenly jumps.

                         KEMP
               George!  You've given a most lucid
               explanation and all that!  But I
               don't think I entirely understand.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Look!  There are a lot of things in
               the world you don't understand,
               aren't there?

                         KEMP
               Of course!  Quite a number.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               But you don't refuse to believe
               in them because of that?

                         KEMP
               Not if I can see the proof with
               my own eyes.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Good!  All I'm asking you to do
               now is to witness a demonstration
               of the possibility of movement in
               the fourth dimension.
                    (to Dr. Hillyer)
               Philip, will you please hand me
               that box?

     All eyes turn to Dr. Hillyer as he eagerly rushes to
     the table, lifts the box with surprise at its lightness,
     and takes it to the Time Traveller.  George opens it
     with great care and brings forth a mechanical device

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I've told you.  The larger model
               can carry a passenger on a journey
               through Time. - Not through Space,
               mind you, but through Time.

                         BRIDEWELL
               Oh, I say George!  If you start
               floating around in the future, aren't
               you likely to mess things up for the
               rest of us?

                         DR. HILLYER
               The future is already there.  It's
               irrevocable and cannot be changed.

     He answers thoughtfully.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               That's the most important question
               to which I hope to find an answer.
               Can Man control his destiny?  Can he
               change the shape of things to come?



     [PAGE 16 MISSING FROM HARD COPY]



                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               Imagine that this cigar is the Time
               Traveller.  Now, this lever in front
               of him controls movement.  Forward
               pressure sends the Machine into the
               future, backward pressure into the
               past.  And the harder the pressure
               the faster the Machine travels.



     GROUPSHOT - LOW ANGLE                                  24

     All eyebrows are raised.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               This experiment can be performed
               only once.  If it succeeds, I lose
               my model forever.  That is why I
               need witnesses.

     They look at each other, uncertain whether he is
     joking or not.  Bridewell stoops with difficulty to
     examine the table.

                         KEMP
               Go ahead.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               You're ready then?

     Despite disbelief, there is a tense silence as he puts
     his finger on the lever.  Then he pauses.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Doctor Hillyer, would you care
               to lend me your hand?

     Dr. Hillyer extends his hand hesitantly, smiling
     weakly.



     INSERT OF MODEL                                        25

     Using Dr. Hillyer's forefinger, the Time Traveller
     presses the lever forward.  A LOW-PITCHED HUM is
     heard.



     CLOSE ON THE MEN - LOW ANGLE                           26

     The men stare in fascination as the CAMERA PANS
     and the HUMMING INCREASES.



     INSERT:  GLASSES - CHANDELIER - VASE                   27

               The glasses on the silver tray rattle        (a)
               and clink against each other.

               The gas lights of the chandelier             (b)
               flicker rapidly.

               A vase shudders and moves slightly on        (c)
               the mantelpiece.



     INSERT OF MODEL                                        28

     As the vibration increases, the outline of the model
     is blurred and gradually becomes transparent, until
     the Machine with the cigar has vanished utterly.
     The HUMMING HAS REACHED A HIGH SHRIEK and STOPS
     abruptly.



     BACK TO CLOSE ON MEN - LOW ANGLE                       29

     The sudden silence is almost unbearable.  They
     stare at the empty table.  The CAMERA PANS.

                         DR. HILLYER (touches his
                    cigar pocket)
               I'll be damned!

                         TIME TRAVELLER (almost
                    to himself)
               It worked!

     Filby swallows.

     Bridewell, with his mouth open, stares at the table.
     Now he looks at the glass of champagne in his hand
     and places it on the mantelpiece as far out of
     reach as he can.  Then, suddenly reversing his
     decision, he retrieves the glass and gulps it down.

     Dr. Hillyer slowly turns to the Time Traveller.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Where did it go?

                         TIME TRAVELLER (recovering)
               Go?  Nowhere in the usual sense.
               It's still here.
                    (indicating space where the
                    Machine stood)
               But it's no longer in the present.
               It's traveling through time - to
               the future, to be precise.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Do you seriously expect us to
               believe that?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Certainly.

                         DR. HILLYER
               But you just said it hasn't
               really moved.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               That's correct.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Then why can't we see it?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Because we're in this room on
               December 31st, 1899, while the
               model you saw is perhaps a hundred
               years away.  This room, or even
               this house, may no longer exist a
               hundred years from now.  But the
               Time Machine is occupying the same
               space it did a moment before it went
               off on its journey.

     Dr. Hillyer runs his hand over the top of the table.

                         DR. HILLYER (exasperated)
               If it occupies the same space, I
               should be able to feel it.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               You must remember that the space
               you've just put your hand through
               is today's space.  You can't put
               your hand into the space of
               tomorrow.

                         DR. HILLYER (getting angry)
               Space is space!  It doesn't change!
               The same space that is here now should
               be here a hundred or even a thousand
               years from now.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               No!  Time changes space.  This flat
               ground we're standing on now could
               have been at the bottom of the sea
               a million years ago.  And a million
               years from now it could be the
               interior of a huge mountain.

     Dr. Hillyer turns away, speechless.



     GROUP SHOT                                             32

     Kemp steps forward.

                         KEMP
               Suppose what you say is true.
               Exactly what do you suggest we do
               with such a contraption?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               For my part, I intend to take a
               journey into the future. - Unless
               someone else prefers to volunteer.

     There is no response.

                         BRIDEWELL (chuckling)
               I say, George.  Suppose you go off
               and get lost in the fiftieth century!
               How will you find your way back?

                         TIME TRAVELLER (quite
                    serious)
               That's a calculated risk I'm prepared
               to take.

     Dr. Hillyer, having controlled his fury, now exchanges
     significant glances with Kemp and turns back with an
     air of reasonableness.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Now listen, George!  I don't
               know what you take us for, but
               we're not fools.  There are a
               number of ways of doing a
               disappearing trick!  But a man of
               your ability should not bother
               with such nonsense.



     CLOSE ON DR. HILLIER - MOVING SHOT                     33

     He gets up from his chair.

                         DR. HILLYER (unable to
                    resist the temptation for
                    sarcasm)
               There's a war on, you know!  The
               Boers are putting up a pretty stiff
               fight in South Africa and our
               country needs inventors like you.
               I can put you in touch with the
               War Office if you wish.

     He walks over to the Time Traveller who is sitting
     near the table on which stands the empty Ebony Box
     with its lid open.  Filby is in the b.g.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (looks
                    up at Filby)
               What do you think?

                         FILBY (hesitating
                    slightly, and then)
               I think Dr. Hillyer has a point,
               George.

     Lazily the Time Traveller toys with the lid of the
     Ebony Box, then closes it with a SNAP.  He looks up
     and nods.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Now you're being sensible.  I'll
               take care of it first thing in
               the New Year.



     BACK TO GROUP SHOT                                     34

     Everyone rises.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Well, time to go.

                         KEMP
               Yes, we all have our plans for
               tonight.

     Dr. Hillyer and Kemp head toward the door.  Bridewell
     lingers at the table where the model of the Time
     Machine disappeared.

                         BRIDEWELL (concerned)
               Are you all right, George?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Of course, I am.

                         DR. HILLYER'S VOICE
               Coming, Bridewell?

     Reluctantly Bridewell leaves the library followed
     by the Time Traveller.



     INT. ENTRANCE HALL - FULL SHOT                         35

     While his guests put on their capes, overcoats, scarfs,
     gloves and hats, preparing for the cold weather
     outside, the Time Traveller steps to the door and
     grasps the handle.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Thanks for coming.

     He opens the door and they file past him, Bridewell
     at the rear.

                         AD LIBS
               Happy New Year. - Goodbye, George -
               Happy Twentieth Century. - Etc.

     Bridewell clasps the Time Traveller's shoulder,
     reassuringly.



     EXT. COTTAGE - LONG SHOT - (DUSK) - (MATTE)            36

     In contrast to the previous SHOT (Sc.l) this is a snow-
     less wintery day.  The visitors are boarding the
     carriage that awaits them in the drive.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Come on, Bridewell.

     Bridewell glances back to the Time Traveller, then
     submits and, with a CRACK OF A WHIP, the carriage
     moves off.



     EXT. ENTRANCE - FULL SHOT                              37

     The Time Traveller, a silhouette framed in the door-
     way, waves to them.



     THE CARRIAGE                                           38

     As it pulls away, Bridewell leans out, waving.  From
     the opposite direction another carriage full of NOISY
     YOUNG PEOPLE THUNDERS by.  In early New Year's Eve
     REVELRY they TOOT their toy HORNS at the Time Traveller.



     BACK TO THE TIME TRAVELLER                             39

     Unmindful of their salutations he turns and enters the
     cottage.



     INT. ENTRANCE HALL - MED SHOT                          40

     The Time Traveller slowly closes the door and leans his
     back against it, staring into space.  Thinking. - He
     spots a newspaper on a nearby table, apparently left by
     one of his guests, and picks it up.



     INSERT: NEWSPAPER                                      40-A

     A ROLL OF DRUMS in military fashion ACCENTS the headline
     that the Boer Army has won another victory.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                40-B

     He closes his eyes and, added to the DRUMS, we HEAR
     the call to battle by a DISTANT BUGLE.  Then more
     BRASS, FIFES and HORNS join the BUGLE and DRUMS to take
     up a MILITANT OVERTURE.

     He loosens his collar, then with sudden resolution
     strides toward:



     OMITTED                                                41-56



     INT. LIBRARY - LONG SHOT                               57

     The Time Traveller crosses to his writing table in
     the f.g.  He stands there and even in the darkness
     WE CAN OBSERVE that he is an angry man.  He strikes
     a match and lights the overhead gas fixture.  The
     light comes up and the MUSIC STOPS as he stares
     across the room to see:



     FILBY - MED. SHOT                                      58

     sitting in a chair near the fireplace.

                         FILBY
               I thought I'd better stay.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               You needn't have troubled yourself.
               I'm all right.

                         FILBY
               No you're not. - You've been
               behaving oddly for over a month
               now.
                    (and then)
               I'm not leaving until you tell me
               what's on your mind.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                             59

     Deep in thought, he goes to the fireplace and stirs
     the coals.  The CAMERA FOLLOWS.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I appreciate your gesture, David,
               but if you don't mind I'd rather
               you left me alone.

                         FILBY
               You have changed, George.
               Enormously.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I'm sorry.

                         FILBY (looks up to him
                    directly)
               Will you answer me one question
               honestly?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I'll try.

                         FILBY
               Why this preoccupation with Time?

                         TIME TRAVELLER (sharply)
               Why not?

                         FILBY
               Don't go simple on me, George!

                         TIME TRAVELLER (a beat,
                    then calmly)
               If you want to know the truth, I
               don't much care for the time I was
               born into. - It seems people aren't
               dying fast enough these days.  They
               call upon science to invent new,
               more efficient weapons to depopulate
               the earth.

                         FILBY
               I quite agree with you.  But here
               we are and we have to make the best
               of it.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               You may have to.  I don't.

                         FILBY (making a half-
                    hearted attempt at levity)
               All right.  Take a journey on your
               contraption.  What would you become?...
               A Greek?  A Roman?  One of the
               Pharaohs?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I prefer the future.

                         FILBY
               You're not seriously saying you can
               do it?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               You saw the experiment this afternoon,
               didn't you?

                         FILBY
               I saw a toy machine vanish.  But
               I'm certain there are a number of
               ways of doing that trick.  Any
               magician at the Hippodrome could
               probably do it.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (angrily)
               It was no trick! - Would you care
               to see the full-scale model?

                         FILBY
               No, I would not!  I have no desire
               to tempt the laws of Providence and
               I don't think you should.  It's not
               for man to trifle with.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Now you sound like Hillyer and Kemp.

                         FILBY
               There is something in their common
               sense attitude to life.
                    (and then)
               George, I speak to you as a friend.
               More, as a brother.  If that machine
               can do what you say it can...destroy
               it.  Destroy it, George, before it
               destroys you.

     Distant SOUNDS of NEW YEAR'S CELEBRATIONS are HEARD.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               You must have plans for New Year's
               Eve.  Don't let me keep you.

                         FILBY
               Mary isn't well.  We decided to
               stay home with the baby.  But why
               don't you come home with me.  You
               haven't seen little Jaime for a
               long time.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I can't.

                         FILBY
               What's stopping you?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I just want to see the old century
               out by myself.

                         FILBY (rising)
               Have it your own way.

     He goes to the door.



     AT THE DOOR                                            60

     Filby stops, then turns around.

                         FILBY
               Will you promise me that you won't
               leave the house tonight?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I promise you, I won't walk out of
               the door.

     Filby, a little puzzled by this strange promise, turns
     to go as the Time Traveller puts down the poker and
     steps up to him.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               David!  Please don't think me un-
               friendly! - Come over to dinner -
               next Friday.  Won't you?

                         FILBY
               Very well.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Fine...and will you bring the others
               with you?

                         FILBY (with a warm smile)
               Whatever you say, George. - Happy
               New Year.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (shaking hands)
               And a very happy New Year to you, David.

     Filby pats his arm before he leaves.  The Time Traveller
     stands there until he hears the FRONT DOOR SHUT.  Then,
     FOLLOWED BY THE CAMERA, he goes to the writing table
     and sits down.



     AT THE WRITING TABLE                                   61

     The Time Traveller opens a drawer and takes out the
     new calendar that reads:  "1900, Welcome New Century."
     He flips a few pages to find the next Friday and jots
     down the dinner engagement.  At this point Mrs. Watchett,
     with his velvet smoking jacket over her arm, appears
     in the doorway and walks up to him.

                         MRS. WATCHETT
               Will you be having supper in this
               evening, sir?

                         TIME TRAVELLER (while ex-
                    changing jackets with Mrs.
                    Watchett's help)
               I don't think so, Mrs. Watchett.  Why
               don't you take the evening off and
               celebrate.

                         MRS. WATCHETT
               Thank you, sir, but if you won't be
               needing me I think I'll turn in early
               and get some sleep...
                    (indicating revelers outside)
               ...it I can. - Goodnight, sir.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Goodnight.

     She turns to go as the Time Traveller calls after her.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Oh, Mrs. Watchett!
                    (as she responds)
               I've invited Mr. Filby and the others
               to dinner next Friday.
                    (and then)
               Happy New Year, Mrs. Watchett.

                         MRS. WATCHETT
               Happy New Year, sir.

     Mrs. Watchett exits, closing the door after her.  Once
     again the Time Traveller is alone.  He looks at the
     old calendar that reads:  "December 3l. 1899," rips
     the final sheet from the pad, crumples it into a tight
     little ball and tosses it into the hearth where it
     burns.  With slow and deliberate movements he replaces
     the old calendar with the new one.  Then, he hastily
     scribbles a note which he puts into an envelope and
     places it prominently on the table.  He rises and
     mounts the steps that lead to:



     INT. CORRIDOR - MOVING SHOT                            62

     The Time Traveller walks slowly toward a closed door
     at the end of the passageway.  Here he pauses momentarily,
     removes the key from his pocket, unlocks the door, then
     slowly swings it open as the MUSIC STARTS the THEME of
     the picture.



     INT. LABORATORY - FULL SHOT - (NIGHT)                  63

     The laboratory has the appearance of having once been
     a greenhouse.  Only a few potted plants remain.  The
     glass walls are obscured from view from the garden by
     rows of tall growing plants.  Only the glass skylight
     is clear.  Thick, dark, low-hanging clouds are pass-
     ing beneath the moon, dimming its light and leaving
     the interior a maze of dark shadows.  As the slow mov-
     ing clouds pass overhead, a shaft of moonlight seeps
     through and we SEE workbenches, numerous tools, sheets
     of drawings and scientific instruments situated around
     the perimeter.

     But the most conspicuous object in the room is the
     Time Machine.  It is a duplicate of the miniature model
     already seen.

     However, its size gives it a majestic quality.  Nickel,
     ivory and crystalline quartz gleam and sparkle.  While
     the miniature possessed a delicate, appealing note, the
     full size Machine has an ominous look.  The wavering
     moonlight seems to render it alive and give it the
     power of movement.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                  64

     Staring at the Machine, hypnotized by his own crafts-
     manship, he locks the door with accustomed movement,
     then crosses to a workbench and lights a candle.  Here
     a crystalline lever is attached to a polishing buffer.
     The Time Traveller sets it in motion, polishing the
     crystal lever until its rough edges disappear and it
     sparkles like a fine cut diamond.  As he works, his
     lips purse and he softly STARTS TO WHISTLE the melancholy
     strains of "The Land Of The Leal."  A clock near him on
     the workbench reads:  "9:30."

     Satisfied with the buffing, he removes the gleaming
     handle and crosses to the Machine.  He settles into the
     saddle and affixes the crystalline lever.  There is no
     sign of urgency in his movements to betray that his
     settling himself into the saddle is any more than a
     routine position he has taken before to work on the
     Machine.

     Then he leans back in the saddle and gazes up at:



     INSERT:  SKYLIGHT - (STOP MOTION OR ANIMATION)         65

     Passing clouds.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 66

     He looks upwards for several moments.  Then his hand
     slowly reaches forth and his fingers encircle the
     lever. - Gently he urges it forward.

     A HUMMING SOUND, similar to the one made by the model,
     but MORE RESONANT starts and a soft glow wells up from
     within the Machine.



     INSERT:  THE CONTROL PANEL                             67

     The luminous dials show:  "31 December 1899."  The
     meters and indicators start to BUZZ and whirl.  The
     glow increases.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 68

     His expression is taut as he looks around, then down
     to the control panel.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               I started...and the laboratory grew
               faint around me...



     INSERT OF PANEL                                        69

     The figures spin, the needles vibrate.  Then almost
     at once the Time Traveller's hand reaches for the
     lever and jerks it over to halt the Machine.  The
     HUMMING LESSENS and FADES.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 70

     As he starts to look up and around, slowly.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               ...I stopped.



     WHAT HE SEES - MOVING SHOT                             71

     Starting at the WINDOW with frost around the edges
     and icicles outside, we move around the room PASSING
     THE WORKBENCH over to the DOOR.  During this we HEAR the:

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               No change; everything exactly as it
               bad been before. - But no!

     THE CAMERA SWINGS BACK TO THE WORKBENCH, CLOSE, where
     the clock now shows "11:09" and the candle has burned
     shorter.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE (excited)
               The clock said 9:31 when I started and
               now it was 11:O9...and the candle,
               shorter by inches.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 72

     He looks amazed, then pulls his old fashioned watch
     from his pocket by its gold chain.  It flips open
     showing almost "9:32."

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               And yet by my watch which was in the
               machine with me, only a few seconds
               had passed.

     Pleased, he puts his watch away and reaches for the
     lever, looking off toward the:



     WORKBENCH - (ANIMATION)                                73

     The HUMMING SOUND STARTS again and, while the hands
     of the clock circle the dial, the flame of the candle
     flickers with the speed of a bee's wing, melting the
     candle down.  The CAMERA MOVES to the window where the
     frost has spread and the icicles continue to grow.
     Light comes up behind so that the crystals glitter like
     gems and the sun starts to rise.



     TIME TRAVELLER IN THE MACHINE - MED. SHOT              74

     The rays of the early Morning sun slide down the lab-
     oratory wall and sweep across the Time Traveller and
     his Machine.  A trace of a smile -- and then, he looks
     up and squints.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               It was disconcerting to see the sun...



     INSERT:  SKYLIGHT - MED. SHOT - (STOP MOTION OR        75
     ANIMATION)

     As the sun arches majestically.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               ...arc in less than a minute...



     INSERT:  POT OF FLOWERS - (STOCK AND/OR STOP MOTION)   76

     As they close.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               ....to see flowers closing their eyes
               for the night, changes that normally
               took hours, occuring in seconds, was
               beautiful.

     During this it has turned into night and a little SNAIL
     rushes across the ground beneath the plant, and then
     the flowers start to open again.  Light begins to flood
     the scene.

     In the b.g. Mrs. Watchett leaps into the garden, pauses
     the briefest instant to sprinkle the flowers, then with
     the speed of wind streaks away.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 77

     A trace of a smile, then apprehension.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               And as yet I was travelling very slowly!
                    (challenging)
               What if I went faster?!

     His hand shoves the lever farther over toward the
     future position.

     THE HUMMING SOUND RISES TO HIGHER PITCH.  The Time
     Traveller lurches in his seat, clings to the controls
     and looks at the dials.

     INSERT OF SKYLIGHT - (STOP MOTION OR ANIMATION)        80

     The sun soars across the sky, night falls.  Pin points
     of stars streak by and dawn comes.  The sun is chased
     by the stars again and again.  Faster and faster.



     VERY CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                           81

     His eyes gleam with a mad light, half pleasure, half
     pain.  His face is illuminated by the alternating
     flashes of light, each one indicating the passage of
     another day.

     He turns toward the:



     WINDOW - FULL SHOT - (ANIMATION, STOP MOTION & STOCK)  82

     Without a trace of frost or icicles.  The snow has
     disappeared, replaced by the lush green of Spring.
     While the vines of a morning Glory grow up and around
     the window like a snake and the flowers open and close,
     we see the following through repeated fast flashes.

                    The sun hops swiftly across the sky.    (a)

                    The night falls and the stars circle    (b)
                    the North Star.

                    tumultuous clouds.

                    On the following day the sky darkens    (e)
                    with thunderheads.  There is a
                    cataract of lightning and THUNDER.



     BACK ON TIME TRAVELLER                                 83

     Quick flashes of lightning on the Time Traveller's
     face followed by a series of SHORT THUNDERCLAPS.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               It became intoxicating.  To see an
               entire storm in a few seconds. -
               So I pushed the lever on toward
               even greater speed.

     He applies greater pressure on the lever.  The
     HUMMING INCREASES.  The alternate flashes of light
     become a flicker almost too fast for the eye to
     follow.  He looks o.s. and sees:



     EXT. TREE IN GARDEN - FULL SHOT - (ANIMATION)          84

     Its shadows, cast by the sun and the moon, dance
     around the trunk, faster and faster -- the moon
     passing through its phases and the sun shifting
     its position with the seasons.



     BRANCHES - CLOSE SHOT - (ANIMATION)                    85

     Leaves grow quickly.  Flowers appear and turn into
     small green apples.  Growing larger, they turn red
     and fall.  The leaves gradually become amber and
     disappear.  Suddenly the bare branches are covered
     with snow for a few seconds, then again burst into
     green leaves and blossoms.



     EXT. DISTANT HILLSIDE - FULL SHOT - (ANIMATION)        86

     Through the window we see the trees grow and
     change like puffs of vapor -- now brown, now
     green; they spread, shiver and pass away.  Snow
     flashes across the country, vanishes and is
     followed by the brief bright green of Spring.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               Thirteen years had passed...fourteen...
               fifteen...sixteen...and then...

     Gradually soot, dirt and grime has built up on the
     windows from the outside and darkness prevails.

     The hand of the Time Traveller quickly pulls back
     the lever.

               In the year nineteen hundred seventeen...
               I stopped.

     The flickering of passing days and nights slows and
     the HUMMING SOUND GRADUALLY DIMINISHES.  The dial
     stops on "13 September 1917".



     TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                             89

     The CAMERA PULLS BACK as he steps out of his Machine
     and glances with astonishment around the interior
     of the laboratory.  The once clear windows are now
     dirty and boarded up.  The world outside is
     completely obscured from view.  Only faint light
     penetrating cracks indicates that it is day out-
     doors.  He crosses to the door.  Dust falls as he
     opens it and enters the corridor.



     INT. LIBRARY                                           90

     The dim light and the protective sheets covering
     the furnishings previously seen, lend the room a
     ghostly appearance.  Tilted paintings reveal
     faded spots on the walls and the dust is inches
     thick here, as well as in the dining room seen
     in the b.g.  Cobwebs are everywhere.

     The floor SQUEAKS on every footfall as the Time
     Traveller, coming down the steps from the
     corridor, enters the room and looks about.



     THE SHELVES - TIME TRAVELLER'S P.O.V.                  91

     Among his books still rest the clocks, his once
     prized possessions.  There is NO TICKING now.
     The hands of the clocks, each pair indicating a
     different time, seem to guard the past.

     Curiosity takes the Time Traveller from the
     library, through the ENTRANCE HALL, to the front
     door.  It refuses to respond to his attempt to
     open it.  Even when he uses his shoulder it does
     not budge.  He steps back and flings his full
     weight against it and with a WRENCHING SOUND it
     gives slightly.  Under continued pressure the
     nailed boards outside give way and a flood of
     daylight illuminates the dusty interior.  The
     Time Traveller moves into the open driveway that
     is now taken over by weeds.



     EXT. COTTAGE - LONG SHOT - DAY                         93

     The Time Traveller takes a deep breath and looks
     curiously around.  Everything is overgrown with
     vines and flowers.  The house is boarded up.  He
     starts to wander around, thinking, investigating.

     (NOTE:  The house is situated upon a site with
             distinctive landmarks that will stay
             recognizable during his journey into
             the future, thereby giving a clear
             conception that time-travelling does
             not involve geographical movement.
             For instance, the sharp curve of the
             River Thames in the distance will
             remain even after the house itself
             has disappeared.)

     EXT. ROAD - LONG SHOT - (DAY)                          95

     Coming up the hill on a narrow dusty road is a
     car of 1916 vintage, with the HORN HONKING.  The
     CAMERA PANS with it, up to a SMALL STORE across
     the street.  The sign above the entrance reads:
     "Filby's Department Store".  A MANNEQUIN,
     dressed for the period, is in the window.  The
     driver, in the uniform of a Second Lieutenant of
     the First World War, steps out of the car.  The
     Time Traveller walks over to see his old friend,
     sans moustache.

               Filby!  I expected more of an
               enthusiastic greeting from...

                         FILBY (smiles as he
                    interrupts)
               I'm afraid you have me confused
               with my father, sir.  There was a
               remarkable resemblance. - I'm
               James Filby.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Was?

               Yes...yes...I've been away.

                         JAMES FILBY
               He was killed in the war...a year
               ago.

               No!...it can't be...
                    (then, as he realizes its
                    truth)
               I'm sorry to hear that.
                    (pause, then hesitantly
                    points)
               And the gentleman who used to live
               across the street?

                         JAMES FILBY
               Oh, him.  Some inventor who
               disappeared around the turn of the
               century. - If you're interested in
               that house, forget it.  You can't
               buy it or even go inside.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Why is that?

                         JAMES FILBY
               My father was executor of the
               inventor's estate and he refused to
               liquidate it.
                    (adds with a smile)
               I often chided him on that account,
               but he felt positive that the owner
               would return some day. - Some people
               hereabouts think it's haunted.
                    (stares at Time Traveller
                    curiously, studying the
                    strange cut of his clothes)
               Who are you, sir?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Just a stranger who once knew your
               father.

                         JAMES FILBY
               I see.
                    (still curious at the Time
                    Traveller's abstract attitude)
               Have you been at the front, sir?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Front?  What front?

                         JAMES FILBY
               Why the war, of course.

               What war?

                         JAMES FILBY
               Great heavens, man, don't you know
               we've been at war with Germany
               since nineteen fourteen?  I thought
               perhaps you had seen action in
               France...or maybe...
                    (noticing confusion, adds
                    with a note of compassion)
               Perhaps a cup of tea would make
               you feel better.  Won't you come in?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               No...no, thank you.

                         JAMES FILBY
               You're sure you're alright, sir?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Yes, I'm quite alright.

                         JAMES FILBY (hesitantly)
               Then...goodbye, sir.

     The Time Traveller nods and James Filby slowly
     turns and, glancing back repeatedly, enters the
     Department Store.

     He speaks almost to himself.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Goodbye, Jaime.

     With the bitter taste of death for his old
     friend, David Filby, he slowly walks across the
     street and returns to the cottage.



     INT. LABORATORY - FULL SHOT                            98

     The Time Traveller approaches the Machine, steps
     up into the seat, throws his head back and grimly
     shoves the lever forward.



     SKYLIGHT - FULL SEOT - (STOCK AND ANIMATION)           99

     ACCENT on MUSIC, then as the HUMMING OF THE TIME
     MACHINE takes over, suddenly panes of GLASS BREAK
     one after another, giving a clear view of a sky
     full of SWIRLIING TURBULENT CLOUDS.

     The FLICKERS of days and nights, as well as the
     HUMMING, INCREASES and DECREASES, in accordance
     with his manipulation of the controls.  Over this:

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               As I went along, I gained experience
               in handling the Machine.  I found
               that I could stop for a day, an hour,
               or even for a second to observe, then
               go ahead for a year or two. - Thus I
               was able to see the changing world
               in a series of glimpses.

     Something catches his interest.  He pulls back
     the lever to SLOW DOWN.



     EXT. STREET - FULL SHOT - (NIGHT) - (STOP MOTION)      101

     With the speed of wind, pedestrians streak across
     the pavement.  The bright lights of the night pop
     out one after another leaving a sparingly
     illuminated street.  The HUMMING SUBSIDES.  The
     mannequin previously seen in the show window now
     wears the clothing of the "Roaring Twenties".  A
     distant CLOCK STRIKES ELEVEN.

               Good heavens, that's a dress?



     MANNEQUIN - MED. SHOT                                  103

     From her pretty face with the funny hat, the
     CAMERA PANS DOWN to the hem line of her skirt,
     twelve inches from the floor.

     A smile appears on his face.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               This was intriguing.  I wondered
               just how far women would permit
               this to go.

     He pushes the lever ahead.  Flashes and HUMMING
     INCREASE and we:

     As the years speed by INTERRUPTED BY SHORT BLURS,
     the dresses of the mannequin change.  The skirts
     get shorter and shorter, then drop inch by inch
     while the hair styles vary.  The bosom appears to
     swell with the sinking neckline and flattens as
     the neckline rises.  During this:

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               I began to grow fond of that
               mannequin.  Maybe because, like me,
               she didn't age.



     THE TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                         106

     Suddenly he hears the SOUNDS OF AIRPLANES and
     EXPLOSIONS in a strangely ACCELERATED manner.
     He looks down at the instruments.



     INSERT OF DIALS                                        107

     December of 1939 and January, February, March,
     April, May of the year 1940 are peeling off.

     The instruments vibrate erratically.

     He stares at the dials with much concern as he
     is PITCHED back and forth in his Machine.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               Suddenly, in nineteen forty I began
               to be buffeted from side to side.
               My first thought was that the Machine
               had a mechanical defect or a part
               had worn out.

     The Time Traveller HEARS the SCREAMS of DIVING
     PLANES.  He stops the Machine and looks up at:



     SKYLIGHT - MED. SHOT - (NIGHT) - (STOCK)               109

     Through the panes of broken glass we see a clear
     but limited glimpse of the night sky that is
     swept by beams of searching lights.

     ANTI-AIRCRAFT batteries are FIRING as a squadron
     of Nazi fighter planes are caught in the criss-
     cross beams of light.  The sky is pierced with
     ack ack.  Then, following the sound OF APPROACHING RAF.
     FIGHTER PLANES, a dog fight ensues.  Several of the
     planes are hit and plummet earthward, balls of
     streaking flame and fire.

     Gazing up at the grim spectacle.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               The last time I had stopped was in
               nineteen seventeen, twenty three years
               ago.  And the war with Germany was
               still waging - now in the air with
               flying machines.  It didn't seem
               possible they could go on fighting
               all these years and still have the
               means of fighting.  Then I realized
               the truth of the matter.  This was a
               new war.  There must have been an
               interval of peace in between these
               wars.  Yet they had learned nothing
               but to prepare even more effective
               means of destroying one another.  I
               decided to push on into time and see
               the outcome.

     He looks down at:

     Denoting the movement of the Machine through time.
     The dials spin from 1940 to 1959 where the HUMMING
     NOISE SUBSIDES and the dials again come to a stop.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               The fighting in the sky lasted only
               a few moments.  By nineteen forty five
               it was over, but I continued on a
               few more years before pausing for
               another glimpse of my silent, never
               aging friend.

               It vas reassuring to find that she
               hadn't changed.  Only her costume.
               Provocative to say the least.  I
               wondered what she would look like
               ten years hence.

     With a grin he throws the lever forward.

     and so on until it finally STOPS on 1966.

     EXT. STREET IN 1966 - LONG SHOT - (DAY)                117

     People are racing along the sidewalk.  The SOUND
     OF MORE DEEP-THROATED SIRENS from all directions
     comes over.  Drivers leave their cars of the period
     in disorder.

     The running is purposive, however.  All are entering
     particular buildings or, like those closest to the
     Time Traveller, are descending a stairway from the
     sidewalk down below street level.  Some glance sky-
     ward.

     A LITTLE GIRL picks up the doll she has dropped
     as her FATHER returns from the shelter.  He gathers
     her up in his arms and rushes back to safety.

     In a few seconds the streets are deserted.

     The Time Traveller gets out and looks around,
     confused.

               At first I wondered if my Machine and
               I were the cause of the panic.  I was
               to soon find out we weren't.

     He starts off toward the sidewalk, the CAMERA
     MOVING with him.  At the descending subway stair-
     way he stops and peers downward, but sees no one
     below.  Meanwhile, through a loudspeaker o.s.,
     a melodious SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA is heard softly,
     until a BURST OF CHORDS attracts the Time Traveller's
     attention.

     A TELEVISION CABINET on display.  The set is

     led by one of the popular conductors of tomorrow.
     The CAMERA SWINGS to the modern ENTRANCE of FILBY'S
     DEPARTMENT STORE just as the Time Traveller reaches
     the two broad glass doors.  As he steps forward he
     intercepts the rays of electronic eyes and the doors
     fly wide open.

     He stops startled, looking about to see who opened
     them.  Seeing no one, he starts slowly forward.

     From the TV set BLARES MUSIC that gradually becomes
     the UNDERSCORE for the SCENE.  The Time Traveller
     enters and turns his attention to other products
     of tomorrow -- refrigerators, vacuum cleaners,
     reducing belts, etc.  As his keen mind grasps the
     significance of each, he smiles with approval, proud
     of his fellow man.  His delight increases until he
     is interrupted by APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS.  He looks
     off.



     REVERSE SHOT                                           121

     Coming from the office is THE WARDEN, dressed in a
     plastic suit.  He also wears an armband and a white
     crash helmet, both bearing the insignia of "Civilian
     Defense."  MUMBLES are heard from beneath his mask
     as the CAMERA PANS him to the Time Traveller.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
                    (shakes his head)
               I can't understand you.

     The warden takes off his helmet.  He is David
     Filby's son, James, whom we saw in 1917 as a young
     man.  He is now in his mid-sixties.

               you hear the air raid siren?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               You mean that horrible screeching?

                         WARDEN
               It wasn't constructed for its
               aesthetic values, you know, but to
               warn silly young fools like yourself
               to get down into the shelter.  Now
               go on.

               But I'm perfectly comfortable and
               I find your store magnificent.  What
               splendid achievements, what gigantic
               strides mankind has taken, what...

                    (interrupting)
               Come on, young man.  We'd better be
               going before the mushrooms start
               sprouting.
                    (looks at Time Traveller
                    with renewed interest)
               You do look familiar.  Haven't
               we met somewhere before?

               Indeed we have.  Right here.  Many
               years ago.

                         WARDEN
               I was sure of that, but the exact
               time escapes me.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               It was two wars ago, I believe.
               Nineteen seventeen.

                         WARDEN (awed)
               Why now I recall.  The chap who
               inquired about my father -- and
               the house that used to be across
               the way.
                    (stops and stares at
                    the Time Traveller)
               But no...that's impossible.  You
               haven't changed.  You're not a day
               older.  And your clothes...

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I'm afraid it's going to take me
               a little time to explain... You see...

     There is an insistent, EAR PIECING SIREN.  It
     lasts for three seconds.

                         WARDEN
               The last alert...hurry!

     He grabs the Time Traveller by the arm and drags
     him out.

               in!  That's important!!

     The Warden runs, looks back over shoulder, calling.

                         WARDEN
               Hurry!  Hide 'til the All Clear!

     He descends into the air raid shelter.

                    (yells)
               I've got to talk to you.

     The Time Traveller looks up as he hears the
     APPROACHING SIRENS OF AN AMBULANCE.  Alarmed,
     he runs across the street directly in the path
     of the ambulance that threads its way between the
     cars left in disorder on the road.  The driver
     spins the steering wheel and the ambulance tilts
     crazily in trying to avoid the Time Traveller.
     Suddenly there is a BLINDING FLASH.  He stops and
     looks startled.

     Through the thick cloud of smoke and dust we see
     the once proud city of the future in ruins.  Only
     a single, large structure in the f.g. remains stand-

     The ground shudders with an OMINOUS sound and sudden
     a great rent appears in the wide street ahead, as
     though the earth were being torn apart.  It zig-zags
     down the street and from the widening fissure clouds
     of smoke and steam rise.

               But then Mother Earth, aroused by man's

               violence or her own!

     ures in the f.g. dissolve into smoke and flame and
     the upper parts come tumbling down into the rising
     red flood.  Then the incoming rush of the river
     meets the flowing tide of lava.  The two opposite
     elements, molten rock and cold green water, dwarf
     the ruined city as they leap toward each other, and
     meet with explosive fury.  The air is rent with the
     SINGING HISS of water and the CRACKLING of cooling
     rock.  Steam whitens the sky.



     THE TIME MACHINE - LONG SHOT - (STOCK) - (PROCESS)     131

     Out of the tumult a flow of red hot lava turns
     aside and leaps directly toward the Time Machine.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               Then I saw my own danger.  I too was
               to be engulfed!



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                132

     As he sees his great peril.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               But to go back was unthinkable.

     He jams the lever forward to its furthest position.
     The HUMMING SOARS TO A VERY HIGH PITCH.



     THE ENCROACHING LAVA - (STOCK)                         133

     It has been approaching with the speed of a torrent,
     but now it literally leaps forward in a blinding
     red haze that engulfs the entire scene.



     THE TIME MACHINE - MED. SHOT                           134

     The interior of the Machine is permeated with a dull
     red glow which seems to flow like mist all about the
     Time Traveller.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               Only my speed through time saved me
               from being roasted alive and encased
               in stone forever.



     INSERT OF DIALS                                        135

     They are spinning too fast to distinguish anything
     in the gradually fading red glow.



     EXTREME CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                        136

     His face is bathed in sweat.  His eyes search the
     growing darkness.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               The molten rock cooled.
                    (he closes his burning
                    eyes as the last of the
                    light vanishes)
               I prayed...wondering how many centuries,
               how many eons must pass before the wind
               and rain could wear away the mountain
               that enclosed me.

     In the pitch darkness there are only the sounds of
     the HUMMING TIME MACHINE and the SLOW LABORED
     BREATHING of the Time Traveller.

     Then a match flickers.  The CAMERA SCARES BACK.  The
     Time Traveller holds up a burning matchstick, his
     face glistening with perspiration as he leans forward
     to look at the dials.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
                    (whispering)
               Darkness...darkness for centuries.



     INSERT OF DIALS                                        137

     They roll very fast.  We can distinguish only the
     passing of years -- 70,000...80,000...90,000...
     100,000.  Then the matchlight flickers and goes
     out leaving only the dial's own faint glow.



     BACK ON TIME TRAVELLER                                 138

     Once again there is darkness and the MONOTONOUS HUM
     of the Time Machine.  He breathes heavily and tries
     to calm himself.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               I wondered if there was still war
               being waged on the ground above me...
               if man would still exist on earth,
               when I saw the sun again.

     As he speaks, the Time Machine goes faster and faster.
     HIGH PITCHED HUMMING INCREASES.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               The centuries rolled by. - I put
               my trust in time and waited for
               the rock to wear down around me.

     A white light from above begins to permeate the dark-
     ness.  The Time Traveller looks up, his face showing
     immense relief.



     WHAT HE SEES - (ANIMATION)                             139

     Rocks deteriorate and a bright blue sky bursts into
     view.  ACCENT ON MUSIC.



     EXT. TIME MACHINE AND GROUND NEARBY - LONG SHOT        140
     (SPLIT, ANIMATION)

     Everything is a blur except the Time Machine with its
     passenger.  The black rock on the surface slowly melts
     away and the flickering sunlight returns.  The Machine
     is now finally entirely above ground, the only distinct
     object in the whirling transparent landscape.



     EXT. TIME TRAVELLER - CLOSE SHOT                       141

     As he smiles gratefully up at the sky.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               I was free again!

     He looks o.s.



     INDISTINCT COUNTRYSIDE - LONG SHOT - (ANIMATION)       142

     There is an impression of several great buildings
     set wide apart by green landscape -- a landscape
     which no longer changes color even though trees
     spring up like plumes of green smoke.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               Thousands of centuries passed, but
               the earth stayed green!  There was
               no winter!  No wars! - Had man finally
               learned to control both the elements
               and themselves? - I had to stop and
               find out.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                             143

     As he eagerly pulls hard on the lever, the HUMMING
     DECREASES and the dial freezes on:  "23 November
     802,701".  THERE IS A CRASH LIKE THUNDER and the
     Time Machine suddenly goes into a spin.  The CAMERA
     ZOOMS BACK TO A FULL HIGH SHOT as the machine keels
     over.  The friction caused by the intrusion creates
     a pitiless HAIL, and we

                                    SLOWLY DISSOLVE TO:



     EXT. TIME TRAVELLER - CLOSE SHOT - (DAY)               144

     Thick mist eddies about his face, undulating
     dreamily, revealing enough to see that he is
     unconscious.  Blood seeps from a gash across his
     forehead.  He dazedly opens his eyes to find that
     he is gazing across the dewey, green turf.  Then
     he looks up.



     EXT. THE SPHINX - FULL SHOT - LOW ANGLE - (MATTE)      145

     The vapor rises like a curtain to disclose a great
     bronze pedestal, green with verdigris, whereon
     clawed feet support the white marble figure of an
     immense Sphinx.  The figure has the face of a
     woman, the body of a huge cat and the tail of a
     serpent.  A weeping birch tree barely touches its
     outspread wings.



     THE TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                         146

     He shakes the cobwebs out of his head and, FOLLOWED
     BY THE CAMERA, rises with difficulty.  Still half-
     dazed he presses a handkerchief to his temple, as
     he loosens his collar, then reaches into the Machine,
     pockets the lever and surveys his surroundings.



     LANDSCAPE - LONG SHOT - (MATTE)                        147

     It looks like a garden untended for centuries.  The
     trees and shrubs are laden with strange blossoms or
     exotic fruits.

     In the distance there is a building that might once
     have been a temple.  Vines mat the ancient walls,
     seemingly holding them together.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 148

     He smiles.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (to himself)
               At last I've found a Paradise.

     He starts off toward the building WHISTLING his
     favorite tune, "The Land Of The Leal".  The CAMERA
     ACCOMPANIES him as he looks about with interest.



     WHAT HE SEES - MOVING SHOT                             149

     Strange, exotic fruits bend the branches of the
     TREES, some purplish and gourd-shaped, others
     suggesting giant raspberries, mangoes, etc.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               Nature tamed completely and more
               bountiful than ever before.



     VARIETY OF FLOWERS - MOVING SHOT                       150

     The CAMERA PANS under boughs laden with orchids and
     a multitude of other gorgeous blossoms.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               Flowers everywhere...the whole landscape
               one vast garden with no sign of weeds or
               briars.



     EXT. ENTRANCE TO GREAT BUILDING - LONG SHOT - (DAY)    151

     The Time Traveller pauses and looks up at the building.



     ACROSS FACADE - PAN DOWN - (MINIATURE?)                152

     Vines creep up the crevices.  The ornamental stone
     work, while rich in detail, is weathered and
     broken with age.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
                    (surprised)
               Unrepaired for centuries!  Maybe
               unlived in for as long.
                    (then)
               It would be no Paradise if it
               belonged to me alone.



     INT. ENTRANCE - MED. SHOT                              153

     Shooting through the ARCHWAY we see the Time
     Traveller mount the steps and enter the building.



     INT. THE GREAT HALL - FULL SHOT - (MATTE) - (DAY)      154

     In the background across the hall, the Time Traveller
     halts.  He is dwarfed by the height of the vaulted
     ceiling.  Although ancient in appearance, everything
     is ultra modern in design.  Sunlight streams through
     windows where half the panes of stained glass are
     broken.  Faded curtains droop in dusty folds along
     the walls, and at random about the floor are low
     tables, some heavily fractured, loaded with bowls
     of fruit.

     His FOOTSTEPS ECHO through the great hall as the
     Time Traveller crosses to:



     A TABLE - MED. SHOT                                    155

     The Time Traveller glances down at the spread of
     exotic fruit.  Everything looks fresh and clean as
     though newly prepared.  Yet there is no indication
     of life or sound, either human or animal.  The air
     hangs in a deathlike stillness.  Slowly the Time
     Traveller turns and looks around the walls, his
     eyes searching, scrutinizing for some clue to
     this strange place.  There is none.

     Then he picks up an empty marble plate and POUNDS
     with it on the top of the table.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (shouting)
               Anyone here?

     But an ECHO is his only answer.  Curiously he re-
     traces his steps and leaves the great hall.



     EXT. LANDSCAPE - FULL SHOT - (DAY)                     156

     Pick up the Time Traveller as he walks slowly along.
     Every sense he possesses is on the alert.  His eyes
     probe every bush and tree and object that could
     possibly conceal some person or thing.



     SERIES OF SHOTS                                        157-161

     As the Time Traveller takes this long, slow walk,
     INTERCUT INSERTS of the various innocent objects
     he looks at with CLOSEUPS of Time Traveller as he
     reacts to the bewildering SILENCE and lack of life
     or movement.

     The continued stretch of emptiness builds up a wave
     of apprehension in the Time Traveller which grows
     as he moves along.  The apprehension mounts into
     tension and gradually but inevitably approaches
     the state of horror that a human being would
     experience in a strange place where he had just
     come from an innocent freshly set table of ripe
     fruits and stepped outside into a beautiful but
     weird vacuum.



     EXT. WOODED AREA - LONG SHOT                           162

     As the Time Traveller reaches the edge of the trees,
     he hesitates, then moves into the forest.



     SERIES OF SHOTS                                        163-166

     The trees are thick and deep shadows cut patches of
     darkness through the bright sunlight which struggles
     to penetrate the maze.  The Time Traveller walks
     with continued wariness through the trees, glancing
     from left to right and occasionally stopping dead
     still and quickly darting a glance behind him at
     what he imagines to be some sound of movement.
     But all this is imaginary on his part.  There is
     nothing that moves or makes a sound in this forest.

     Suddenly he stops as he distinctly hears a familar
     and quite HUMAN combination of NOISES.  The SOUND
     SPLASHING WATER and LAUGHTER.  He hurries to some
     dense foliage where he stops to cautiously peer out.



     EXT. THE POOL - LONG SHOT - (DAY)                      167

     The Time Traveller's VIEW is partially obscured by
     the leaves.  At considerable distance upstream, the
     PEOPLE OF THE FUTURE are swimming in a natural pool
     and sunning themselves on a beach of white sand.
     They are small, but delicately formed.  Their grace
     and beauty fits perfectly into this splendid new
     world.  The spot is also extremely lovely, surrounded
     by fern trees, and with the water plunging into it
     from a high waterfall.  Below the pool the stream
     emerges in a swift torrent.



     ANOTHER, CLOSER SHOT                                   168

     A beautiful GIRL, dressed in a silken robe of white
     and gold, starts running.  As she runs, she loosens
     her robe which drifts to the sand and she dives deep
     into the crystal water.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                169

     He smiles philosophically and leans back against a
     tree trunk, watching the distant swimmers, reassured.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (musingly,
                    to himself)
               So this is man's future...



     GROUP SHOT                                             170

     The people, apparently without any cares of the
     world, play, romp and swim.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (o.s.)
               ...to bask in the sunlight, bathe in
               the clear streams and eat the fruits
               of earth with all knowledge of work
               and hardship forgotten.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 171

     He pauses, thinking back on what he has just said.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Well, and why not?

     Suddenly a SHRILL SCREAM COMES OVER from the pool.
     He turns.



     THE POOL - LONG SHOT                                   172

     The Girl has swum out too far and is caught by the
     swift torrent.  She CRIES OUT PITEOUSLY.

     The other people turn their heads toward her, but
     make no move to help.



     CLOSE ON GIRL                                          173

     She has caught a ledge of rock and clings.  Two
     little men, their bare feet dangling in the water,
     sit nearby but ignore the Girl's plight.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                           174

     He jumps out from the foliage, rushes to the bank,
     points toward the Girl and tries to attract the
     attention of those near her on the bank.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Help her!...

     No one moves.  He runs toward the ledge.



     BACK TO THE GIRL                                       175

     Her grasp on the ledge grows weaker.  She is at
     the point of letting go.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                           176

     Reaching the ledge, he pushes past the people nearby
     and grasps the Girl's wrist just as her fingers
     slip.  Quickly, he pulls her out of the river's
     turbulent current and lifts her up in his arms.



     GIRL - EXTREME CLOSE UP                                177

     Looking up at the Time Traveller bewildered, she
     shows neither fear nor gratitude.



     TIME TRAVELLER - EXTREME CLOSE UP                      178

     Gazing back at the Girl thoroughly puzzled.  He
     turns and glances down at the two little people
     on the ledge.



     CLOSE TWO SHOT                                         179

     These two men will later be known as the YOUNG MAN
     and the MAN IN WHITE.  They return the Time Travel-
     ler's look of scorn with pleasant smiles as if they
     do not know the meaning of a mean look.



     TIME TRAVELLER & GIRL - EXTREME CLOSE, MOVING SHOT     180

     Trying to avoid looking at the dripping, robeless
     Girl - after all he is a Victorian - he carries her
     to the safety of the bank and sets her down on the
     sandy beach beneath the trees.  The CAMERA FOLLOWS
     him as he straightens, then quickly takes off his
     jacket and throws it around her.

     He looks at her for the first time sees the almost
     ultimate in feminine beauty.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Are you all right?



     TIME TRAVELLER & GIRL - FULL SHOT                      181

     Wearing his velvet jacket very appealingly, she
     calmly rises, turns and, without a word, walks
     away.  The Time Traveller stares after her in
     astonishment.

     The disconcerned people, now all dressed in multi-
     colored robes, are leaving the pool.  They walk
     past the Time Traveller as though he was a part of
     the scenery, merely adding to his confusion.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                182

     Perplexed.

     EXT. ENTRANCE TO THE GREAT BUILDING - (SUNSET)         183

     Shooting toward the ARCHWAY.  The sun is sinking as
     the last stragglers of the little people enter the
     great hall.  The Time Traveller slowly follows them.
     He pauses on the steps to see if any will turn back
     to either welcome him or resent his intrusion, but
     they move on with lack of interest, completely.  He
     sits down on the steps, thoroughly perplexed at this
     utter indifference.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                             184

     Seated on the steps leaning against a column.  He
     senses another's presence, looks about, sees no one,
     then turns to glance over his shoulder.  The Girl, now
     wearing her robe and holding his jacket over her arm,
     appears from behind the column.  He looks at her and
     smiles reassuringly, but makes no move toward her. -
     She comes closer, then sits on the step above him and
     returns his jacket.  While he slowly slips it on,
     she slides down a step to sit alongside him.

                         THE GIRL
               Why did you?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Why did I what?

                         THE GIRL
               Come after me.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (ironic)
               I did it to save your life, young
               lady, which I'm afraid doesn't hold
               much meaning for you or anyone else.

                         THE GIRL (simply)
               It doesn't.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Must have been fifty of your friends
               watching you drown.  Not one of
               them so much as lifted a finger. -
                    (shakes his head)
               A curious attitude - in a curious
               world.
                    (a pause, then a
                    smile)
               Aren't you the least bit interested
               in what I am...where I come from?

                         THE GIRL (innocently)
               Should I be?

                         TIME TRAVELLER (smiles)
               Perhaps you'd better take me to
               someone a bit older I can talk to.

                         THE GIRL
               There is no one older.

     The Time Traveller is suddenly struck by the truth
     of her words.  All of the little people seem to be
     of the Girl's age or younger.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Doesn't anyone age in this land
               of yours?

     The Girl makes no reply.  Instead she gazes off at the
     sun which is low in the heavens.  Shadows have already
     fallen over the distant hills.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               What's your name?

                         THE GIRL
               Weena.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               How do you spell that?

                         WEENA
               Spell?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Write!  - Can't you write?  Look!

     He bends over, picks up a stick and starts to draw
     on the ground.



     INSERT: DUST                                           185

     As the stick writes out: " W E E N A "



     BACK TO SCENE                                          186

     She shows little interest.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               And what are your people called?

                         WEENA (as if he ought to know)
               Eloi.



     INSERT OF DUST                                         187

     The stick now writes in the dust: " E L O I "



     BACK TO SCENE                                          188

     A shadow crosses her face.  Suddenly she springs
     to her feet, concerned.

                         WEENA
               Come.  We must go in.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (rising)
               Why?  What's wrong?

                         WEENA (anxiously)
               It is getting dark.

     She grabs his hand and pulls him toward:



     INT. THE GREAT HALL - LONG SHOT - (MATTE?) - (DAY)     189

     Crowded now.  The people of the future are sitting
     on cushions around the tables, having their evening
     meal.  The glowing orange light of the setting sun
     pierces the broken windows, lending a curious at-
     mosphere to the place.  No one pays attention to
     Weena or to the Time Traveller as they enter in the
     b.g.



     AT THE MAIN TABLE - MED. SHOT                          190

     A score of attractive young men and young women are
     enjoying their dinner.  There is a general atmos-
     phere of bubbling good humor.  They don't even look
     up as Weena and the Time Traveller sit down at the
     table.  She hands him an orange-sized raspberry.  He
     takes it, looks at the Young Man and the Man in White
     who sit across the table from him and tries to engage
     them in conversation.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (directed to
                    Young Man, but meant for the
                    entire group)
               I don't mind telling you, I'm quite
               hungry.  I've come a long, long way.

     Looks around for some kind of a reaction.  There is
     none.

     He bites into the fruit.  It's good.  While he is
     eating he searches for another way to bring up the
     subject.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               In my time a berry this size would
               have made news in every civilized
               country.



     GROUP SHOT                                             192

     There is no reaction, so he addresses the Young Man
     again.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Sir, perhaps curiosity has died.
               Perhaps even courtesy has died, but
               I have come a long way and there are
               things I would like to know.

                         YOUNG MAN (considers a
                    moment, then)
               Why?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Because I shall return to my time
               and they will ask questions such as
               what kind of government rules your
               world.

                         MAN IN WHITE
               We have no government.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (speaking
                    as though to a child)
               You must have a body of men who pass
               and enforce laws.

                         MAN IN WHITE
               There are no laws.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (taken aback,
                    then)
               How do you get your food and clothing?

     The Man in White looks at the Young Man beside him.
     They both shrug their shoulders.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Doesn't anyone work?

                         MAN IN WHITE
               No.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (picks up
                    fruit)
               Then where does this come from?

                         MAN IN WHITE
               It grows.  It always grows.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               But it must be planted, cultivated,
               nurtured...unless...
                    (with mistaken insight as he
                    observes no reaction to this
                    last query)
               Unless you have an economy so well
               organized that you can devote all your
               time to study and experimentation.
               Am I right?

                         MAN IN WHITE
               You ask many questions.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (annoyed)
               Yes!  And I'm not ashamed of it.
               That is how man has learned and
               bettered himself.  I must learn about
               you and your civilization.  You have
               books, don't you?

                         YOUNG MAN (recognizing a
                    half-forgotten word)
               Books. - Books!  Yes, we have books.

     He rises and beckons.  The Time Traveller's brow
     clears.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Books will tell me what I want to
               know.  Books will tell me all about
               you.

     He too gets up and follows the Young Man.



     AT THE WALL - LONG SHOT                                193

     The Young Man leading.  He reaches the wall and
     seizes an ancient curtain which covers it.  A
     cloud of dust rises as he tugs it aside and the
     curtain falls, almost crumbling.  Shelves and
     shelves of books are disclosed.  The books are
     old even though many of them have futuristic de-
     signs.  The bindings of once proud volumes hang in
     brown tatters.  The Time Traveller steps to the
     books.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                194

     The realization of the true state of affairs shows
     on his face.  He is appalled.  Carefully he pulls
     a volume from the shelf.  Its binding breaks as
     he opens it and, when his hand touches the pages,
     they crumple like ashes and drift to the floor.
     He drops the book.  His voice is a shocked WHISPER.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Yes...they do tell me all about you!

     With sudden violence he slams his fist into a whole
     shelf of books.  His hand plows through them and
     the dust swirls into the air.  He turns back in
     anger.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               What have you done?  Thousands of
               years of building and rebuilding
               creating and re-creating so that
               you can let it crumble to dust.

     With one hand he grabs the Young Man and shakes him.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               A million yesterdays of sensitive
               men dying for their dreams.  For
               what?  So you can swim and dance
               and play.

     He releases him and leaves.



     THE HALL - MOVING SHOT                                 195

     The Time Traveller stomps among the Eloi, hating
     them for their dissipation.

     Without emotion they watch him walk toward the
     entrance.  Only Weena jumps to her feet.  Her
     former indifference is gone.



     AT THE ENTRANCE                                        196

     From the top step, the Time Traveller looks down
     at them.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I am returning to my time!  Not to
               tell of the uselessness of the
               struggle - not to tell of the
               hopeless future - but only so that
               I can die among men!

     He turns and strides toward the door.



     EXT. ENTRANCE - MED. SHOT - (DUSK)                     197

     The Time Traveller bursts out of the building.  A
     moment later Weena appears in the archway.  She
     stands there, looking after him.

                                           DISSOLVE TO:



     EXT. FOREST - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT)                      198

     There are patches of mist and haze between the
     trees.  With a blazing torch the Time Traveller
     strides across.



     EXT. TIME TRAVELLER ON THE PATH - (NIGHT)              199

     Coming from the distance the CAMERA PANS HIM TO
     THE EDGE OF LAWN, where he stops short, jerking
     the pipe from his mouth, his eyes wide with con-
     sternation.  He raises the torch high to see:



     EXT. THE LAWN - FULL SHOT - (NIGHT)                    200

     There is no Time Machine.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                201

     In stunned shock.



     THE PATH - FULL SHOT                                   202

     Holding his torch high, the Time Traveller hurries
     toward the bushes around the edge of the lawn
     looking for his Machine, beating the branches with
     his free hand.  After he passes one of the bushes,
     a white indistinct creature dashes out of it and
     disappears in the darkness.  Unaware of this, the
     Time Traveller stops in the mindle of the lawn
     where the Machine was last seen.

     (NOTE:  The surrounding is suggestive of the spot
             where the Time Traveller's house once stood.)

     He looks about, slowly turning in a complete circle.
     Meanwhile the CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSE.  Then, sud-
     denly remembering, he digs his free hand into the
     pocket of his trouser, drawing out the lever he
     had removed and looks at it with self-assurance.
     Returning the lever to his pocket, he drops to his
     knees and by the light of his torch, scrutinizes
     the grass.



     THE GROUND - TIME TRAVELLER'S P.O.V.                   203

     The turf has been ripped in parallel grooves as
     though some heavy object had been dragged across.
     CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY FORWARD following these grooves
     and HALTS where small misshapen, half-human foot-
     prints stand out clearly in the freshly turned
     earth.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                           204

     He straightens slowly, his eyes narrowed.
     Nervously he looks around, then steps on follow-
     ing the grooves.



     BACK TO THE FOOTPRINTS                                 205

     THE CAMERA CONTINUES TO FOLLOW the grooves
     straight across the lawn to the flagstones around
     the white sphinx.  There are dark scratches on the
     stones leading to the wide panel in the base of
     the pedestal.  Here the marks end.



     AT THE PEDESTAL - MED. SHOT                            206

     The Time Traveller pauses, then gives the panel an
     exploratory KNOCK.  It responds with a HOLLOW SOUND.

     The Time Traveller thrusts his torch between the
     claws of the sphinx.  With both hands now free,
     he tries unsuccessfully to push the panel either
     to right or left or up or down.  Taking a penknife
     from his pocket, he runs the blade around the panel's
     edge hunting for a secret latch.  No success.

     Then he pauses, searching for a tool, and sees a
     loosened flagstone.  He picks it up.  With this
     heavy weight he batters the panel.  At each blow
     it RESOUNDS LOUDLY, not unlike a gong.  Four times
     he strikes, and then on the fifth blow the rock
     shatters in his hands.  He stops in despair.

     He senses he is under observation by an unseen
     presence.  Alarmed, he whips around then looks up
     to:



     THE SPHINX - LOW ANGLE - (MINIATURE OR MATTE)          208

     The marble face looks baleful, almost smiling in
     the torch light.



     BACK ON TIME TRAVELLER                                 209

     He turns and peers toward:



     THE BUSHES                                             210

     In the shadows, beyond reach of the light, is a
     wide semi-circle of luminous eyes, reflecting the
     flame of the torch.



     TIME TRAVELLER - FULL SHOT                             211-213

     He grabs his torch from the pedestal and slowly
     paces toward the nearest bush.  But as he ap-
     proaches, the glowing eyes vanish in the haze,
     followed by a ghostly impression of pale,
     fleeing creatures.

     The Time Traveller halts and turns in another
     direction.  The same thing happens.

     Then he has an idea.  Bending, he beats the torch
     against the moist soil and extinguishes it.  Now
     in the darkness he straightens and waits, peering
     around until he hears a twig CRACK, then moves
     into the deep shadow of a tall bush, looking off.



     THE PATH                                               214

     Through the mist in the foliage a pale figure
     approaches slowly.  It emerges onto the lawn.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                             215

     The CAMERA FOLLOWS as he leaps forward, grapples the
     other figure and bears it to earth.  For a moment
     there is a struggle and then the other figure lies
     perfectly still.  The Time Traveller rears back to
     get a look at it.



     THE FIGURE ON THE GROUND - EXTREME CLOSE SHOT          216

     It is Weena.  The moving shadow of the Time Traveller
     reveals her pale face, with closed eyes, wearing an
     expression of helpless terror.  She appears to be
     waiting for the inevitable end, but when it does
     not come, she slowly opens her eyes.  She sees the
     Time Traveller and her face records a wave of
     relief.

     The CAMERA WITHDRAWS TO TWO SHOT as the Time
     Traveller, embarrassed, helps her sit up.

                         WEENA
               I heard you pounding...I came to
               tell you...

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               How do you open that panel?

                         WEENA
               No one opens it.  Only the Morlocks.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Morlocks? - Who are the Morlocks?

     A look of fear comes into her eyes.  She drifts
     her gaze away from his, too frightened to answer.
     Gently he takes her by the shoulders and turns
     her to face him.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Why are you afraid of the Morlocks?

     Again Weena drops her eyes from him, but he cups
     his hand beneath her chin and tenderly turns her
     head back so that her eyes meet his.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Tell me.

                         WEENA
               When they call, we must go below.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Do the Morlocks live beneath the
               earth?
                    (Weena nods)
               Why must you obey their command?

                         WEENA
               They give us the food we eat, the
               clothes we wear.  We must do as
               they command.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               What happens to your people when
               they go below?

                         WEENA (repressing an in-
                    voluntary shudder)
               No one knows.  No one has ever
               returned.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (smiling
                    at her warmly, reassuringly)
               It won't happen to you.

     Weena looks up at him, her fears dwindling, find-
     ing comfort in this strange being whom she cannot
     understand.  Then she glances high into the dark sky
     and the old fear returns.

                         WEENA
               It is night.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Only children are frightened by
               the dark. - But then you are a
               child, aren't you?
                    (Weena glances around
                    warily into the shadows,
                    her anxiety mounting)
               I'll build a fire.

                         WEENA (taking his
                    hand, rises)
               Let us go from here.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (getting
                    up)
               I can't, child.
                    (walking toward the sphinx)
               My Machine is inside there, I
               intend to wait here 'til morning,
               then find some way of getting
               inside.

                         WEENA (catching up)
               No, you must not.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (stops,
                    then)
               Help me gather some wood.



     THE LAWN AND THE BASE - LONG SHOT                      217

     Reluctantly she helps him collect a few twigs which
     she hands over to him.

                         WEENA
               Where are you from?

                         TIME TRAVELLER (picks
                    up dry branches)
               As a matter of fact, I'm from
               right here.
                    (gesturing)
               There's where my house stood many
               thousands of years ago.  Here - to
               that monument, was my laboratory.
               About there was my library where I
               once sat talking with friends about
               my Time Machine.

     Meanwhile, Weena has seated herself near the
     bushes in the f.g.



     CLOSE ON WEENA                                         218

     She watches every move he makes.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
                    (continuing)
               I hoped to learn a great deal.  I
               hoped to take back the knowledge,
               the advancement, mankind made...
               instead what do I find?  Vegetables!

     Meanwhile a pair of pale, hairy hands rise slowly
     from behind her.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                             219

     With his back turned, he is piling up the sticks.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (continuing)
               The human race reduced to living
               vegetables!



     BACK TO WEENA                                          220

     The hairy hands grab her shoulders.  The fear
     paralyzes her.  She is unable to scream.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 221

     He is about to light a match, but finds he needs
     more wood.  Without turning he calls back to Weena.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Get me a few more twigs.

     When there is no answer he turns and looks.



     AT THE BUSHES                                          222

     Weena is gone.  The CAMERA ZIPS TO LEFT, then to
     RIGHT and finally STOPS on the limp legs of Weena
     slowly disappearing under the brush.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                           223

     We hear the RUSTLING OF BRANCHES and quick DIMINISHING
     FOOTSTEPS as the CAMERA RUSHES with the Time Traveller
     toward the bush.  He helps Weena to her feet and draws
     her to the pile of dry branches.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
                    (after calming her)
               What was it?

                         WEENA (low)
               Morlocks.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (strikes
                    match and holds it to twigs)
               This seems to keep them away.



     CLOSE ON WEENA                                         224

     She gazes into the fire, with fascination.  Slowly
     she raises her hand and reaches out to grasps the
     flame.



     TWO SHOT                                               225

     The Time Traveller grabs her hand.  It is almost
     too late.  She looks at her burned hand with more
     amazement than pain.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (while
                    examining her hand)
               What ever made you put your hand in
               the fire?

                         WEENA
               I never saw it before.

     Apparently no harm done, the Time Traveller releases
     her hand.  He shakes his head in amazement and sits
     down beside her.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
                    (after a long silence)
               Do you know that the first thing
               which separated man from the rest
               of the mammals was his knowledge of
               fire?
                    (he looks at her)
               No, I suppose you don't.
                    (pokes at fire)
               The next great stride came with
               the discovery of the wheel.
                    (turns to her)
               Do you know what that is?
                    (she shakes her head)
               I'm sorry I was angry with your
               people.  I had no right to be.
               No more than if I had visited the
               Island of Bali in my own time.
               You were safe inside your great
               house, yet you came out into the
               night to warn me.  The one
               characteristic which distinguished
               man from the animal kingdom was the
               spirit of self sacrifice.  You have
               that quality, Girl.  I'm sure all
               of your people have it.  All it
               requires is someone to reawaken it.
               I shall try if you'll let me.  Will
               you?

                         WEENA
               I do not understand you, but I
               believe you.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               That's a good start. - Now try to
               tell me...who or what are the Morlocks?
                    (Weena looks at him blankly)
               Are they people or animals?
                    (her expression remains unchanged)
               What do you know about yourself?  The
               past?  Don't your people ever speak
               of the past?

                         WEENA
               There is no past.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Don't you ever wonder about the future?

                         WEENA
               There is no future.



     ANOTHER ANGLE                                          226

     The Time Traveller is staring into the fire stirring
     the glowing embers as he speaks slowly and with
     compassion, hoping to arouse some feeling within
     her, even though she may not grasp the meaning of
     the words.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Man's past is mainly a grim struggle
               for survival, but there have been
               moments when a few voices have spoken
               up.  These rare moments have made the
               history of man a glorious thing.  I
               refuse to believe it is dead and gone.
               We've had our dark ages before and
               this is only another of them.  All
               you need is for someone to show you
               the way out. - I'm only a tinkering
               mechanic, but there must be this
               hidden spark in one of your people.
               If I can only kindle that spark, my
               coming here will have some meaning.

     During his speech Weena has cuddled close to him,
     her cheek touching his knee.  He looks down at her
     and sees he has made a friend.  He places his hand
     gently on her hair.  She looks up, her eyes no
     longer showing fear.  Their faces are illuminated
     by the dancing flames.



     THE FIRE - CLOSE SHOT                                  227

     It CRACKLES reassuringly.

                                     SLOW DISSOLVE TO:



     EXT. WELL - FULL SHOT - (DAY)                          228

     The ring of flames from the previous scene is
     seemingly replaced by a dark, circular shaft from
     which comes the low THROBBING of some GIANT
     MACHINES, pounding, beating monotonously.  The
     CAMERA MOVES BACK to include the LANDSCAPE
     where more wells are visible in the distance,
     each surrounded by a low, porcelain wall.  Their
     roofs are shining brass-like disks.

     Across the field, from the direction of the sphinx,
     approach the Time Traveller, carrying his jacket
     over his shoulder, and a few steps behind, Weena.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               My efforts next morning to open the
               panel were fruitless.  I had to find
               another way to retrieve my Machine.

     Weena, concerned, stands back as the Time Traveller
     walks up to the well in the f.g. and peers down into:



     THE SHAFT - HIGH ANGLE                                 229

     It descends into darkness, but near the top can be
     seen handholds in an irregular pattern.  The
     THROBBING OF MACHINES is ominous.



     AT THE MOUTH OF WELL - FULL SHOT                       230

     The Time Traveller in the f.g. turns back to Weena.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Listen!
                    (pause)
               Do you hear?

                         WEENA (fearfully)
               Yes.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Machines!

                         WEENA
               No...Morlocks.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
                    (straightening, amazed)
               You mean those animals run machines?

                         WEENA
               They are Morlocks.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
                    (as he walks to her)
               I know, but have you seen the
               machines?



     CLOSE ON WEENA                                         231

     She shakes her head.

                         WEENA
               No, only heard of them.

     The CAMERA EASES BACK to include the Time Traveller
     as he reaches her.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Who told you?

                         WEENA
               The talking rings.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
                    (moves closer to her)
               What sort of rings?

                         WEENA
                    (with a shrug)
               Rings that talk.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Can you show me these rings?

     Weena nods and starts off.  He follows her.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:



     INT. GREAT HALL - FULL SHOT - (DAY)                    232

     Deserted, until Weena leads the Time Traveller past
     the tables toward the shelves of crumbling books
     that the Young Man had previously shown him.

     She enters an archway and walks up a dark stone
     corridor.  He follows.



     INT. STONE CORRIDOR - MED. SHOT                        233

     Weena leading the Time Traveller up the corridor
     where it veers sharply to the right.  They disappear
     around the corner.



     INT. GREEN MUSEUM - LONG SHOT - (DAY) - (MATTE)        234

     The Time Traveller and Weena stop at the threshold of
     a huge museum-like room, all done in a greenish
     colored porcelain-like substance.  There are no
     windows, but the vaulted ceiling has a transparent
     dome where the sun's rays, changing with the course
     of day, illuminate the entire museum.  It is
     evidently a place that no one bothers to visit.



     TIME TRAVELLER & WEENA - MOVING SHOT                   235

     Their feet kick up small flurries of dust as they
     walk among exhibitions of a long bygone era still
     existent behind plastic.  Some of the cases are
     broken and their contents, exposed to the atmos-
     phere, have decayed, crumbled to dust.  We recognize
     objects and machines, some belonging to the early
     part of the twentieth century and still others take
     on the forms and shapes that the audience of today
     will recognize as contemporary.  Then they pass
     cabinets that hold objects of a time far beyond
     comprehension.

     Weena finally leads the Time Traveller to a broken
     case which contains several boxes of golden rings
     a few inches in diameter and one inch wide, lined
     with minutely spaced grooves.  He picks up the
     nearest box and examines its contents.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
                    (picking up a ring)
               Are these the talking rings?

                         WEENA
               Yes.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               They speak?

                         WEENA
               Yes.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Of what?

                         WEENA
               Things no one here understands.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               How do you get it to talk?

     Weena takes the ring from the Time Traveller and
     lays it on a smooth topped porcelain block on its
     edge, like a coin, and spins it like a top.



     INSERT:  WHIRLING RING                                 236

     A VOICE emerges from the spinning ring as the current
     of air flows through its grooves, much like a phono-
     graph needle evokes sound as it plays through the
     surface of one of our records.

                         VOICE FROM RING
               Whomsoever chances upon these rings
               will probably hear the last recorded
               voice of civilized man.  This is the
               year four thousand eight hundred and
               twenty-nine.



     TWO SHOT                                               237

     The Time Traveller is listening in fascination and
     Weena in disinterested detachment.

                         VOICE FROM RING (cont'd)
               The war between the East and West,
               which is now in its three hundredth
               and twenty-sixth year has at last
               come to an end.  There is nothing
               left to fight with and few of us
               left to fight.  The atmosphere has
               become so polluted with deadly
               germs that it can no longer be
               breathed.  There is no place on
               this planet that is immune.  The
               last surviving factory for the
               manufacture of oxygen has been
               destroyed.  Stockpiles are rapidly
               diminishing and when they are gone,
               we must die...

     The last few WORDS DECREASE IN VOLUME and FADE AWAY.
     The Time Traveller eagerly reaches into the case for
     the second ring and spins it.

                         ANOTHER VOICE FROM RING
               This is the last day.  We, the last
               to survive, have had our final meeting.
               We have decided to split into two
               groups.  Each man and woman has made
               his own decision.  Some have chosen
               to take refuge in the great caverns
               and find a new way of life far down
               below the earth's surface.  The rest
               of us have decided to take our chances
               in the sunlight, small as those chances
               may be.

     The VOICE from the ring DWINDLES and is heard no
     more.  The Time Traveller quickly picks up the
     third and last ring and spins it.  NO WORDS are
     heard -- only the SOUND of MARCHING FOOTSTEPS over
     floors of stone -- then a deadly SILENCE.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                238

     As he watches the last ring spin to a standstill.
     Over this:

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               From the talking rings I learned how
               the human race divided itself and
               how the world of the Eloi and Morlocks
               began.

     He turns.



     GREEN MUSEUM - LONG SHOT                               239

     The Time Traveller paces across the hall.  Weena
     hurries after him.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               By some quirk of fate the Morlocks
               had become the masters and the Eloi
               their servants.  The Morlocks main-
               tained them and bred them like cattle
               only to take them below when they
               reached maturity, which explained why
               there were no older people along them.

     They exit.



     GREAT HALL - FULL SHOT                                 240

     The Time Traveller, followed by Weena, walks from
     the book shelves toward the entrance.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               Now I knew I must go below.  It was
               the only means of finding a way up
               into the sphinx to reach my Machine
               and to find out what happened to the
               little people when they went below.

     They leave the Great Hall.



     EXT. LANDSCAPE - FULL SHOT - (DAY)                     241

     The Time Traveller strides toward one of the wells.
     Weena senses his intention and catches up with him
     to grasp his arm.

                         WEENA
               No...don't go...please.

     He shakes her off.



     AT MOUTH OF WELL - MED. SHOT                           242

     The Time Traveller places his jacket on the wall.
     Then into the well he drops a dry leaf which, instead
     of fluttering slowly down, is at once sucked out of
     sight by the current from the shaft.  Then he looks
     around and finds a pebble, drops it down the well and
     listens.

     After a PLOP is heard he puts his arm down the
     shaft as far as it goes, feeling its surface, then
     throws his leg over the porcelain wall and starts
     to descend.  Weena rushes to his side to stop him.

                         WEENA
               You will not come back.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I'll be back.

     Weena shakes her head and, as though giving him
     a farewell gift, thrusts a large blossom into his
     pocket.  The Time Traveller smiles as he dis-
     appears.



     FROM THROAT OF WELL - LOW ANGLE                        243

     Locking from below, the top of the well appears
     like a small blue disk with Weena peering down.
     The Time Traveller gropes his way.

     Suddenly from the far distance comes the SOUND of
     LOW but POWERFUL SIREN.  Weena straightens.



     CLOSE ON WEENA                                         244

     An expression of fear comes slowly over her face
     as the LOW SIREN is joined by ANOTHER of HIGHER
     PITCH.  The Two make a grating dissonance.  Slowly
     she turns in the direction of the sound.



     BACK WITH TIME TRAVELLER                               245

     He looks up, concerned, pausing in his descent.



     BACK TO WEENA                                          246

     As the THIRD DISCORDANT BLAST joins the other two,
     Weena's fear is gone.  In its place is an expres-
     sion of utter resignation.  Like someone in a
     trance she opens her eyes and stares straight
     ahead.  Then, as though she is summoning all her
     strength to go through some ordeal, she starts
     walking away.  The CAMERA PANS and we see the breeze
     ripple her silken robe about her as she moves.

     (NOTE:  During the above and throughout the follow-
             ing sequence the dirge-like WHISTLES
             CONTINUE, ECHOING mournfully.)



     REVERSE SHOT                                           247

     Weena is walking forward and disappears behind the
     trees as the Time Traveller emerges from the well
     in the b.g.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                248

     Looking for Weena.  She is nowhere to be seen.
     His face shows exasperation, bewilderment.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Weena!  Where are you, Girl?



     WEENA - FULL SHOT                                      249

     She continues to walk toward the source of the
     SIRENS.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                           250

     The DIRGE-LIKE MELODY becomes LOUDER, pulsating,
     as he pauses to watch:



     EXT. EDGE OF FOREST - LONG SHOT - (DAY)                251

     Emerging from the forest are two Eloi, a man and
     a woman.  They are several paces apart and pay no
     attention to one another.  Both have exactly the
     same manner as Weena.  They walk along, eyes
     straight ahead, faces expressionless.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                252

     As he looks ahead, then left and right, searching.



     VARIOUS GROUPS OF ELOI - (SPLIT?)                      253-254

     In the open country now, the forest behind them.
     In their colorful robes, the Eloi march slowly
     across the green landscape.

     All are converging toward a single point somewhere
     ahead.



     WEENA AMONG ELOI                                       255

     They walk close together, paying no attention to one
     another, following the command of the MELANCHOLY
     STRAINS OF THE SIRENS.



     BACK ON TIME TRAVELLER                                 256

     His concern has turned to apprehension as he tries
     to grasp the meaning of what he observes.



     EXT. THE SIRENS ON THE SPHINX - FULL SHOT - (DAY)      257
     (MINIATURE)

     It is the source of the sound.  There are little
     bursts of vapor from the tops of the sirens as
     they repeat their tones, like a fantastic pipe
     organ behind the Sphinx.



     TIME TRAVELLER AND ELOI                                258

     All of them walk in the same direction.  The Time
     Traveller looks this way and that, bewildered.
     But the Eloi disregard him and march straight
     ahead, eyes forward.

     The Time Traveller breaks into a run.



     TWO SHOT                                               259

     The Time Traveller overtakes the Young Man, seizes
     his arm and jerks him to a halt.  Around them pass
     the shadows of the marching Eloi.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               What's happening?  Tell me!

     The Young Man shows no emotion as he struggles to
     free himself.  His movements are almost mechanical.
     This unnerves the Time Traveller.  He stares at
     him, releasing his grip.

     The moment the Young Man is free, he faces about
     and continues his march.  The Time Traveller re-
     mains motionless, watching him go.  The ECHOING
     SIRENS are now getting on his nerves.



     EXT. ENTRANCE TO THE GREAT BUILDING - LONG SHOT -      260
     (DAY)

     The Eloi pour out of the Great Hall, walking in
     a trance-like state.



     EXT. LANDSCAPE - EXTREME LONG SHOT - (DAY) - (SPLIT?)  261

     From all directions the Eloi in their bright robes
     are moving, singly and in long files.  The impres-
     sion is one of vastness -- a feeling that mankind
     is marching to some unknown doom.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                           262

     He spots a girl, rushes up, grabs her from behind.
     But it is not Weena.  Disappointed, he releases
     her, then goes on again, covering his ears with
     his palms, fighting to retain command of his own
     reason.



     SEVERAL SHOTS OF THE SIRENS - (MINIATURE)              263-265

     At various angles -- up, sideways, tilted.  The
     WAILING is DEAFENING.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                266

     He still strives to control himself, moves forward,
     then pauses in amazement, looking straight ahead.



     EXT. THE SPHINX - FULL SHOT - (DAY) - (MATTE)          267

     It is toward the white sphinx that the Eloi have
     been marching.  But now the panel, upon which the
     Time Traveller had pounded so hard, is wide open,
     revealing a dark entrance into the pedestal.

     And despite their previous repugnance to the
     Sphinx, all of the people are now marching across
     the lawn resolutely to it.



     AT THE PEDESTAL - LONG SHOT                            268

     The Young Man is the first to reach it.  He enters
     the wide opening and starts descending into sub-
     terranean darkness.  Others follow, Weena among
     them.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (o.s.)
               Weena!

     Without hearing him she passes through the entrance.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                           269

     He desperately pushes forward, elbowing his way
     past others in his haste to overtake Weena.  The
     crowd impedes his progress and he shoves the
     Eloi impatiently aside as he fights on.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (shouts in
                    despair)
               Weena!



     THE PANEL                                              270

     Slowly closing and the sound of the SIRENS gradually
     DIES AWAY.  The Time Traveller reaches the panel as
     it shuts tight before he can touch it.  He spreads
     his palms against it in despair, then turns to face
     those Eloi who, like him, are locked outside.  What
     he sees astonishes him.



     GROUP OF ELOI                                          271

     They no longer approach the sphinx.  The ceasing of
     the sirens seems to have released them from their
     hypnotic spell and now, awake again and frightened,
     they are retreating.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 272

     As he goes after them to the edge of the flagstones
     and calls out angrily.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Stop!



     BACK TO ELOI                                           273

     Featuring the Man in White in the f.g.  They halt
     and stare back.  The Time Traveller's voice comes
     over like a whip.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (o.s.)
               What are you running from?

     None of the Eloi answer.



     TOWARD THE SPHINX - FULL SHOT                          274

     Beyond several Eloi the Time Traveller stands in
     the shadow of the white sphinx.  He steps slowly
     forward onto the lawn, looking around the big
     semi-circle of his audience.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (sharply,
                    gesturing back toward the panel)
               Where have they gone?
                    (no answer)
               What happens to them?
                    (no answer)
               Don't stand there like a fatted
               cattle grazing contentedly in lush
               pastures. - Answer me!  What's
               wrong?

                         MAN IN WHITE (calmly)
               There is nothing wrong.  It is all
               clear.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               What do you mean, all clear?

                         MAN IN WHITE (repeating)
               All clear!

                         TIME TRAVELLER (thinking
                    rapidly, talking to himself)
               Once....in the middle nineteen
               hundreds I heard a man...
                    (it bursts upon him)
               The falling bombs!
                    (to the Man in white
                    and the crowd)
               That's over.  Gone.  Dead for
               hundreds of thousand of years.
               There are no more flying machines.
               No bombs.  No wars!

                         MAN IN WHITE
               Yes, the rings have told us that
               story.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MED SHOT                              275

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               But you didn't listen.  You didn't
               learn anything.  All that is left
               is fear...a blind animal fear.
               Ages ago men were taught to hide in
               the ground when the sirens blew...
               taught to run from a raining death...
               but those men are dead!  And so are
               the men who slaughtered them.  Don't
               you understand?
                    (looks around pleadingly)
               You are slaves of a dead past... You
               don't even own your souls.  You're
               led to slaughter like sheep!

                         MAN IN WHITE (o.s.)
               But there is nothing to fear now,
               it's all clear.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               What about those who went below?
               How are they to come back?



     MAN IN WHITE                                           276

     He looks ominously at the Time Traveller.

                         MAN IN WHITE
               They never come back.  Nobody can
               bring them back.

     Unimpressed, the crowd begins to disperse, the Man
     in White following them.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 277

     Calling after them.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               You can try.  Won't any of you
               even try?

     He sees that the situation is hopeless.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (almost
                    to himself)
               Well, someone has to try!

     He runs off.



     SERIES OF SHOTS                                        278

     The Time Traveller running through the forest.         (a)

     He is laboring up the open hillside.                   (b)

     The Eloi in a semi-circle silently watch.  A few       (c)
     of them hesitantly start after the Time Traveller.



     EXT. THE WELL - FULL SHOT - (DAY)                      279

     Arriving, the Time Traveller pauses to catch his
     breath, picks up a piece of wood that could serve
     as a torch, then jumps over the wall and starts
     to descend.

     Over this a faint THROBBING OF MACHINES can be
     heard.



     SHOOTING INTO SHAFT - HIGH ANGLE                       280

     The Time Traveller climbs down, gripping the walls
     with his hands and feet.  The depth beneath him is
     dizzying.  THROBBING LOUDER.



     IN THE WELL - FULL SHOT                                281

     As the Time Traveller descends, the CAMERA FOLLOWS
     him, step after step.  The deeper he goes, the darker
     it becomes and the THROBBING OF MACHINES INCREASES as
     well.

     Suddenly a rock gives beneath his weight.  He barely
     saves himself.  Not without fear he pauses to rest,
     glancing upward.



     FROM THE THROAT OF WELL - LOW ANGLE                    282

     A couple of the curious Eloi peer downward, watching
     the Time Traveller's progress.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 283

     A metal ladder affixed to the wall brings him finally
     to the opening of a transverse passageway.  In almost
     complete darkness he steps from the ladder into the
     tunnel and pauses to take the piece of wood from his
     belt, but decides not to light it.  He bends and peers
     ahead.



     INT. GREAT CAVERN - FULL SHOT                          283X1

     The Time Traveller emerges onto the bridge in the b.g.,
     pausing for a moment to survey the surroundings, then
     starts slowly down the staircase carved along the wall.
     The gloom is relieved only by puffing smoke and waver-
     ing lights, revealing occasionally vague shapes and
     grotesque shadows.

     (NOTE:  DRIPPING WATER from the walls and THROBBING OF
             MACHINES punctuate the desolation of this
             scene as well as the following sequence.)



     CLOSE ON T.T. - MOVING SHOT                            283X2

     Walking, he notices an opening ahead and cautiously
     moves toward:



     INT. ENTRANCE TO FEASTING ROOM - FULL SHOT             283X3

     At the threshold of this dark, silent cell the T.T.
     pauses, then slowly enters.  Behind him, across the
     cavern, an indistinct figure watches, but quickly
     disappears as the T.T. strikes a match.  The sight
     that the T.T. beholds fills him with revulsion and
     horror.



     THE FEASTING ROOM - T.T.'S P.O.V.                      283X4

     This is obviously a feasting place of the Morlocks.
     In the flickering light we see stone tables and
     scattered around the floor far below the unmistak-
     able remains of human bones after the flesh has been
     carnivorously picked away.

                         T.T.'S VOICE
               So, this was the destiny of the
               Eloi.



     CLOSE ON T.T.                                          283X5

     His features twisted in horror in the flickering
     light of his match.

                         T.T.'S VOICE
                    (continuing)
               They were being bred like cattle
               by the Morlocks who had degenerated
               into the lowest form of human
               life...cannibalism.

     The match dies between his fingers.  Suppressing a
     shudder, the T.T. turns and as he leaves this chamber
     of horror, the rock behind him comes to life.  A pale,
     spectral Morlock crosses the screen in the f.g.
     descending.  Another in the b.g. does likewise.



     MACHINES - FULL SHOT                                   283X6

     Morlocks, their indistinct bodies obscene in their
     mockery of the human form, labor endlessly tending
     the needs of their machinery.  They look up toward the
     intruder as they HEAR his APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS, then
     hide.



     STAIRWAY - MOVING SHOT                                 283X7

     The T.T. slowly descends the slender stone stairway
     that hugs the sheer wall.  Meanwhile at the base of
     the feasting room under the stairway on which the T.T.
     is moving a Morlock moves a curtain aside and reveals
     itself.  It silently watches as another Morlock
     appears at the top of the stairs and follows.

     GROUP OF ELOI                                          283X15

     Passing near the T.T.'s hiding place.  Weena and the
     Young Man are side by side.



     AT THE MACHINES                                        283X16

     The Morlocks who followed the T.T. are closing in.



     BACK TO T.T. - MOVING SHOT                             283X17

     He is unaware of the Morlocks behind him.  Hugging
     the rock, he makes his way to the closest possible
     point where he can still remain unobserved by the
     herding Morlocks and get Weena's attention.  He
     reaches out.

                         T.T.
               Weena!

     But she continues on with complete resignation to her
     fate.  Unmindful of his own safety, he leaves his hid-
     ing place and grasps her by the shoulders.

                         T.T.
                    (shaking her)
               Girl!
                    (he turns and grasps the
                    passing Young Man)
               Come to your senses!  All of you!

     As the T.T. pulls Weena toward the staircase, the
     Young Man follows.



     FOOT OF STAIRWAY                                       283X18

     Morlocks block the escape.



     THREE SHOT                                             283X19

     The CAMERA MOVES with the T.T., Weena and the Young
     Man as they are forced to retreat.



     AT ENTRANCE OF FEASTING ROOM                           283X20

     Where other Morlocks with CRACKING WHIPS herd the Eloi
     into the chamber of horrors.

     One of the Morlocks spots the T.T., Weena and the
     Young Man.  He swings his whip.



     BACK TO THREE SHOT                                     283X21

     The CAMERA MOVES with them as vicious CRACKING
     WHIPS drive them back to the entrance of the
     feasting room.



     TWO SHOT                                               283X22

     The T.T. tries to protect Weena.  Suddenly a long
     lash of a whip strikes like a serpent and coils
     about the T.T.'s neck.  He drops his unlit torch
     and whirls in pain.

     Another whip scares Weena into the chamber of
     horrors, while several other whips land on the T.T.'s
     shoulders.  Finally he grabs the whip from around
     his neck and jerks it, wrenching it free.



     AT THE ENTRANCE OF FEASTING ROOM                       283X23

     The T.T., wielding the whip fiercely, drives the
     Morlocks back several paces, then suddenly from
     above a pale body of a Morlock lands on him,
     knocking him down, causing him to drop the whip.
     On the ground the cowardly Morlock stumbles
     away leaving the T.T. a prey to the battery of
     CRACKING WHIPS.  He crawls in pain into the
     chamber of horrors.



     GROUPSHOT INSIDE FEASTING ROOM                         283X24

     The T.T. comes to his feet among the Eloi.  The
     WHIPS HAVE STOPPED, then the silence is broken by
     the GROWL of approaching MORLOCKS.  Through the
     curtains, dark shapes swarm toward them.  Then
     suddenly the T.T. pulls out his matchbox from his
     pocket.  A match flares!



     GROUP OF MORLOCKS                                      283X25

     In the glare of yellow light we see the leprous
     figures of blinded Morlocks, dropping their whips,
     shielding their eyes.



     THROUGH MORLOCKS'S EYES - (OPTICAL EFFECT)             283X26

     The T.T.'s hand with the burning match rapidly zooms
     into the center of the picture in a BLINDING FLASH
     turning the screen momentarily white, then yellow
     and red.  Then the CAMERA MOVES BACK indicating the
     Morlocks' retreat.  Slowly the normal colors
     reappear.



     BACK TO THE GROUP OF MORLOCKS                          283X27

     Regaining their sight in the darkness, they start
     to close in.



     THROUGH MORLOCKS'S EYES - (OPTICAL EFFECT)             283X28

     Followed by the Eloi the T.T. exits the feasting
     room and again lights a match.  A BLINDING FLASH
     starting from the flame as a center engulfs the screen,
     momentarily white again, then yellow, finally red.
     Once more the CAMERA RETREATS, then still seeing
     through the Morlocks' eyes the CAMERA ZOOMS CLOSE
     ON THE MATCH BOX and the scaley hand of a Morlock
     slaps all the matches except one to the floor.



     T.T. - MED. SHOT                                       283X29

     He lights his last match and moves forward, looking
     for his lost torch.



     GROUPSHOT                                              283X30

     The T.T. leads the Eloi toward the stairway, the
     light of the match his only weapon in keeping the
     Morlocks away.  Finally he spots his torch and
     picks it up hurriedly.



     CLOSE ON T.T.                                          283X31

     His face streams with sweat and is taut with appre-
     hension while he applies the dying match to the
     intended torch.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (muttering)
               Burn, will you!

     He holds the match steady, but it burns lower and
     lower without starting the wood.  In despair he
     turns to Weena.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Quick, something to burn!  It's
               my last match!



     BACK TO THE MORLOCKS                                   283X32

     As they are closing in.



     CLOSE ON WEENA                                         283X33

     With a fierce gesture she rips open the loose sleeve
     of her robe, tears off a piece of cloth and holds
     it out.



     BACK TO T.T.                                           283X34

     As match is about to die, he holds it beneath the
     cloth.  It flames up and he seizes it, dropping the
     dead match.

     He holds the burning cloth beneath the wood and
     in this hotter flame it begins to burn.  Once it
     starts he again attempts to make his way by blind-
     ing the Morlocks and leads the Eloi to the stairway.



     GROUPSHOT                                              283X35

     As the Eloi slowly make their way toward the stairway,
     one Morlock gains courage, and with his long whip
     strikes the torch out of the T.T.'s hand.



     A CORNER                                               283X36

     The torch rolls in and begins to sputter.



     BACK TO SCENE                                          283X37

     The Eloi huddle against the wall in terror as other
     Morlocks gain courage and move forward toward the
     T.T.  As they face one another, the fight begins.



     [PAGE 90 MISSING FROM HARD COPY]



     Eloi below him.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Weena!  Weena, get the torch!



     CLOSE SHOT - WEENA AND YOUNG MAN                       351X5

     Huddled against rock - React to fight - Weena
     looks quickly toward the Time Traveller, then
     turns searching for the flickering torch.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 351X6

     As he turns to fight with Morlock on ledge.
     Morlock swings at him.  He ducks and almost
     falls off ledge.  He grabs Morlock, and hangs
     on until he can scramble up on ledge again.
     He clutches at Morlock's throat, banging his
     head against the rock wall, finally throwing
     him off ledge.  At the same time another Mor-
     lock appears on ledge, while the Morlock he
     had previously kicked rises to menace him from
     the other side.  The Time Traveller jumps across
     cavern to ramp and starts down toward the floor,
     trying to get back to his torch, his only weapon
     against the Morlocks.



     CLOSE SHOT - THE TIME TRAVELLER                        351X7

     He pauses momentarily against Rock Wall.  He
     sees Eloi, still huddled in a group, apparently
     too confused to move.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Weena!  Go on!  Go on the
               steps!



     CLOSE SHOT - AT ROCK - WEENA AND YOUNG MAN             351X8

     Weena spots the still flickering torch and
     starts toward it.



     INSERT OF TORCH                                        351X9

     Lying on ground, still burning, Weena bends
     down to pick up torch, when suddenly a Morlock
     appears facing her.  She screams and jumps back,
     watching in terror, as the Morlock comes toward
     her.



     MED. SHOT                                              351X10

     The Time Traveller comes down ramp to meet several
     Morlocks converging on him.  He tries to fight his
     way past them.



     CLOSE SHOT - WEENA AND YOUNG MAN                       351X11

     Morlock rushes in, grabs Weena and carrying her
     over his shoulder starts across toward Feasting
     Cave.



     MED. SHOT - TIME TRAVELLER                             351X12

     JUMPS up on ramp, kicks back at Morlocks - sees
     Morlock carrying Weena - JUMPS through Morlocks
     and runs toward her.



     FULL SHOT                                              351X13

     The Time Traveller runs to Weena, pulls her away
     from Morlock, knocks him against rock.  In the
     meantime another Morlock runs up on rock and
     jumps at Time Traveller, knocking him down.
     The second Morlock rebounds from rock and leaps
     on the Time Traveller and starts to choke him.



     CLOSE SHOT - TIME TRAVELLER                            351X14

     Looks up toward YOUNG MAN - silently appeals for
     help.



     CLOSE SHOT - YOUNG MAN                                 351X15

     Stancing in front of group of Eloi returns the
     Time Traveller's silent plea for help.  Slowly
     raises his right hand, stares at it as he
     gradually clenches it into a fist.  Then, making
     up his mind, raises both hands and strikes Mor-
     lock hard on the back of his neck.



     MED. SHOT                                              351X16

     As Morlock relaxes his grip the Time Traveller
     kicks him back to rock, scrambles up and runs
     to get his torch.  Several Morlocks try to herd
     Eloi back into Feasting Cave, but led by the
     Young Man and his newly discovered strength, the
     Eloi resist them.  The Time Traveller runs back
     in with torch, and herd the Eloi toward stairs.



     FULL SHOT                                              351X17

     The Time Traveller urges the Eloi up the stairs
     pushing Weena ahead of him.  They climb up past
     Cauldron.  Morlocks come in after fleeing Eloi,
     shielding their eyes from the light of the Time
     Traveller's torch.



     CLOSER SHOT                                            351X18

     The Time Traveller looks ahead to be sure the
     Eloi are all on their way out.  Then turns back
     and drops his torch into the oil flowing into
     the Cauldron.



     FULL SHOT                                              351X19

     The burning torch catches the Cauldron on
     fire, which quickly spreads across the floor
     of the Cavern, to the steaming Machine on
     the right, which explodes.  The Time Traveller
     herds Eloi out across Stone Bridge.



     MED. SHOT                                              351X20

     Pursuing Morlock runs up steps in back of
     burning Cauldron hiding his face from the
     flames.  He bumps into the Pipe coming down
     the wall, loses his balance and falls into
     the burning Cauldron - Flames shoot higher.



     PAN SHOT                                               351X21

     Another Morlock comes from behind machine, as
     fire creeps across floor, almost reaches machine
     at same time as fire - and it explodes.  Morlock
     catches fire and runs across into Feasting Cave.



     PASSAGEWAY - LONG SHOT                                 352

     Smoke is thick as the Time Traveller and Weena
     run toward a circle of light on the floor far
     ahead.



     CIRCLE OF LIGHT - HIGH ANGLE                           353

     Weena and the Time Traveller reach the light
     that comes straight down from above, and look
     up the shaft.  Smoke belches from the passage-
     way as he helps her start up the ladder and
     then he, himself, follows, clambering out of
     sight.



     IN THE WELL                                            354

     The CAMERA FOLLOWS Weena and the Time Traveller
     climbing up, COUGHING from smoke.  The light
     becomes slowly brighter and he looks up.



     FROM THROAT OF WELL - LOW ANGLE                        355

     Gradually the top of the well becomes visible
     through the swirling smoke.  The Young Man is
     peering down.  He reaches to help Weena and the
     Time Traveller.



     SHOOTING INTO SHAFT - HIGH ANGLE                       356

     Weena and the Time Traveller are both dark with
     soot, near exhaustion.  Far below them red flames
     pierce through the smoke.  They each in turn grasp
     the helping hand of the Young Man and climb up out
     of the well.



     EXT. THE WELL - MED. SHOT - (SUNSET)                   357

     As their eyes meet, the Time Traveller grips the
     Young Man's shoulder and gives it a brief shake
     of approval.

     The Time Traveller then grabs up branches and twigs,
     carries them to the mouth of the well, ignites the
     pile of kindling with his torch and drops the burn-
     ing wood down in to the well.



     SHOOTING INTO SHAFT - HIGH ANGLE                       358

     The burning wood drops to the bottom where it ignites
     the oil with a burst of flame that shoots up the well.



     BACK TO SCENE                                          359

     The Time Traveller picks up his jacket and points to
     the other wells.  The Young Man first, then the rest of
     the Eloi grasp the idea.  They also light branches
     from the torch and dash for the various wells to
     duplicate the Time Traveller's action.



     VARIOUS SHOTS OF ELOI                                  360-362

     Carrying bundles of burning wood to the mouths of
     wells and dumping the fire below.



     TWO SHOT                                               363

     With Weena at his side, the Time Traveller gazes on
     with approval at the Eloi's work.



     EXT. LANDSCAPE - FULL SHOT - (SUNSET)                  364

     It is dotted with wells, each of which has been
     turned into a fiery furnace shooting flames and
     smoke up from the burning oil below, preventing
     the Morlocks from any avenue of escape to the
     surface of the Earth.



     A WELL - (MINIATURE)                                   365

     It falls with a CRASH to the ground and begins to
     spew smoke and flame into the undergrowth of the
     forest nearby.



     EXT. ENTRANCE TO GREAT BUILDING - LONG SHOT -          366
     (SUNSET)

     Smoke drifts out of its windows.  The Eloi hurry
     out, led by the Man in White.  They stop and stare
     at the sight of the Morlock world being destroyed
     below.



     EXT. THE BLAZING FOREST - (SUNSET) - (STOCK)           367-368

     The sun on the horizon is a dim red ball through
     the smoke.  Several trees fall over, blazing.  LOW
     UNDERGROUND RUMBLING is heard.



     WEENA AND THE TIME TRAVELLER                           369

     They start down the hill after the Eloi, seeking
     safety together.  Suddenly a DISTANT RUMBLE OF THE
     EARTH makes them pause and look o.s.



     EXT. LANDSCAPE - FULL SHOT - (DUSK) - (MINIATURE)      370

     Then comes a SERIES OF TREMBLORS, each more powerful
     than the one before.  The earth shudders and the
     blazing forest begins to collapse.  It does
     not explode into the air.  Rather, the solid
     earth seems to give way so that the entire
     surface of the ground begins to fall into the
     subterranean chambers.



     ANOTHER ANGLE - (MINIATURE)                            371

     A section of the earth sheers away and falls
     in an ever widening rift.



     A WELL - (MINIATURE)                                   372

     As it is swallowed by the earth, followed by a
     belch of steam.



     BACK TO LANDSCAPE - (MINIATURE)                        373

     Leveled off by the earthquake.  There are no more
     flowers, no more buildings, wells, smokestacks or
     obelisks.  There is no movement -- only the
     flickering of low flames and the smoke driven by
     the gentle breeze.



     GROUP OF ELOI                                          374

     Staring into the vast destruction.



     TIME TRAVELLER AND WEENA                               375

     He holds her hand.  The CAMERA MOVES IN SLOWLY and
     we begin to hear the

                      TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
                 (calmly)
             The underworld of the Morlocks was
             gone...and so was the life of leisure
             for the Eloi.

     He looks o.s.



     GROUP OF ELOI                                          376

     The Man in White, with others, approaches the group
     headed by the Young Man.  The two men look at each
     other, their gestures and expressions showing their
     joy at release from centuries of fear.

                      TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
             From now on they would have to work
             to survive.  And looking at their
             faces, I somehow knew that they could
             start over again.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER AND WEENA                       377

     He looks down to Weena and we HEAR:

                      TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
             Another night was coming, but this
             night no Eloi needed to fear.

     The CAMERA MOVES CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER who looks
     up in concern.

                      TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
             But what of me? - I was imprisoned
             in a world in which I did not belong.

                                  DISSOLVE TO:



     EXT. THE POOL - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT)                    378

     This is the same pool where the Time Traveller
     saved Weena's life.  The peaceful SOUND of the
     RUSHING STREAM is occasionally interrupted by a
     REMOTE RUMBLE of EXPLOSION from the earth below.

     There is no sign in the sky of old constellations,
     only the face of the full moon looks familiar.
     The Time Traveller, wearing his velvet jacket,
     relaxes on the white sand, playing with the
     blossom Weena gave him earlier that day, and
     WHISTLING "The Land Of The Leal".

     Weena sits on a large rock nearby at the edge of
     the pool, washing the soot from her face and hands.
     She glances over to the Time Traveller.

                      WEENA
             Are you sorry?

     He STOPS WHISTLING, but the MUSIC CONTINUES.
     He turns.

                      TIME TRAVELLER
             Sorry? - Sorry for what?

                      WEENA
             That you have to stay.

                      TIME TRAVELLER
                 (gazing into the night)
             Yes. - I am sorry because I could
             tell so much to the people of my
             own time... I could tell them about
             the happiness and sorrow the future
             has in store for them.  They could
             learn from it...or would they?

                      WEENA
             You don't want to stay, do you?

                      TIME TRAVELLER
             It isn't that, but I don't fit here
             anymore than you would in my time.

                      WEENA
                 (a pause, and then)
             I would like to see your time.

                      TIME TRAVELLER
             No, Girl, you wouldn't be very
             happy there.

                      WEENA
             Do you have someone like me -
             there?

                      TIME TRAVELLER
             No.  No one like you.  But there
             are friends who will miss me. - As
             a matter of fact, I'm probably late
             already.

                      WEENA
                 (stealing a glance,
                 then quietly)
             Women?

                      TIME TRAVELLER
             No, men.
                 (teasing)
             There is a woman too, of course!
                 (noticing her disappointment,
                 he relents)
             She looks after my house for me.
             She is sixty-two years old. - Much
             older than you are.

     Weena, relieved, starts to comb her wet hair
     into a new arrangement.

                      WEENA
                 (suddenly)
             How do they wear their hair?

                      TIME TRAVELLER
             Who?

                      WEENA
             The women in your time.

                      TIME TRAVELLER
                 (after a thought)
             Up!

                      WEENA
             Up? - How?

                      TIME TRAVELLER
                 (with awkward gesture)
             Like this.

                      WEENA
             Show me.

     The Time Traveller puts the flower back into his
     pocket, gets up and walks over to Weena.



     WEENA - MED. SHOT                                      379

     The Time Traveller appears behind her.  He first
     hesitates, then gently lifts her hair into a fair
     imitation of the upswept Edwardian style.  She
     smiles, then with an impulsive move turns her face
     toward him.

                      WEENA
                 (innocently)
             Would I be pretty?

     The gesture brings her eyes and lips close to his.
     He still holds her upswung hair and, as he gazes
     into her young eyes, he feels her warm breath on
     his cheek.

                      TIME TRAVELLER
                 (slowly)
             Yes...you would be.  More than
             pretty.
                 (his voice sinks to a whisper)
             I wish we could go back together,
             Weena, back to my own time...or to
             times before that when the world
             was young.  We could...

     EXCITED VOICES o.s. interrupt this interlude.  They
     both look in the direction of the voices.



     EXT. HILL - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT) - (MATTE)              380

     A group of Eloi, led by the Young Man and the Man
     in White, approach them, talking excitedly,
     pointing to the ruins of the white sphinx just
     revealed by the rolling smoke.  The face is
     broken and the pedestal partly in shambles.  The
     panel is open.



     TIME TRAVELLER & WEENA                                 381

     Joyfully he grabs her hand and, pulling her,
     breaks into a run.



     GROUP OF ELOI                                          382

     The Young Man steps forward, pointing o.s.  The
     Time Traveller and Weena run through the haze,
     then the Eloi follow them.



     EXT. THE WHITE SPHINX - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT) -          383
     (MATTE)

     The face is broken in half.  It is left with only
     a half a smile and thin smoke drifts through the
     remaining eye.  The rest of the statue and the
     sirens are on the ground beside the partial ruins
     of the pedestal.  Beyond it the hill is gone and
     gray haze covers the once green world.  The Time
     Traveller and Weena come through the charred
     bushes onto the lawn.  Here they stop.



     THE OPEN PANEL - THEIR P.O.V.                          384

     The Time Machine sits in the midst of the swirling
     smoke.  The flames, licking at the inside walls,
     have not yet reached the Machine.



     TIME TRAVELLER & WEENA - MED. SHOT                     385

     He releases her hand to reach into his jacket pocket
     and bring forth the lever without which the Machine
     will not function.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (without
                    looking at her)
               Come, Girl!

     He walk, toward the panel.  Weena follow,
     hesitantly, but the long habit compels her to
     halt before the threshold.  Unmindful of this,
     the Time Traveller enters.



     INT. PEDESTAL - LONG SHOT                              386

     Shooting from inside the pedestal, the Time
     Traveller and his Machine are black silhouettes
     in the foreground, while beyond him Weena stands
     on the lawn outside, the moonlight flooding her
     radiant features.

     Inside, black smoke still rises and whirls around
     as the Time Traveller examines his Machine and
     starts to fit the lever into place.



     REVERSE ANGLE                                          387

     The Time Traveller working eagerly.  A shadow
     starts sliding across his figure, moving more
     swiftly until darkness falls and the panel closes
     with a CLANG.



     OUTSIDE THE PANELS                                     388

     Weena, seeing the panels close, runs up to them
     and POUNDS her fists vainly on the metal doors.



     INSIDE THE SPHINX - MOVING SHOT                        389

     The Time Traveller leaps to the panels and struggles
     to open them.  From without he hears Weena's
     POUNDING and CRIES.  Suddenly he senses a living
     presence within the sphinx.  For a moment there is
     silence.  Then from the right comes a hacking,
     weak COUGH.  Another from the left.  Then some-
     thing STUMBLES OFF, down the stairway.  He whirls
     around, GASPING and COUGHING, to see three of the
     enmaddened Morlocks rising before him.  Avoiding
     them, he stumbles to his Machine and gets into
     the saddle.  The suffocating smoke blinds him as
     he gropes for the lever.  Morlocks seize his legs and
     try to wrest him off the Machine.  The fire and
     smoke become dense, half obliterating the struggling
     bodies.



     INSERT:  THE CONTROL PANNEL                            390

     The Time Traveller's hand gropes for the lever and
     finally grasps it.



     OMITTED                                                391-403



     INSERT OF DIALS                                        404

     Spinning backwards.  Suddenly, a gloomy shade falls
     over the instruments, followed by a burst of
     whirling smoke and the twinkling red light of fire.
     There is a flash of sunshine, then finally total
     darkness.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                             405

     Passing back in time through his captivity beneath
     the lava.  He reels in the saddle, then coming
     from darkness a red glow quickly engulfs the scene.
     As the red hot lava leaps away from him and the
     daylight returns, we can see that his face is
     covered with perspiration.  He looks off to see:



     SERIES OF SHOTS - (ANIMATION, MINIATURE, SPLIT)        406

     (NOTE:  These shots seen previously are now printed
             backward.)

             The red hot lava withdraws through the         (a,b,c)
             street ruins and the great rents in the
             ground gulp it up quickly.  Out of the
             ruins building are molded and then
             atomic explosions in reverse flash
             across the screen.  The SOUND OF
             EXPLOSIONS, RUMBLING ETC.  IN REVERSE
             AND SPEEDED UP join the HUMMING of the
             Time Machine.

                                               BLUR TO:

             The sun and the moon chase each other          (d,e)
             alternately across the sky, gradually
             slowing.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 407

     INTERCUT his reaction to the previous scenes until
     he straightens and readjusts the lever.  The
     HUMMING DECREASES, then walls rise about him.
     Watching the dials, he carefully moves the lever.
     The flickers of the days and nights decelerate
     and, with a sudden pull, he halts the Time Machine.
     The HUMMING ABRUPTLY CEASES.



     INSERT:  DIAL                                          408

     It stops on:  "5 January 1900".



     INT. LABORATORY - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT)                  409

     The Time Machine has returned, but it is resting
     in the far corner of the room instead of in the
     spot where we originally saw it.

     In the gloom, the Time Traveller clambers pain-
     fully from the Machine.  Then, FOLLOWED BY CAMERA,
     he staggers to the workbench and sinks onto it.
     His eyes explore the room and finally come to rest
     on the clock.  It is "8:04".

                                        SLOW DISSOLVE TO:



     PENDULUM CLOCK - CLOSE SHOT                            410

     Now showing "9:22".  For a long while only its
     MONOTONOUS TICKING is heard. - A welcome change
     from the cacophony of time traveling.

     The CAMERA MOVES slowly to reveal the DINING ROOM
     where the five men, their meal finished, are
     sitting silently around the table.  Mrs. Watchett
     is quietly serving the liqueur.  The Time Traveller
     is puffing on his pipe.  Kemp is chewing on his
     cigar and Hillyer's face is red with indignation.

                         DR. HILLYER
               It is ridiculous!  Simply preposterous!

     Filby is bent over his coffee playing absorbedly
     with the spoon which CLINKS loudly in the room's
     silence.  Bridewell, of course, takes a big gulp
     from his brandy.

                         BRIDEWELL
               Well, there's one thing I'll say
               for you, George.  You always could
               tell a good story.  Best adventure
               yarn I've heard for years.
                    (loudly)
               You're a truly fine inventor,
               George!

     He alone starts to laugh at his 'joke', but a
     hiccup quickly puts a period to that.  Mrs. Watchett
     steps to the Time Traveller to pour him a bit of
     brandy.

                         MRS. WATCHETT
               I'll turn down your bed for you!

     As she exits Kemp looks up.

                         KEMP
               Truthfully, where have you been
               for the past week?

     Bridewell examines the remaining brandy in his glass.

                         BRIDEWELL
                    (voice of experience)
               Now, we shouldn't ask such questions,
               Walter.  It's not hard for a man to
               lose a week now and then.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (smiling)
               I understand your doubt.  Take it
               as a lie if you wish.  Now that
               I'm back I scarcely believe it
               myself.
                    (a flash of memory)
               Except that...
                    (groping in pocket)
               ...here are the flowers Weena gave
               me.

     He places the blossoms on the table before Filby.
     They are actually less than a day old and fairly
     fresh.



     FILBY AND THE BLOSSOMS - CLOSE SHOT                    411

     As he picks them up to examine.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (o.s.)
               A present for you, David.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                             412

                         TIME TRAVELLER (to Filby)
               You were always interested in
               botany. - Try to match them with
               any species known today.



     BACK TO FILBY                                          413

     As he looks up, puzzled.

                         FILBY
               I don't think I can.



     GROUP SHOT                                             414

     A still unimpressed Hillyer slams his hands on
     the table, stands up, looks around and then down
     to Kemp.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Are you coming, Kemp.

     Rising hesitantly, Kemp turns to the Time Traveller.

                         KEMP
               It's getting late and you look
               exhausted.  You had better get
               some rest.

     Everyone gets up, Bridewell with difficulty, and
     starts to leave.



     COTTAGE - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT) - (MATTE)                415

     The snow falls softly, big flakes wobbling down
     from the sky.  The front door opens letting out
     the four guests wearing hats, capes and overcoats.
     They walk toward a waiting carriage, Kemp helping
     the staggering Bridewell.  Filby is the last to
     leave.  He pauses at the step of the carriage
     looking back to the Time Traveller who stands
     motionless in the doorway.

                         FILBY
               Goodnight, George.



     AT THE ENTRANCE                                        416

     The Time Traveller lifts his hand and waves.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Thank you, David, for being such
               a good friend - always.

     With this he turns and goes into the house, closing
     the door slowly.



     AT THE CARRIAGE                                        417

     Those inside are waiting for Filby to get in,
     but he, deep in thought, still stands gazing back.
     Kemp thrusts his head from the window.

                         KEMP
               What do you think, Filby?

                         FILBY (after a pause)
               One thing is certain.  Those
               flowers couldn't have possibly
               bloomed in the winter-time.

                         HILLYER (in the b.g.)
               You don't really think that story
               was true?

     Filby reaches a decision.

                         FILBY
               Look, you chaps go on.  It's
               just a short walk home for me.

                         HILLYER (o.s.)
               Go on, driver!

     The WHIP CRACKS.



     THE DRIVEWAY                                           418

     As the carriage rolls off leaving Filby standing
     in the falling snow.  He waits until the carriage
     disappears, then retraces his steps to the front
     door and raps on it.  He pauses a moment, then
     uses the heavy knocker.  There is still no answer.
     He steps back and looks off toward the:



     EXT. LABORATORY WING - FILBY'S P.O.V.                  419

     No light shines through its windows.



     BACK TO FILBY                                          420

     He raps once more, and getting no reply tries the
     door.  It is unlocked.  He steps into the house.



     INT. LIBRARY - FULL SHOT                               421

     The coals still glow in the grate as Filby enters
     the fully lit room, looking for his friend.
     Suddenly a clock from the neighboring room CHIMES
     ONCE.  Filby turns, goes toward it and stops at
     the doorway.



     DINING ROOM - FILBY'S P.O.V.                           422

     The table is cleared, candles extinguished.  The
     pendulum clock is TICKING lazily.  The time is
     "9:30".



     FILBY - PANSHOT                                        423

     He calls into the darkness.

                         FILBY
               George!...

     No answer.  Then an odd HUMMING sound brings
     him to stiff attention.  The SOUND INCREASES in
     VOLUME and PITCH until the entire house seems
     to tremble.  Then a violent gust of wind blows
     open the door that leads to the laboratory.

     Filby pivots and runs up the steps, through the
     corridor.



     AT THE DOOR OF LABORATORY - FULL SHOT                  424

     Filby, dishevelled and out of breath, arrives
     and tries the door -- it is locked.  The NOISE
     is almost DEAFENING.  He puts his shoulder to
     the door and finally bursts it open.  At the
     very instant he does so, the SOUND CEASES abruptly.
     He stops short, gazing aghast.



     THE LABORATORY - FILBY'S P.O.V.                        425

     The Time Traveller with his Machine FADING,
     leaving the present.

     Then the CAMERA MOVES ACROSS the workbench to the
     corner where we last saw the Time Machine.  It is
     not there!  The CAMERA WHIPS to the other corner.
     Nor is it there!  A few sheets of paper whirl
     desolately in the center of the floor.



     CLOSE ON FILBY                                         426

     He looks tense, ignoring the APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS
     behind him.  Mrs. Watchett hurries in.

                         MRS. WATCHETT (nervous,
                    breathless)
               Oh, Mr. Filby...what...
                    (her eyes widen)

                         FILBY (with finality)
               He's gone!

     The CAMERA FOLLOWS Mrs. Watchett as she slowly
     approaches the center of the room.  Here, with
     squinting eyes, she leans down to observe the
     floor.

                         MRS. WATCHETT (to
                    Filby)
               There's something funny here, sir!

     Filby steps aside her to investigate.



     WHAT THEY SEE                                          427

     The CAMERA MOVES ALONG parallel grooves resembling
     the ones the Time Machine left in the lawn at the
     front of the sphinx.  They are scratched deep in
     the floor leading from the spot where the Machine
     was last seen to the other corner of the laboratory
     where it originally stood.  Here, not only its
     imprint, but also the color and finish of the
     floor is preserved.



     TWO SHOT                                               428

     They straighten.  Mrs. Watchett looks at Filby,
     puzzled.

                         FILBY
               I think I understand. - Look!



     LABORATORY - FULL SHOT                                 429

     Mrs. Watchett listens as Filby moves to the imprint
     in the floor where the Machine first stood and
     explains.

                         FILEY (pointing)
               See the imprint?  This is where
               the Time Machine originally
               stood.
                    (he paces across to the
                    end of the grooves)
               But the Morlocks moved it.
               They dragged it across the lawn
               right into the sphinx...right
               here.
                    (turns and points)
               And Weena was standing there when
               he last saw her...the same space -
               in a different time. - So he moved
               back his heavy Machine from here,
               across the room, scratching this
               floor...
                    (indicating the grooves
                    that lead to the imprint)
               So that he can appear outside the
               sphinx again and help the Eloi
               build a new world...and build a
               new world of his own.

                         MRS. WATCHETT (faintly,
                    sentimentally)
               Where he left her!..

     Filby doesn't answer.  He looks about the labora-
     tory for the last time, then takes Mrs. Watchett's
     arm and leads her from the room.  The MUSIC STARTS
     THE THEME:  "The Land Of The Leal".



     INT. LIBRARY - FULL SHOT                               430

     Filby and Mrs. Watchett come into the room.

                         FILBY
               But it isn't like George. - To
               return empty handed.  To try to
               rebuild a civilization without
               a plan.
                    (to Mrs. Watchett)
               He must have taken something
               with him.

                         MRS. WATCHETT
               Nothing.

     She looks around and discovers three empty spaces
     on the tightly packed book shelves.  She walks to
     them.

                         MRS. WATCHETT
               Nothing except three books.

                         FILBY
               Which three books?

                         MRS. WATCHETT
               I don't know. -- Is it important?

                         FILBY (smiles)
               No, I suppose not. - Only...what
               three books would you have taken?

     She looks at him, pondering the question as they
     leave the library.



     INT. ENTRANCE HALL                                     431

     They stop at the door and Mrs. Watchett stands
     beside Filby as he opens it.  Outside the snow
     is falling softly.

                         MRS. WATCHETT
               Mr. Filby, do you think he will
               ever return?

                         FILBY (quietly)
               One cannot choose but wonder. -
               You see...he has all the time in
               the world!

     With these words, Filby turns up his collar, pulls
     the brim of his hat over his eyes and walks into
     the night.  Mrs. Watchett looks after him.  She
     hears the SOUND of his DIMINISHING FOOTSTEPS
     SQUEAKING in the virgin snow.  Slowly she closes
     the door.



     EXT. COTTAGE - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT) - (MATTE)           432

     Drifting like a curtain, the snow falls quietly
     as Filby, a solitary figure in the night, pauses
     a moment to look up at the sky, then selects a
     path and starts walking the long way home.

                                            SLOW FADE OUT.



                          THE END

              EXT. JUNGLE VILLAGE - CONTINUOUS

              A relatively modern village... for a remote jungle. Dawn is
              JUST barely beginning to break. The morning mist persists as
              we see FOUR FEDERALES with machine guns surrounding a group
              of VILLAGERS.

              O
               N GROUND - A WOMAN VILLAGER is thrown down. Her SON, 8, runs

          1
              to her side. She's mad. Her son cries.

          

                                                                          2.

          

          

          

                                  WOMAN VILLAGER
                        You monsters!
              UP ANGLE - As we see the THREE FEDERALES, greasy men, holding
              AK-47's, and looking down with hardened indifference. OS, we
              hear an EVIL CHUCKLE. The men part as we see-
              - COL. PANTERA. A bottom-heavy disgusting pig of a man walks
              up between them. Pantera leans down, face to face with her.

                                  PANTERA
                        We appreciate the generous donation
                        for the continued protection of
                        your village.
              ANGLE ON - Their jeep, overflowing with the Village's
              precious crops.
              WIDER - A tiny group (10) of other villagers stand at a safe
              distance. The Woman's HUSBAND runs forward. He immediately
              LUNGES at Pantera, just as-
              -SHIKA-SHIKA - Pantera is flanked by 3 MACHINE GUNS pointed
              at the Husband's chest. Pantera slothfully grins. He leans
              forward and yanks an HEIRLOOM NECKLACE from her neck.

                                  PANTERA
                        After all, the jungle can be a very
                        dangerous place. BAH-HAHAHAHA.
              They jump into the Jeep and tear into the jungle LAUGHING.

          

          

              EXT. JUNGLE ROAD - MOMENTS LATER


          4                                                                    4
              The jeep clamors down the bumpy makeshift path. Pantera sits
              in the passenger seat as the others are crammed in around the
              food. The Jungle looms ominous around them.

              H
               IGH ANGLE - As we watch the jeep from the jungle ceiling
              high above... as if from someone's POV.
              ON DRIVER - He suddenly reacts to a fallen tree on the road
              ahead. Slams on the brakes. Pantera is thrown around.

                                  PANTERA
                        Idiota! Watch where you're going!

                                  DRIVER SOLIDER
                        There's a log on the road, senor.
                            (quietly to himself)
                        ...that wasn't there an hour ago.

                                   PANTERA
                        Well, what are you waiting for?!

                        REMOVE IT!

          CORTEZ leaps out. Grabs the winch from the front of the jeep
          and pulls it to the log, roughly 15 feet away.
           EEP POV - Pantera and Driver barely notice the out-of-focus
          bg Cortez get suddenly YANKED out of scene!

                               CORTEZ (O.S.)
                    ...yirk!
          ON DRIVER - His eyes go wide. Trying to see in the dark.

                              DRIVER SOLIDER
                        (softly, nervous)
                    D-d-dios mio.
          ON LOG - Cortez is gone. Pantera wakes up.

                              PANTERA
                    What?! WHAT IS IT?!
          OS - Hear the sound of a CHAIN clinking. Then WHOOSHING as
          the chain winch suddenly FLIES IN, and CRACKS the BURLY
          SOLDIER across the jaw! It wraps itself around his neck.
          Before he can react...
          - YOINK! He gets pulled over the hood of the jeep, landing on
          the ground HARD.

                                URLY SOLDIER

                    OOF!
          Burly gets pulled backward... away from the Jeep and into...
          the darkness. He SCREAMS the entire way, clawing the ground.
          ON JEEP - Driver is freaking out now. Last Soldier is in the
          back. Pantera stands up in the jeep. "Last" jumps out and
          readies his machine gun.

                              PANTERA
                        (to Jungle)

                           (
                         shaking/nervous)
                    The jungle god that punishes those
                    who prey upon the weak.
                        (looks scared to Pantera)
                    He's coming... for us.

              OS NOISE - Suddenly hear the whooshing of 4 quick punches,
              kicks, a short machine gun burst and a WHUMP. Pantera and
              Driver look to the ground.
              ON GROUND - Last Soldier lays beaten on the jungle floor.

                                  DRIVER SOLIDER
                        I'm sorry, senor.
              Driver bounds out of the Jeep and runs SCREAMING into the
              jungle. CAM PULLS BACK with him as Pantera shrinks in bg.

                                  PANTERA

                        COWARD!! GET BACK HERE!!
              Something suddenly skitters behind Pantera! He turns to look.
              Nothing. He reaches down and pulls up... a MACHETE.

                                  PANTERA

                        SHOW YOURSELF! DO YOU REALIZE WHO

                        YOU'RE DEALING WITH?!
              ON PANTERA - He circles backs against the Jungle wall, trying
              to find him. Tense. Suddenly-
              -a PAIR OF WHITE EYES open in the blackness behind him!
               n a quick series of shots we see Pantera getting the raw end
              of a flurry of fist and foot attacks. His attacker is moving
              way too fast for the camera to keep up.
              Pantera falls back, panting heavily. Panicked. He tears off
              into the dense Jungle!
              ON PANTERA RUNNING THROUGH JUNGLE - Thick foliage. Panicked.

              An oasis of calm, violated by this sweating, machete-
              clutching brute. He stumbles, then stands in the middle.

                                    ANTERA
                        I am not afraid of a myth!

                        Actually... it's "Turtle", pal.
              Pantera swings around. Eyes wide.
               N ATTACKER - We pan up the thick green legs. Muscular and
              strong. Further up. Arms to match. Rough skin. It wears a
              shorn HOODED PONCHO. Inside are two white eyes and gritted
              smiling teeth.
              The poncho falls to the ground.

          

                                                                       5.

          

          

          
              ON ATTACKER - It's LEONARDO! Beaten blue bandana blowing in
              the breeze. Total hero shot. He pulls out a SINGLE KATANA
              SWORD, poised for battle. Pantera's backed into a corner.

                                  PANTERA
                        Let's see if a ghost can die, then.
              Pantera SCREAMS and runs to Leo and starts swinging! At the

              The Boy is still at the Village Clearing. Suddenly -
              - the sound of the JEEP begins to rumble in the distance! The
              villagers panic and scatter. VROOM! The Jeep flies out of the
              jungle and bounce-slows into the FG!
              Only there is no one driving it... and it still has the
              stolen food in it. And the stolen medallion dangles from the
              rear view mirror.

                                  WOMAN VILLAGER
                        It's a miracle!
              The village rejoices. The Boy steps aside for a beat, looks
              back at the Jungle. Something catches his eye.
              ...a small crouched figure on a tree branch. Barely
              silhouetted. His white eyes lit in the darkness. One of them
              WINKS as the boy smiles.

              Leo leaps into frame. He takes out his katanas and lays them
              carefully on the ground. He KNEELS, head bowed, eyes closed.

              The camera lifts away from Leo... and then PLUNGES into the
              nearby CAVERN. MUSIC begins to swell. Cam travels a few feet

              The music is in full tilt as the camera travels through

              EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - NIGHT                             9

              A mouse-level shot of the spectacular city that never sleeps.
              It's oddly hypnotic. Still. Until...
              - BAM! A pair of sneakers land barely in front of the camera,
              tearing off into the distance.

                                  NYPD #1 (O.S.)

                        FREEEZE! STOP OR WE'LL SHOOT!
              Shoes belong to a panicked MUGGER, early 20's, as THREE NYPD
              OFFICERS clamor after him. The Mugger is a jackrabbit -
              hopping newspaper machines, rolling under passing trucks and
              doing anything he can to avoid arrest.
               ventually the NYPD peter out. The mugger looks back. Smiles.

                                  MUGGER
                        Heh, heh... suckers.
              ON MUGGER - His eyes suddenly go wide as - VROOOOOM! - we see
              a jet-black tweaked out motorcycle fly over the cops' heads,
              aiming directly for Mugger!

                                   MUGGER
                        Whaaa!!!
              The Mugger runs, but can't escape. The Driver is dressed in
              all-black motorcycle leathers and black-visored helmet. Scary
              and faceless. He quickly gains on the Mugger and GRABS him by
              the collar in mid-stride!

                                  MUGGER
                        You crazy?! Put me down, man!
              But Driver doesn't. Instead, he holds him lower without
              stopping the bike... and proceeds to plow Mugger's head into
              every trash can and garbage bin along 9th Avenue!

                                  MUGGER

                        OW! HEY! WHAT'RE YOU-OW!! OOF!
              Just as it looks like he'll hit a telephone pole... Driver
              veers left! He drags the Mugger into...

               EXT. DEAD END ALLEYWAY - CONTINUOUS

               Driver tosses him onto the ground at full speed. Mugger
               SLIDES down the alley and collides with a pile of garbage
               like he's a human bowling ball.
               ON HEAD OF ALLEY - The Driver guns the bike and kicks up a
               ton of dust and racket, peeling donuts at mouth of the alley.
               And then he stops. Dust slowly settles and smoke dissipates.

                                   MUGGER
                         Wh-wh-what kinda freak are you?!
               The Driver gets off the bike. Silence. Backlit by headlight.
               He walks directly to the Mugger with purpose. Mugger starts
               to really freak out. Driver picks him up by the collar and
               SLAMS him to the back WOODEN FENCE WALL.

                                   MUGGER
                         P-p-please. Don't kill me, man.
               Driver just cocks his head. Mugger can see his own terrified
               reflection his Driver's black visor. Driver reaches behind
               his back and pulls out a COMBAT KNIFE! He reels back and...

                                   MUGGER
                         Wh-wha-wha-WHAT ARE YOU DOI- AAAGH!

               W
                HAM! - Driver nails the dagger through the Mugger's JACKET,
               PINNING HIM TO THE WALL. Driver turns around to gather the
               purse's belongings at the mouth of the alley.
                fter he stops cringing, the Mugger wriggles the blade out of
               the wall. Driver doesn't notice as - THWIP-IP-IP! - he hurls
               the knife at the Driver!
               THUNK! It sticks in the DRIVER'S BACK!
                N MUGGER - His grinning eyes suddenly GO WIDE as Driver
               slowly turns around, UNHURT! The Mugger is trapped as Driver
               moves toward him... and a BOLO CHAIN drops to his side.
               ON WALL SHADOW - as we see a flurry of punches, kicks and
               throws as Driver lays a beating on the criminal who needs to
               be taught a lesson. An OS Police Siren chirps.
               MOUTH OF ALLEY - The police suddenly show up, cherries
               flashing. They run to FG, mouths drop.

               of the bike as Driver (Nightwatcher) roars in to a stop.
               Nightwatcher drives underneath a TRAIN BRIDGE. He takes off
               his helmet. Red cloth spills out. He turns around as we see-

               - RAPHAEL, THE RED-MASKED NINJA TURTLE!
               He reaches back and pulls out the KNIFE from his SHELL. Looks
               at it, shaking his head and grinning. He sheathes it.

               INT. UPTOWN APARTMENT - AFTERNOON

               The cam pulls out of a LARGE MASCOT HEAD - looks like a big
               goofy Turtle head with googly eyes and dumb smile. WIDER we
               see a fake ZIPPER spirit-glued onto Mikey's plastron. In his
               hands, he holds two nerf-styled NUNCHUCKS.

                                   MICHAELANGELO
                             (from inside mascot head)
                         Okay - waita-WHOA-WHOA-WHOA-WHOA!!
               Suddenly TEN KIDS WITH BIRTHDAY HATS AND FOAM NUNCHUCKS run
               in SCREAMING and start beating on Mikey... a little too hard.

                                   SCREAMING KIDS
                         Get him! Yeah! You suck! Hey!
                         Awright! Take that, Turtle-dork!

                         HEY! NOT BELOW THE-OOOFF!! OW!!
               End WIDER with the kids all walking away from Mikey, now on
               the floor doubled over from the "playing". A beat, then-
               -one more kid runs back and kicks Mikey.

                                   LITTLE GIRL

               Beautiful downtown autumnal street. Parked in front, we see
               the "COWABUNGA CARL" PARTY VAN loudly decorated in kid-
               friendly colors with an embarrassing and low-tech looking
               TURTLE HEAD ON TOP. PUSH IN on upstairs apartment window.

                         Thanks so much. You're worth every
                         penny. I have to tell all my
                         friends about you. You'll love
                         their kids too.

               Mascot Mikey is standing at the door, holding a fistful of
               cash, still in full costume.

                                   MICHAELANGELO
                         I can only hope they're as lovely
                         as the rugrats you got here.
               ON KIDS - They look tough, brandishing their nerf weapons - a
               toddler street gang. One of the kids does a finger-point-then-
               throat-slit gesture. The mom looks and beams. The kids
               quickly smile to cover.

                                   MICHAELANGELO
                             (through gritted teeth)
                         Such... angels.
               Mikey looks to the side, and sees the still piled-high stack
               of PIZZA BOXES through the fake head POV.

                                   SOCCER MOM
                         Okay! Everyone say good-bye to

               ON DOOR - As the door closes and Mom turns back, a green hand
               reaches in quickly a grabs a box of pizza. The door closes.

               Mikey opens the van's rear doors. He PULLS OFF the fake
               zipper on his chest and then pulls off his fake turtle head.
               His trademark orange bandana spills out.
               He turns, breathing in the fresh surface air. A quiet beat
               until - A POLICE SIREN approaches, faint, in the distance.
               Mikey jumps in the van, slams the door shut as the car
               whizzes by.
               WIDER - the van takes off down the street.

               EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREETS - LATER

               CLOSE ON - a regular motorist sitting in his car at a traffic
               light. Don monitors from a small dashboard cam. Man looks OS
               Left. Reacts.
               OFF HIS LOOK - We see Mikey beside him in the van. He's
               behind the wheel - face FROZEN in a goofy SMILE like a
               ventriloquist to "hide" his identity. Don follows on a small
               surveillance cam under the rearview mirror.

                                   MICHAELANGELO
                         Yes... sir.

                         That's a good boy.

                                   MICHAELANGELO
                         All's I'm saying Donnie is that no
                         one would notice if YOU did one of
                         these gigs every now and again.

                                    DONATELLO (O.S.)
                         But you add such... panache to the
                         character.
               Mikey, emotional, pops into "fully animated" facial mode. He
               rubs his sore neck.

                                   MICHAELANGELO
                         Well, if panache is French for
                         "punching bag", I'd have to agree
                         with ya.

               A darkened room lit only by the lights of dozens of tv's,
               monitors and TV tubes. Cables run everywhere. In front of
               them is DONATELLO - our resident tech-head turtle.

               ON CAR - The Man is still looking - only now really freaked
               out - at the fully animated Mikey head.

                                    MICHAELANGELO
                         Aw nuts.
               Mikey suddenly grips his face back into a tight SMILE,
               frozen. He looks over and waves at the man who confusingly
               waves back.

                                   MICHAELANGELO
                             (ventriloquist style)

               ON DON - He hits some switches. Monitors change.

                         Traffic's clear eastbound for two
                         blocks. Then hook up with route J.
               BACK WITH MIKEY - He's still waving with a frozen smile.

                             (ventriloquist style)
                         Righteous.
               Mikey immediately "unfreezes" and sticks his tongue out and
               antics at the Man! Before the man can react, Mikey TEARS OUT
               and zips across traffic down a deserted side-street.
               ...as we notice the annoying ice cream style music tinkering

                                    M

               The van parks in a long-forgotten alleyway. A dummy gate
               closes behind it, obscuring it from view.

               The dripping concrete and metal maze explodes with the
               cacophony of Mikey riding his skateboard, backpack in tow.

               But this isn't just any half-pipe - it tests all of Mikey's
               skills in ninjitsu, extreme sports and cross-training. He
               jumps on and off the board to occasionally tackle obstacles
               with all four limbs. A fun rock n' roll sequence.
               Feels like Mikey is miles away from the surface world when he
               arrives at a seemingly DEAD END. He smiles as he reveals a
               BRICK DUMMY WALL that brings him to...

               Mikey lands in the "foyer" of sorts. Atop entrance stairs. He
               kicks the double doors open.

                                   MICHAELANGELO
                         Honeeeeey! I'm hooome!
               As Mikey slides down the banister, the cam dollies around

               I
               behind him revealing the LAIR. Breathtaking to fresh eyes.
                t has a wonderful lived-in feel - they're not squatters...
               they've made this their HOME. Furniture is jury-rigged and
               the place is custom lit to provide the right kind of
               atmosphere. If we looked behind the surface detail, we'd see
               a mesh of wires and circuitry powering the entire lair.
               Donatello runs up to Mikey. Mikey robotically hands him the
               wad of money from the party.

               As Donnie walks away, Mikey LOUDLY CLEARS HIS THROAT. Don
               stops as Mikey holds out his hand. Don's busted - he peels
               off a few bills and hands Mikey his share.

                         Domo arigato, dude.
               Mikey walks into the room and plops down on a sofa. Hits a
               remote as a BIG SCREEN lights up in front of him. Suddenly-

                                   SPLINTER (O.S.)

               ANGLE ON - SPLINTER the Japanese rodent master and father of
               the TMNT. He is well-kempt, still walks with a cane, and has
               the same sparkle in his eye. He approaches Mikey. Silent.

                         Sensei?
                             (thinks, then realizes)
                         Oh! Here ya go, Master Splinter.
               Mikey reaches into his bag and removes a foil-wrapped piece
               of BIRTHDAY CAKE. Splinter lights up.

                                   SPLINTER
                         Ahh! Butter creme frosting!
               Donatello walks to Splinter. Holds his hand out, judgmental.

                                   DONATELLO
                         Master. No cake. You remember your
                         last cholesterol tests.

                                   SPLINTER
                         But I-
                             (changes attitude)
                         -Donatello! I am your Master!

                                   DONATELLO
                         Nice try, sensei. But you can still
                         be my Master... with low
                         cholesterol.
               Splinter surrenders the cake. As Don walks away,
               Michaelangelo reaches into his bag and secretly passes
               Splinter a smaller wrapped piece.

                                   SPLINTER
                         He-heh. You have done well, my son.
               Donatello walks to the fridge and opens it - FILLED with
               dozens of other pieces of Birthday Cake leftovers. He tosses
               it with the rest.                                  C

               The street noise below is barely audible. Camera creeps along
               the edge of the building, reaching a row of GARGOYLES.
                AN ALONG GARGOYLES - Still. Concrete. Creepy. Just as we
               pass the fourth, we barely notice it's WHITE EYES OPENING.
               QUICK SNAP BACK TO GARGOYLE - Only now it's gone. Something
               strange is coming to town...

               EXT. NEW JERSEY HARBOR - SUNSET

               Large freighters. Lots of activity. PUSH IN on a steamer as a
               crane lowers a LARGE VERTICAL CRATE to the dock - it THUMPS
               down hard.

                                   APRIL (O.S.)
                         Careful! That isn't some box full
                         of fish!
               CAM LOWERS - as APRIL O'NEIL leaps down into frame. Dressed
               in jungle expedition gear with her head wrapped in a bandana.
               She takes off her sunglasses and admires the crate.
               ON BOX - Labelled "O'Neil Cargo". Something ominous about the
               crate. PUSH IN on it as April steps in front. Admires it with
               pride. Turns, takes out a cell phone, and hits speed dial.
               ON PHONE DISPLAY - "Calling HOME". It rings.

               A spacious NYC loft - tons of bookcases work as room
               dividers. Piled with artifacts, unopened crates of all sizes,
               boxes of maps, and a general organized mess. A hockey game
               BLARES from a TV set.
               CAM PANS ACROSS ROOM - The telephone continues to ring just
               as we reach the KITCHEN - with piles of dirty dishes and fast
               food. And then a path of strewn clothes that gets messier and
               messier until we reach -
               - CASEY JONES, snoring on a sofa. He finally wakes up,
               clamors for the phone, tripping over mess in the process.

                         Talk to me.

                                   APRIL
                         Hey. It's me. I'm back.
               Casey rubs his face, tries to orient himself. Looks at watch.

                                   CASEY
                         Was that today, babe?
               April's disappointed. Same old Casey.

                         Yes. It was today that I returned
                         to you after being in a deadly
                         jungle for almost a month.

                         I thought you were going to meet me

                                   CASEY
                         I'm sorry, babe. I must've-

                                   APRIL
                         Forget it. I'll take a cab.
               A long pause on the phone. Casey knows he's busted.

                                   CASEY
                         I missed you?
               April doesn't answer. She closes the phone. Casey slumps in
               his chair, shaking his head.

                                   CASEY
                         Good goin', Case.
               Back at the dock, April is back to business.

                                   APRIL
                         Howie! Get this on the truck for
                         delivery! Let's go!
               P.O.V. INSIDE BOX - See April through the wood slats. We'd
               swear we almost hear... LOW GROWLING.

               Mikey is on his bed. His thumbs pound away at a video game on
               TV - bored. He puts down the controller and yells to the
               ceiling.

                                   MICHAELANGELO

                         I'M! BORED!!!!!
               He stands up and walks to DON'S ROOM. He opens it. It takes
               only one foot until the door is pushed up against piles of
               TECH JUNK. Mikey uses his shoulder and pushes it open.
                N DON - He's hunched over a work table, back to Mikey.
               Tinkering as always. Wild inventions line the walls, some
               finished, some not. Some pay tribute to past TMNT adventures.

                                   MICHAELANGELO
                         Don, y'ever feel like you were

                              MICHAELANGELO(cont'd)
                    like we never really left that
                    glass turtle bowl when we were
                    little dudes.
          REVERSE ANGLE - Don lifts his head up, eyes MAGNIFIED in some
          bizarre head contraption. He flips up side panels,
          ELECTRONICA MUSIC blares out.

                               ONATELLO
                    Oh, hi Mikey. You say something?

                              MICHAELANGELO
                        (sighs - to himself)
                    Every day it's the same thing. Wake
                    up. Birthday party gig. Drive home.
                    Watch TV. Train... Rinse. Repeat.

                              DONATELLO
                    I know. Isn't it great?
          A beat. Mikey sighs, then walks back downstairs to the LIVING
          ROOM SOFA. He and the camera think he's alone, but before he
          knows it, Splinter is sitting next to him, cross legged,
          still, and sipping tea.

                              MICHAELANGELO

                    WAH!!

                              SPLINTER
                    Michaelangelo. Boredom is never an
                    indicator of your surroundings. It
                    is a reflection of your inner
                    heart. Fill yourself with
                    excitement on the inside... and
                    you'll live the most rewarding life
                    of all.
          Mikey stares at Splinter, dead pan. A beat. Then returns to
          flipping channels. He stops on a NEWS program - "NYC DIRT".

                              NYC DIRT REPORTER (O.S.)
                    And so yet again, police officials
                    are baffled at a crime of
                    retribution that can only be
                    attributed to the mysterious figure
          M         known as "The Nightwatcher".
           ikey lights up. On TV is a flashy well-coifed, know-nothing
          REPORTER. Beside him is a news photo of the tied up MUGGER
          from our second scene.

                    This is the latest in a string of
                    vigilante acts that have been

                    Although the victims have been
                    criminals themselves, the
                    Nightwatcher's actions have been
                    identified as destructive and
                    overly-violent... verging on the
                    edge of lethal.
          ON MIKEY - Can't smile wide enough. He runs to his room,
          returns with a POLAROID CAMERA. He snaps a picture of the TV.
          He pulls it out, placing it in his NIGHTWATCHER SCRAPBOOK,
          overflowing with paper clippings and articles on the
          vigilante.

                    Now THAT'S what I'm talking about!
                    Cruising the streets, busting those
                    who hold themselves above the law.

                    But they aren't above HIS.
          Don walks in, holding an in-process invention. He looks up.

                    Mikey, the man's practically a
                    criminal himself. Anyone who
                    operates without boundary or rule
                    of law cannot be legislated and
                    needs to be reigned in.

          ON DOOR - Raphael walks in, his Nightwatcher costume no where
          in sight.

                    Ah, Raphael. Your brothers and I
                    were just discussing the vigilante
                    Nightwatcher once again.

                    Where have you been? You've been
                    spending so much time away from
                    home lately...
          Raphael's on edge from the mention of Nightwatcher already.
          His attention doesn't break from Donatello.

          Splinter watches the growing tension with concern.

                    I have no problem with the

                    Nightwatcher has ultimate power...
                    then who makes sure he doesn't
                    cross the line?
          Mikey picks up two NINJA BLADE RINGS, twirling them around
          aggressively in mock battle.

                    Sometimes there are lines that even
                    the police can't cross. Someone has
                    to be willing to do what needs to
                    be done. And to do that, fear
                    becomes a weapon.

                              DONATELLO
                    You are such a Neanderthal.
          Raphael does the bully FAKE LUNGE at Don. Don reacts quick
          and startled, eyes wide.

                        (SCOLDING)
                    Raphael! If bullying is the only
                    way to argue your point, then
                    perhaps you do not have much of a
                    point to begin with.

                    Yes, sensei.
                        (to Mikey)
                    And quit touchin' my stuff.
          Raph yanks the Ring Blades out of Mikey's hands and storms
          out of the room by flipping up a series of cables to the
          second floor.

          

                                                                          20.

                         That was just a startle response
                         and isn't really an indication of
                         fear!
               Raph does the "blah blah" hand gesture from above. Enters his
               room, slams the door and immediately BLASTS MUSIC...
               ...and it's some annoying pop HIP-HOP song.

               Then HEAVY ROCK starts playing to drown out his family. A

               Tense in the room for a bit. Don looks at the other two.

               A large JET LINER flies into the city. Lowering. The wheels
               fold out under the carriages.
               CLOSER - LEO is on the landing gear, his face lit up by the
               city glow in front of him. He jumps off as - FOOMP! - a HANG-
               GLIDER opens up from his backpack. He lowers the glider to

               Disgusting. Dripping. Out of the slime, Leo rises. A beat...
               inhales, then SMILES WIDE.

                                   LEONARDO

               All is peaceful in the lair. The big screen TV is the only
               light source. Mikey snores and drools on the couch, covered
               in junk food wrappers. Donnie sleeps with an "TECH HEAD"
               magazine over his face... gadget-in-process in his lap.
               ON ENTRANCE - Leo walks in and places his bag on the floor.
               The place feels different... but still feels like home.

               Leo peers in cautiously. Splinter is still awake. Expecting
               him. Kneeling on the floor. Very serious.

                                    SPLINTER
                         Enter.
               Leo walks in and kneels in front of Splinter.

                                   LEONARDO
                         I have completed my training,
                         master. I am prepared for the next
                         stage.

                                   SPLINTER
                         That you are, my son. You must now
                         apply all that you have learned on
                         your lengthy journey to your
                         everyday life. THAT will be the
                         most challenging training of all...
                plinter reaches out and hands Leonardo an ANCIENT MEDALLION.
               Leo is touched.
               CLOSE ON SHADOWS OUTSIDE OF ROOM - We see a pair of EYES,
               watching the entire scene... jealous.

                                   SPLINTER
                         I've missed you, Leonardo.

                eo hugs Splinter.

                                   LEONARDO
                         I've missed you too, father.

                                   SPLINTER
                         I'm afraid much has changed in your
                         brothers' spirits since you have
                         left. But now that you are home,
                         they will finally have the ethical
                         and warrior leadership they have
                         been lacking. The family needs you.
               ON LEO - He swallows that big pill very hard.

                                   LEONARDO
                         Heh. Yeah... I mean, yes sensei.

          ON OUTSIDE OF ROOM - Raphael walks out of the shadows. He's
          good... but not too good for Splinter. Splinter and Leo break
          and face the doorway. An awkward silence.

                                  LEONARDO
                       Hey.

                       Well, I'm goin' to bed.
          He leaves.

          of the head, and keeps on walking.

               It was all a nightmare. We go WIDER as we take in the
               ostentatious bedroom of MAXIMILIAN WINTERS, a young mid-40's.
               Famous NYC entrepreneur.
                inters is large, handsome, built and powerful in every
               sense. His bedroom reflects it as well - large simple shapes,
               decorated with a modern-day tribal/tech appeal. This guy is
               filled with adrenaline, power and machismo.

               Rock/hip-hop music crashes in as we see Winters' morning
               workout - a combination of weaponry work (martial arts and
               others), floor routines and bag work. He takes it all very
               seriously.
               Sequence ends with him smashing the top off of a Mook Jung
               training block with his bare fist. He walks out of the room,

               He slowly LOWERS OUT OF FRAME. CAM PULLS OUT WIDER REVEALING -
                 Winters Office is an "elevator" of sorts that can ride up
               and down the front of the building, allowing him access to
               any floor of his Tower without leaving his desk.
               WIDER - see the Tower is a monolith in the middle of
               Manhattan - complete with it's own front Central Park-ish
               gated entry. A true work of modern architecture.

               We see the wonder of everything Winters - mixing of old
               artifacts with modern day aesthetic and implementation. The
               ceilings are vast and there is no mistaking the worth of the
               man and his company.

               Leo walks along the upper floor of their lair. As he passes
               Mikey's room, his brother pops out with his skateboard. We
               follow them as they walk down to the TV area.

                         Say, what's up with April and
                         Casey? I expected them to drop by
                         after I got back.

                         We don't see much of `em anymore.
                         April seems to be working a lot -
                         eww - and Casey seems to be, I
                         dunno, "different" lately. Maybe he
                         doesn't like having to put the
                         toilet seat down now that they've
                         moved in together.

                         They're living together now?
               They get to the living room area. Mikey walks to the edge of
               a jury-rigged HALF-PIPE he built in an old water slough.
               Mikey continues as he skates back and forth.

                         buzzkills to be around.

          hand to Casey, who doesn't know what she wants. He awkwardly
          HIGH FIVES her.

                              CASEY
                    Yeah-ha! The fourth General.

                    The crow-bar.

                              CASEY
                    Oh.
          He hands it to April as she twirls up a CROW-BAR and cracks
          open the front panel.
          INSIDE BOX POV - The light gradually breaks in, until - CREAK
          - the front panel falls to the floor.
          CLOSE ON - Winters' look. Pure wonder and admiration. He
          walks up to it slowly. April and Casey cautiously stay back.

          ON BOX - We finally see the statue - GENERAL AGUILA - a seven-
          foot towering wall of granite and obsidian. Eagle warrior
          armor reflecting a South American design... though not from a
          specific time period. Winters rubs his hand over the stone.

                         I've been so grateful for the
                         opportunities you've given me
                         lately. I'd probably be still
                         selling antique curios if you
                         hadn't visited my shop that day.
                              (off of box)
                         But I have to ask... why the
                         fascination with these particular
                         works of art? I'd never even heard
                         of the Legend of Yaotl until we
                         met.

               EXT. FLASHBACK BATTLEFIELD - 3000 YEARS AGO

               -the armor becomes the back of a HELMET. Camera dollies
               around the helmet until we're looking at a dark and imposing
               figure. YAOTL. His helmet is impenetrable, with eye slits.
               Note - the flashback is dark, shadowed and monochromed.
               Detail is hinted at instead of shown. Very stylized.

                         It was a time long before the
                         Mayans, April. Long before the
                         Aztecs and even the Olmecs. It was
                         a time of legends. A time of
                         greatness. The true mother culture
                         of Central America.
               Cool shots of Yaotl. His armor, his stance, etc.

                         There was a man named Yaotl. More a
                         force of nature than man. And
                         together with his Four Warrior-
                         Priest Generals, they pillaged
                         every culture in their path.
               QUICK SHOTS OF EACH GENERAL. The walk along side Yoatl.
               Possibly slo-mo. We will come to recognize them through their
               distinct armor as the Four Stone Generals - in human form.

                         And for every culture they
                         destroyed, they drank in all the
                         magic and knowledge known to them.

                              WINTERS(cont'd)
                    They became a warring hurricane,
                    gathering more power and knowledge
                    with each conquest.
          GROUP SHOT - Of five Warriors. High atop a hillside, finally
          stopped. Ready for battle. Their character-specific weapons
          are drawn. Around them is a small army of MINIONS.

                                WINTERS (V.O.)
                    Then they came across a culture
                    rich with science, magic and their
                    own technology. A South American
                    version of "Atlantis".

                          BEAT)
                    It was like blood in the water for
                    a predator like Yaotl.
          CLOSE ON - Yaotl. As he raises his sword in the air. CAM
          DOLLIES AROUND HIS HEAD REVEALING their opposing forces. An
          army of THOUSANDS. Waving their weapons in the air.
          The opposing army CHARGES. Yaotl's men pull out   a large
          ORNAMENTAL STAND - a "stargate" of sorts. Yaotl   and his men
          are unmoving... as they begin a ceremony. Yaotl   looks to the
          heavens above - as we see a CLUSTER OF SPECIFIC   STARS move
          into place.

                              WINTERS (V.O.)
                    As the army approached, Yaotl used
                    the knowledge they'd gained in
                    black magic and sorcery. Timing
                    their attack with the alignment of
                    the Stars of Kikin, they opened a
                    portal to another world.
          ON CHARGING ARMY - they stop dead in their tracks. Front-lit
          by the OS portal. Don't know what to expect -
          ON PORTAL - A crackling electric circle opens to another
          dimension. Suddenly - DOZENS OF MONSTERS EXPLODE OUT!
          Creatures of all varieties. Gnashing Fangs. Swiping claws.

                              WINTERS (V.O.)
                    They unleashed an army of monsters.
           N BATTLEFIELD - men getting slaughtered (in a nice PG sort
          of way). Quick shots. Intense.

                              WINTERS (V.O.)
                    The monsters knew no side   - they
                    destroyed the enemy... as   well as
                    Yaotl's own army. Men who   swore to
                    spill their blood for his   cause.
                    Yaotl had to do something   to stop
                    more from coming through.

                         In the end, there were no victors.
                         And they were responsible for the
                         eradication of the greatest culture
                         that will never be known. The

                         know exactly what we are to do for
                         you.

                         I need the finely-tuned eyes and
                         stealth of your Foot Ninja to...
                         monitor the city for me over the
                         next few days.
               Winters walks to his window. It's night. Overlooks the city.

                                   WINTERS
                         Just keep your eyes peeled for
                         anything... strange.

                         What kind of strange things?
               The question hangs as we PUSH IN ON Statue's face... his
               eerie eyes. We think his eye GLOWS, only we-

               The glowing eye is really a STAR. The same line pattern we
               saw at movie's open. The stars ADJUST... lining up in a more
               straight-lined manner.

               A MAN walks down the sidewalk. As he passes a DARKENED
               ALLEYWAY, he hears a low GROWL come from it. He stops.
               ALLEY POV - As the man looks in. Can't see a thing. Hand-held
               cam. He moves to leave... and the growl comes again.
               STREET - Man stares in. No one on the street. Looks closer...
               closer... grows more tense as...

                         Gave me a scare kitty.

               cat, as Man walks off into the distance. Until...

               onto the cat, yanking it back into the alley! Quick
               caterwaul. Silence. And then we hear a BURP.

               Leo feverishly works out. He stops, looking up, panting.

                         Does ANYBODY train anymore?!

                         Um... make that another hour.
               Leo sighs. Splinter walks by, not stopping.

                                   SPLINTER
                         A true leader knows how to motivate
                         his troops regardless of their own
                         motivations.
               Splinter walks past a large FUSE BOX. Leo thinks a beat. Then
               smiles.

               INT. DARK CHAMBER - NIGHT

               Another place that isn't the TMNT lair. Dark and mysterious.
               Don't know where we are. Feels ceremonial. We see close up
               detail of statue GRANITE.
               A DEEP VOICE chants OS in a South American tongue as HIGH-
               TECH GEAR is placed on the rock. It becomes powered,
               triggering a reaction in the stone itself.
               Music builds as we see quick shots of the granite cracks
               GLOWING RED. Camera travels with the rising glow.
               End on a pair of DEAD EYES - suddenly come to life. Red glow.

               The boys stand high atop the city below. Readying to run a

          Don is grinning. Observing the subtle tension.

                    Just trust me on this one.
          Music builds to a fun number as the two teams run parallel on
          buildings. The course requires them to work as a TEAM,
          throwing, catching and propelling one another from obstacle
          to obstacle.
          Leo accidentally slips, PLOWING Raph face-first into a brick
          wall. Raph, convinced Leo did it on purpose, uses his next
          opportunity to hurl Leo dangerously high and far over a
          billboard. The situation escalates at each juncture.

                              LEONARDO
                    Have you been avoiding me? Barely
                    seen you since I got home.

                    I see. So... you're definitely not
                    upset at me or anything, right?

                              RAPHAEL
                    Why'd you think that?

                              LEONARDO
                    I don't know... your brother gets
                    to go on a world-wide training
                    mission and you have to stay home.
                    Might upset me too.

                              RAPHAEL
                    Are you trying to make me mad?

                              LEONARDO
                    I'm just saying, I'd understand if
                    you were upset.
          Their intensity ESCALATES.

                              RAPHAEL
                    You wouldn't understand the first
                    thing about me, daddy's boy - OOF!.
           hey both trip over a duct, tumbling in a ball. They stop
          rolling, continue fighting.

                              LEONARDO
                    Is that what this is about? You
                    think Splinter likes me best?

                              RAPHAEL
                    You'd love that, wouldn't you?

                ikey and Don high five. Leo and Raph aren't amused. They
               stare down. Raph does his BULLY FLINCH fake-lunge... only Leo
               doesn't twitch. Suddenly-

               OFF HIS LOOK - We see LARGE SHADOWS moving with in a large I-

                         We need to come up with a plan.

                         Later!
               Raph RUNS OFF toward the action.

                         RAPH!!!
               But Raph doesn't stop. All three look at each other. Then-

               The boys cross over on a large CONSTRUCTION CRANE and scale
               up the few more stories to the top. They stand on a scaffold
               underneath the floor of the activity.
               ON WALL - Deep CLAW MARKS are carved into the steel, much
               like by April and Casey's loft. Don notices.

          They scale to the top floor. Peering over the edge.

                    scenario for ya.

                              MICHAELANGELO
                    Good news is that there are a
                    buncha Foot Ninja gettin' the snot
                    kicked out of `em.
          CAM FINISHES ON FLOOR - Showing SIX FOOT NINJAS and KARAI
          squaring off against a LARGE BIGFOOT-LIKE MONSTER! It tosses
          them around like stuffed animals.

                    out of `em...
          ON TURTLES - As they've all now crept up to the dark corner
          of the floor. A FOOT NINJA gets clobbered and sails past
          them, and off the building. (safely to a scaffold below)

                               D

                               ONATELLO
                    An interesting conundrum. Do we
                    hold dear the value of life and
                    help the Foot regardless of our
                    tumultuous past?

                              MICHAELANGELO
                    I vote for sitting back and
                    enjoying the show.
                        (to Leo)
                    Whaddaya say, leader boy?
          ON LEO - He's troubled. The burden of "leader" shouldered.

                              RAPHAEL
                    Nah. We kick butt.
          Raph jumps forward! Leo rolls his eyes, as all the Turtles
          jump into the fray. The Foot are surprised at first, and the
          Bigfoot Monster is confused as well.
          ON LEO - He stops when he comes face to face with Karai.

                               EONARDO
                    Who are YOU?!
          ON KARAI - She pauses a moment. They exchange expert katana
          attacks. Stalemate. She gestures to the Foot as they use this
          opportunity for their escape. As they leap away, Karai looks
          back at the Turtles...

          

          R

          

          

          

          

                                                                     40.

          

          

          
          The Creature immediately CHASES the boys throughout the
          structure, as they use all their ninja skills to avoid it,
          not to mention impalement on the bed of rebar below!
           aph tries to turn the tables and attacks the Creature! The
          boys have no choice but to help him... putting them in deeper
          trouble.
          The I-Beam is getting dented and twisted with each impact.
          The tussle begins to fall - whoomp, whoomp - down many
          flights of floors.
          Raph gets separated at one point, jumping off the side of the
          building to catch up, and swings himself back onto the bottom
          floor to await the others.
          SMASH! They fall into Raph's floor.

                              RAPHAEL
                    Nice of ya's ta join me.
          But the Turtles eventually get cornered. And just as the
          Creature closes in-

                              MICHAELANGELO

                    YEEEAAAAARGGHHH!!!!!
          The creature stops. Confused. So are the other three turtles.

                              MICHAELANGELO
                    What? I saw it on a nature show
                    once.
          The creature SCREAMS BACK! Boys freak out.

                              TURTLES

                    AAAAAAGGHHHHH!!!!!

          A
           NGLE ABOVE TURTLES - As a large teetering pallet filled with
          dried cement and blocks to come CRASHING DOWN ON THEM! The
          Turtles are buried under the rubble.
          RUH? - The Creature is confused... until it's hit with a
          blinding light, and then an EXPLOSION - FWOOM! We hear heavy
          footsteps thumping through the light. Shapes start to form
          until we see...
          ...LIVING VERSIONS OF THE FOUR STONE GENERALS! Sporting HIGH
          TECH GEAR - a mix of tech with ancient magic scrawlings.
          Their bodies "glow" with a red inner life, seeping through
          their stone cracks and piercing eyes.
          The Generals are all ANIMAL-THEMED - Mute and powerful Ape-
          themed costume ("MONO"), Eagle Leader ("AGUILA"), agile
          Jaguar ("GATO") and the deadly snake-like female
          ("SERPIENTE"). Large. Imposing. Completely bad-ass.
          The Creature ROARS and FIGHTS to no avail...

          

                                                                         41.

          

          

          
               BURIED POV - Silent. The Turtles start to GROAN, regaining
               consciousness. Moonlight shoots in as they move the rock and
               stand up, groggy.
               ON MOUTH OF ALLEY - Through the smoke we can see silhouettes -
               a large hairy shape, along with FOUR VERY LARGE SHAPES. The
               sounds of freighter doors CLOSING, engines revving and then a
               caravan of sorts pulling away.
               WHOOOOOP! - A POLICE SIREN chirps. Approaching the now-
               destroyed site.

                                   DONATELLO
                         Better hit the tunnels, guys.
               Donnie uses a small prod to prop open a MANHOLE COVER. Don,
               Mike and Leo jump in. Leo looks back, Raph is still stewing.

                                    LEONARDO
                         Raph. Save it for another day.

                             (BEAT)

                         RAPH!
               Raph knows he has to go. Reluctantly he enters the sewer. The
               lid closes as the alley is illuminated by POLICE CHERRIES.

               A
                 beat, then Mikey barely pops the lid open for another peek.

                                   MICHAELANGELO (O.S.)
                         Y'know, it's not that bad, dudes.
               ON BUILDING - Actually, the place is destroyed. Dented, torn
               and looking like a post-night raid in WWII.

                                                                 CUT TO:

          

          

               EXT. WINTERS TOWER - NIGHT

               UP ANGLE on the Tower. Dead of night. No one around.

          

          

               INT. WINTERS TOWER SECRET CELL BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS


          50                                                               50
               A cavernous structure. Dimly lit. High ceiling. A few odd
               silhouettes here and there.
               We hear the clicking of Winters' shoes echo as he enters.

                                   WINTERS
                         What seems to be the problem?
               Karai and six Ninja are already there.

                                   KARAI
                         The "problem" is that we were hired
                         to merely patrol the city and
                         report anything "strange" to you.

                                   (MORE)

                                                                    42.
                              KARAI(cont'd)
                        (grabs sword hilt)
                    You never said anything about

                    MONSTERS.
          Winters smirks, looking at the mouse who thinks he can take
          the lion. He reaches to a satchel on the floor. The Foot
          TENSE in anticipation. Instead... Winters comes up with a

          MONEY BRICK.

                               INTERS
                        (tosses money brick)
                    So, your job duties were just
                    redefined. Congratulations on your
                    promotion.
          SHINK! - Karai pulls out her To and slices the brick in mid-
          air. Winters STOPS and looks back over his shoulder.

                              KARAI
                    We may be hired help to you, but
                    you should never forget... we are
                    the Foot Clan.
          ON WINTERS - Condescendingly finds this particularly `cute'.

                              WINTERS
                    Oooooooh...
          It sets the Foot off. They all grab their weapons, moving
          toward Winters. Karai flips forward, sword drawn and at
          Winters throat!
          ...as Winters stands still... and begins to LAUGH.
          Slowly, the thumping of FOUR SETS OF FEET lumber out of the
          shadows. Reveal themselves to be THE FOUR STONE GENERALS.
          They flank Winters, who is just loving the theatricality of
          it all.
          The Foot Ninja leap back. Winters remains confident and
          unmoving. Generals SMIRK at Karai and the Foot.

                               WINTERS
                    I believe we made a deal, Karai. I
                    expect you to honor it.
                         (beat, stares her down)
                    You do understand "honor", don't
                    you?
          Karai stews... unblinking stare. Of course she does.

                              WINTERS
                    So I don't care what part of
                    "muscle for hire" you don't
                    understand. I hired your muscle.
                    Now exercise the ones attached to
                    your feet and...
                        (closer - terse)
                    ...get back to work.

          

                                                                    43.

          

          

          
          Karai slowly steps back. Winters smiles wide, reaches into
          the drawer and takes another brick of bills and tosses it to

                               W
          a Foot Ninja. Then another to a second Ninja.

                               INTERS
                    So I will double... no, no...
                    TRIPLE your pay for your troubles.
                        (stare down)
                    Are we cool?
          ON FOOT - They just stare back, blank goggles. Probably
          seething inside. Winters is flanked by Generals.

                              WINTERS
                    Are we... cool?
          The Foot don't move. Tense. Karai finally nods. Terse.

                              WINTERS
                    Ninjas. No sense of humor.
                        (to Generals)
                    So how did we fare?
          CORRIDOR ENTRANCE - a hunched SHAPE undulating in chains is
          wheeled into the light.
          Winters approaches it - chained to a high-tech and uplit
          pallet on the floor. We can barely make it out as being the
          HAIRY CREATURE from the I-beam fight.

                              WINTERS
                        (close, quiet)
                    So it begins...
          It SCREAMS. Fights it's restraints. Tires. Breathing heavily.
          Winters approaches, safely inches away from his fanged maw.
          Creature suddenly lunges forward! Winters doesn't flinch. He
          merely grins at the creature.

                              WINTERS
                        (to General Aguila)
                    Were there any problems?
          AGUILA speaks in a gravelly, hardened voice. He towers over
          Winters by a foot. Clearly the leader of the four.

                              GENERAL AGUILA
                    None, my lord.

                              WINTERS
                        (to Karai)
                    You see, now THAT'S a good soldier.
                    You two should compare notes.
          Karai and Aguila stare at each other. Karai obviously not
          used to being handled like this.

          

                              K

          

          

          

          

                                                                  44.

          

          

          

                              KARAI
                    Just what is this all about?

                              WINTERS
                    Oh, let's call it a scavenger hunt.
                        (re: Generals)
                    I now have the power and know-how,
                    but I need the speed and stealth of
                    an organization such as your own.
                    Not to mention an organization that
                    values discretion.

                              KARAI
                    But of course.

                              WINTERS
                    You see, I have nine more beasts
                    like this that should be coming to
                    town very soon. Thirteen in all, to
                    be exact.
          The Four Generals move the monster into a position on the
          floor ahead - into a DISK on the floor. ON CEILING - We see
          the top of a CAGE inserted over top, creating a cell.

                               ARAI
                    But... why? Why here? Why now?

                               WINTERS
                    Instinct, mostly. They're animals
                    at their core.
                        (looks off, distant)
                    And they recognize something
                    familiar in the air... in the
                    stars.

                        (BEAT)
                    What can I say? I'm a lover of
                    animals.
          The disk ROTATES. WIDER we see that there are already some
          cells inserted on the large stone disk in the floor. Filled
          by darkened silhouettes of creatures that we're probably glad

                               W
          we don't fully see. Glowing eyes pierce out of the darkness.

                               INTERS
                    So you go and get to know each
                    other. And don't forget... play
                    nice.
          The Generals turn and walk-push the Foot out of the door.
          They move to fight back, but Karai waves her hand.

                              KARAI
                    Not now. Our business will be
                    handled at a later time...

          

                                   D

          

          

          

          

                                   R

          

          

          

          

                                                                 C

               INT. TURTLES LAIR - KITCHEN - AFTERNOON

               Three brothers sit around their breakfast table, looking hung
               over from the previous night's brawl. Mikey comes in, looking
               the worst of all, and plops into his seat. Cam circles table.

                         plate of the thing that hit us last
                         night? Oi, my head...
               Don pours over a thick book on MONSTERS AND MYTHOLOGY.

                         Was it just me, or did that
                         creature look familiar?

                         woulda pitched in sooner.

                         Fact remains, Raph, that we should
                         have never been there in the first
                         place.

                         happiness throughout the city... oh

                         Come to think of it, it WAS pretty
                         strange to see the Foot too. And
                         who was that woman?

                         only one who has to be responsible!

          Splinter makes himself a TEA. Room is SILENT.
          ON TURTLES - Raph and Leo GLARE at one another while they
          eat. Don is pouring over a THICK BOOK while Mikey sits with
          his forehead on the table.

                              SPLINTER
                    If anyone needs me, I'll be
                    watching my stories.

                    And in the latest of a string of
                    strange criminal activity, a
                    construction site was nearly
                    destroyed last night. Authorities
                    believe a violent battle had taken
                    place earlier that evening.
          The boys react and rush into the MAIN LIVING AREA.
          ON TV - a well-coifed News Reporter stands outside of the I-
          BEAM TOWER. In the daylight, we can see the building is
          twisted and dented from the night's fighting.
          The boys immediately JUMP FORWARD. Mikey grabs the remote and
          ups the volume.

                              SPLINTER
                    My sons, what-
          Splinter's eyes go wide. He looks at his boys listening to
          the TV intently. Mikey nurses his sore head.

                              SPLINTER
                    I believe you boys have some

                         Leonardo, I am most disappointed in
                         you. You are the leader of your
                         brothers. I was counting on you to
                         bring order to the chaos of this
                         family.

                                   LEONARDO
                         But Master Splinter, how can I be
                         expected to do so when Ra-

                         the Leader, my student.
               ON LEO - Biting his tongue. Hard.

                                   SPLINTER
                         But the involvement of the Foot and
                         their mysterious leader worries me.

                         I'm personally worried about a
                         monster running around the streets
                         of New York. But hey, that's just
                         me.
               Don elbows Mikey back in line.

               They sit on that for a moment. Casey leans in for a kiss.

               Casey climbs up from the fire escape. Checks to make sure
               he's alone. He reaches inside a chimney flue and pulls out -
               A BASEBALL BAT and his CLASSIC WHITE HOCKEY MASK!
               He slips it on. Does a few warm up swings. Cricks his neck.

               EXT. NYC ROOFTOPS - CONTINUOUS

               All is still, until the panicked face of a BURGLAR enters
               frame. Being held by his collar.

                                   BURGLAR

                         I'M SORRY MAN! I-I-I WON'T EVER DO

                         IT AGAIN! I'M SORR-OOOF!
               BAM! - the leather fist of Nightwatcher slams Burglar back,
               tripping over an A/C duct. He tries to shield himself-
               REVERSE ANGLE - BOOM! - Nightwatcher lands in the FG.

                         someone else does it... all over
                         yer HEAD!
               Night hurls him back into a roof access door, denting it.
               Raph's loving this. Walks to the Burglar and picks him up.

                                   BURGLAR
                             (almost in tears)

          It's getting serious. Casey's bat is suddenly wrapped by
          Night's CHAIN, and pulled down. Raph's visor flips up.

                         I dunno, I just got tired of the
                         "nothing". Sitting around waiting
                         for some disaster to cross our
                         paths. Of us battling Utroms and
                         Triceratons or any other friggin'
                         creature... when there was still
                         some guy gettin' mugged 100 feet
                         above the lair. Just didn't seem
                         right. `Specially if we had the

               Casey, taking the hit himself!

                         Not good.
               Raph takes out NINJA SMOKE PELLETS and throws them on the
               roof - FWOOM! When the smoke clears, Casey is standing there
               alone! Raph is 10 feet away as Casey flinches and takes off
               too.

               BOOM! - Gato lands up on the roof and quickly gives chase!
               They can't lose him, even when they drop to street level.

               Raph and Casey are tearing ass through the alleyways, trying
               to escape the thing that's close on their tail.

                                   CASEY

                         WHAT WERE THOSE THINGS, RAPH?!
               Raph ignores him, looking for a street sign. Then he sees it -
               56th Street.

                                      RAPHAEL
                         Bingo.
               Raphael quickly dashes left through TRAFFIC!
               DOWN ALLEY BEHIND THEM - BOOM BOOM BOOM - We see Gato
               bounding down the wall, almost in a four-legged run,
               occasionally jumping off walls at incredible speeds! A true
               jaguar. It leaps through the traffic as well.

          UNDER A BRIDGE - Raph points up and - CHOOP! - hits a remote
          that lowers his MOTORCYCLE.

                              CASEY
                    What are we gonna do, Raph? WHAT

                    ARE WE GONNA-

                    -hey, cool ride.

                                RAPHAEL
                    Hop on.
          Raph leaves Gato in a cloud of dust... but not for long. Gato
          clamors along... keeping up with the weaving bike! In the
          fray, Casey looses his mask... as it gets trampled by Gato.
          It's an insane chase, with Raph trying to lose him as Casey
          swings his bat, trying to stave off the Stone General.
          Suddenly - THUNK!
          A circular OBSIDIAN BLADE lands in his wooden bat. He looks
          at it.

                                CASEY
                    Um, Raph?
          Raph sees the blade! They manage to switch positions in mid-
          ride, with Casey driving and Raph in back. Raph throws kicks
          and punches at their pursuer when he closes in.
          The chase takes them to a PARKING GARAGE as they circle
          upwards, Gato jumping from car to car, still on their tails!
          ROOFTOP - They're trapped. He doesn't have a hope... aside
          from jumping the bike to the next roof!

          He lets out the clutch as they make the jump! WHAM! - Sparks
          and crucial pieces fly off the undercarriage. They both look
          back at Gato up and away at the top of the structure.

                              CASEY

                    SUCK ON THAT, ROCK FACE!
                        (Gato leaves edge)

                    THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT, PUNK!
          ...and then -thumpthumpthump- Gato JUMPS DOWN TOWARD THEM!

                                CASEY
                    Oh crap.
          Casey guns it - BUT THE BIKE DOESN'T WORK ANYMORE - as Gato
          is in mid-air, taking off. Casey grabs the weakening Raph and
          drags him off.

               Gato lands and patrols the roof... almost SNIFFING them out.
               Casey and Raph are barely hidden inside a rooftop shack.
               Suddenly - BOOM! - Gato finds them. He tries to smash through
               the steel door with his bare hands!
               Raph leans his body into the door as a last ditch effort.
               He's taking a pounding as the door is denting with each slam
               by Gato. Casey tries to help as well.
               Gato comes close to breaking in. Very tense. Then-
               -the LIGHT on his exo-suit begins to STROBE. A signal. A
               signal to return home. He surveys quickly... then runs off.
               Casey and Raph fall out. Both shell-shocked.

               escape outside of the building and the window slide open.

          Everyone is gathered around as April finishes. Mikey, in
          particular, is hunched over, intent. Casey, like before, has
          fallen asleep. Silence for a beat. Then-

                    Well?! WHAT NEXT?!!!

                              APRIL
                    No one knows. The legend stops
                    there.

                    But it's just a legend.

                    The micro-tech of this dart is
                    astounding. The molybdenum is of a
                    grade only found in a few select
                    markets... not to mention it's
                    current stock is going for a little
                    more than two-grand an ounce right
                    now.

                    So what do we have? We have someone
                    with a lot of money.

                               ONATELLO

                               EONARDO
                    Do you think he's trying to

                    Well, what would you do with an
                    army of monsters?

                    me n' Casey?

                              LEONARDO
                    Or until we prove Winters is up to
                    something more than collecting art.

                              DONATELLO
                    I'll work with April and see if
                    these Stars of Kikin she told us
                    about can give us any clues.

                              RAPHAEL
                    I say we just storm the castle and
                    face this jerk in person!

                    Raph, that would be the worst idea
                    yet. We hang back. Analyze.
                    Formulate a plan, THEN storm your
                    castle. Are we clear?
          Tense stare off between Raph and Leo. Raph moves anyway.
          Casey stops him. Quieter moment.

                               CASEY
                    Raph. Don't do it, man.

                    I spent my whole life running out

                    Sometimes, just takin' a breather
                    is the best thing to do.
          ON APRIL - She's listening to Casey... maybe her man-boy is
          growing up. Raph knows he can't win.

               It's dark. Barely lit in the hallways of the top private
               floors of Winters Tower.
               The camera travels the long and ornate hallways. Decorated in
               a different sense than the main building... in a sense of
               family, tradition and legacy.
                ictures spanning centuries in age. Some photos. Some
               portraits. Families. Loved ones.

               INT. WINTERS STUDY - CONTINUOUS

               Cam continues until we find a high-backed chair parked in
               front of an oversized blazing FIREPLACE.
               ON CHAIR - Winters sits. Tired. Sullen. Sipping brandy. Looks
               above the fireplace and lifts his snifter in a toast.

                                    INTERS
                         To picking up the pieces.

               ABOVE FIREPLACE - is a suit of armor... THE suit of armor of
               none other than Yaotl the Conqueror. He looks at it with
               heavy thought. Then-

                                   WINTERS
                         What is it?
               Winters doesn't turn around. Stays in E-FG. Cam adjusts to
               show the shape of GENERAL AGUILA in the doorway.

                                   GENERAL AGUILA
                         Two creatures remain, my lord.
               A long beat. Winters closes his eyes.

                                    WINTERS
                         Well, by all means then. Let's
                         finish it.
               ON AGUILA - He squints. Deep in thought and not sharing.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               Nightwatcher runs along the rooftops. He pauses. He lifts his
               visor to feel the night air on his face. He sees WINTERS
               TOWER in the distance... practically egging him on.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               Classic Diner design, Pete's Diner is closed for the evening.
               The last light goes out.

               A greasy DINER COOK finishes cleaning up the tables. He
               suddenly hears a noise in the back. Big CLANK.
               KITCHEN - He walks to the back. He hears the noise... now
               from inside the WALK-IN FREEZER. He slowly approaches it.
               ANOTHER NOISE. He moves to open
               INSIDE OF FREEZER - the door slowly opens. The man's face
               peers in. His eyes go WIDE. He SCREAMS!!!

               Nightwatcher hears the scream. Runs to the source and looks
               down at Pete's Diner. Sees the commotion inside. Uses his
               bolo chain and a power cable to form a ZIP LINE down the
               street as-

          

                                                                       67.

               INT. PETE'S DINER - MOMENTS LATER

               -KERSMASH! He goes through the front window! He stands, cat-
               like. Ready for anything. The room is only lit by the neon
               signage behind the counter. Suddenly -
               Night creeps to the freezer. He can hear the CHEWING and the
               SNARLING behind the thick door. He takes out a spiked brass-
               knuckle. Ready. Places a hand on the door... and opens it.
               ON DOORWAY - The creature is huddled over a pile of frozen
               meat. Chewing with pieces flying everywhere. Disgusting. It
               turns around - monkey-like and ferocious looking DEMON... but
               "cute" in a bizarre kinda way. Music builds as go-
               WIDER ON SIDE VIEW - Night stands there. The horrible demon
               creature suddenly jumps out of the freezer too! Face off with
               Raph as we realize-
               -it's only THREE FEET TALL!

                                   NIGHTWATCHER
                         Hey there little fella. All that
                         commotion for just little ole y-
               The Demon SCREAMS! It jumps Night, slamming him to the floor
               behind a row of tables!

                                   NIGHTWATCHER (O.S.)

                         WAHH! OOOF! AAAGGH! OW!! WHOAAA!!!
               Plates, glasses and utensils fly everywhere, smashing all
               over the diner as the Demon pummels him.
               CLOSE ON NIGHT - The Demon is jumping up and down, slamming
               his helmeted head repeatedly to the floor! It lunges forward,
               mouth open as Night backhands it with a PLATE. The Demon
               jumps back and up, landing on a rotating CEILING FAN.

               T
                he creature lunges down again, but this time, Night is
               ready. He fights back. Like fighting with a Chihuahua hopped
               up on cocaine.
               A break in the fight. The creature has disappeared. Night
               knows he's there. He preps. Grabs his SMOKE PELLETS from his
               pocket. And waits... until...
               ...the Demon swoops in for another attack! Mouth open, fangs
               bared as Night tosses the smoke pellets inside!
               WIDE - POOOMPH! POOOMPH! POOOMPH! The pellets explode in its
               mouth, sending smoke shooting out of it's nostrils, ears and
               eyes! It shrieks, flying out of the Diner!

                              NIGHTWATCHER
                        (victory taunting)
                    Yeah! That's what I thought! Don't
                    mess with the Nightwatcher!
          Night turns. His helmet is still on. He hits his LIGHTS on
          the side of his head to see through the thick smoke. He finds
          the DINER COOK huddled behind the counter. Night looks scary.

                              DINER COOK
                    Pl-pl-please don't hurt me!

                               NIGHTWATCHER
                    Whattaya talkin' about? I JUST

                    SAVED YOU!

                              DINER COOK
                    Please, sir. I have kids.
          Night looks around. He sees the CASH REGISTER on the floor.
          He picks it up, puts it on the counter.

                              NIGHTWATCHER
                    There ya go, pal. Make sure this is
                    safe. HEY - YOU HEARIN' ME?

                              DINER COOK

                    TAKE IT! JUST TAKE IT! DON'T HURT

                    ME, PLEASE!

                              NIGHTWATCHER

                    LISTEN! I DON'T WANT YER FRIGGIN'

                    CASH! WHY DOES EVERYONE HAVE SUCH A

                    HARD TIME BELIEVIN' I'M A GOOD GUY?
                        (points threatening)

                    I JUST SAVED YOUR STINKIN' LIFE!
          Sudddenly - SHINK! - a THROWING STAR is lodged in the cash
          register till! Night jumps. Looks out the window.
          CAM PULLS WAY WAY BACK, REALLY FAST - Out the Diner and to
          the rooftop across the street... and over the green shoulders
          of LEO.
           ll he sees is a panicked man and the large shape of
          Nightwatcher standing over him, holding the register.
          CLOSE ON LEO - He's fuming. Staring down at Nightwatcher. The
          frustration of the last few days pent up inside of him.

          B
           ACK IN DINER - Night slowly lays down the register. Trying
          to figure out his next move.

                              NIGHTWATCHER
                    This night just keeps gettin'
                    better n' better...

               Tense stand-off as... Night suddenly bolts out the back as
               Leo bolts the roof in hot pursuit!

          

          

          78                                                                78

               EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREETS - CONTINUOUS

               Night tears down the streets and through back alleys. Leo
               keeps up with him effortlessly, hurling an assortment of
               THROWING STARS his way.
               Night suddenly DASHES OUT into traffic! Jumping over passing
               cars from roof to roof!

                                   LEONARDO
                         Nice try, amateur.
               Leo crosses the busy street while still maintaining his
               secrecy. Zip lines through power lines, avoids an oncoming
               bus, and flips back onto a cable.
                e swings and manages to snag Nightwatcher in mid-leap!

                                   LEONARDO
                         Oof! You're a heavy boy, aren't
                         you?
               They both land on a fire escape, as Night clamors to the top.
               Leo wastes no time in catching up.

          

          

          79                                                                79

               EXT. ROOFTOPS - CONTINUOUS

               The chase continues. Night giving it his all, and Leo keeping
               up pretty easily. He throws Leo a pretty strong curveball,
               and Leo barely recovers.

                                   LEONARDO
                         Okay, someone's been training
                         pretty hard.
               It begins to spit rain - and becomes a FRANK MILLER DOWNPOUR.

          

          

               EXT. ROOFTOP DEAD END - CONTINUOUS


          80                                                                80
               Night reaches an area that's a DEAD END. One side of the
               buildings has a LARGE LETTERED SIGN facing away. Fills the
               rooftop with silhouettes. No choice but to turn around...
               ...as Leo slows to a stop at the other end of the building.

                                   LEONARDO
                         I want you to know that I
                         appreciate your intentions. But you
                         can't change the world like this.
               INSIDE HELMET - All we hear is rain pouring. Raph can't hear
               Leo - just sees him wagging his finger at him.

          

                                                                     70.

          

          

          

                              NIGHTWATCHER
                        (to himself in helmet)

                              L
                    Oh god. He's lecturing.

                               EONARDO
                        (now audible)
                    ...so I'm going to give you one
                    chance to just walk away and stop
                    this vigilante nonsense.
          Leo unsheathes his two katanas. Raph can't hear him.

                              NIGHTWATCHER
                        (to himself in helmet)
                    Okay, Leo. Wanna play?
          Nightwatcher drops TWIN BOLOS. He twirls them with
          expertise... then motions for Leo to fight. Charge at each
          other, running through the rain, weapons drawn.
          They fight. Hard. And with expertise. Two masters duking it
          out. It surprises Leo. It fills Night with more adrenaline.
          There's a break. They circle like tigers. Renewing attacks.
          Night knows every one of Leo's moves, and counters in turn.

                              LEONARDO
                    What? How did you-
          ...then he starts goading him on. Pushing Leo. Prodding.
          Making him MAD. ...and then Leo fights back. HARD.
          Night can't keep up. Leo uses every bit of his control,
          restraint and expertise. He surgically slices the bind under
          Night's helmet. He jumps on top of the vigilante.

                              LEONARDO
                    Goodnight, dark prince.
          Leo UPPERCUTS Night, knocking his helmet off! His face
          falls... IT'S RAPHAEL! Leo pales.

                              LEONARDO
                    R-raph?

                        (THINKS)
                    What?
          But Raph doesn't feel like explaining. Refuses defeat.

                              RAPHAEL

                    AAAAAAAAGHH!!
          He mule kicks Leo back. Leo tumbles back, still in shock.
          They yell at each other through the pouring rain.

          

                                                                          71.

          

          

          

                                   RAPHAEL
                         You're so friggin' smug! You think
                         the world revolves around YOU,
                         dontcha? That we couldn't POSSIBLY
                         survive without the mighty and
                         powerful Leonardo to guide us
                         through our problems, HUH?!

                             (PACES)
                         Well, I gotta newsflash for ya - we
                         got along just fine without you.

                                   LEONARDO
                         I was training! Training to be a
                         better leader! For you! Why do you
                         hate me for that?!

                                   RAPHAEL
                         ...and whoever said I wanted to be
                         led? I shoulda gone on that
                         training!

                                   LEONARDO

                         Y
                          OU WEREN'T READY! You're impatient
                         and hot-tempered! And more
                         importantly... I'm better than you.
               Raph stops in his tracks. Reaches behind his back... and
               pulls out his TWIN SAIS. He flips them to the front.

                                   RAPHAEL
                         Well, big brother, I'd have to
                         disagree with you on that one.
               Raph takes a ready stance. Leo does too. And they fight.
               Brother vs. brother. Katana vs. Sai. Technique vs. Heart.

               In another part of the city, the Generals have caught the
               Demon from Pete's Diner. As they carry him to the caravan,
               their RADIO COMM goes off.

               Camera RISES UP until we reach the rooftop where Leo and Raph
               continue to duke it out in the rain.
               They battle. In the end, Raph becomes an uncontrollable ball
               of anger, unleashing everything on Leo.

               It ends with Raph pinning Leo to the ground... holding a sai

               MILLIMETERS FROM HIS EYEBALL!
               Tense. Raph shakes. He looks like he's going to do it... then
               stops. He collapses back. Almost ashamed of what he's done.
               Leo just can't believe that Raph bested him. They pant
               heavily. The rain dies down.
               Raph RUNS AWAY, across a few rooftops. Away from his brother.
               He suddenly STOPS and looks back at Leo, small in the
               distance.
               CLOSE ON LEO - A SHADOW suddenly falls over him. He looks up
               to see the FOUR GENERALS surrounding him. He tries to fight
               back... but is too wiped from Raph.
               GATO POV - "reading" Leo on the ground. He frowns.

                                   GENERAL GATO
                         It is neither monster nor human.
               CLOSE ON AGUILA - He manages a small smile.

                                   GENERAL AGUILA
                         Then he shall perfectly serve our
                         purposes... let us inform our
                         commander that the final creature
                         has been captured.
               ON RAPH - He sees the commotion from afar... as Leo gets
               TRANQUILIZED with the Generals' dart cannon.

                                   RAPHAEL

                         LEO!!!
               Raph runs closer as the Generals lower to the ground and
               drive off. Raph jumps from rooftop to rooftop to try and
               catch his brother.

                                   RAPHAEL

                         L
                          eo!!! Hang on!!
               But the Caravan is too fast, and eventually loses Raph.

                         NOOOOOOOO!!!!
               Raph gets weak and collapses to his knees on the roof. The
               sun begins to rise. He has to return to the sewer.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Raphael walks to Splinter, practicing himself in the dojo.
               Raph holds his Sais in one hand, his bolo chain in the other.
               Clenches both tight.

                                   SPLINTER
                         Raphael? What is the matter?

                                   RAPHAEL

                             (RANTING)
                         I was out, and did... something...
                         something happened and I- ARRRGH!!!
               Raphael picks up a HEAVY WEIGHT and hurls is across the dojo.
               Splinter is unfazed, but he won't take any more.

                                   SPLINTER
                         Raphael! Kneel.
               Raph stops. Breathing heavy. Falls in line - walking to
               Splinter and dropping to his knees in front of his father.

                                   RAPHAEL
                         I did something... I did something
                         really stupid, Master Splinter.

                                    SPLINTER
                         Go on...

                                   RAPHAEL

                             (SEMI-RAMBLING)
                         I know why you chose him now. I
                         know that there's a reason why he's
                         the better son and I'm not.

                             (THINKS)
                         And I think I made things worse
                         tonight.
                             (beat - calming down)
                         A WHOLE lot worse... I know you
                         must be ashamed of me, father.
               Raphael is lost in his guilt. Splinter kneels in front of
               Raph.

                                   SPLINTER
                         Raphael. You always bear the
                         world's problems on your shoulders.
                         It is an admirable quality when you
                         are a protector of others...
                plinter gently lays a hand on Raph's shoulder.

          

                                                                       74.

          

          

          

                                   SPLINTER
                         But you must realize that while, at
                         times, you may not be my favorite
                         student, it does not mean that you
                         are my least favorite son.
               Raphael looks up. Having not thought of it that way.

                                   SPLINTER
                         You are strong, passionate and
                         loyal to a fault. These are the
                         merits of a great leader as well...
                         but only when tempered with
                         compassion and humility.

                                   RAPHAEL
                         But Master Splinter, I messed up
                         big tonight... I mean BIG.
               Splinter chews on this.

                                   SPLINTER
                         Leonardo? R

                                (beat, ashamed)
                         Yes.
               Splinter is grim. Nods. But he moves on.

                                   SPLINTER
                         Well then, I believe your brothers
                         may be in need of a leader.
               Raphael looks up. Finally, his shot. He holds his SAIS in one
               hand, and his BOLO CHAIN in the other. Ninja Turtle vs.
               Nightwatcher. He grips them both hard. He drops the chain.

                                   RAPHAEL
                         Thank you... father.

                 The   disk in the basement is suddenly RAISED up to the lobby
               area,   replacing the slick marble design with an antiquated
               stone   version. Only now, THIRTEEN CREATURE CELLS surround the
               disk.   Very ceremonial.
               - Finally, Winters' office elevator LOWERS from high above.
               He's in the actual ceremonial gear worn by Yaotl years ago.
               He holds the helmet to his side. Very serious. He looks over
               his now-ceremonial lobby... satisfied.
                 PUSH IN on one cell, as Leo sits hunched over, unconscious
               and helpless...

               INT. APRIL AND CASEY'S LOFT APARTMENT

               Quick shots of April and Casey gearing up. Casey with his off-
               the-shelf sporting gear. April with sleek-looking Japanese
               combat gear and weaponry.
               They both emerge from their rooms, dressed to kill. Casey's
               jaw drops as we scope out April.

                                     CASEY
                           Wow.

                                     APRIL
                               (models it)
                           Picked it up on my last trip to
                           Japan. You... like it?

                                     CASEY
                           Oh... oh yeah.
               They share the moment. Seeing what they forgot about each
               other when they first met. It's enough for them to smile.

                                     APRIL

                             (faking confusion)
                         Mask? What mask?
               April runs into the other room and comes back with her hands
               behind her back. She takes out a NEW MASK for Casey - cool,
               crisp and a badass paintjob.

                                      CASEY
                         No way...

                         I was saving it for our
                         anniversary.

               Almost awkward as Casey leans forward and is about to kiss
               her... Then a MUSICAL TUNE (first bar of the TMNT series)
               plays on a car horn outside, interrupting them again.

                                   APRIL
                         That's our ride.

               Splinter and Don sit in the back seat. Pulling further toward

                nd on Raph in passenger seat and Mikey driving.

                             (looks around)
                         Not because of our individual
                         strengths... but because of how we
                         function as a team.

                         dangerous. You sure you're in?

               Karai walks down the center path of the garden, flanked by a
               DOZEN FOOT NINJA. She motions for them to take position.

                         As ordered - no one gets in. No one
                         interferes. No one bears witness.
               SUDDENLY - the security alarm from the front gate BUZZES.
               Karai waits a beat. It buzzes again. She walks to the
               SECURITY PANEL by the front gate.
                N MONITOR - We see CASEY standing there, obscured by a LARGE
               WOODEN CRATE IN FRONT OF HIM. Karai coldly opens the gate.

                    Yeah, hey, I was supposed   to drop
                    this off for Mr. Winters.   If I
                    don't get this done, I am   majorly
                    in the doghouse. You know   what I'm
                    sayin', right? Right?
          The two stare at each other as the CAM ANGLES BEHIND KARAI -
          she's holding a KATANA SWORD behind her back!
           AM DOLLIES OVERHEAD as we see that Casey is packing MAJOR
          sports gear "heat" on his end too. Both don't let on.

                              KARAI
                    Please come in, then.

                              CASEY

                    I mean, "but of course".
          Casey wheels the crate inside. The gate closes only KARAI HAS
          NOW DISAPPEARED! Casey opens the front hatch, revealing Don,
          Raph, Mikey, April and Splinter.

          WIDER - The empty garden begins to move. CREEPY, as DOZENS OF
          FOOT NINJA begin to rise out of the shadows and slink toward
          our heroes, surrounding them.
          KARAI makes a dramatic entrance, landing in front of April
          and Casey. Tense beat.

               examines one of the cells.
               PUSH IN - it's LEO. He's slowly waking up - groggy. Muttering

               We finally get to see how much of an ass-kicker Master
               Splinter is. Same with April, who squares off against Karai.
               They fight hard. April ends up cornered, about to be skewered
               by her blade when...
               -CLUNK! She wobbles and then passes out. When Karai falls out
               of frame, she reveals CASEY JONES a hundred yards behind her
               holding his HOCKEY STICK! April frowns.

                                   APRIL
                         I had the situation under control.

               Mikey fights the most like Jackie Chan - comical maneuvers
               backed by solid-hitting blows. Don uses his bo-staff in 1001
               different ways, both offensively and defensively.
               Casey is enjoying the hell out of it. High flying, adrenaline
               rush. He even catches April checking him out, and vice versa.
               April suddenly spots an opening to the front doors!

               The light sequence gets to Leo's cell... it doesn't light up.

                         What?
               His mind reels. Looks down at the cells. Nothing. Then it
               hits him like a ton of bricks. He turns to the Generals...

                                   WINTERS

               INT. WINTERS LOBBY

               Our six Heroes all tear into the lobby. They turn back, an
               army of ninjas closing in on them!

                                   MICHAELANGELO
                         What do we do, dudes?!

                         I'm working on it.
               Raph grips his sais with renewed strength. Casey looks
               around, putting things together mentally. Tension builds!

               hockey stick and - SMASH!!! - kills a LOBBY VASE. Suddenly,
               sirens blare as the OUTSIDE BUILDING SECURITY SHUTTERS SLAM
               DOWN just like in Act I!
               The Ninjas are locked out!

                    Nice work, Jones.

          OFF DON'S LOOK - the mayhem builds at the other end of the
          vast lobby. The cells are glowing. The portal worsens.

                    And that would be the swirling

                    Cool.
          They all run over. Mikey runs to a cell.

                    Leo! Is that you?
          RAARRGH! - A claw swoops out. He dodges out of the way.

                              MICHAELANGELO
                    I guess that would be a "no".

                    Hey buddy! Come on, man. Leo,
                    please wake up!
          Raph holds Leo in his lap on the floor. Looks like Leo is
          DEAD. Raph's head falls low, as...

                              LEONARDO (O.S.)
                    Wh-wh-what took you s-so long?
          WIDER - Leo is alive. Coughs and slowly gets his strength
          back. Stands up. He and Raph look at each other. Leo can only
          imagine what Raph's been through to rescue him. A beat.

                              RAPHAEL

               elevator office! He heads straight for a sword wielding
               BRONZE STATUE... particularly the sword part. Closer...
               closer... and...

               INT. WINTERS LOBBY

               Winters' body still lays on the floor. This is bad.

                                   CASEY
                         Is he... is he dead?
               Mikey takes out a hockey stick from Casey's bag and pokes
               Winters' limp body. Nothing.

                                   MICHAELANGELO
                         Yup. He's WAY dead, dude.
               WINTERS GASPS FOR AIR! Startles everyone in the room.
               ON EVERYONE - Their faces all drop as Winters stands up in
               his mini-crater, brushes himself off and is perfectly fine!
               Winters' mind is racing a mile a minute. Doesn't even notice
               those around him.

                                   WINTERS

                             (GROANS)
               Raph can't take it any more. He draws his sais and thrusts
               them at Winters. THAT gets his attention. Winters looks up in
               awe at seeing the mutated freaks in front of him.

                                   WINTERS

                         No harm?! Whatever! I'm about to
                         give you piercin's in places you
                         never imagined if you don't tell us

               Winters collapses on the floor. Head in hands.

                                   WINTERS
                         This was our chance. We could have
                         changed it all.

               The same red-tinted battlefield we left in Winter's
               flashback. Monsters are leaping through the hoards.

                                    INTERS (V.O.)
                         There are things, Miss O'Neil, no
                         one could possibly know...
               Camera pushes in on YAOTL and his Four Generals high on a
               hill, surveying the action.
               ON YAOTL - He takes off his helmet... IT'S WINTERS HIMSELF.

                                   WINTERS (V.O.)
                         It was I who stood on that
                         battlefield all those years ago.
               Winters/Yaotl looks out at the death and destruction. He
               looks shocked, surprised.
               A SHADOW falls over Winters body. He looks up - it's a
               ceremonial SHAMAN from their enemies' camp.

                                   WINTERS (V.O.)
                         And we had to pay a price.
               The Shaman makes hand gestures, chanting. Winters is pulled
               up in the air, and in a crackle of red electricity, we see
               him become... grayer.
                N GENERALS - Same electricity. Different effect. They
               scream, slowly turned into STONE. Cracks form on their
               bodies, light shooting out of it.

                                   WINTERS (V.O.)
                         We were cursed that day. My four
                         comrades-in-arms were turned into
                         stone.

                    immobile... yet fully aware at all
                    times to ponder the crimes we've
                    committed.
          ON WINTERS - He stands on the battlefield. Alone. As he
          walks, the CAM MOVES around him. During this, we X-DISSOLVE
          BETWEEN A FEW SELECT TIME PERIODS between then and now.

                              WINTERS (V.O.)
                    My curse was to live... forever. To
                    feel the pain of losing love time
                    and time again. Of boredom. The
                    pain... of time.
           ACK IN PRESENT DAY. Winters stops walking...

                              WINTERS
                    We were doomed to live this way
                    until, as the Shaman put it, "you
                    corrected the mistakes of your
                    past".
                        (gestures to the lobby)
                    That's what this is about. Penance,
                    Miss O'Neil. Finally getting a
                    chance to right our wrongs.

                              GENERAL AGUILA (O.S.)
                    Our master fails to include crucial

                    glory of fresh air... we rotted in

                    But thanks to his cunning, his

                    LIVING... we have now become-

                              GENERAL SERPIENTE
                    And we shall finish what we began
                    all those years ago. We will
                    finally have our victory.

                        (to Karai)
                    Destroy them.
          Karai sees Winters' condition. Clearly getting screwed by the
          very beings who have been nothing but hostile toward her and
          her Foot Clan. She suddenly GESTURES WITH HER HANDS -
          military/ninja style.

          

                                                                          87.

          

          

          

                                   APRIL
                         What does THAT mean?

                                   KARAI
                         It means we're going to help you.
               WIDER - 40 Foot Ninja disperse around out of the building,
               leaving Karai and 4 Foot Ninja behind.

                                   KARAI
                         My soldiers will find the
                         thirteenth monster. And you will
                         bring it back here. Hurry - we
                         don't have much time.
               Karai runs off. April looks over at Winters. He nods, still
               hurting. April takes off after Karai, leaving Casey behind
               with the Four Foot. They run out into the garden, just in
               time to see the other Foot disappear into the night.

                                   CASEY
                         I got shotgun!
               BACK ON GENERALS - They move toward Winters! The Turtles
               quickly look at one another. Know what they have to do.
               They all leap in the way, standing between Winters and his
               backstabbing Generals.
               Aguila moves forward to Leo. Raph steps in beside him,
               defiant. Then Mikey. Then Don.

                                   RAPHAEL
                         If you mess with one of us-
                             (looks around)
                         -you mess with all of us.
               Aguila smiles at their chutzpa.

                         Challenge accepted.
          97   The Portal worsens behind them. Sound and sight. The Eight 97
               are ready to fight.
               ...and the fight BEGINS! The Turtles leap, pounce and strike
               with all the exuberance and intensity they've ever had.
               Winters moves to help the Turtles.
               Suddenly a WALKING STICK across his chest stops him!

                                   SPLINTER
                         They must face them alone. As
                         brothers.
               Winters debates it in his head for a beat - WHAM! - a
               tentacle from the portal slams down next to him!

          

                                                                          88.

                         Alright. We have more important
                         things to do!
               ON PORTAL - A small DEMON makes its way out of the portal!
               Winters runs and flips through the air and then CLOBBERS IT
               with his bare hands, sending it back down!
               He lands on the other side.

                                   WINTERS
                         Help me push the cells into the
                         portal!
               Splinter does as the two masters also manage to lay some
               smackdown on any emerging creature out of the portal.

                                                                 CUT TO:

                                   CASEY (O.S.)
                         This has got to be the suckiest
                         vehicle to save the world with.
               - as the Cowabunga Carl van roars around the corner. Tinkling
               musical notes chime along with the speed. Appropriately lame
               and embarrassing.
               INSIDE VAN - Casey drives, as April, Karai and Four Foot are
               crammed in the back. Awkward silence.

                                   CASEY
                         So... anybody from out of town?

                E BEGIN TO INTERCUT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE LOBBY FIGHT,

               AND CASEY/APRIL MONSTER CHASE...
               LOBBY - The combatants all pair off for their final battle.
               Utter commotion. Mikey is paired with Serpiente.
               Donnie is paired with the General Mono. He uses his quick
               speed and expert staff against the hammer-weilding Statue.
               Leo fights with Gato. He can't dodge him. He's too fast. Leo
               lands a lucky blow, but Gato recoils - BOOM! Leo's knocked
               shell-first into a large GLASS DISPLAY CASE filled with
               swords and bladed weapons of all kinds.

                                   LEONARDO
                         Come to daddy.
               MOMENTS LATER - SMASH! - Leo steps out, ready for action.
               Strapped with a dozen swords tucked all over his body. He
               pulls them out randomly as needed throughout the fight.

          Raph and Aguila duke it out in and around the MONSTER CELLS.
          It's a Jackie Chan-inspired sequence, where they have to be
          aware of their environment to avoid defeat.

                              RAPHAEL
                    Sensei! How you guys doing?!
          ON SPLINTER AND WINTERS - The portal is pulling the cells in.
          About five more to go. Splinter also flips around and takes
          out another demon trying to escape. Splinter actually seems
          to be having FUN.

                              SPLINTER
                    Wonderful, my son. WONDERFUL!
          BACK WITH APRIL AND CASEY - Rush the streets of NYC.

                              KARAI
                    My troops have located the final
                    monster. At the harbor docks.

                               ASEY
                    Oh, I got this one covered.
          Casey GUNS IT for the pier, music tinkling. CAM ZOOMS AHEAD
          THROUGH THE STREETS until it reaches the pier. CAM CRANES
          over the harbor warehouses until we see -
          - the 13th monster! Looks like a land-locked GIANT CROCODILE.
          It appears unconscious - a hundred or so TRANQ DARTS sticking
          out of it's back. The Van pulls onto the scene.

          I
           NSIDE THE VAN - Everyone is in shock. The ninjas look at
          each other.

                               ASEY
                    Huh. Now there's somethin' you
                    don't see every day...
          They pile out of the van.

                              CASEY
                        (off of monster)
                    Well, I guess we have to figure out
                    how to get handsome here back to
                    Winters' Tower.

                              KARAI
                    We should tie it to the van and
                    drag it back.

                              CASEY
                    Wow. You're... hard core.
          ON CREATURE - A Foot Ninja stands next to the lifeless body.
          As he turns his head he doesn't see THE CREATURE'S EYE OPEN!

          

                                                                  90.

          

          

          
          WIDER - The creature stands up as everyone turns to see. The
          creature DOG SHAKES his hide, sending the tranq darts flying
          everywhere! They slam into the walls like shrapnel.
          ON FOOT - As they dive out of the way. One gets hit with a
          dart in the chest. Looks down. Passes out.

                                CASEY
                    Incoming!
          ON VAN - As they open the doors to act as shields as - THUNKA
          THUNK THUNK - darts stick in the door!
          ON CREATURE - He's now standing... and dying to chase
          something. It GROWLS/SCREAMS as they all pile into the van!
          Casey immediately throws it in reverse and starts peeling
          back on the pier, barely staying out of the clutches of the
          creature smashing the pier in front of them. Get to the end
          and spin the vehicle around.

                              APRIL

                    FAST! GO FAST NOW!!!
          Casey guns it, the 12-foot creature mere inches away!
          STARS IN SKY - Karai sees the stars are slowly moving out of
          alignment. Losing time fast.
          BACK IN LOBBY - CRANE DOWN on Winters and Splinter. On the
          last full cell.
          ON PORTAL - A pair of LARGE EYES are threatening to come out.
          In the BG, dozens of winged DEMONS fly around inside.

                              LEONARDO
                    They better hurry with that last
                    monster!

                              RAPHAEL
                    I'm sure my man Casey's got it all
                    under control...

                              LEONARDO
                    That's what I'm afraid of.
          BACK WITH VAN - CLOSE ON CASEY'S FACE - As he's screaming his
          guts out.

                              CASEY

                    I GOTTA TELL YA... I'M, UH, I'M

                    STILL NOT SURE THAT THIS WAS THE

                    BEST IDEA!!!!
          WIDER - We see that he's on top of the Van, acting as LIVE
          BAIT to attract the creature! It's working too! The creature
          pounces along like an awkward greyhound run. April drives.

          

                              R

          Casey is throwing SPORTS EQUIPMENT at it from his large
          hockey bag. The creature is catching and eating it all.
          INSIDE VAN - Casey slips in.

                              APRIL
                    What are you doing in here?!

                              CASEY
                    Ran outta food.
          They all look out the back window as the creature pounds
          closer and closer...
          BACK IN LOBBY - The Turtles and Generals are at a standstill.
          Turtles all get thrown into a pile between the Generals.

                               APHAEL
                    Listen. I'm the last guy to sound
                    like a TV cartoon, but I think we
                    need to work together.

                              MICHAELANGELO
                    Teamwork. The more you know...
          Don clocks Mikey behind the head.

                              LEONARDO

                        (TEASING)
                    Why Raph, no solo act tonight?
          Raph grins. They stand, backs to back... finally as a TEAM.
          They trust one another, and their efficiency shows.
          ON PORTAL - More tentacles begin to come out. More claws
          surround the surface edges.
          ON TMNT - The music swells. The brothers act and think as
          one. The way they should. They way they will from now on.
          ON SPLINTER - As cam PUSHES IN, he stands up. Seeing his
          sons. As one. As BROTHERS. He smiles.

                              SPLINTER
                    Yes. Yes, my sons.
          The Generals can't keep up. It's enough to distract them to
          make mistakes the TMNT take advantage of.
          ON WINTERS - Sees the portal light beginning to SHRINK!
          Because of the TMNT's moves, the Generals are now on the
          precipice of the Portal, being pulled back. They struggle to
          stand.
          The brothers look at each other. The place is violent with a
          whirlwind and screaming Monsters.

                                  LEONARDO
                      I'm in.

                                DONATELLO
                      Affirmative.

                                MICHAELANGELO
                      Roger dodger, dude.
          The   TMNT launch into their FINAL ATTACK - perfectly in synch
          and   take out each of the Generals, knocking them back into
          the   PORTAL! They're plucked out of mid-air by cloudy tendrils
          and   pulled back!
          The Turtles collapse onto the floor, back to the portal.
          Silent. Splinter runs over to them.

                                SPLINTER
                      My sons, I am so proud of you all.
          Then - BOOM! - the Generals' ARMS slam onto the ridge of the
          portal - BEGINNING TO CLIMB OUT! The Turtles jump back.

                                TURTLES

                      WAAAHHHHH/OHMIGOD!/WHOOAAA!!!

                                GENERAL AGUILA
                      Silly children. We are immortals
                      made of stone! The Earth has only
                      BEGUN to feel our wrath!
          The brothers are screwed. They can't stop the Generals. Until-
          BEHIND TURTLES - Glowing headlights grow larger. Closer. As -
          KERSMASH!!! The Van flies through the lobby, musical chime
          and all, being trailed by the Creature! April clips a corner
          as the vehicle spins out of the path.
           he Creature tries to stop, but can't on the marble floor. It
          falls, sliding, clicking its claws trying to stop!

                                  WINTERS

                      LOOK OUT!
          Winters dives in and pushes the Turtles out of way as the
          Creature flies in and knocks the Generals back into the
          Portal! The Cloud Tendrils grab a hold of it and pull it back
          into the Portal!
          ON STARS - The Stars move out of alignment, ending the cycle.
          ON PORTAL - It begins to close. The Generals struggle to get
          out, only now, we see they are HUMAN... their curse broken...
          and an eternity of pain and suffering ahead of them.

          

                                                                  93.

          

          

          
          Aguila tries to fight his way out of the portal.

                              GENERAL AGUILA

                    YOU CANNOT DEFEAT US! WE-
          WHAM! - Raph and Leo team-roundhouse him back into oblivion!

                              RAPHAEL
                    I thought he'd never shut up.
          WIDER - The portal EXPLODES in a upwards funnel. Silence.

                              MICHAELANGELO

                    HOLY CRAP!!!

                                 RAPHAEL

                    WE DID IT!

                              TURTLES

                    YEAH! WHOOHOO! WE DID IT!
          The brothers high five one another. Splinter smiles proud.
          ON VAN - Dusty and smoking. The door clangs open. Casey piles
          out. Karai comes next and accidentally FALLS on Casey in a
          very compromising position! She slyly smiles. April falls out
          last beside them.

                              CASEY
                        (caught - looks at both)
                    Oh. I, uh -
          HUHN! - Casey tosses Karai off of him. April's eye cocks.

                              APRIL
                    Don't try to tell me for one second
                    that you didn't enjoy tha-
          Casey just grabs her, cutting her off and they kiss. Like
          they should have been kissing all along.
          They stop. Noses close. Smile. They pull apart, revealing
          MIKEY standing there. Watching them all gooey-eyed.

                              MICHAELANGELO

                    AWWWWWW....
          Raph and Leo look at each other. A beat. Then hug. Brothers
          again. Dialogue would just ruin this moment.
          Splinter walks over to them. CAM ADJUSTS to show Karai and
          the Foot Ninja standing there. Silence. Finally, Karai steps
          forward -

                              KARAI
                    You are every bit the warriors I
                    was informed you were. You have
                    passed.

          

                                                                  94.

          

          

          
          ON TMNT - they're confused.

                              LEONARDO
                    Passed what?

                              RAPHAEL
                    You know us?

                              KARAI
                    I've known OF you for some time.
                        (beat, to Leo's question)
                    Savor your victory tonight. For
                    soon we will have further business
                    together.

                              SPLINTER
                    What kind of business?

                              KARAI
                    The kind that involves familiar
                    faces from your past...
          ON TURTLES - They all look at each other.

                              RAPHAEL
                    She doesn't mean...
          They look back - and see Karai and the Foot have DISAPPEARED.
          Raph looks over at WINTERS. He's hunched over in the corner.
          Can't tell what's going on. They walk over slowly.

                               RAPHAEL
                    Winters?
          ON WINTERS - Looks like he's sobbing. They get concerned.
          Then the sobs turn to LAUGHING. He stands up. His hand is
          spotted red with his M
                               own BLOOD from a cut on his cheek.

                               ICHAELANGELO
                    I'm never usually that happy to be
                    bleeding.

                              DONATELLO
                    You would be if you were an
                    immortal who couldn't bleed for
                    three thousand years...
          Winters looks at all the Turtles.

                              WINTERS
                    Thank you. Thank you from the
                    bottom of my heart. You've made a
                    very old man, very very happy.

                              MICHAELANGELO
                    So, um, what happens now?

                ON WINTERS - He just SMILES. Content. Finally at peace. As he
                ages thousands of years in front of us... eventually turning
                to DUST and blowing away.

                                    MICHAELANGELO
                          Okay... just a little bit creepy.

                              (SNEEZES)
                          Oh gawd. I think he's in my n-n-

                          ATTCHOOOOO!! OH GROSS!!!
                CAM PULLS BACK, out of the building, onto the street. See the
                destruction. The clearing skies. THE SUNRISE.

                                                                    UT TO:

                Raph comes to Splinter's room.

                                     APHAEL
                          You wanted to see me Sensei?

                                    SPLINTER
                          Sit down, Raphael.

                                    RAPHAEL
                          Thank you, Master Splinter, for
                          your guidance.
                              (thinks, humble)
                          I can only hope that one day, I
                          will be able to begin the next
                          stage of my training like Leo.
                Splinter smiles. Reaches into a box and takes out a similar
                MEDALLION to the one given to Leonardo.

                                     SPLINTER
                          That, my son, you already have.

                              (BEAT)
                          Our training works in mysterious
                          ways. But the answer that lies in
                          all our questions... is family.
                Raph beams as he accepts the "badge". He excitedly stands up.
                Splinter looks to the hallway where his eyes meet Leo's. They
                exchange knowing smiles as Splinter winks and we-

                A ROCKIN' NUMBER PLAYS as we cap everyone's adventures.
                Splinter walks through the lair. It's empty. He walks past
                their "trophy room". He places the ornate head of WINTERS'
                CANE on the shelf.

                He sits down to meditate. But first reaches into his robe and
                pulls out a TIN FOIL PACKAGE. He opens it up and smiles.

                                     PLINTER

                Mikey and Don are on the rooftops. Leo and Raph join them on
                top. Leo and Raph have an aside to themselves.

                          So we're cool with the whole

                APRIL'S POV INSIDE HELMET - We see a small DIAMOND RING taped
                to the visor. She takes it off. Beaming. Models it on her
                hand. She leans forward.

                All four turtles are horsing around. They get geared up...
                and head off for a game of NINJA TAG.
                The boys run, hoot and holler as they fly high on the

                          So what makes a family? Personally,
                          it's more than sharing a roof or a
                          bathroom. It's sharing life... My
                          father taught me that, and I think
                          it's pretty much true... y'know,
                          provided that you don't kill each
                          other in the process. Or that no
                          one touches your stuff. Or makes
                          loud noises when you're trying to
                          sleep. Or...

                They run close to the camera, once again, a family.

                                    RAPHAEL (V.O.)
                          Hey, nobody said it was easy.

                And as RAPHAEL and LEONARDO leap toward camera, we-

TOMBSTONE

An original screenplay
By
Kevin Jarre


























                                           Fourth draft

                                           March 15, 1993




ROLL PROLOGUE OVER MAIN TITLE:  a collage of old photos, 
prints, etc., and silent live-action vignettes, all dark and 
heavily shadowed like a dimly-remembered dream.  The first 
images show the opulence of the Gilded Age, the epic vistas of 
the west, cattle drives and cowtowns with all their 
violence....

                     V.O. NARRATION
          "The economic explosion following
          the Civil War created an
          unprecedented nation-wide market
          for beef.  Previously worthless
          cattle running wild throughout
          Texas were gathered into herds 
          And driven north to the railheads 
          In Kansas.  Fortunes were made as 
          Cowtowns sprang up on the 
          Prairies, wide-open centers of
          Commerce and vice, their streets
          Choked with heavily-armed young
          Men fresh from the cattle drives.
          In those days the correct term
          For a cowhand was 'drover'.
          'Cowboy', like 'cowpoke', was
          originally an insult implying
          deviant sexuality and was rarely
          used.  But these invading drovers
          were a wild breed for soon
          shootings and wholesale drunken
          riots became so frequent that
          ordinary citizens literally could
          not walk down the street.  In fact
          at their height the cowtowns had
          higher murder rates than modern
          New York or Los Angeles and there
          Was no law but that of the gun."

A dashing FIGURE in a Prince Albert coat appears, long locks 
tumbling down his shoulders, twin Navy Colts thrust into a red 
sash at his waist, a tin star on his chest.  Next we see him 
in action, downing 3 barroom opponents at once, pistols 
FLASHING around the room like a strobe light:

                     V.O. NARRATION
          "Straight-up at 75 yards or eye-
          to-eye at point-blank range, the 
          greatest gunman of all time was
          an Illinois abolitionist farm boy
          named James Butler Hickok, better
          known as Wild Bill, the Prince of 
          Pistoleers.  But Wild Bill worked
          His trade on the side of justice
          And as marshal of cowtowns like
          Hays City and Abilene he became a
          Legend, the one man who stood
          Between law and chaos."

Now Hickock sits facing us, playing poker as a shabby-looking 
FIGURE with a gun steals up behind him and FIRES.....

                     V.O. NARRATION
          "Wild Bill's fame spread nation-
          wide but his end came quietly in 
          the spring of '76 when a strange
          cross-eyed little drifter put a
          bullet through the back of his
          head, apparently for no other
          reason than he wanted to kill a 
          celebrity."

Now a group of cowhands carouse a streetcorner, raising hell 
as 2 mustachiod young LAWMEN walk up, trying to quiet them 
down.

                     V.O. NARRATION
          "In Dodge City meanwhile, Wyatt 
          Earp and Bat Masterson were 
          Becoming known as fast-guns.  But
          Their fame had nothing to do with
          Shooting."

Seeing it's hopeless, the lawmen whip out their pistols and 
start clubbing the drover's making them stagger and grimace, 
holding their heads....

                     V.O. NARRATION
          "Earp and Masterson operated more
          like modern policemen, using 
          teamwork and persuasion to keep
          order.  Still, sometimes things 
          got out of hand."

An ARMED DROVER creeps up behind the lawmen, about to fire....

                     V.O. NARRATION
          "But Wyatt had a guardian angel."

A REED-THIN FIGURE with a sawed-off shotgun steps from the 
shadows behind the drover and FIRES.  The huge blast WHITES-
OUT the screen for an instant, making the drover seem to 
disappear.  The lawmen spin around.  The thin man breaks the 
shotgun open then calmly holds out his wrists to be cuffed.  
Earp looks at him in shock, mouthing the word "thanks".

                     V.O. NARRATION
          "John Henry 'Doc' Holliday was
          the son of an aristocratic,
          highly cultured southern family.
          Trained in Philadelphia, he had
          Embarked on a career as a society
          Dentist when he contracted
          Tuberculosis.  Advised to practice
          In the west where it was thought
          The climate and clean air would
          Prolong his life, Doc soon
          Realized it was all only a matter
          Of time and gave up dentistry to
          Become a professional gambler and 
          Gunman..."


The scene shifts to an elegant Victorian home: a stern Jewish 
patriarch orders his darkly beautiful DAUGHTER upstairs as her 
weeping mother looks on.  The girl huffs up the stairs 
followed by her little white dog.  Next, the girl and dog are 
seen escaping through a window to the street below and a 
waiting cab.

                     V.O. NARRATION
          "Others headed east.  Bent on
          becoming an actress.  Josephine
          Marcus defied her wealthy and
          Very proper San Francisco Jewish
          Family to run away with a 
          Traveling theatrical company,
          Braving the perils of the 
          Frontier on her own.  Dangerous as
          This might seem, it was another
          Age and women were so rare, their 
          Presence so cherished that they
          Could travel virtually anywhere
          In the west in perfect safety."

Now we see HORSEMEN silhouetted against the night sky, a hand 
knocking on a door, figures conferring in darkness, then more 
riders, moving west in restless haste toward the rising 
sun....

                     V.O. NARRATION
          "At about this time the Texas
          Rangers, having eliminated the
          Commanche threat, turned their 
          Attention to the outlaw gangs
          Marauding along the Rio Grande,
          Cleaning up the border strip in 4
          Years of hard riding.  Those they
          Could not indict or convict the 
          Rangers put down in their Black
          Book, letting it be known that
          They could either leave Texas or
          Face summary execution.  This
          Resulted in the mass migration of
          The absolute dregs of the Texas
          Underworld to the most dangerous,
          Uncivilized part of the entire
          Country, the southeast corner of 
          The Arizona Territory."

A jagged, moonlit landscape, a lone prospector and his burro 
moving along a ridge, a pick digging into a rocky ledge, an 
ore car emerging from a mine shaft, finally a hilltop cluster 
of tents becoming the skeletal wood-frame beginnings of a 
town....

                     V.O. NARRATION
          "Harsh and inhospitable, savaged
          in turn by the Apache and Mexican
          bandits, this had always been an
          accursed place, a virtual hell on
          earth where it was thought life
          itself could never prosper, much
                     V.O. NARRATION (cont.)
          less civilization.  Then in 1879,
          a prospector named Ed Schiefflin
          set off alone into the Dragoon
          Mountains.  Friends told him he
          Was crazy, that the only thing
          He'd find in this Godforsaken
          Place would be his tombstone.
          Instead he found silver, lots of 
          It, and overnight the town of
          Tombstone sprang up.  Mining
          Taking out millions in ore.  Land
          Value shot sky-high and
          Speculators and gamblers and
          Opportunists of all nations
          Scrambled in by the thousands to
          Make Tombstone queen of the
          Boomtowns, so rich that the
          Latest Paris fashions, hard to 
          Find even in the biggest cities, 
          Were sold there by the wagonload
          From the makeshift storefronts."

An engraving of a stagecoach holdup, herds of cattle moving 
north, a newspaper story of a massacre in Mexico, congressmen 
railing at each other, shaking their fists....

                     V.O. NARRATION
          "Meanwhile, the exile Texans had
          banded together to form the
          nucleaus of an organized gang.
          Seizing controp of the

          The backbone of their trade
          Remained border rustling,
          Periodic raids into Mexico to
          Steal cattle while engaging in
          What was described as a virtual
          Orgy of murder and violence.  The 
          Raids became so frequent and so
          Bloody that the Mexican
          Government formally protested to
          U.S. President Chester A. Arthur,
          Prompting heated debate in 
          Congress.  General Sherman
          Declared that the only possible 
          Way of bringing order was to send
          In the army but in the wake of
          Civil War Reconstruction federal
          Intervention in civilian affairs
          Was politically impossible."


Pounding hooves, flowing manes, a pack of night-riding 
HORSEMEN kicking hell-for-leather across the desert 
moonscape....

                     V.O. NARRATION
          "With only some 100 members, the 
          gang was an elite body of gunmen,
          known by the red silk sashes they
          wore around their waists.
          Fiercely proud of their
          Terrifying reputation and
          Answerable to no one, they were a
          Law unto themselves, finally 
          Emerging as one of the earliest 
          Examples in American history of
          Full-scale organized crime."

          "They called themselves the
          Cowboys."

EXT - SONORA DESERT/CANYON ENTRANCE - DAY

Burning daylight, hard reality.  A squad of uniformed MEXICAN 
RURALES rides through the Sonora desert, sabres glinting in 
the sun.  Approaching the mouth of a rocky canyon their hard-
bitten CAPTAIN signals them to stop, leaning down to study a 
jumble of hoofprints on the ground.  He turns to the anxious-
looking YOUNG RURALE on his right, speaking in Spanish via 
subtitle:

                     CAPTAIN
          It's them, only an hour north.

                     YOUNG RURALE
          But this is the border.

                     CAPTAIN
          You saw what those animals did at 
          That rancho.  You think a border
          Is going to stop me?  No, I'm 
          Going to see them suffer for what 
          They did!  I swear it on my soul!

The Captain spurs his horse and they ride on at a gallop, 
plunging into the canyon....

DELETED

EXT - SKELETON CANYON - NIGHT

The full moon throws fantastic shadows across the high walls 
of the canyon as the Rurales ride through.  At the bend the 
Captain halts them.  The young one starts to speak but the 
Captain shushes him, peering into the darkness.  A few beats 
then:

                     CAPTAIN
          Turn around!  Fast!  Now!

But suddenly GUNFIRE erupts from the shadows all around them, 
blasting them from the saddle, each powder flash lighting up 
the canyon for an instant, freezing each victim in the moment 
of his death.  Then, just as abruptly the firing stops, 
leaving only the Captain, the young Rurale, and a 3rd Rurale 
alive.  Dazed and bloody, they struggle to their feet as 6 
armed FIGURES emerge from the shadows, walking into the 
moonlight toward them.  With broad-brim hats swept up in 
front, silk scarves and red sashes, high boots and silver-
studded gunleather, they look like 17th century pirates.  
These are the Cowboys:  OLD MAN CLANTON, the ageless, white-
bearded leader;  CURLY BILL BROCIUS, 2nd-in-command, smiling, 
bull-necked;  IKE and BILLY CLANTON, the old man's sons;  
FLORENTINO, a Mexican half-breed;  and JOHNNY RINGO, dark, 
Byronic, with an air of something very strange.  The Old Man 
nods to Florentino:

                     OLD MAN CLANTON
          Tell 'em to get on their knees.

Florentino does so in Spanish.  The others kneel but the 
Captain remains on his feet, steely-eyed, defiant.

                     FLORENTINO
          He will not kneel.  He is proud.

                     CURLY BILL
          So how'd you like our little
          Carry-on over at that rancho?
          Kinda hit the spot didn't it?

                     CAPTAIN
          Animals!  Butchers!

                     OLD MAN CLANTON
          Hey, somebody get that stick on 
          His knees.

Curly Bill casually FIRES his shotgun into the Captain's legs, 
dropping him into a splayed lotus position.  Curly Bill knods.

                     CURLY BILL
          Gracias.

                     OLD MAN CLANTON
          They call me Old Man Clanton.  I'm
          What you might call the founder
          Of the feast.  Now maybe you ain't 
          Heard, but we skylark through
          Your dingy little country just
          About any time we damn well
          Please and big-hat, crummy-
          Lookin' free-holes stumblin'
          Around in the dark ain't allowed.
          Messican po-lice, huh?  Think
          You're bad medicine, don't you?  
          Hell, I've let stronger stuff run
          Down my leg.  So next time we come
          Better step aside.  Get in our
          Hair again, we'll saw your prods
          Off with butter knives and stuff
          'em in your gobs.  Ain't kiddin'
          neither.  You been told.  Now git.



The others rise and dash away but Curly Bill stops the 
Captain:

                     CURLY BILL
          Hold up, jefe.  Got a joke I wanna 
          Tell you.

The Captain speaks grimly in Spanish.  Florentino smiles.

                     FLORENTINO
          He say he know you killing him.

                     CURLY BILL
          Now how'd he figure that out?

                     FLORENTINO
          He say he is no' afraid, someone
          Will revenge for him.  A sick 
          Horse.

                     CURLY BILL
          A sick horse?  What the hell...

Scattered chuckles from the others but we notice Ringo frown 
and draw his pistol as the Captain repeats the words.

                     FLORENTINO
          Something, I don't know, he talk
          Fancy, you know, like a priest.
          Is like, "a sick horse who sits---"

                     RINGO
          That's not what he said, you
          Ignorant wretch.  Your spanish is
          Worse than your English.  Come on,
          Let's get it over with.

Ringo takes aim.  The Captain sneers, suddenly in English:

                     RURALE CAPTAIN
          You go to hell!

                     RINGO
          You first.

EXT - ARIZONA DESERT - DAWN

GUNSHOTS as the Cowboys fire their pistols and shout, running 
their stolen herd out of a draw into a clearing where the 
McLaury brothers wait:  FRANK, older, edgy; and TOM, younger, 
easy-going.

                     TOM
          Looks like you had a party!

                     CURLY BILL
          Oh, we had a big time!
          The Old Man, Curly Bill, and Ringo rein up and look out at the 
          sun rising magnificently from the desert floor.  The Old man 
          stretches his legs in the stirrups, taking out a whiskey 
          flask.

                     OLD MAN CLANTON
          Ain't that sweet?  That's why I 
          Stay out here.  Thank you, God.

He raises the flask and drinks.  Curly Bill turns to Ringo:

                     CURLY BILL
          What'd the Messican mean, a sick 
          Horse's gonna get us?  Didn't make
          No sense.

                     RINGO
          He was quoting the bible,
          Revelations: "Behold a pale horse
          And the one that sat on him was
          Death and Hell followed with him."

                     CURLY BILL
          Well now that's a little more 
          Like it.

EXT - TRAIN STATION PLATFORM/TELEGRAPH OFFICE - DAY

A BLACK HORSE, a fabulous thoroughbred stallion, rears and 
neighs on an open flat-car where it's tethered with 4 near-
identical geldings.  A small boy tries to pet it as a strong-
featured, fair-haired MAN appears, quieting the horse.  Tall 
and slim in a black frock coat and black flat-brim hat, he 
moves with assurance and grace, a man in control.  This is 
WYATT EARP.

                     DAKE
          "Dear Governor Gosper-in re
          yours directing action against
          Cowboys, stop.  Beg to inform have
          Twice sent deputies to serve
          Warrants on Cowboy suspects,
          Stop.  Nothing to show for it but
          2 dead deputies, stop.  Short of
          deputizing U.S. Army am at loss-

                     DEPUTY

          Wyatt Earp.

                     DAKE
          Wyatt Earp?  Oh, right, Dodge City.

Back down the platform Wyatt strokes the stallion gently, 
looking up as Dake approaches.

                     DAKE
          Mr. Earp?  My name's Dake, Crawley Dake.  I'm the U.S. Marshal 
          for-

                     WYATT
          I said forget it, answer's no, I 
          Don't want the job and that's
          Final.  I'm going to Tombstone and
          Nothin' short of dyin's gonn

          But wait, you don't understand-

                     WYATT
          No Marshal, you don't understand. 
          I'm through with lawing, I'm
          Through with the whole
          Proposition.  Forever.  I did my
          Duty, now I'd like to get on with
          My life.  That is if you don't 
          Mind.  Jesus.  Good day now.

                     DAKE
          I see, off to strike it rich,
          Huh.  All right, fine, wish you
          Luck.  Tell you this though, never
          Was a rich man yet didn't wind up
          With a guilty conscience.

                     WYATT
          Already got a guilty conscience,
          Might as well have the money too.

Dake retreats.  Wyatt turns back to his horse testily.  
Suddenly:

                     O.S. VOICE
          Boy, I'd know that sour face
          Anywhere.

Wyatt turns.  His brothers stand behind him, smiling.  Though 
VIRGIL is a little older and heavier.  MORGAN a little younger 
and slimmer, they're otherwise identical to Wyatt, right down 
to their style of dress.  Wyatt breaks into a grin, hugging 
them both, his cool replaced with an almost boyish enthusiasm.

                     MORGAN
          Well how do we look?

                     WYATT
          Hey!  Virgil!  My God!  Morgan!  Hey, 
          Boy!  You look great!  Both of you!

Virgil's blonde wife ALLIE, small, fierce, and Irish, steps up 
with Morgan's fair, cameo-lovely young LOUISA in tow.

          Wyatt, you remember Allie

                     ALLIE
          Good God, well he better.

                     WYATT 
               (hugs her, laughing)
          Allie-girl...And Louisa!  You're
          So lovely.  I'm at your feet,
          Darlin'.  Just at your feet.
               (turns to Morgan)
          Guess it's only right.  Ma always
          Said you were the prettiest.

                     VIRGIL
          But she doted on the frowner

Wyatt's handsome blonde wife MATTIE enters from the street:

                     MATTIE
          Wyatt, I couldn't find a single
          Store that had laudanum any-

                     WYATT
          Mattie, they're here!  Folks this 
          Is Celia Ann but you can call her
          Mattie.  Or even Mrs.  Earp if you 
          Prefer.

                     VIRGIL
          Mrs. Earp?  Land O' love, it finally happened!  Mattie it's a 
          Pleasure!

All exchange greetings and hugs.  Wyatt positively beams:

                     WYATT
          Boy, I sure been dreamin' about 
          This.  God!  Since forever!  Wait!

He turns them toward the stationhouse window, arranging them 
in a group and pointing to their reflection.

                     WYATT
          There, look at that!  God
          Almighty

Wyatt smiles, shaking his head. Morgan's starts to speak, but:

                     WYATT
          Don't talk, just...yeah.

They stand silently, studying themselves, together as a 
family.  Wyatt still shaking his head happily, drinking it in.  
Finally:

                     WYATT
          All right, now let's go make our fortune.
          DELETED

EXT - WAGON - MAGIC HOUR

A large woman, Wyatt's black horses tied to the rear, crosses 
the majestic, forbidding Arizona desert with its red volcanic 
rocks and the giant saguaro cactus dotting the landscape so 
mysteriously, like huge, spiny hieroglyphics....

EXT - CAMP BY RIVER - NIGHT

A camp by the river under a clear night sky dripping with 
stars.  After dinner.  The women, Virgil, and Morgan sit by 
the fire.  Morgan petting his dog, a sweet little foxhound.  
Louisa sits behind him, twirling his silky blonde hair, 
turning to Mattie:

                     LOUISA
          Don't you love their hair?  They
          All have the same hair.

Just then Wyatt appears on his stallion, galloping across the 
moonlit plain toward them, sitting his horse like a centaur.  
It's clear he's a magnificent horseman.  Virgil smiles:

                     VIRGIL
          Look at him go, will ya?  I tell 
          You, that's the real Wyatt, born
          In the saddle.

                     MATTIE
          Oh, he can go all right.

                     ALLIE
          Can he then?

                     MATTIE
          Rather ride than eat.

The women cackle lasciviously.  Virgil groans at Allie:

                     VIRGIL
          Try to be a lady, will you?

Wyatt rides up and dismounts, unsaddling the horse.

                     MORGAN
          Give him some good exercise?  Sure
          Some stud.  Some string in fact.
          What're you gonna do, race 'em?

                     WYATT
          Hope so.  Clean up with this boy.

Louisa turns to Mattie, fishing in her bag:

                     LOUISA
          Mattie hon', did you say you
          Needed some laudanum?  I have a 
          Bottle right here.  Just be 
          Careful.  It's full of hop.

                     MATTIE
          You're a lifesaver!  Don't worry,
          I just get headaches sometimes.

As Wyatt leads the horse away the women get up, Allie and 
Louisa going to the river with dishes, Mattie crossing to the 
wagon.  Virgil and Morgan watch her appreciatively:

                     VIRGIL
          Mighty fine.  Wonder where he
          Found her.  Same place we found
          Ours probably

At the other end of camp Mattie climbs into the wagon and lies 
down.  Wyatt appears and starts to stroke her head.

                     WYATT
          Come up to the fire, honey.

                     MATTIE
          I think I'll just lie down awhile

A coyote starts HOWLING from the far darkness.  Mattie 
shudders:

                     MATTIE
          Long as I live I'll never
          Get used to that sound.

                     WYATT
          They're just lonely is all.  Hell,
          I howl myself sometimes.

                     MATTIE
          You get lonely?

She seems genuinely surprised.  Wyatt looks genuinely 
confused.  Over at the fire, Morgan hugs and mashes Louisa 
playfully.

                     MORGAN
          Come up, Lou.  Come up here, girl.

                     LOUISA
          Stop...

She fights loose.  Wyatt walks up, sits, shaking his gold 
watch.

                     WYATT
          Look at that.  Busted.  Brand new 
          Money Ward, too.  33 years old 
          And I don't even have a decent
          Watch.  'Bout time I started
          Lookin' out for myself.

                     VIRGIL
          Well here we are a family again.
          Been so long plain forgot how
          Good it feels.  Want to thank you
          For that, Wyatt.  All your doin'.

                     WYATT
          We're gonna do it, boys.  Gonna
          Get ours.  Feel it in my bones.
          All we have to do is keep our
          Eyes on that brass ring.

                     MORGAN
               (lies back)
          Boy, look at all those stars.  Bet 
          You can see every star there is.
          Practical touch 'em.  Kinda makes
          You think, you know?  I mean you
          Look up and you think God made 
          All that but he still remembered
          To make a little speck like me.
          Kinda flattering really.  Hey,
          Wyatt, you believe in God?  No,
          Come on, really, do you?

                     WYATT
          Maybe, yeah.  Hell, I don't know.

                     MORGAN
          Well what do you think happens
          When you die?

                     WYATT
          Got me.  Somethin'.  Nothin'.  I
          Don't know.

                     MORGAN
          I read this book, book on
          Spiritualism...

                     VIRGIL
          Oh, God, here he goes...

                     MORGAN
          ...said a lot of people, when 
          they're dyin', they see this
          light, like in a tunnel.  They say
          it's the light leading you to
          heaven.

                     WYATT
          Really?  What about hell?  They got
          A sign or what?

                     MORGAN
          Hey, Wyatt, God damn it, I'm serious!


                     WYATT
          Well that's your problem.  Hey 
          Virge, see anything of Doc while
          You were in Prescott?

                     VIRGIL
          Hit a streak when we left.  Him
          And Kate.

                     ALLIE
               (from the stream)
          Uh, that woman.

                     WYATT
          I miss Doc.  I miss that ol' rip.

                     VIRGIL
          I don't 

                     ALLIE
          Neither do I.

                     WYATT
          He makes me laugh.

INT - PRESCOTT SALOON - NIGHT

A handsomely appointed saloon.  At a corner table, the pot is 
so rich 2 players have folded leaving ED BAILEY, a big, 
sullen, tough-looking gambler, facing gaunt, elegant DOC 
HOLLIDAY.  Full of southern refinement and languid, almost 
feline grace.  Doc has such unerring style and aplomb that he 
makes his constant tubercular coughing sound as if he's merely 
clearing his throat.  Bailey leans forward, seething with 
impatience:

                     BAILEY
          I said that's 500 to you,
          Holliday.  In or out?

                     DOC
          500? Sly boots, must be a peach
          of a hand.

KATE HORONY, Doc's voluptuous Hungarian consort enters, 
refilling his engraved silver stirrup cup.  She has a faint 
accent:

                     KATE
          Here, Doc.

                     DOC
          Bless you, darling
               (puts arm around her)
          Darling!  Are you mad?  You're not
          Wearing a bustle.  How lewd!

                     BAILEY
          Oh, for Christ's sake!

                     DOC
          Ed Bailey, you look like you're
          Just ready to burst.  Well call me
          A fool but I guess I'll just have
          To call.  Cover your ears, darling.

Doc covers the bet and shows his hand.  Bailey pounds the 
table.

                     BAILEY
          God damn son of a...

                     DOC
          Isn't that a daisy?

                     BAILEY
          Just pick up your money and go.
          Sick of listening to you simper.

                     DOC
          Now Ed, are we cross?

Doc leans forward, revealing an ivory gun-butt under his coat.

                     BAILEY
          Skinny lunger, your guns don't 
          Impress me.  Wasn't for those guns
          You'd be nothin'.

                     DOC
          Why Ed, what an ugly thing to
          Say!  Does this mean you're not my
          Friend anymore?  You know, Ed, if
          I thought you weren't my friend I
          Don't think I could bear it.

Now a Cheshire cat smile we will soon come to know very well 
steals over Doc's face as he takes out his nickel-plated .38 
Colt Lightning and .45 Peacemaker and lays them on the table.

                     DOC
          There, now we can be friends
          Again.  But remember, Ed,
          Friendship is trust-so please
          Don't hurt me.

Doc bats his eyelashes.  Bailey jumps up, boiling.  A long, 
sweaty moment, then Bailey LUNGES.  Doc spring up, grabbing 
him by the hair and jabbing his fist into Bailey's armpit.  
Bailey screams and doubles over.  Doc gives him two more 
blows, so light they hardly seem capable of the effect they're 
having.  But as he turns to give him another we suddenly SEE 
that there's a KNIFE in Doc's hand.  The bartender reaches for 
the shotgun under the bar.  Kate pulls a Derringer from her 
muff and puts it to his ear.

                     KATE
          Touch that gun, I burn you down!

He backs off.  Kate covers the room.  Bailey drops to his 
knees.


                     BAILEY
          Oh, my God...

                     DOC
          Does it hurt?  A lot?  Good.

Eyes gleaming cruelly, Doc blows his cigarette smoke into 
Bailey's face.  Bailey sinks to the floor in a fetal position.  
Kate gathers up the pot as Doc retrieves his guns, looking 
around the room.  Then both back up to the door.

                     DOC
          Well, good evening then.

They exit.  The others look down at the groaning Bailey lying 
in a pool of his own blood.  A GAMBLER shakes his head:

                     1ST GAMBLER
          Judas...

EXT - STREET OUTSIDE - NIGHT

Doc and Kate stride quickly down the board sidewalk to the 
hotel.

                     DOC
          I calculate that's the end of 
          This town.  And let's don't bother
          About the luggage, darling.

                     KATE
          I been having the boy at the
          Hotel pack us up every night
          Since your streak started

Kate points to 2 horses saddled and packed outside the hotel.

                     DOC
          My sweet clever Magyar, so that's
          Why you're not wearing a bustle.

Doc gives Kate a peck on the cheek as they mount and ride 
off...

EXT - TOMBSTONE OUTSKIRTS/COTTAGES - DAY

A small cottage at the edge of town.  As the Earps drive up we 
SEE a sobbing woman sitting splay-legged in the middle of the 
street while her husband tries to comfort her.  3 small 
children stand alongside them, watching in stunned silence as 
Cowboys FRANK STILLWELL, cocky, arrogant, and PETE SPENCE, 
lean, dark, heave their furniture and belongings out of the 
cottage into the street while snarling things like, "shut 
up...deadbeats...move it!"  The Earps stop, staring at this 
scene in shock, Allie looking ready to fight.  Virgil 
restrains her, Stillwell looks up:

                     STILLWELL
          What're you lookin' at?

Virgil looks at Wyatt who shakes his head.  They drive on 
as....


EXT - ALLEN STRESS, TOMBSTONE - DAY

Unlike the dreary, weather-beaten western towns in movies, 
Tombstone is new and colorful, part town, part mining camp, a 
wild mixture of brightly painted wooden storefronts and half-
finished stone buildings rimmed by clusters of tents and 
shanties, all perched atop a hill with a magnificent view of 
the desert and the purple Dragoon mountains beyond.  We HEAR 
the vibrant din of hammers and saws, player pianos, hurdy-
gurdys, clip-clopping horses' hooves, and pealing laughter as 
the Earps drive up Allen Street, the main drag, lined with 
saloon after saloon, sidewalks bustling with drovers, miners, 
Chinamen, and sullen gun-toting hard-cases.  They pull up in 
front of the Grand Hotel and step down.  JOHNNY BEHAN, 
handsome, well-dressed, wearing an ornate crescent-shaped gold 
sheriff's badge and a ready smile walks up and shakes hands:

                     BEHAN
          Newcomers, eh?  Names John Behan,
          I'm Cochise County Sheriff.  Just
          Hit town?

                     WYATT
          Just this minute.  I'm Wyatt Earp,
          These're my brothers-

                     BEHAN
          Wyatt Earp...Dodge City, right?

                     WYATT
          Gave all that up.  Going into business.

                     BEHAN
          Well I'm the man to see.  Besides
          Sheriff I'm also tax collector, 
          Captain of the Fire Brigade, and
          Chairman of the Non-partisan Anti-
          Chinese league.  A man of many
          Parts.  Got a place to stay yet?  I
          Also sit on the Townlot
          Commission.  Got a couple of
          Lovely cottages coming up for
          Rent.  Here, let me show you...

EXT - TOMBSTONE OUTSKIRTS/COTTAGE - DAY

The Earps and Behan stand on the porch of the very same 
cottage we saw the Cowboys evict the family from.

                     BEHAN
          The one next door and the one
          Across the street are vacant too.
          Same rent and I'll throw in a 
          Good cleaning.  Believe me, you
          Won't find a better deal within
          Town limits.

Wyatt looks enquiringly at his brothers.  They shrug.  He's 
calling the shots.  Wyatt shrugs back.  Finally:

                     WYATT
          Guess we'll take all three.

EXT - O.K. CORRAL/ALLEN ST. - DAY

A large stable and corral backing up into a vacant lot.  
Wyatt's big horses feed in their stalls while Wyatt faces the 
stableboy:

                     WYATT
          ...and easy on the grain, I don't
          want 'em too fidgety.

Morgan and Virgil enter with FRED WHITE, the jovial old town 
marshal.  Shaking hands, all 4 go up Allen, taking in the 
town.

                     MORGAN
          Wyatt, meet Fred White, he's town marshal.

                     WYATT
          Lotta law around here.  Just met the Sheriff.

                     WHITE
          Who, Behan?  He ain't no law, only
          Real law here's the Cowboys.

                     VIRGIL
          The Cowboys, yeah.  I heard of 'em.

                     WHITE
          Nobody does nothin' without 'em.
          They're it.  Hell, even the 
          Apache're scared of 'em.  There's
          A couple right there: Sherman
          McMasters and Pony Deal.  Can
          Always spot a Cowboy, they all
          Wear those red sashes.

White points to SHERMAN MCMASTERS and PONY DEAL, a half-breed, 
standing over by the hotel, joking in sign language.

                     VIRGIL
          Look pretty rough.

                     WYATT
          Just like any other hard cases.
          Gotta know how to handle 'em.

                     WHITE
          Well I'm no Wild Bill.  Way I
          Handle 'em's just mainly live and
          Let live.  That usually answers 
          But even so, gets kinda spooky
          Sometimes.  Still somebody's gotta
          Do it, I mean how the hell else 
          You gonna walk down the street?

                     VIRGIL
          Doesn't anybody raise a stink?
          The hell kinda town is this?

                     WHITE
          Boomtown.  Wide open.  People
          Grabbin' with both hands ain't 
          Got time for any law and order.
          In fact the less law the more
          Opportunities there are for
          Makin' money.  Plain fact is the
          Cowboys're good for business.

                     WYATT
          What about all these saloons?

                     WHITE
          Ah, now that's the real mother-
          Lode in Tombstone.  Up and down
          Allen Street, full-blast 24 hours
          A day, liquor, hostesses,
          Gamblin', makin' money hand over
          Fist.  All except the Oriental.  On
          Account of the element.  Have a 
          Man for breakfast in there most
          Days.  Regular slaughter house.
          High-rollers won't go near it.
          Too bad, nice place.

Wyatt nods, suddenly very interested as they walk on and....

EXT - ORIENTAL SALOON - DAY

We feel the sensual delight of going from hot sun into cool 
dark as Wyatt enters, going up to the ornate mahogany bar.  
Though a large, handsome saloon complete with gaming tables, 
it has only a few patrons on hand.  "The Lilly and the Rose" 
is on the player piano as bartender MILT JOYCE appears:

                     JOYCE
          What can I get you?

                     WYATT
          Let me have one of those cigars.
               (lights up, looks around)
          Kinda nice in here.  You run it?

                     JOYCE
          Milt Joyce, owner-operator.

                     WYATT
          Well, excuse me for askin', Milt,
          But isn't it kinda dead in here?

Joyce points to the faro table in the corner where JOHNNY 
TYLER, an unshaven plug-ugly with a big D.A. Colt .45 carried 
ostentatiously in a shoulder holster, deals to a couple of 
scruffy-looking drifters.

                     JOYCE
          You see that bird at the faro
          Table?  That's Johnny Tyler.  He
          Barged in here one day, said he
          Was takin' over the game, started
          Slappin' customer, wavin' his 
          Gun around, scarin' off all the
          High-class play.  Only trade comes
          In here now's just bummers and
          Drovers, just the dregs.

                     WYATT
          Why don't you get rid of him and
          Get yourself straight dealer?

                     JOYCE
          Well sure, neighbor, easy to say.

INT - FARO TABLE - DAY

As Wyatt walks up Tyler starts snarling at one of the players:

                     TYLER
          You back that Queen again, you
          Son of a bitch, I'll blow you 
          Right out of that chair!
               (looks up, sees Wyatt)
          Somethin' on your mind?

                     WYATT
          Just wanted to let you know
          You're sitting in my chair.

                     TYLER
          That a fact?

                     WYATT
          Yeah.  It's a fact.

Tyler looks Wyatt over, noting he is unarmed.  He stands, 
sneering:

                     TYLER
          For a man that don't go heeled
          You run your mouth kinda reckless.

                     WYATT
          Don't need to go heeled to get
          The bulge on a dub like you.

                     TYLER
          That a fact?

                     WYATT
          Yeah.  It's a fact.

                     TYLER
          Well I'm real scared.


                     WYATT
          Damn right you're scared.  I can 
          See it in your eyes.

Wyatt steps forward suddenly, eyes cold and hard like a shark.  
Suddenly realizing he's in way over his head.  Tyler shrinks 
back reflexively, his hand moving toward his gun.  The other 
players scatter.  Wyatt nods, his voice calm and steady:

                     WYATT
          Go ahead.  Skin it.  Skin that
          Smoke wagon and see what happens.

                     TYLER
          Listen Mister, I'm getting' tired-

Wyatt abruptly SLAPS his face, making his teeth clack 
together.

                     WYATT
          I'm getting tired of your gas.
          Jerk that pistol and go to work.

Tyler goes pale, all pretense of courage gone.  Wyatt slaps 
him again.

                     WYATT
          I said throw down, boy.

Another slap.  Tyler stays frozen, blood dripping down his 
chin.

                     WYATT
          You gonna do something or just
          Stand there and bleed?

Tyler's done.  Wyatt plucks his gun away, handing it to Joyce.

                     WYATT
          No, I didn't think so.  Here,
          Milt.  Keepsake, hang it over the
          Bar.  All right, youngster.  Out
          You go...

Wyatt takes Tyler by the ear, dragging him across the room 
like an unruly child.  At the door he gives the ear a twist.

                     WYATT
          And don't come back.  Ever.

Tyler winces.  Wyatt shoves him out into the street then turns 
to Joyce casually:

                     WYATT
          See how easy that was?

EXT - CORNER OF ALLEN & 5TH STREET (STAGECOACH) - DAY

Later.  Wyatt walks up to his brothers at the corner.


                     WYATT
          Well we're off and running.  Just 
          Acquired us a quarter-interest in
          The game at the Oriental.

                     VIRGIL
          Acquired?

                     WYATT
          So to speak.

Down the block, unseen by the Earps, a wild-eyed Tyler is 
advancing on them with a sawed-off shotgun.  He is within 20 
feet when suddenly:

                     O.S. VOICE
          Why Johnny Tyler, you madcap,
          Where are you going with that
          Shotgun?

Tyler spins around to see Doc standing in a doorway, smiling.  
Tyler freezes.

                     TYLER
          Doc.  I didn't know you were in town.

Wyatt spots Doc and walks up, brothers in tow.  Though they 
don't so much as shake hands, we sense a strong bond between 
the 2 men.

                     WYATT
          Doc!  How the hell are you?

                     DOC
          Perfect, Wyatt.  Simply perfect.

                     TYLER
          Wyatt?  Wyatt Earp?

                     MORGAN
          Going into business for
          Ourselves.  Wyatt just got us a 
          Faro game.

                     DOC
          Since when is faro a business?

                     WYATT
          Didn't you always say gambling's 
          An honest trade?

                     DOC
          I said poker's an honest trade.
          Only suckers buck the tiger.  The
          Odds are all with the house.

                     WYATT
          Depends how you look at it.  I
          Mean it's not like anybody's
          Holding a gun to their heads.

                     DOC
          That's what I love about Wyatt.
          He can talk himself into anything.

They laugh.  Frozen there.  Tyler begins to tremble.  Finally:

                     DOC
          Oh sorry, Johnny, I forgot all
          About you.  You can go now.  Just 
          Leave the shotgun.

                     TYLER
          Thank you.

Tyler scuttles off as Behan approaches affably.  Doc sniffs.

                     WYATT
          Sheriff Behan, Doc Holliday.

                     DOC
          Forgive me if I don't shake hands.

                     BEHAN
          So how's Tombstone treating you?

                     WYATT
          Fine, fine.  But I was thinkin',
          You know what this town really
          Needs is a race track.

                     BEHAN
          Actually, you know, that's not a 
          Bad idea, send a signal we're
          Growing up.

                     DOC
          Little ahead of yourselves,
          Aren't you?  This is just a mining
          Camp.

                     BEHAN
          See how everyone dresses?  Awfully
          Toney for a mining camp.  No, the
          Die's cast, we're growing, be as
          Big as San Francisco in a few 
          Years.  And just as sophisticated.

                     DOC
          I can hardly wait.

As if on cue, a bullet WHIZZES past Behan's head.  Everyone 
ducks.  More GUNFIRE as a man holding a bloody hand to his 
throat reels out the door of the nearby Crystal Palace, his 
gun firing wildly like a sputtering engine before he pitches 
face first onto the sidewalk, dead.  Immediately 2 more men 
appear: a staggering DRUNK with a bullet hole in his shoulder; 
and TURKEY CREEK JACK JOHNSON, a leathery plainsman with his 
gun at the ready.  A crowd forms as the drunk raises his 
pistol, bellowing.

                     DRUNK
          You son of a bitch!

                     JOHNSON
          That's right, keep comin', keep comin'...

                     DOC
               (turns to Behan)
          Very cosmopolitan.

                     WYATT
          I know him.  That's Creek Johnson.

Suddenly a 3rd man, TEXAS JACK VERMILLION, long-haired, hawk-
nosed, appears, pistol at the ready, keeping bystanders at 
bay.

                     VERMILLION
          Easy, gents. Private affair...
               (spots Wyatt)
          Wyatt! Doc! Hey!

                     WYATT
          Jack...

                     DRUNK
          You bastard!

The drunk now has raised his gun to where it's almost level 
and:

                     JOHNSON
          Yeah, good.  Right about there.

Johnson FIRES.  The drunk drops in a heap.  Johnson spots 
Wyatt:

                     JOHNSON
          Hello, Wyatt!  Hiya Doc!

                     WYATT
          What was that all about?

                     VERMILLION
          Drunks.  Crawfished a bet, called 
          Him a liar.  I saw the whole thing.

                     DOC
               (turns to Behan)
          Sheriff, may I present a pair of
          Fellow sophisticates, Turkey
          Creek Jack Johnson and Texas Jack
          Vermillion?  Watch your ear, Creek.

Doc points to his bloody ear.  Johnson touches it, sees the 
blood, gives a silent start.  Just then White arrives, looking 
weary, facing Johnson and Vermillion.

                     WHITE
          'Fraid I'll have to have those guns.

                     JOHNSON
          Fair fight.  We were legal.

                     WHITE
          Sorry, boys.  Gotta take you 
          Before Judge Spicer.

                     VERMILLION
          Well law and order every time,
          That's us.

They hand over their guns while Virgil looks at the 2 dead men 
lying in the street, shaking his head:

                     VIRGIL
          What kinda town is this?

                     VERMILLION
          Nice scenery.

They look.  A stagecoach stops in the street.  JOSEPHINE 
MARCUS looks out the window, her little white dog under her 
chin.  She and Wyatt spot each other instantly, both 
impressed.

                     BEHAN
          That must be the theatrical 
          Troupe.  There's a show tonight at
          Schieffelin Hall.

                     JOHNSON
          Hey, Wyatt, you goin' to the
          Show?  Maybe we'll see you there.
               (turns to White)
          Won't we.

                     WHITE
          Yeah, probably.

White leads them off to jail.  Wyatt and Josephine hold each 
other's gaze as the coach drives on.  Doc smiles:

                     DOC
          Well, an enchanted moment

EXT - GRAND HOTEL (STAGECOACH) - DAY

Pony Deal and McMasters watch as the actors exit the coach for 
the hotel.  Josephine turns to the pretty 1st actress:

                     JOSEPHINE
          Interesting little scene.  I 
          Wonder who that tall man was.


                     1ST ACTRESS
          Typical frontier type.  Long and
          Lean.  And those gray eyes.  Like a 
          Wild hawk.  You see quite a few of
          His type out here.

                     JOSEPHINE
          Oh, I want one.

INT - LOBBY, GRAND HOTEL - DAY

The actors enter, going to the desk while Josephine looks for 
a place to sit.  A fat, well-dressed easterner with a 
newspaper sits nearby, ignoring her.  Seeing this from 
outside, McMasters instantly barges into the lobby, hoists the 
easterner out of his chair, and hurls him bodily out into the 
street.  Josephine nods her surprised thanks.  McMasters tips 
his hat shyly, exits as the 1st actress returns with her key.  
They exchange looks....

INT - SHIEFFELIN HALL - NIGHT

A full house, pandemonium.  Curly Bill, Ringo and their Cowboy 
entourage form a block in the center 
Rows while BILLY BREKENRIDGE, Behan's bespectacled, slightly 
effeminate little Deputy makes his timid way down the aisle, 
looking for a seat midst the off fist-fight and yelling match.  
2 cocky young Cowboys, BILLY GROUNDS and ZWING HUNT, call out 
to him:

                     HUNT
          Hey, Sister Boy!

                     CURLY BILL
          Shut up, Zwing.  Sit here, Billy.

Curly Bill beckons.  Happy as a lark, Breakenridge takes the 
seat next to him.  Up above, the Earps sit in a box, the women 
thrilled:

                     ALLIE
          This is so much fun!  We haven't
          Been to a show since years.

                     MATTIE
          I hope they're good.

                     STILLWELL
               (shouting from below)
          Lady, they better be good.

Doc enters, Kate on his arm.  The  women exchange uneasy nods.

                     DOC
          Kate, you know the Earps.

They sit as White enters with Mayor JOHN CLUM and wife.

                     WHITE
          Wyatt, this is Mayor Clum and his wife.



                     CLUM
          Your reputation precedes you.  I wonder -

                     WYATT
          Not a prayer.  Nice meetin' you.

While the orchestra tunes up and the crowd's excitement rises, 
White sits next to Wyatt, pointing out the different Cowboys 
and giving a thumbnail sketch of each as we PAN over them:

                     WHITE
          Well everybody's here except the
          Old Man.  Got the blade, Billy
          Grounds, Zwing Hunt, Billy
          Claiborne, Wes Fuller, Tom and
          Frank McLaury, Billy Clanton's 
          The youngest.  Wild one.  Then the
          Breeds, Hank Swilling, Pony Deal.
          Florentino's Mex-breed.  They all
          Hate Mex, but he hates 'em
          Special.  Johnny Barnes, Frank 
          Stillwell.  That's Behan's little
          Deputy, Billy Breakenridge.
          Follows the Cowboys around like a 
          Puppy.  And the big boys: Curly
          Bill Brocius, he's the Old Man's
          Rimrod; the one looks like an
          Actor, that's Johnny Ringo.  Best
          Gun alive they say.  He's kinda
          Different.  Curly Bill's the only
          One he talks to.  I mean they're 
          All rough boys, but Ringo... I
          Don't know.  I really don't

Music.  The house lights dim.  The audience hushes.  A 
spotlight hits easel at the end of the stage: "Professor 
Gillman and His Ballet of Gravity."  Out in the audience, 
Barnes groans:

                     BARNES
          Professor Gilllman?  Oh hell, I
          Seen him in Bisbee.  He catches stuff.

The curtain goes up.  PROFESSOR GILLMAN, a 3rd rate juggler in 
white tie, tailcoat, and black tights steps out and starts 
tossing Indian clubs in the air.  The audience starts groaning 
but the Professor's rictus-like smile never changes.  Having 
seen enough, Frank Stillwell stands up and shouts:

                     STILLWELL
          Hey profesor!  Catch this!

Stillwell raises his pistol and FIRES.  An Indian club 
explodes in the Professor's hand.  Screams and scattered 
laughter in the audience.  The Professor is frozen in utter 
shock, staring at the bullet graze on his hand and saying out 
loud:

                     GILLMAN
          They shot me!  I don't believe it!

A chord of music and the curtain drops like stone.  
Applause....

EXT - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

The other acotrs hustle the Professor off the stage, appalled.  
The 1st Actress turns to MR. FABIAN, a handsome, slightly 
raffish classical tragedian.

                     1ST ACTRESS
          My God, they're shooting at us!
          They're actually shooting at us!
          What'll we do?

                     FABIAN
          Only thing we can do, dear-be
          Good.  In any event, at least we
          Won't have to wait for our 
          Notices.  Exciting, isn't it?  Now 
          This is theater!

INT - SHIEFFELIN HALL - NIGHT

More music and another card reads: "Selections From the Bard 
of Mr. Romulus Fabian, Tragedian in Excelsis."  The curtain 
rises and Fabian steps out, a purple velvet cloak wrapped 
resplendently about him like a toga.  In the audience, Curly 
Bill's mouth drops:

                     CURLY BILL
          Prettiest man I ever saw

Fabian throws open his cloak, revealing his lithe form in 
doublet and tights.  The whores in the gallery hoot and cheer.  
Fabian bows.

                     STILLWELL
          How come he ain't wearin' no pants?

                     BARNES
               (points to whores)
          That's how come.

                     FABIAN
          Ladies and gentlemen, the St
          Crispin's Day Speech from Henry V.
          To set the Scene, England is
          Now at war with France. 
          Everything rests upon the battle
          About to begin.  Henry, the young
          King of England, addresses his men
          Thusly: "My cousin Westmorland?
          No, my fair cousin-"

Another GUNSHOT and a bullet SPANGS into the column next to 
Fabian with a shower of plaster.  Without missing a beat, 
Fabian casually flicks a chunk off his shoulder and continues:

                     FABIAN
          "If we are marked to die, we are
          enow/ To do our country loss; and
          if to live./ The fewer me, the
          greater the share of honour..."

In the audience Barnes holsters his smoke pistol reflectively.

                     BARNES
          He's got nerve, I'll say that.
          What do you think, Billy?

Starry-eyed, Breakenridge answers without thinking:

                     BREAKENRIDGE
          Oh, he wonderful!

          Uh-oh, looks like somebody's in love.

Raw laughter from the others.  Breakenridge sinks in his seat.

                     CURLY BILL
          Let him alone.

On stage Fabian is in full cry, giving the local a slice of 
the ripest ham:

                     FABIAN
          "We few, we happy few, we band of
          brothers;/ For he today that
          sheds his blood with me/ Shall be
          my brother; be he ne'er so vile./
          This day shall gentle his 
          Condition;/ And gentlemen in
          England now a-bed/ Shall think
          Themselves accurs'd they were no
          Here./ And hold their manhood
          Cheap whiles any speaks/ That
          Fought with us upon Saint
          Crispin's day!"

Wild applause and cheering.  Fabian bows with elaborate 
modesty.

                     CURLY BILL
          That's great!  That's our kinda stuff!

The curtain falls.  Another card: "Faust - or the Devil's 
Bargain" and the orchestra whirls into "Danse Macabre" by 
Saint-Saens, the rising curtain revealing a wild pained 
backdrop, all black and red, covered with weird, Beardsley-
esque designs and images of death and damnation.  A light 
comes up, revealing an ancient white-bearded scholar sitting 
alone with his books.  Then a hooded Satan dances across the 
stage, slender and lissome in paned black doublet and breeches 
and black hose, tempting the old man with images of wealth and 
youth in the form of a shimmering blonde ballerina.  The old 
man succumbs, signing Satan's contract.  The audience watches 
in rapt attention, especially the Cowboys:

                     STILLWELL
          He's gonna some up short on that one.

                     CURLY BILL
          Know what I'd do?  I'd take the
          Deal then crawfish and drill that
          Ol' Devil in the ass.  How 'bout 
          You, Johnny?  What would you do?

                     RINGO
          I already did it.

Satan makes a flourish.  A flash-pad EXPLOSION transforms the 
old scholar into a young student.  The ballerina flits by.  
The student offers her gold.  They dance, swirling about the 
stage in a mad waltz with Satan hovering behind them, 
mirroring their every move like a puppet master.  Finally, 
having gotten all his gold, the Ballerina drifts away leaving 
the young student alone, lost in bitterness as he changes back 
into the old scholar sitting with his books.  Satan appears 
over him, exultant and triumphant, ready to collect the debt 
as the curtain falls with a final crashing chord.  Thunderous 
cheering and applause.  The curtain rises again and the 
performers come out for bows, all except Satan.

                     DOC
          Very instructive

                     WYATT
          But who was the Devil?

Suddenly Satan bounds out, removing the hood.  It's Josephine.

                     MORGAN
          It's that woman from the coach!

                     WYATT
          I'll be damned...

Josephine spots Wyatt's box and smiles.  Doc raises an 
eyebrow:

          You may indeed.  If you get lucky.

EXT - ALLEN STREET - NIGHT

After the show and theatergoers, including the Earps, stroll 
homeward arm-in-arm down Allen, all looking up at the clear 
night sky above.  At the Oriental Wyatt stops, turning to 
Virgil:

                     WYATT
          Comin' to the Oriental, Virge?

                     ALLIE
          Not tonight! Tonight me and my
          Old man're gonna have some fun.
          Get moving, old man!

She laughs, shoving Virgil down the street.  He looks at 
Wyatt:

                     VIRGIL
          Her maiden name was Sullivan.

                     WYATT
               (kisses Mattie)
          Better go with 'em, honey.  Here's
          Where I leave you.

                     MATTIE
               (grabs his hand)
          No, stay.  Please stay with me.

                     WYATT
          Honey, I gotta start makin' money.

                     MATTIE
          Oh, all right.

                     WYATT
          Well I guess I don't have to go 
          Right now.  I guess I could stay a little while.

                     MATTIE
          No, no, I don't want to keep you.

                     WYATT
          No really, I can stay a while.

                     MATTIE
          Just go.  It's all right.  Wyatt, 
          Really.  Work well.

                     WYATT
          All right, well, good night.

Another kiss and he heads for the Oriental with Morgan.  
Mattie walks on after the others, fishing through her bag for 
her bottle of laudanum....

DELETED

INT - ORIENTAL - NIGHT

The saloon is packed.  TRACK along the bar at floor level past 
a wild array of high-button shoes, patent leather pumps, and 
stack-heeled boots with jingling silver spurs.  Track again at 
shoulder level past an equally wild array of slouch hats, 
pork-pies, derbys, and wide-brim sombreros.  Wyatt sits 
against the wall, dealing faro with Doc at his side, Morgan on 
lookout while a sweaty overdressed HIGH ROLLER makes bets, 
gnashing his teeth and drumming his fingers n a fever of 
impatient greed:


                     HIGH ROLLER
          All right, I'm on fire!  Black
          Seven, seven stickin' spades.

          You are on fire.

          sad news, friend.

                     HIGH ROLLER
          Damn!  All right, wait a minute...

The high roller lays a set of deeds out on the table as....

INT - ORIENTAL - NIGHT

A break in the game.  Wyatt studies the deeds as Morgan and 
Doc look on.  Kate sits to one side, blowing smoke rings 
contentedly.

                     WYATT
          So now we're in the mining 
          Business.  Turning into regular
          Tycoons.  Gonna call this one the
          Mattie Blaylock.  Mattie'll get a

          Just his style, Morg.  Doesn't
          Mean anything.

                     DOC
          So tell me, Wyatt.  I'm curious.
          Do you actually consider youself
          A married man?  Forsaking all
          Others?

                     WYATT
          Well yeah.  Pretty much.  I mean I
          Was no angel when we met but
          People change Doc.  I mean sooner
          Or later you gotta grow up.

          I see.  And what would you do if
          "she" walked in her right now?

          "She"?

          You know damn well who I mean.
          That dusky-hued lady Satan.

                     WYATT
          I don't know.  Probably ignore her.

                     DOC
          Ignore her?

                     WYATT
          I'd ignore her.  People can 
          Change, Doc.

                     DOC
          I'll remember you said that.

Doc point.  Josephine has just walked in with the other 
actors.

                     WYATT
          Oh, hell...

She spots Wyatt and starts toward him but he looks away, as if 
ignoring her.  She stops.  Behan steps up to her, tipping his 
hat, very gallant.  They move toward the bar.  Wyatt turns to 
Doc.

                     WYATT
          Satisfied?

                     DOC
          I stand corrected.  Wyatt.  You're
          An oak.

Josephine and Behan chat at the bar.  White nudges Joyce:

                     WHITE
          Since when'd you start servin'
          Ladies in here?

                     JOYCE
          Actresses.  It's different.

Mr Fabian enters, dramatically gotten-up like Lord Byron.  The 
whole bar bursts into applause.  He bows.  Breakenridge jumps 
up from his table, excited:

                     BREAKENRIDGE
          Here, Mr Fabian, have this table.

He seats Fabian near the faro game, gets him some champagne.

                     FABIAN
          Oh, thank you.  You're very kind.


                     BREAKENRIDGE
          Mr. Fabian, I've got to tell you, 
          That's the most wonderful thing I 
          Ever saw.  What was that?

                     FABIAN
          Henry's all right but he's no
          Match for the Melancholy Dane.

          Hamlet, dear friend, the supreme
          Role of any actor worth his salt.

                     WYATT
          Getting drunk, Doc.

Doc chuckles.  Suddenly Curly Bill looms over the faro table 
with Ringo and a drunken Ike Clanton.

                     CURLY BILL
          Wyatt Earp, huh?  I heard of you.

                     IKE
          Listen, Mr. Kansas Law-dog.  Law
          Don't go around her.  Savvy?

          I'm retired.

                     CURLY BILL
          Good.  That's real good.

                     IKE
          Yeah, that's good, Mr. Law-dog, 
          'cause law don't go around here.

                     WYATT
          I heard you the first time.

                     CURLY BILL
          Shut up, Ike.

                     RINGO
               (steps up to Doc)
          And you must be Doc Holliday.

          And you must be Ringo.  Look,
          Darling, Johnny Ringo.  The
          Deadliest pistoleer since Wild
          Bill, they say.  What do you 
          Think, darling?  Should I hate him?

                     KATE
          You don't even know him.

          Yes, but there's just something
          About him.  Something around
          The eyes, I don't know, reminds me
          Of... me.  No.  I'm sure of it, I
          Hate him.

          Evidently Mr. Ringo's an educated
          Man.  Now I really hate him.

Ringo looks at Doc, holding his gaze while suddenly whipping 
out his .45.  Everyone but Doc flinches.  Ringo does a 
dazzling series of twirls and tricks, his nickel-plated pistol 
flashing like a blaze of silver fire, finally slapping it back 
into his holster with a flourish.  Cheers and hoots.  Doc 
rolls his eyes, hooks a finger through the handle of his 
silver cup, then launches into an exact duplication of Ringo's 
routine using a cup instead of a gun.  The room bursts into 
laughter.  Doc shrugs.  Ringo lets a strange little hint of a 
smile cross his face then exits with the others.  White 
exhales, turns to Wyatt:

                     WHITE
          See what I mean about it getting
          Spooky?

                     WYATT
          Curly Bill, huh?  Who was that 
          Other idiot?

                     WHITE
          Ike Clanton, Old Man's eldest
          Son.  Know he ain't got the stuff,
          Makes him miserable.

                     WYATT
          Yeah, and dangerous.

Sitting up on the bar to see the show, Josephine turns to 
Behan:

                     JOSEPHINE
          The man dealing faro.  Who is he?

                     BEHAN
          That's Wyatt Earp.  Made quite a 
          Name for himself as a peace
          Officer in Kansas.

                     JOSEPHINE
          A peace officer... Impressive man

                     BEHAN
          Yes, very.  And very married.

                     JOSEPHINE
          Oh, so that's it...

EXT - ALLEN STREET/ORIENTAL - NIGHT

Curly Bill steps out with Ike and Ringo.  He looks around.

                     CURLY BILL
          I feel like doin' somethin'.
          Getting woolly.

          Hey, Chinky!  Come here a minute...

An old Chinaman minces by.  Curly Bill dashes after him...

BACK & FORTH INT/EXT - ORIENTAL / ALLEN STREET - NIGHT

Later.  Doc is at the piano, drunk as a lord but playing 
Chopin flawlessly.  Kate pours him another drink.

                     KATE
          That's my lovin' man.  Just can't

          Enough?  Never.

Now the High-Roller comes reeling up, loud and gratingly 
drunk.

                     HIGH ROLLER
          Hey, is that "Old Dog Tray"?
          Sounds like "Old Dog Tray".

          A which?

                     DOC
          You know, Frederic-fucking-Chopin.

Doc plays on.  Josephine leaves with Behan.  Morgan sighs:

                     MORGAN
          Now that wounds me.  Little tin
          Swain walkin' off with that black
          Beauty.  I mean I'm a married man
          And all but still, it ain't right.

Wyatt grunts and nods, perturbed.  Outside the others mount up 
but Curly Bill stands drugged-up in the middle of the street, 
arms out, head back, eyes closed, luxuriating in the 
moonlight.

                     CURLY BILL
          Boy, I feel great!  Full of that
          Hop I got from Chinky.  I feel 
          Just capitol!  You boys go ahead.
          I'm gonna stick around awhile,
          Howl at the moon.

The others shrug and ride off.  Curly Bill pulls his pistol, 
spinning it.  Back inside the Oriental it's late, few patrons 
remain.  A few beats then suddenly everyone jumps as GUNSHOTS 
echo from outside.  White goes to the window, looks outside:

                     WHITE
          Curly Bill.  He's over across the
          Street shootin' out the lights.

                     CLUM
          This is great, this is just great.

Just then Behan dashes in, white as a sheet, Josephine in tow:

                     BEHAN
          Have you been out in the street?
          Somebody's got to do something.

                     CLUM
          You're the Sheriff.

                     BEHAN
          It's not County business, it's a 
          Town matter.

Outside Curly Bill starts taking potshots at a passerby's 
feet, making him dance down the street and scurry for cover.  
Curly Bill cackles.  Inside White turns uneasily to Wyatt:

                     WYATT
          Why don't you just leave it alone?

                     WHITE
          No, I gotta do something.  I don't 
          Suppose you'd card-

                     WYATT
          None of my business, Fred.

Wyatt keeps dealing, Doc keeps playing.  White draws himself 
up and exits.  Outside, Curly Bill reloads and keeps shooting.  
White steps out into the street.  We feel a sense of inverted 
terror as he draws his gun and we SEE that his hand is 
trembling.  He crosses the street, coming up behind Curly 
Bill:

                     WHITE
          Hey, Curly?  Come on now, boy...

Curly Bill spins around.  White's gun stares him in the face.

                     CURLY BILL
          Well, howdy, Fred!

Back in the bar, Wyatt puts his cards down, looks over at Doc.

                     WYATT
          Maybe I ought to go out there.

                     DOC
          You will or you won't.  Don't look
          To me.  I'm going to sleep.

Doc lays his head down on the keys, passes out.  Wyatt frowns 
for a moment.  Finally he stands, turning to Morgan:

                     WYATT
          Go wake up Virgil.
               (turns to Joyce)
          Hey Milt, lend me a sidearm, will you?

Joyce hands him a Colt from under the bar.  Outside White 
covers Curly Bill, trembling harder now.  An adrenaline rush 
in a man White's age is hard to look at, he seems so frail, so 
vulnerable.  Even his voice has a quavering edge to it:

                     WHITE
          Hand that over.  Come on now.

                     CURLY BILL
          Why sure, dad.  I'm only in fun.
          Here she is.

With a reassuring smile, Curly Bill holds his pistol out butt-
first.  White reaches for it, visibly relieved.  But quick as 
a snake's tongue Curly Bill spins it around and FIRES POINT 
BLANK into White's chest, blowing him over backward, the blast 
so close it sets his clothes on fire.   Curly Bill turns just 
as Wyatt flashes into frame and SLAMS him over the head with 
his pistol barrel, laying him out in a groaning heap.  Wyatt 
glances at White lying semi-conscious in the street, chest 
heaving, eyelids fluttering, making weak little bird-like 
sounds, smoke rising from his smoldering shirt and vest.  Clum 
runs up:

                     WYATT
          Put his clothes out.

Clum pats the embers out in White's clothes but as Wyatt 
starts to haul Curly Bill up he suddenly finds himself 
surrounded by Ike, Billy Clanton, and six other Cowboys.

                     IKE
          Turn loose of him.

                     WYATT
          He just killed a man.

                     BILLY
          He said to turn loose of him.

                     WYATT
          Well I'm not so go home.

                     IKE
          Swear to God, Mister, step aside
          Or we'll tear you apart.

The Cowboys tense up, ready for action.  Wyatt holds his 
ground, his hard, steady gaze zeroing in on Ike:

                     WYATT
          You.  Come here a second.

Ike steps up, full of brass.  Without warning Wyatt jabs the 
muzzle of his pistol into his forehead, snapping his head 
back.  Wyatt cocks the pistol.  The other Cowboys hush.  Ike 
freezes.  Wyatt's eyes bore into him.

                     WYATT
          You die first, get it?  The others 
          Might get me in a rush but before
          That I'm gonna make your head
          Into a canoe.  Understand?

Ike stands stock still.  Billy steps forward, undaunted:

                     BILLY
          He's bluffin'!  Let's rush him!

This is it.  The Cowboys poise themselves, ready to start, 
but:

                     O.S. VOICE
          And you, you simpleton, you're next.

Again a hush.  Doc stands behind Wyatt, still drunk, but with 
his .38 trained on Billy.  Billy sneers:

                     BILLY
          Hell, he can't hit nothin'.  He's 
          So drunk he's probably seein'
          Double.

Doc pulls out his .45, training it, too, on Billy:

                     DOC
          I have two guns.  One for each of you.

Billy pauses, chastened.  Suddenly there's another commotion 
as Virgil and Morgan bull their way through the crowd from 
behind with shotguns.

                     VIRGIL
          All right, look out!  Break it up.
          Go home, all of you, go home now...

This breads the group's will and things suddenly calm down 
dramatically as the Cowboys disperse.  Wyatt lowers his 
pistol, heaving a sigh of relief as he pulls the still-groggy 
Curly Bill to his feet and hauls him reeling toward the jail.

                     WYATT
          Come on, you...

                     CURLY BILL
          Crack me back of the head like
          Some stinkin' bull.  Hell, you
          Ain't no fightin' man, you're
          Just a cop.

EXT - JAIL/ALLEN STREET/HOTEL - NIGHT

Later.  As the Earps and Doc step out on the sidewalk we can 
see the semi-conscious Curly Bill through the front door of 
the jail laying in one of the cells, holding a bloody kerchief 
to his head.  Wyatt closes the door, locks it, gives Clum the 
keys.

                     WYATT
          There.  He'll keep till morning

The street is quiet as they start back toward the Oriental.  
Virgil and Morgan following at a discreet distance, smirking:

                     VIRGIL
          Keep your eye on that brass ring.
          Don't let anything side-track you.

                     WYATT
          I know, I need a keeper.

Meanwhile across the street at the hotel Josephine turns to 
Behan.

                     BEHAN
          Well I guess you can see, never a 
          Dull moment.  Maybe you should
          Stay around to see what happens
          Next.  Who know?  You might find a
          Future here.

                     JOSEPHINE
          Maybe even my destiny.

INT - ORIENTAL - DAY

Morgan's hound sleeps in the corner while Virgil and Morgan 
shoot pool.  Wyatt looking on.

                     WYATT
          ...but he says did I actually see
          it happen and I said, no, when I
          arrived Fred'd already been shot.
          So the judge said, can't have a
          Murder without a witness-case
          Dismissed.  Can you beat it?  After
          All that.  Oh hell, who cares,
          None of my business anyways.

Clum enters, frowning and anxious, just as Morgan sinks a 
shot.

                     MORGAN
          Boy, I love this game.  When we're
          Finally set we gotta each have a
          Billiard room in our houses.

                     CLUM
          Excuse me, Wyatt, just a moment,
          Please, I wanted to try and 
          Reason with you.  We still haven't
          Found a Marshal and-

                     VIRGIL
          Come on Mayor, he already told
          You no.

                     CLUM
          What about you?  You were a lawman.

                     VIRGIL
          I'm busy.  We're all busy.  Sorry,
          Mayor, but you're really barkin'
          Up the wrong tree.

                     WYATT
          You tell 'em, Virge.

Clum exits shaking his head.  They keep playing.  After a 
beat:

                     WYATT
          You know, I was thinkin', maybe
          We ought to open our own place.
          That's the real money.  Build it
          Up, milk it for all it's worth,
          Then sell it off for a bundle and
          Breeze out of this burg with more
          Money than Croesus and ready to
          Live like kings.  Let's you and me
          Take a walk around town, Virge,
          See if we can scout us out a 
          Couple of nice lots.

                     VIRGIL
          I can't hardly believe it.  It's 
          Working out just like you said,
          Wyatt.  We're lootin' this burg
          Six ways through Sunday.

                     WYATT
          Pretty fun too, isn't it?

                     VIRGIL
          Kinda, actually, yeah.  I gotta admit.

EXT - COTTAGE ON EDGE OF TOWN - DAY

Virgil and Wyatt walk down a quiet, tree-shaded lane on the 
outskirts of town.  Suddenly a rubber ball rolls into their 
path.  A small BOY plays in the front yard of a nearby 
cottage.  Virgil and Wyatt approach, Virgil returning the 
ball:

                     VIRGIL
          What're you up to today, son?

The boy stands stock still, staring at the men in silence.

                     WYATT
          Cat got your tongue?

He turns and walks back to the street without another word.

                     WYATT
          Wait a minute, Virgil!  Where you goin'?

Virgil keeps going.  Wyatt starts after him, leaving mother 
and child in confusion as....

INT - VIRGIL'S PARLOR - DAY

In tight on a gleaming silver shield, "Town Marshal, 
Tombstone, A.T."  PULL BACK to reveal it pinned to Virgil's 
breast.  He sits by his parlor hearth with Morgan at his side.  
Wyatt sits opposite with his head in his hands.

                     VIRGIL
          I couldn't help it, Wyatt.  I 
          Looked at that woman and it was
          Just like somebody slapping me in
          The face.  I mean these people're
          Afraid to even walk down the 
          Street and I'm trying to make
          Money off it like some kind of
          God damn vulture.  That's not me,
          That's somebody I don't even know.

                     WYATT
          Virgil, please.  Don't do this to me.

                     VIRGIL
          It's got nothin' to do with you, 
          Wyatt.  It's-

                     WYATT
          Nothing to do with me?  I'm your 
          Brother for Christ's sake.  God, I
          Don't believe this.
               (turns to Morgan)
          Talk to him, will you?  Or hit him.
               (no answer, pauses)
          Oh no, don't tell me...

Morgan looks down in sheepish silence.  Then he pulls back his 
coat, revealing the Deputy's badge on this vest.  Wyatt 
groans.

                     MORGAN
          Like you said, Wyatt.  We're
          Brothers.  Gotta back your
          Brother's play.  Just did like I
          Figured you would.


                     WYATT
          Listen to me, both of you.  This 
          Is no good.  This is trouble we
          Don't need.  For the first time in
          Our lives we got a chance to stop
          Wandering and finally be a
          Family.  Do this and you throw it
          All away.  You saw what happened
          To Fred White.

                     MORGAN
          Come on, we're not about pickin'
          Fights.  Just gonna keep a little
          Order, that's all.

                     WYATT
          Yeah?

                     MORGAN
          Like you said, just gotta know
          How to handle 'em.  Old Fred
          Wasn't up to it.  We know that
          We're doin', Wyatt.

                     WYATT
          All right, say you're right, say
          You don't get yourself killed.
          There's something else.
               (turns to Morgan)
          It's too late for Virge, he
          Already rolled his bone.  But it's 
          Not too late for you, Morg.

                     MORGAN
          What're you talkin' about?

Wyatt exhales wearily then crouches down in front of his baby 
brother, looking deep in his eyes, his voice soft, plaintive:

                     WYATT
          All the years I worked the
          Cowtowns, I was only ever mixed 
          Up in one shooting.  Just one.  A
          Man got killed.  Wasn't my fault,
          Just doin' my job.  I don't even 
          Know if it was my bullet that
          Dropped him, but... I don't kno,
          It's sort of hard to explain.  At
          First I just felt funny, you
          Know, kind of clammy inside.  But
          When it finally sunk in what I'd 
          Done... Believe me, boy, you
          Don't ever want to feel that way.
          Not ever.
               (pauses)
          Didn't even make a dent, did I?
               (stands, exits)
          You're both makin' a big mistake.

EXT - DESERT, HOOKER RANCH - DAY

Armed with a borrowed pistol and carbine, Wyatt gallops 
through the desert on one of his other big blacks, eyes 
scanning the tracks beneath him.  He rides up and stops at a 
well near a large ranch house.  He dismounts, studying tracks 
as rancher HENRY HOOKER rides up, strong, noble-looking, like 
something from a Frederic Remington canvas.  Wyatt nods.  
Hooker nods back.

                     WYATT
          This Hooker's ranch?

                     HOOKER
          That's right.  And I'm Hooker.

                     WYATT
          You seen anything of a man on
          Horseback leading a black
          Stallion?

Hooker suddenly falls silent, looking at the ground nervously.

                     WYATT
          Well you must've seen somethin',
          The trail runs right by your 
          Waterhole.
               (no answer)
          Oh, I see.  So it must've been a
          Cowboy, right?  Really got you
          People treed, don't they?

                     HOOKER
          Look, Mister, it's fine for you
          Boomers to court trouble, you're
          Just passin' through.  Us
          Cattlemen gotta live here.  Best I
          Can do's point you up to the cut.
          That's their roost.

Wyatt nods his thanks.  Hooker looks down, ashamed.  Wyatt 
stares at him a moment.  There's something genuinely troubling 
about so strong a man living in fear.  Wyatt rides on, shaking 
his head....

INT - DESERT CAMP - DAY

A small camp near a clump of trees.  Pony Deal brews coffee 
while McMasters leans against a fallen oak log feeding an 
eager pack of mongrel pups from a block of jerky as Wyatt 
rides up.

                     MCMASTERS
          Run for your lives, boys!  It's
          That great two-gun dog-catcher
          From Kansas!

                     WYATT
          McMasters, isn't it?  Listen, you
          Seen a black stallion with-

                     MCMASTERS
          Look, I got a rule.  I don't talk
          To lawmen.  Dog-catchers neither.

                     WYATT
          I'm not a lawman, I'm just a 
          Private citizen getting' my 
          Property back

                     MCMASTERS
          Well in that case, I saw your
          Horse.  Billy Clanton was takin'
          Him up to the Cut to show him 
          Off.  The boys're all up there
          Right now, branding.  And in a 
          Mood.  Still want your property
          Back, Mr. Private Citizen?

EXT - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

Wyatt and McMasters ride along side-by-side through the hills.

                     WYATT
          So what about you Cowboys anyway?

                     MCMASTERS
          If I had to explain it you
          Wouldn't understand.  Just say
          We're brothers to the bone.

                     WYATT
          Yeah, but some of the things they
          Say your brothers've done...

                     MCMASTERS
          There's all kinds of horses,
          Ain't there?  Same with Cowboys.
          What they do's their affair.  I
          Don't preach and I don't judge.  I
          Ain't no dog-catcher.

EXT - RUSTLER'S PARK - DAY

A wide plateau in the mountains dotted with tents, water and 
fee troughs, rope corrals, etc.  Cowboys cut out steers while 
others crouch around fires, cooking, looking up with naked 
hostility as Wyatt rides up.  McMasters points to the edge of 
camp where Billy Clanton is currying Wyatt's stallion.

                     MCMASTERS
          You seem like a nice fella.  Like
          To've know you better.  Had you lived.

Wyatt rides on, making for Billy.  Ike steps up with INDIAN 
HAWK SWILLING, the giant half-breed.  They walk alongside 
Wyatt.


                     IKE
          Hey, law-dog.  The hell you doin' here?

                     SWILLING
          How 'bout I just drag you off
          That horse and eat you blood raw?

Wyatt ignores them, riding up to within 20 feet of Billy and 
dismounting.  Billy looks up, supremely confident and 
unconcerned.

                     WYATT
          Where'd you get that horse?

                     BILLY
          Beauty, ain't he?

                     WYATT
          I asked where you got him.

                     BILLY
          Where do you think?  I stole him.

Everyone laughs.  More cowboys gather, jeering.  Wyatt steps 
closer.

                     WYATT
          Look, I don't want any trouble
          With you but that's my horse and
          I mean to have him back.  One way
          Or another.

                     BILLY
          Come and get him.

                     WYATT
          Look kid, I know what it's like, 
          I was a kid, too.  Even stole a
          Horse once.  But you can't--

                     IKE
          Don't sweet-talk him, make a move.

                     SWILLING
          Yeah, go ahead, Mister.  Make a move.

Billy steps back, poised.  Ike and Swilling do the same.  3 
more Cowboys move up behind him.  The scene seems on the brink 
of explosion when Curly Bill suddenly STREAKS into frame on 
his buckskin mare, majestic and 10 times life size as he pulls 
back and SKIDS to a stop in front of Wyatt, raising a giant 
roostertail of dust, making everyone but Wyatt recoil.

                     CURLY BILL
          Give him his horse, Billy.

                     IKE
          Come on, Curly!  Don't let him-


                     CURLY BILL
          Shut up.
          Give him his horse, Billy.

Billy reluctantly hands over the leadline.  Wyatt mounts and 
rides off with Dick Nailor in tow, Curly Bill riding 
alongside.

                     CURLY BILL
          Feel bad about ol' Fred.  Just
          Can't hold back when I'm feelin'
          Woolly.  Still, feel kinda bad.
          But now we're square.  Anyway no
          Use for holdin' a grudge.  I
          Deserved a rap in the head.

                     WYATT
          Make you a deal.  My brother took
          Over the Marshal's office in
          Tombstone.  Got it in his head
          He's gonna make the place safe
          For widows and orphans.  You and
          Your boys stay out of his way,
          I'll make sure he stays out of yours.

                     CURLY BILL
          Fair enough.  You know I got to 
          Admit, you got a lot of bark on
          You comin' up here like this.

                     WYATT
          They were all gonna jump me back
          There.  What ever happened to one
          Against one?

                     CURLY BILL
          Ain't our way.  We go all on one,
          One on all.  Fight one of us, you
          Fight us all.  That's the Cowboy way.

                     WYATT
          And how come you call yourselves
          Cowboys?  Cowhands ride for the brand.

                     CURLY BILL
          Oh, we ride for a brand all right.
               (gives Wyatt the finger)
          This brand.  How 'bout you?

                     WYATT
               (points thumb at self)
          This brand.

                     CURLY BILL
          We're gonna get along just fine.

EXT - ALLEN STREET - DAY

A lazy afternoon.  The Earps and Clum lounge in front of the 
hotel.

                     CLUM
          I can't thank you enough.  Since
          You took over there hasn't been a 
          Single problem.  We're finally
          Becoming a civilized town.

                     VIRGIL
          Nothin' to it.

                     WYATT
          Maybe I jumped the gun.  Maybe
          Those Cowboys aren't near as bad
          As they're painted.  You know I
          Was thinkin', there's a lot of
          Money in the cattle business...

                     VIRGIL
          Wait a minute, you thinkin' of
          Getting in bed with the Cowboys?

                     WYATT
          Business is business.  Don't have
          To love 'em to work with 'em.  Not
          If there's money in it.

                     VIRGIL
          You are the one, Wyatt.  You sure are.

EXT - GUADALOUPE CANYON - MAGIC HOUR

Old Man Clanton leads 4 other Cowboys with a herd through the 
rocky canyon, slipping a flask and singing as the first shot 
RINGS OUT from the rocks above, becoming a FUSILLADE.  When 
the dust settles, all are dead except the Old Man who lies 
pinned under his horse, semi-conscious.  FIGURES emerge from 
the shadows.  It's the Rurales led by the same Young Rurale 
from before.  He bends down to the dazed Old Man, speaking 
carefully:

                     YOUNG RURALE
          The old one you kill.  This was my father.

                     OLD MAN CLANTON
               (sits up suddenly)
          What, and I'm supposed to
          Tremble?  Kiss my ass, Messican.

Hissing gleefully, he jams a derringer under the Young 
Rurale's chin and FIRES, blowing off his sombrero as he falls.  
The other Rurales fire, emptying their guns into the Old Man 
as if he were some monstrous rattlesnake that might bite 
them....

EXT - RUSTLER'S PARK - NIGHT

Curly Bill, Ringo, and the others are by the fire, passing a 
bottle, as Frank Still well gallops up and dismounts, 
breathless:

                     STILLWELL
          Old Man Clanton's dead!  Ambushed 
          In Guadaloupe Canyon.  Messican's
          Got him.

In tight on Curly Bill as the news sinks in.  He clenches his 
fist in rage, then bites a knuckle, getting his control back.

                     CURLY BILL
          All right, first thing's first:
          It's my outfit now, I'm runnin'
          The show.  Ringo's number two man.

                     IKE
          Your outfit?  I'm next in line.

                     CURLY BILL
          You ain't got enough in your
          Britches.  Think you can prove
          Otherwise, go ahead.

Seething with humiliation, Ike mounts up and rides off.

                     CURLY BILL
          Anybody else?

No takers.  Curly Bill turns back to business:

                     CURLY BILL
          All right.  Billy, go after Ike
          And cool him off then go find the
          McLaurys, tell 'em what happened
          And keep an eye on things.  Wes
          Fuller and Bill Claiborne, too.
          Rest of you come with me.  We're
          Goin' to Mexico.

They mount in a bunch and take off south like the wind....

EXT - DESERT - DAY

Wyatt is up on his stallion, riding along the foot of a high 
hill.  Coming to a cut, he suddenly stops.  Josephine is 100 
yards up ahead, gorgeously impressive in a black velvet riding 
habit, riding side-saddle through the cut on a pretty mare.

                     WYATT
          Oh, hell...

Looking for an escape, Wyatt turns up a narrow trail on the 
side of the cut.  He follows it as it winds around the hill 
then abruptly drops back down and comes out on the other side 
of the cut right in front of Josephine.  She waves.  He 
groans:

                     JOSEPHINE
          Well, hello.


                     WYATT
          We've never actually met.  My
          Name's-

                     JOSEPHINE
          Wyatt Earp, I know.  I was
          Beginning to think we'd never
          Meet.  This is fortuitous.  That
          Means lucky.

                     WYATT
          I know what it means.

Suddenly Wyatt's stallion groans nervously, throwing its head, 
aroused by the presence of the mare.

                     JOSEPHINE
          What is it?

                     WYATT
          Easy now... That mare's in season.

                     JOSEPHINE
          Oh...
               (calms her horse)
          Now she's starting.  How do they know?

                     WYATT
          They know.  It's the scent.  We 
          Better split 'em up.

                     JOSEPHINE
          I have a better idea, let's run
          It out of them!

Before Wyatt can stop her she's off at a full gallop.  Wyatt 
pauses, debating with himself.  Finally:

                     WYATT
          Yeah, I'm an oak all right.

He takes off at a dead run.  Catching up, the horses find 
their rhythm, breaking into a smooth gallop, flying over a jet 
black plain of volcanic ash into a rolling meadow carpeted 
with yellow desert poppies, so bright it almost hurts your 
eyes to look at them.  Coming off a rise the desert floor 
shears off into a wide crevice.  Josephine heads right at it.

                     WYATT
          You're not that crazy, are you?

                     JOSPEHINE
          Oh, yes I am!

A crack of her crop and she streaks toward it.  Wyatt grits 
his teeth and follows suit.  The sound of their hoofbeats 
stops for a long instant as they take the jump together, 
sailing through the air side-by-side, Josephine giggling like 
a little girl.  They light on the other side and gallop on....

EXT - DESERT - MAGIC HOUR

They pull up at a huge desert stone formation, a canopy of 
white sandstone with vermillion streaks swirling through it 
looming over them like a giant oyster shell.  Wyatt dismounts, 
helping Josephine.  He takes his long duster from his saddle 
and lays it on a wide, table-shaped rock for them to sit on.

                     JOSEPHINE
          That was lovely!

                     WYATT
          You know you almost got us both
          Killed back there?

                     JOSEPHINE
          Fun though, wasn't it?

                     WYATT
          You'd die for fun?

                     JOSEPHINE
          Wouldn't you?  You're laughing!  I
          Was sure you never laughed.

                     WYATT
          I laugh sometimes

                     JOSEPHINE
          Yes, but how often?  Tell me, are 
          You happy?

                     WYATT
          Am I happy?  I don't know.  Happy 
          As the next man, I guess.  I don't
          Laugh all day long like an idiot,
          If that's what you mean.

                     JOSEPHINE
          You're a little touchy about it.

                     WYATT
          I'm not touchy, I just, it's a
          Silly question, that's all.  Am I
          Happy?  Are you happy?

                     JOSEPHINE
          Of course, I'm always happy.
          Unless I'm bored.  That blonde
          Woman, is that your wife?

                     WYATT
          What about her?

                     JOSEPHINE
          Nothing... Tell me, what do you
          Want out of life?

                     WYATT
          Where do you get these questions?

                     JOSEPHINE
          Just answer.

                     WYATT
          I don't know, make some money,
          Have some kids, you know.

                     JOSEPHINE
          Doesn't suit you.

                     WYATT
          How would you know?

                     JOSEPHINE
          Just doesn't, that's all.

                     WYATT
          Well I ought to know my own mind
          And I'm tellin' you what suits me
          Is a family and kids.  That suits
          Me right down to the ground.  In
          Fact, that's my idea of heaven.
               (pauses)
          All right, what's your idea of heaven?

                     JOSEPHINE
          Room service.

Wyatt laughs, almost in spite of himself.  Josephine beams.

                     JOSEPHINE
          See?  You're laughing again.  But
          That's what I want.  Go places and
          Move and never look back and just
          Have fun.  Forever.  That's my idea
          Of heaven.  Need someone to share
          It with, though.

                     WYATT
          You mean Behan?
               (sees her shrug)
          Then why are you with him?

                     JOSEPHINE
          Well he's handsome and he's
          Charming.  He's all right.  For
          Now.  Don't say it, I know, I'm 
          Rotten.  I can't help it.  I've
          Tried to be good but it's too
          Boring.

                     WYATT
          The way you talk.  Never heard a
          Woman talk like that.

                     JOSEPHINE
          Oh look, I haven't got time to be
          Proper, I want to live.  I'm a 
          woman, I like men.  If that's 
          Unladylike then I guess I'm not a
          Lady.  At least I'm honest.

                     WYATT
          Well you're different, no arguing
          That.  But you're a lady all right.
          I'll take my oath on it.

He looks at her, enchanted, but suddenly his face clouds.

                     JOSEPHINE
          What's wrong?

                     WYATT
          I don't know, doesn't make any
          Sense.  I almost can't look at
          You.  Like it hurts.

                     JOSEPHINE
          I know, me too.  What should we do
          About it?

He takes her in his arms and kisses her.  She sinks in his 
arms.  He kisses her again then falls to her knees, throwing 
his arms around her legs and pressing his face into the folds 
of her skirts.

                     WYATT
          God...

She runs a hand through his hair.  He stands, lifting her with 
him until they are face-to-face and she can feel him pressing 
into her.  After a beat:

                     JOSEPHINE
          You know this is adultery.  You
          Burn in hell for that.

                     WYATT
          Then let's make sure we get our
          Money's worth

EXT - DESERT - MAGIC HOUR

They loll on the rock, facing each other, clothes in disarray.

                     JOSEPHINE
          I must say this certainly has
          Been an unexpected little
          Windfall.

                     WYATT
          Fortuitous even.


                     JOSEPHINE
          And I don't even know your full name.

                     WYATT
          Easy to fix.  Wyatt Berry Stapp Earp.

                     JOSEPHINE
          And I'm Josephine Sarah Marcus.
          My friends call me Josie.

                     WYATT
          Josie... No, I'm gonna call you
          Sadie.

                     JOSEPHINE
          I hate Sadie.

                     WYATT
          Well you'll always be Sadie to me.

                     JOSEPHINE
          Always?

                     WYATT
          Getting late.  We better get back.

He looks away and stands, helping her up.  They go to their 
horses.  He lifts her up into her saddle and stands awhile, 
arranging the folds of her skirt.  After a beat:

                     JOSEPHINE
          So I assume we're regarding this
          As just a kind of interlude.

                     WYATT
          Look, it's too much of a tangle.
          I already cast my lot.  I can't go
          Back and I can't sneak, feel back
          Enough as it is.

                     JOSEPHINE
          You feel bad about this?  About me?

                     WYATT
          I didn't mean it that way.

                     JOSEPHINE
          You know you don't have to sneak.
          You could stay with me.  I know
          Things, Wyatt.  Sweet things.  I
          Could make you so happy.

                     WYATT
          I can't, I'm sorry.  Forgive me.

He mounts and rides off with a wave.  She watches him 
awhile....

INT - FLY'S PHOTOGRAPHIC GALLERY - DAY

A Victorian photographer's studio behind the O.K. Corral.  A 
large skylight overhead illuminates the backdrop as CAMMILIUS 
S. FLY, the prosperous-looking owner prepares his camera.  
Josephine is o.s. in the dressing room on the left:

                     FLY
          What mood would you like for this
          Picture, Miss Marcus?  Any
          Particular occasion you're 
          Commemorating?

                     JOSEPHINE O.S.
          I want to remember exactly how I
          Looked on this day so I want you
          To take a picture of me...

She steps out wearing a diaphonous veil shrouding her from 
head to toe.  Though it partially obscures her form, we can 
see that she's completely nude underneath.  Fly gasps.

                     JOSEPHINE
          ...all of me.

Fly fumbles with his camera, his composure gone.  She turns to 
a nearby mirror, studying herself-black tresses, rounded lips, 
maddening curves, and smokey eyes-a dark angel.  She smiles:

                     JOSEPHINE
          Because I'm wonderful.

INT - WYATT'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Mattie lies in bed, lost in an opium dream.  She snaps out of 
it and sits up as Wyatt enters and gives her a kiss, glancing 
at the half-empty laudanum bottle on the nightstand.

                     WYATT
          That the bottle Lou gave you?
          Better go easy on that stuff.

                     MATTIE
          I know what I'm doing.  Where have
          You been?

                     WYATT
          Out ridin'.  So... how you doin'?

                     MATTIE
          I don't know.  I'm all right.

                     WYATT
          Really?  You sure?

                     MATTIE
          Sure I'm sure.  What is this?

Wyatt sits down on the bed, suddenly intent, his face alight:

                     WYATT
          Well, I was thinking, we've
          Already made a pile of money.
          Maybe we should just pull up
          Stakes and move on.  And we could
          Stay on the move, you know?  Just
          Keep going, see the world.  Live
          On room service the rest of our 
          Lives.  How'd that be?

                     MATTIE
          Wyatt, what're you talkin' about?

                     WYATT
          Just thinkin' out loud.  Forget it.

INT - ORIENTAL - NIGHT

Dark circles under his eyes, looking dreadful, Doc is at the 
corner table with Virgil, Behan, Ike Clanton, and the 
McLaurys.  Josephine lounges by the piano, luscious in a white 
gown, singing "Frankie and Johnny" in a torchy voice.  Wyatt 
enters, blanching at the sight of Josephine.  Joyce appears at 
his elbow:

                     JOYCE
          New singer.  Ain't she somehin'?

Wyatt nods weakly.  Josephine gives him a half-smile.  Wyatt 
blushes.  Morgan approaches.

                     MORGAN
          Doc won't quit, been up 36 hours.
          Clanton came in an hour ago, they
          Switched over to poker.  Tried to
          Get him to bed but he just won't 
          Let go.

                     WYATT
          I know.  And nobody can make him.

They go over to Doc's table and sit down.  Doc beams 
drunkenly:

                     DOC
          Wyatt!  Just in time.  Pull up a chair.

                     WYATT
          Been hittin' it awful hard, Doc.

                     DOC
          Nonsense, I have not yet begun to
          Defile myself.

                     WYATT
               (touches his shoulder)
          But Doc-

                     DOC
          I won't be pawed at, thank you
          Very much

                     WYATT
          Sorry, sorry...

                     KATE
               (puts arm around Doc)
          That's right.  Doc can go all day
          And all night and then some.
          Doc's my man.  Doc's my lovin'
          Man.  Have another one, lovin' man.

She kisses Doc.  Behan nudges Wyatt:

                     BEHAN
          What d'you think of the singer?

                     WYATT
          Nice voice.

                     BEHAN
          That's not what I meant.

Behan gives him a wink.  Wyatt shifts uneasily in his seat.  
This hand is down to Doc and Ike and the pot is huge.  Doc 
shows his hand.  Ike throws his cards down in a drunken rage:

                     IKE
          Son of a bitch!  That's twelve
          Straight hands!  Nobody's that lucky.

The Earps stiffen as the Cheshire cat smile comes over Doc:

                     DOC
          Why, Ike, whatever do you mean?

                     VIRGIL
          Come on, boys, take it easy.

                     DOC
          Maybe poker's not your game, Ike.
          I know, let's have a spelling
          Contest!

                     IKE
               (stands)
          I'll wring your scrawny neck for you!

                     VIRGIL 
               (grabs him)
          That's enough, Clanton.

                     IKE
          You takin' his part?  I'm the one
          Was cheated. God damn pimps,
          You're all in it together.


                     VIRGIL
          Nobody's in anything, Clanton,
          You're drunk.  Go home and sleep
          It off.

                     IKE
          Get your God damn hands off me!
          Don't you ever put your hands on
          One of us!  Don't you ever try to
          Man-handle a Cowboy!  We'll out
          Your God damn pimp's heart out!
          Understand, pimp?

                     VIRGIL
          Don't you threaten me, you
          Little-

Violence seems imminent.  Wyatt jumps in, separating them.  
Behan notices as Josephine gasps, a look of alarm crossing her 
face.

                     WYATT
          Virgil, don't!  Take it easy!  Ike, 
          Just go home and forget it, will you?

                     IKE
          I ain't forgettin' nothin.

Ike lurches to the bar.  Behan takes Josephine aside, 
whispering:

                     BEHAN
          I saw that look on your face just now.
          What's between you and Wyatt?

                     JOSEPHINE
          Absolutely nothing.

                     DOC
          Well that certainly was a bust.  I
          Want my money back.  Come,
          Darling, let's seek our 
          Entertainment elsewhere.

Doc stands up, taking Kate's arm to leave.  But he falls back 
down dizzily, suddenly breaking out in a sweat and coughing.

                     KATE
          What's wrong, Doc?

                     DOC
          Nothing.  Not a thing.  I'm right
          As the mail.

Again he tries to stand.  This time he keels over onto the 
floor and starts coughing up blood.  Wyatt rushes to him.



                     WYATT
          Get a doctor!  Virgil, give me a hand.

They lift the unconscious Doc off the floor.  Ike turns to 
Joyce.

                     IKE
          What's wrong with him?

                     JOYCE
          Lunger.

INT- DOC'S ROOM - NIGHT

Later.  Doc sits up in bed, revived but looking like death 
warmed over, mouth gaping open, eyes swimming with every 
breath.  DR. GOODFELLOW stands by the bed, putting on his 
jacket.

                     DR. GOODFELLOW
          Your condition is quite advanced.
          I'd say you've lost some 60 percent
          Of your lung tissue.  Maybe more.

                     DOC
          So what does that mean?

                     DR. GOODFELLOW
          Two years, two days, hard to say.
          If you have any chance, it's to 
          Stop now-smoking, drinking,
          Gambling, night-life.  You must
          Have a healthy diet and most
          Importantly, you must have
          Complete rest-meaning you must
          Attempt to deny your marital impulse.

                     DOC
          Well, that sounds inviting.

                     DR. GOODFELLOW
          Sorry but I'm afraid you've no choice.

He takes his bag and exits, leaving Doc alone with the abyss.  
Kate enters, going to his bedside, and starts rolling him a 
cigarette.

                     KATE
          How you feeling, Doc?

                     DOC
          Better.

                     KATE
          That's good.  I knew it wasn't nothin'.


                     DOC
          We must talk, darling.  It appears
          We have to... redefine the nature
          Of our association.

                     KATE
          What's that mean, Doc?  You know I
          Don't understand when you talk up
          High like that.  You mean you
          Don't want to be my lovin' man no more?

                     DOC
          Not exactly...

                     KATE
          I'm a good woman to you, Doc.
          Don't I always take care of you?
          Nobody cares for you like me.  I'm 
          A good woman.

                     DOC
          Yes, I know.  You are a good woman.

Kate smiles, licking the cigarette.  She puts it in his mouth 
and leans over to light it so her ample bosom bulges over her 
bodice.  As Doc stares at her chest something behind his eyes 
seems to shut down.  He takes a long drag from the cigarette.

                     DOC
          Then again, you may be the 
          Antichrist.

INT - ORIENTAL - DAWN

The cold blue light of dawn peeks through the windows.  Ike 
drinks at the bar, brooding.  He reaches behind the bar for 
his guns, leaning his rifle against the brass rail.

                     IKE
          Bastards think they can cheat me?

                     JOYCE
          Nobody cheated you, Ike.  Go home.

Ike reaches across the bar and slaps him.  Joyce scowls, more 
irritated than hurt and too tired to make anything of it.  The 
few other patrons left look up drowsily.  Ike nods in drunken 
satisfaction, picking up his rifle:

                     IKE
          And I don't take no mouth from
          Any bartenders neither.  There,
          See?  Give somebody a rap on the 
          beezer, get some God damn respect 
          Around here.  Now you tell the
          Earps and Doc Holliday if I see
          'em on the street, I'm gonna send
          'em all to hell on a shutter.  You
          tell 'em that.

Ike and the McLaurys storm off as Virgil and Morgan step out 
onto the street.  Wyatt turns to them in disbelief:

                     WYATT
          What the hell's going on?

EXT - ALLEN ST/TELEGRAPH OFFICE - DAY

Walking down Allen, Ike stops the group at the telegraph 
office:

                     IKE
          I want to send a telegram.

EXT - ALLEN STREET - DAY

We start to feel a growing sense of dread as 3 grim HORSEMEN 
come galloping out of the desert toward us.  Billy Clanton, 
Wes Fuller, and Billy Claiborne ride into town, trotting by 
the jail with the Earps looking on.

                     VIRGIL
          Billy Clanton, Wes Fuller, and 
          Billy Claiborne.  Now there's six
          Of 'em.  This is like a bad dream.

                     WYATT
          Just stay calm, use your head.
          It'll be all right.  Just the
          Same, though...
               (pauses, sighs)
          Guess you better swear me in.

INT - WYATT'S HOUSE - DAY

In tight on a brass-mounted wooden case.  It opens to reveal a 
gleaming Colt .45 with an extra long barrel, the gold shield 
inlaid on the burr walnut grips engraved with, "To Wyatt Earp, 
Peacemaker..."  This is the Buntline Special, Wyatt Earp's 
legendary sidearm.  Wyatt takes it from the case and puts it 
in his coat pocket as Mattie looks on.

                     MATTIE
          Thought you swore you'd never
          Carry that thing again.

                     WYATT
          Yeah, well, I swore a lot of things.

EXT - ALLEN STREET - DAY

Behan and Jospehine watch from the hotel as the 6 Cowboys, all 
but Ike armed with pistols, walk side-by-side down the middle 
of Allen.

                     BEHAN
          I'm terribly afraid this looks 
          Like the end of the Earp brothers.

Josephine goes pale...

EXT - ALLEN ST/JAIL - DAY

The Cowboys swagger by defiantly, giving the Earps sidelong 
glances.  Meanwhile, the street starts to BUZZ, townspeople 
beginning to notice that something is happening.

                     VIRGIL
          Here they are again.  Look at 'em.

                     WYATT
          Easy, Virge, they're just tryin'
          To egg us on.

Suddenly Doc appears from around a corner, a little the worse 
for wear in a long, dark Inverness cloak and carrying a big 
gold-headed walking stick.

                     MORGAN
          What're you doin' out of bed, Doc?

                     DOC
          What the hell's going on?  I've
          Had five people walk up to me
          Saying the Clantons and McLaurys
          Are gunning for me.

EXT - LOT BEHIND O.K. CORRAL - DAY

A vacant lot behind the OK Corral with Fly's Gallery on the 
left and the Harwood house on the right.  The Cowboys stand in 
a knot near their horses, passing a bottle around.

                     FRANK
          Like to teach those bastards a lesson.

                     BILLY
          Probably already scared them to death.

                     TOM
          You call it, Ike.  What're we gonna do?

                     IKE
               (grabs bottle)
          Gimme that.

EXT - ALLEN ST/JAIL - DAY

Virgil comes out of the nearby Wells Fargo office with a huge 
Stevens 10 gauge shotgun just as Joyce runs up.

                     JOYCE
          Those Cowboys're tellin'
          Everybody in town they're gonna
          Clean you out.  They're down in
          That lot right now behind the OK
          Corral.

                     WYATT
          Don't worry, Doc, it's not your problem.  
          You don't have to mix up in this.

Doc turns on Wyatt, genuinely shocked and hurt.

                     DOC
          That's a hell of a thing for you
          To say to me.

                     VIRGIL
          What the hell're we gonna do?

                     WYATT
          Wait till the liquor wears off.
          Once they start getting headaches
          They'll lose interest.

                     VIRGIL
          Wyatt, they're threatening our lives.

                     WYATT
          You'll never make that stick.

                     VIRGIL
          They're carrying guns in town.

                     WYATT
          Virge, that's a misdemeanor.  You
          Go down there to arrest 'em,
          Something goes wrong, maybe this
          Time somebody gets his head
          Broke, suddenly it's a mess and
          It won't end there, you'll have 
          Cowboys comin' around lookin' for
          Trouble from here to Christmas.
          You gonna risk all that over a
          Misdemeanor?

                     VIRGIL
               (pauses, thinking)
          No, damn it, it's wrong, they're
          Breakin' the law.

                     WYATT
               (pauses)
          All right, Virge, your call.  But
          Give Doc the shotgun.  They'll be
          Less apt to get nervy if they see
          Him on the street howitzer.

Virgil trades the shotgun for Doc's cane.  Doc folds the 
shotgun under his cloak.  They get set, waiting for Wyatt's 
cue.  Finally:


                     WYATT
          Well... Come on, boys.

They start down Allen, footsteps pounding the board sidewalk, 
Virgil and Wyatt in front, Morgan and Doc in the rear.  
Bystanders step aside, trading whispers as they pass, turning 
onto 4th St...

EXT - LOT BEHIND O.K. CORRAL - DAY

Behan dashes around the corner into the lot, facing the 
Cowboys.

                     BEHAN
          They're on their way over here.

EXT - FREMONT STREET/OK CORRAL - DAY

The Earps and Doc turn off 4th onto Fremont St. Creek Johnson 
and Texas Jack Vermillion watch as they pass the grocer's.

                     JOHNSON
          There they go.  Look kinda like preachers.

                     VERMILLION
          Yeah.  Or undertakers.

The vacant lot starts to come into view and the Earps are 
fighting nerves now.  Fists clenched, gritting their teeth, 
eyes darting all over the street, they look all too human and 
nothing like their legend.  It's only Doc, bringing up the 
rear, who couldn't care less.  Wyatt narrows his eyes:

                     WYATT
          Virge, you're makin' the arrest.
          You make contact, I'll back you
          Up.  Morgan'll back me up, Doc'll
          Keep an eye out for trouble.  And
          Keep your hands on your guns.
          They even look like they're gonna
          Start something, buffalo 'em.
          Right over the head.

                     VIRGIL
          Wyatt, I know what I'm doin'.

                     WYATT
               (sees onlookers)
          Look at 'em all.  They love it.
          How in the hell'd we get
          Ourselves into this?

Just then Behan walks up holding up his hands, reassuring:

                     BEHAN
          You don't have to worry about a
          Thing.  I just went down there and
          Disarmed them.

                     VIRGIL
          You did?  Great, thanks.  Come on, boys.

The Earps quicken their step as Behan enters Fly's gallery.  
Seeing the approaching Earp party, the Cowboys glance around 
at each other, setting themselves.  Now at the end of the 
sidealk, the Earps can see that the Cowboys are still armed 
and their relief evaporates.  Wyatt mutters under his breath:

                     WYATT
          Oh, great.  Disarmed my ass...

The Earps slow their step, gathering themselves.  This is it, 
no turning back now.  The Cowboys spread out.  As the Earps 
get closer and closer, it seems as if the very air is electric 
with tension.  But as they step into the street and fan out 
for their final approach, they suddenly do look like their 
legend, 4 tall figures in long black coats advancing in a 
line, grim and unstoppable, a fleeting moment in time frozen 
forever in our minds.  Finally they stop.  The 2 groups are 
facing each other, perhaps 20 feet apart.  Doc raises the 
shotgun, the Cheshire cat smile spreading over his face.  
Virgil steps forward, his face set, holding up Doc's cane:

                     VIRGIL
          We've come to arrest you.  Throw
          Up your arms!

A weird moment of confusion where nobody seems to know what to 
do.  Then Billy Clanton and Frank McLaury SLAP their hands to 
their guns.  The Earps instantly tense up, hands on their 
pistols.  Virgil waves his hands frantically, afraid they've 
misunderstood:

                     VIRGIL
          Hold!  I don't want that!

Suddenly realizing what's happening, Fuller and Claiborne bolt 
and dash into Fly's gallery.  Everyone else stands frozen, 
breath short, pulses pounding, each staring into the other's 
wide-open eyes.  Then something in Billy Clanton's eyes seems 
to go dead and Wyatt groans under his breath as the awful 
realization hits him:

                     WYATT
          Oh, my God...

Billy and Frank jerk their pistols and the scene EXPLODES, 
everything happening in SPLIT SECONDS as Wyatt draws and 
FIRES, knocking Frank down with a gutshot.  Morgan FIRES, 
blowing Billy back against the wall of the Harwood house.  Tom 
darts for the cover behind his horse as Ike dives onto Wyatt 
shrieking like a woman:

                     IKE
          No, no, please!  I don't have a gun!

                     WYATT
          This fight's commenced.  Get to
          Fightin' or get away!

Wyatt hurls him aside.  Ike sprints for the gallery.  Tom 
FIRES over his saddle at Doc who tries for a shot but is 
blocked by the horse.  Billly bounces back up, howling, and 
FIRES, the bullet piercing Virgil's calf.  He drops to one 
knee.  Tom FIRES again.  Doc FIRES one barrel into the air, 
the BLAST making the horse rear up, exposing Tom for a split 
second.  Doc FIRES again.  Tom's side EXPLODES into red mist, 
the full charge of red mist, the full charge of buckshot 
SLAMMING him into the Harwood house.  Tom drops his gun and 
teeters into the street, talking eerie little mincing steps, 
already dead but still moving, like a chicken with its head 
cut off.  Billy FIRES again, dropping Morgan with a hole in 
his shoulder.


                     MORGAN
          I'm hit.

Doc pull his Lightning and FIRES DOUBLE ACTION 1-2-3 times, 
hitting Billy in the abdomen while Frank bounds back into the 
fight, FIRING wildly.  Virgil gets up, FIRING BACK.  The whole 
scene now bathed in thick smoke, the fight starts swirling 
into the street, each man jockeying for position.  Inside the 
gallery, Behan and Fuller watch at the window as Ike dives in.  
He snatches Fuller's pistol and FIRES through the window.  
Ike's bullets WHIZ past Wyatt's ear.  He spins around, calling 
to Doc:

                     WYATT
          Behind us!

In a flashing move taking less than a heartbeat, Doc pivots, 
replacing the .38 in this right hand with his big .45, then 
with one pass of his left hand RAPID FIRES quick as a machine 
gun burst 1-2-3-4-5 times, the bullets RIPPING through the 
gallery, showering Ike and the rest with splinters and broken 
glass.

                     BEHAN
          Come on!

Behan hauls Ike up and they dash out the back door, Fuller and 
Claiborne right behind, all frantically running for their 
lives.  Outside Billy gets to his knees, seemingly 
indestructible, and FIRES at Wyatt,  Wyatt RETURNS FIRE.  Eyes 
wild and bulging, a bloody hand clutching his wounds, Frank 
staggers across the lot, bearing down on Doc through the 
smoke:

                     FRANK
          I got you now, you son of a bitch!

                     DOC
          You're a daisy if you do!

Doc opens his arms, giving Frank a clear shot at his chest.  
Frank FIRES.  The bullet grazes Doc's holster.  Frank trudges 
closer, about to fire again but Doc DRILLS him through the 
heart while in the next millisecond Morgan FIRES from his 
prone position on the ground, the big .45 BLAST carrying away 
the top of Frank's head.  As the last shot echoes through the 
hills, Frank flops limply to the ground like a rag doll while 
out in the street his brother Tom finally runs out of steam 
and pitches face first in the dirt, leaving only Billy, 
leaning against the Harwood house, legs splayed out in front 
of him, absolutely shot to pieces, clicking his empty gun and 
wailing piteously as the smoke clears:

                     BILLY
          More cartridges!  Somebody load my gun...

He keeps repeating it with sinking volume as townspeople step 
timidly into the street.  Fly bends down and takes Bill's gun 
from his hand and the fight is officially over, having lasted 
only some 20 seconds.  Wyatt helps Morgan to his feet as Behan 
strides briskly onto the scene, addressing Wyatt:

                     BEHAN
          All right.  You're all under
          Arrest.

Wyatt looks at him in utter disbelief.  Finally:

                     WYATT
          I don't think I'll let you arrest
          Us today, Behan.  Maybe tomorrow.

More bystanders arrive, a crowd scene rapidly developing.  The 
Earp women run up from the west end of Fremont.  Josephine 
fights her way through the crowd from the east.  She and Wyatt 
catch sight of each other.  She grins, tears in her eyes.  He 
nods, smiling.  Seeing the whole thing, Behan fumes.  And so 
does MATTIE who turns and walks away while Allie and Lou run 
to their men, hugging them.  Meanwhile Doc stands over Frank's 
body, fingering the graze over his thigh, jeering under his 
breath:

                     DOC
          You call that shooting?

                     FLY
               (comes up to Wyatt)
          The McLaurys are both dead.  Billy
          Clanton's just about gone.

Wyatt nods, pocketing his gun, sadly surveying the bloody 
scene.

                     WYATT
          Guess we did our good deed for today.

EXT - BOOT HILL - SUNSET

Fireworks EXPLODE in the darkening sky as a cortege of 50 
Cowboys in their finest parade down the street toward Boot 
Hill, the crude little grave yard, Curly Bill and Ringo in the 
lead, Ike right behind with the 3 coffins and a banner saying: 
"Murdered On The Streets Of Tombstone".  As they take places 
at the gravesite Wyatt approaches Curly Bill.

                     WYATT
          I'm sorry.  If there was any other-

                     CURLY BILL
          I know.  Just did what you had to.
          That banner and stuff, that's
          Just Ike.  Don't worry about it.

Wyatt nods, tips his hat, walks off.  Looking after him, Curly 
Bill whispers:

                     CURLY BILL
          Don't worry about a thing

INT- MORGAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Morgan lies in bed, his shoulder in bandages.  Wyatt sits by 
him

                     WYATT
          How you doin', boy?

                     MORGAN
          Fine.  Better.

Morgan looks out the window, staring at nothing.  He looks 
tired, older, all the fun and youthful zest gone from his 
face.

                     MORGAN
          You were right.  It's nothin' like
          I thought.  I almost wish...

                     WYATT
          I know, kid.  I know.  Me too.

Wyatt touches his arm, a look of unutterable sadness in his 
eyes.  This is the one thing he didn't want for his little 
brother....

EXT - RUSTLER'S PARK - NIGHT

The Cowboys are gathered around a huge bonfire, sparks 
drifting up toward the heavens, faces vivid in the firelight 
like an ancient warrior host.  Curly Bill faces them, bottle 
in hand:

                     CURLY BILL
          Here's to the memory of Billy
          Clanton and Tom and Frank
          McLaury.  They went out real
          Cowboys, dead game right up to 
          Their last kick.  They won their
          Places at the big table with Davy
          Crockett and Wild Bill and Old
          Man Clanton.  They're up there
          Right now tradin' shots with 'em.
          And they'll never be forgot.  Not
          Ever.  Hundred years from now
          There'll be men settin' around a
          Campfire, passin' a bottle,
          Tellin' stories about those boys.
          They're what you call immortal.
          And I say God bless 'em.

They all drink, long and deep, Ringo wiping away tears.  Then:

                     CURLY BILL
          All right, first we hang back,
          Just bide away till everybody
          Thinks this's blown over.  Then...

INT - DRESSING ROOM/BEDROOM, WYATT'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Mattie irons shirts in the adjoining bedroom while Wyatt 
finishes shaving in the dressing room, wiping foam from his 
face, looking in the cabinet for a towel.  Opening the bottom 
drawer, a nest of small brown bottles clatters onto the floor.  
Laudanum bottles, all empty.  Mattie looks up as Wyatt comes 
out, bottle in hand:

                     WYATT
          Mattie.  What about this?

                     MATTIE
               (looks up, keeps ironing)
          I need it.

                     WYATT
          'Least you admit it.

                     MATTIE
          Admit what, I'm an opium fiend?
          No, Wyatt, I just said I need it.
          I need something to keep me warm
          At night.

                     WYATT
          Look, Mattie, I know you're-

                     MATTIE
          You know nothing.  What you don't
          Know would fill a book.  Jesus, I 
          Feel like it's when you're around
          I need it most.  You're never
          Yourself, you never relax.  Never.
          Everything's so stiff and dead.
          You always have to keep a rein on
          Everything, ever yourself.  Oh,
          You smile sometimes, I've even
          Seen you laugh.  But there's no
          Light in your smile for me,
          Wyatt, nothing to keep me warm.
          And I get cold, Wyatt.  I get so cold.
               (pauses)
          What's between you and that Jew woman?

This catches Wyatt off-guard.  He looks at her.  She sneers.  
Then:

                     WYATT
          All right, look.  I can make it 
          Right, I can make this up to you,
          Mattie.  I can, I swear.

                     MATTIE
          Will you go to her and tell her
          Right in front of me she's
          Nothing to you?  Right out loud so
          I can hear?  Tell her she's
          Nothing, tell her she's nobody,
          Just dirt?  Will you do that?

Wyatt falls silent.  Mattie stands, staring at him a moment, 
then:

                     MATTIE
          Until you can do that we've got
          Nothing to talk about, Wyatt.
          Nothing.  Now leave me alone.

She keeps ironing.  Wyatt looks as if a building fell on 
him....

EXT - TOUGHNUT STREET - DAY

Behan comes out of Nellie Cashman's, spots Josephine going 
down Toughnut.  He catches up to her, pacing her.  She keeps 
walking.

                     BEHAN
          Listen, I want to talk to you.

                     JOSEPHINE
          Not now.  I don't have time.

                     BEHAN
               (grabs her)
          I saw that look pass between you
          And Wyatt at the fight.  Listen to
          Me!  You're mine!  Understand?
          You're my woman and I'm your man.

                     JOSEPHINE
          My man?  You told Wyatt you'd 
          Disarmed those men.  Do you
          Actually believe after that I
          Could see you as my man?  You're
          Just a dirty little fixer.

                     BEHAN
          You whore!  You filthy whore!

A HAND reaches into frame, spinning Behan around.  Morgan 
stands there, arm in a sling, red in his eye:

                     MORGAN
          You don't talk that way to a
          Female human being!  Not ever!

                     BEHAN
          Look, I don't want to take
          Advantage of an injured man but
          You better-

With his good arm Morgan SLUGS Behan in the mouth.  Behan 
drops like a leaf, as much to avoid a further injury as from 
the blow.  Morgan turns to Josephine, leading her away.  
Across the street Curly Bill and Ringo share a flask, 
watching, Ringo looking even odder than usual.  Curly Bill 
chuckles:

                     CURLY BILL
          So she's Wyatt's slice now.  Looks
          Like we got another name for the
          Tally book.

EXT - ALLEN STREET/ORIENTAL - LATE DAY

Later.  The Earp brothers stand in front of the Oriental.

                     MORGAN
          Dropped him, that was it.  Sorry
          If I made a worse mess for you.

                     WYATT
          I'm the one made a mess.  Made a
          Right fair mess of the whole thing.

Wyatt looks down, miserable.  Virgil looks up at the sky:

                     VIRGIL
          Getting warmer.  Guess spring's comin'.

Just then Morgan sees Breakenridge passing by in silence.

                     MORGAN
          Hello, Billy.  I say hello, Deputy.

                     BREAKENRIDGE
               (turns to them)
          I don't want to talk to you.  Those
          Men you killed were my friends.
          I'm just a nothing, but if I 
          Wasn't I'd fight you, I'd fight
          You right now.  So I don't wanna
          Talk to you.

He hurries away, eyes tearing up.  The Earps look on in 
amazement.

                     WYATT
          All they ever did was make fun of him.

                     O.S. VOICE
          Sister Boy should've stuck around.

They turn.  A liquored-up RINGO stands behind them on the 
sidewalk like an apparition, murder in his eyes, hands thrust 
into the pockets of a long black buffalo coat, ivory gunbutts 
peeking out.

                     VIRGIL
          What d'you want, Ringo?

                     RINGO
          I want your blood and I want you
          Souls and I want them both right now.

                     WYATT
          Don't want any more trouble, Ringo.

                     RINGO
               (steps up to Wyatt)
          Well you got trouble and it
          Starts with you.

                     WYATT
          I'm not gonna fight you, there's 
          No money in it.  Sober up.  Come
          On, boys.

Wyatt turns into the Oriental.  His brothers follow.  Ringo 
howls:

                     RINGO
          Wretched slugs, don't any of you
          Have the guts to play for blood?


                     O.S. VOICE
          I'm your huckleberry.

Ringo turns.  Doc stands there, smiling that Cheshire cat 
smile.

                     DOC
          That's just my game.

                     RINGO
          All right, lunger.  Have at it.

They face each other, eyes blazing, about to reach critical 
mass.

                     DOC
          On three?  You call it.

                     RINGO
          Here it come: one-two-

At the last possible instant, Curly Bill flashes into frame 
along with Stillwell and Spence, grabbing Ringo from behind 
while the Earps step in front of Doc.

                     CURLY BILL
          Johnny, don't, Jesus!  Come on,
          Son...
               (turns to Earps)
          Never mind.  He's drunk.

They haul Ringo up the street, out of earshot.  Ringo is 
boiling:

                     RINGO
          I want them spitting blood!

                     CURLY BILL
          Easy, Johnny.  Now ain't the time.
               (turns to others)
          I tell you, boys, even I'm
          Worried what'll happen once Ringo
          Runs this outfit!  God have mercy!

He pulls Ringo into a doorway, away from the others.  Tears in 
his eyes, clawing the air, Ringo is beside himself.

                     RINGO
          There's no God, there's no devil,
          I hate the God damn world!  I want 
          To die!

                     CURLY BILL
          Easy, son.  You just need to get
          Your feet back under you, that's
          All.  Come on, boy, let's kick
          South.  Down to the old playground.

INT - ADOBE HOUSE - NIGHT

An adobe rancho in the Sonora desert, small, humbly furnished.  
Inside a Mexican family, 3 children, a husband and young wife 
eat dinner.  Suddenly Curly Bill and Ringo BURST IN, guns 
drawn, shouting in Spanish.  Everyone freezes and as the 
children start crying we feel the family's sense of inner 
terror.  Curly Bill looks the trembling young wife over, 
nodding at Ringo:

                     CURLY BILL
          See son, there is a God after all!

EXT - ALLEN STREET/ORIENTAL - DUSK

Nightfall and the wind HOWLS down the street, kicking up dust 
in swirling columns.  A FLASH of lightning streaks down from 
the purple clouds and a THUNDERCLAP crashes in our ears, 
echoing through town into the hills, making the horses neigh 
and fidget...

INT- ORIENTAL - DUSK

But inside it's bright and warm.  Florentino is alone at the 
bar, nursing a drink while Wyatt deals for Morgan and a few 
others.  Virgil looks out at the storm, shaking his head:

                     VIRGIL
          Gonna be one of those nights.

EXT- RUSTLER'S PARK - DUSK

The Cowboys are gathered on a rise.  Curly Bill stands before 
them, silhouetted against the boiling sky, arms outstretched, 
exulting in the storm's fury.   He turns to his men, eyes 
ablaze:

                     CURLY BILL
          All right, boys.  Now's the time
          To get woolly.

INT - JOSEPHINE'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Josephine sits by the window, reading Swinburne.  A KNOCK at 
the door.  She answers it.  Behan enters.  She bristles, but:

                     BEHAN
          Easy.  I just wanted to tell you
          Things're about to start changing
          Around here.  Lots of so-called
          Hard cases and tough-nuts swagger
          Around this town but none of
          'em's got a clue about the real
          play.  None of 'em.

                     JOSEPHINE
          I don't understand.

                     BEHAN
          You will after tonight.  Bet on it.

INT - PARLOR, VIRGIL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Allie and Louisa sip tea by a blazing fire in the hearth, 
warming themselves against the storm's cold.  Mattie sits 
nearby, sewing.  

                     ALLIE
          God, it's a cold night.  Come up
          To the fire, Mattie.

Suddenly there's a KNOCK at the door.  Louisa looks out the 
window.  Outside is the tall silhouette of a WOMAN in a dark 
cloak.

                     LOUISA
          It looks like a woman.

Allie opens the door.  Josephine enter, breathless, comes into 
the parlor.  Mattie sits up in shock.  The others gather 
round.  

                     JOSEPHINE
          Please, I know it's awful me
          Coming here, but listen, I can't 
          Say why, but I think something is-

Another KNOCK.  Allie goes to the window.  There's a weird 
sense of déjà vu as outside we again see a cloaked woman's 
SILHOUETTE.

                     ALLIE
          Now who in... It's another woman.

Allie starts to open the door but Josephine suddenly leaps up 
and:

                     JOSEPHINE
          No!  Look out!

With her dancer's quickness she dashes across the parlor, 
grabbing Allie and pulling her to the floor just as a 
tremendous SHOTGUN BLAST rips through the open doorway.  The 
chandelier overhead explodes, showering the screaming women 
with broken glass and a harsh MALE VOICE cuts through the air 
as the shrouded figure dashes into the darkness:

                     MAN'S VOICE
          Everybody dies!

INT- ORIENTAL - NIGHT

The sound of the gunshots are lost in the wind and thunder as 
Virgil gets up, yawning:

                     VIRGIL
          Getting late.  Guess I'll turn in.

                     WYATT
          Bundle up, Virge.  Cold out there.

Virgil nods, exiting with a wave.  Wyatt and Morgan keep 
playing, hardly noticing as moments later, Florentino walks 
out....

EXT - CORNER OF ALLEN & 5TH STREET - NIGHT

Virgil turns off Allen onto 5th, the wind whipping his 
coattails.  He glances up as Florentino walks by, crossing 5th 
and ducking into a doorway.  Virgil stops.  SOMETHING seems to 
be moving in the shadows of an unfinished building on the 
opposite side of 5th....

INT - ORIENTAL - NIGHT

A BOOMING SOUND echoes outside, muffled by wind.  Morgan looks 
up:

                     MORGAN
          That thunder's sure somethin'.

                     WYATT
          That didn't sound like thunder.

Moments later Virgil walks back in, pale, hatless, a blank 
look on his face.  He moves with odd, shuffling steps, holding 
himself sideways.  Wyatt and Morgan exchange puzzled glances, 
then:

                     WYATT
          Virgil?

                     VIRGIL
          Wyatt...

Virgil does an unsteady stutter-step, his face taking on a 
pleading, almost childlike look of panic.  But as he turns his 
body toward Wyatt we suddenly see that his whole left side is 
in bloody shreds, his left arm dangling unnaturally by a few 
gory ribbons of flesh.  His voice is a frightened sob:

                     VIRGIL
          Wyatt!

He starts to swoon.  Wyatt rushes over and grabs him as....

INT- HOTEL ROOM (VIRGIL) - NIGHT

The hotel room where they've taken Virgil.  He's on the bed, 
wrapped in bandages, semi-conscious.  Wyatt and Morgan stand 
in the doorway with Doc and the women.  Allie is at Virgil's 
side, hands over her mouth as Dr. Goodfellow speaks in somber 
tones:

                     DR. GOODFELLOW
          I'm afraid your husband's been
          Very badly hurt.  I had to remove
          The entire left elbow joint.  What
          That means is, well I'm afraid-

                     ALLIE 
          Oh, no, no, no, NO!

She starts wailing.  Suddenly alert, Virgil sits up, taking 
her in his big right arm, pulling her close, his voice calm, 
reassuring:

                     VIRGIL
          No, no, don't worry, honey.  I
          Still got one arm left to hug you with.

She buries her face in his chest and sobs.  He holds her, 
rocking her back and forth.  Wyatt turns away, shutting his 
eyes.  

INT- HOTEL ROOM (VIRGIL) - DAY

Virgil lies in bed, staring blankly into space.  Wyatt sits at 
his side, hands over his face while Allie hovers in the b.g.

                     WYATT
          It's all my fault.  If I hadn't been
          So damn smart, if I'd just... Oh
          God, Virge, I'm so sorry.

                     ALLIE
          Look, Wyatt, I don't want to talk
          Right now.

                     WYATT
          Virgil, what am I going to do?

                     VIRGIL
          For God's sake, just leave me alone.

Virgil grimaces in hopeless agony.  Allie touches Wyatt's arm.

                     ALLIE
          He doesn't want to talk now.

Wyatt stands, backing away.  He turns pleadingly to Mattie 
standing in the doorway.  She looks away.  He walks out....

INT - HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

Wyatt comes into the lobby and freezes as McMasters 
approaches.  Wyatt starts to walk by him, but McMasters steps 
into his path:

                     MCMASTERS
          No, wait.  Please.  I know nothin'
          I say'll fix things but I want 
          You to know it wasn't me.

                     WYATT
          No?  Brothers to the bone, right?

                     MCMASTERS
          Not anymore, not after this.

Wyatt looks into McMasters' eyes and we can see he means 
it....

INT - ORIENTAL - NIGHT

Morgan is by himself in the empty saloon, calmly shooting 
pool, his dog jumping enthusiastically at every shot as Wyatt 
enters.

                     MORGAN
          Get down, boy.

                     WYATT
          Morgan, are you crazy?  They're
          Out gunning for us!  What the
          Hell're you doin'?

                     MORGAN
          What's it look like?  They want a
          Piece of me they can come and get
          It, I'm not crawlin' into my hole.

                     WYATT
          Morg, use your head.

                     MORGAN
          I am usin' it, Wyatt.  Been
          Wonderin' how the hell we got in
          This tangle.  You know they hit
          Clum's house, too?  Shot up his wife.
          His wife.  Who ever heard of 
          That?  Men sneakin' around in the
          Dark, back-shootin', scarin' 
          Women?  They're bugs, Wyatt.  You
          Know all your smart talk about
          Live and let live?  Ain't no live 
          And let live with bugs.

                     WYATT
          I know, I was wrong.  But Morg,
          Look, we got to get out.

                     MORGAN
          Listen to yourself, Wyatt.  Lie
          Down and crawl or you might get
          Hurt?  What kinda talk is that?
          That's Virgil lyin' over there,
          Wyatt.  Our own brother.  Ruined
          For life.  No sir, I ain't going
          No place.  You want to go, fine.
          I'm stayin' right here and have
          It out with those bastards.

Morgan pulls back his vest, revealing Virgil's badge.  Wyatt 
drops into a corner chair, defeated.  Morgan makes a shot, 
leaving only the 8 ball.  A few beats.  Seeing Wyatt's misery, 
Morgan softens, poking him with the cue.  Wyatt looks up.  
Morgan taps the middle pocket.  Wyatt shakes his head.

                     MORGAN
          How much you wanna bet?

Wyatt holds up his watch.  Morgan frowns.  Wyatt raises his 
brows:

                     WYATT
          I just got it fixed.

                     MORGAN
          You're on.

Morgan has to lean over the table but he sinks the 8 ball, 
looking over at Wyatt in triumph.  Wyatt applauds, rolling his 
eyes just as a BULLET SPANGS into the wall by his head.  Wyatt 
dives for the floor as ANOTHER SHOT pierces the window.  Wyatt 
jumps up, bounding to the door to see several FIGURES cash 
into the darkness.  Wyatt turns back and freezed.  Morgan lies 
across the table with one leg dangling over the edge, jerking 
and shuddering involuntarily.  Wyatt rushes to him.  The dog 
whines as Doc rushes in with Kate and McMasters.  Wyatt is 
trembling.

                     WYATT
          No, no!  Get the doctor!  Jesus Christ!

INTO - ORIENTAL - NIGHT

The curious crowd outside, watching through the windows.  
Morgan is on the pool table, lying on his side with his shirt 
pulled up.  The dog cowers in the corner, whining while Dr. 
Goodfellow digs into the wound with a steel probe, making 
Morgan writhe in perfect agony.  The doctor turns to Wyatt:

                     DR. GOODFELLOW
          Hold him.

Wyatt takes Morgan in his arms.  The doctor probes.  Morgan 
jerks violently.  Suddenly we hear a blood-curdling SCREAM.  
Louisa is in the doorway, tearing her hair, lost in utter 
hysterics.

                     WYATT
          Oh, no, get her out of her!  Jesus!

And now the whole scene sinks into hellish confusion with the 
dog whimpering, Louisa shrieking as others restrain her, and 
Morgan gives a violet jerk, breaking Wyatt's grip.  The doctor 
snarls, about at the end of his rope.

                     DR. GOODFELLOW
          I said hold him, God damn it!

                     WYATT
          Somebody shut that dog up!

Morgan takes Wyatt's arm, his voice like a child's.

                     MORGAN
          You were right, Wyatt.  They got
          Me good.  Don't let 'em get you
          Too.

                     WYATT
          Will somebody get the damn dog out-

                     MORGAN
          Remember about the light you're 
          Supposed to see when you're dyin'?

                     WYATT
          Easy Morg, don't think about that now.

                     MORGAN
          Isn't true.  I can't see a damn thing.

Tears well up in Wyatt's eyes.  He touches his brother's face.  
Morgan's eyelids start fluttering.  Wyatt squeezes his hand.

                     WYATT
          Morgan?  Morgan!

The dog starts howling, long and loud and pitiful-and in the 
next moment the air is FILLED with howls as every dog and 
coyote for miles joins in the mourning.  Wyatt backs away from 
his dead brother and trudges out onto the sidewalk, staring at 
the blood on his hands.  Standing in the crowd across the 
street, Josephine sees Wyatt and starts for him.  Behan grabs 
her.  She wrenches free and with the whole town watching, 
starts running toward Wyatt.  Seeing her, Wyatt backs away in 
horror, shaking his head:

                     WYATT
          No, no, get away, get away from me...

                     JOSEPHINE
          Wyatt...

She keeps coming.  Wyatt panics.  Finally, in desperation:

                     WYATT
          Whore!  Filthy whore!  Get away
          From me!

She pauses, unable to believe her ears, then runs away crying.  
Fuming with rage, Kate starts after Wyatt.  Doc pulls her 
back:

                     DOC
          Can't you see why he did it?

The howls continue as Wyatt trudges down the street alone.  
Suddenly he doubles over, clutching his abdomen in agony, 
staring at his bloody hands....

EXT - ALLEN STREET - DAY

The wagon bearing Morgan's pine coffin waits in the street, 
hitched and ready.  Virgil is up front with the women, arm in 
a sling, pale.  Doc and Kate wait on horses nearby.  Finished 
loading, Wyatt looks around.  People line the street, watching 
in silence.  Clum and his wounded wife turn away from the 
window of their lodgings next door, unable to meet his gaze.  
The very air feels charged with paranoia and recrimination, as 
if the whole town has suddenly become morally radio-active.  
Bystanders gape as Josephine steps out of the hotel, regal and 
impervious as a queen, wearing a gawking scorn like a mink 
coat, her little white dog scampering after her.  Passing 
Behan, he gives her nasty look and spits.  She doesn't even 
break stride.  Lounging in front of the Crystal Palace with 
the other Cowboys, Stillwell gives Curly Bill an enquiring 
look.

                     CURLY BILL
          Naw, she's nobody.  Wyatt junked her.

Passing Wyatt, she doesn't even glance at him.  Doc sighs:

                     DOC
          And so she walked out of our 
          Lives forever.

Without a word Wyatt climbs onto the wagon and shakes the 
reins, driving off.  He pulls up in front of the Cowboys.  
They make a show of pretending to hide their guns.  Wyatt 
looks straight ahead:

                     WYATT
          I want you to know it's over.
          We're leaving and we're not
          Coming back.

                     CURLY BILL
          Well... 'bye.

                     RINGO
               (sniffs)
          Hey, you smell that?  Smells like
          Something died.

                     CURLY BILL 
               (stifling a laugh)
          Oh, Jesus, Johnny...

Allie's eyes flare, Louisa stifles a sob.  The Cowboys 
snicker. Wyatt clenches his teeth, still staring straight 
ahead, and drives on.  A few beats then Curly Bill turns to 
Ike:

                     CURLY BILL
          Take Frank and finish it.

EXT - TRAIN STATION, TUCSON - NIGHT

A train pours steam onto the platform in puffs and clouds 
while 2 porters load Morgan's coffin into a boxcar.  Up ahead, 
Mattie and Louisa fumble with luggage while Allie boosts 
Virgil into a passenger car.  As we HEAR the conductor's voice 
shouting, " 'Board!", Ike and Stillwell emerge from the 
shadows near the scales, crouched behind shotguns.  They 
exchange nods and start forward, cocking their weapons, 
squinting through the steam:

                     STILLWELL
          That's Virgil with the women.  But 
          Where the hell's Wyatt?

                     O.S. VOICE
          Right behind you, Stillwell.

They spin around.  Wyatt stands behind them, looking down the 
barrels of Virgil's big 10 gauge.  Stillwell raises his 
shotgun, Wyatt FIRES.  Stillwell hits the floor in a crumpled 
heap, his torso a smoking bundle of bloody rags.  Screams 
??????????

                     WAGONMASTER
          Rest of us're 3 months out of
          Independece but we're from
          Carthage, Illinois originally.

                     WYATT
          Carthage, really?  I'm from Monmouth.

                     WAGONMASTER
          Another Illinois man!  Practical
          Neighbors!  Step down, Marshal.
          Have a feed.

EXT - WAGON TRAIN CAMP - NIGHT

Lucinda's ever-silent son sits at a nearby wagon, staring at 
Wyatt while Lucinda rolls dough, lovely as ever.  Just 
finished telling his story, Wyatt sits by the fire with the 
wagonmaster and several others.  They shaker their head:

                     WAGONMASTER
          Ain't got law, ain't got nothin'.
          Only thing between us and the
          Animals.  Always the way it goes,
          Though.  Only way to down an
          Illinois man's from behind, the
          Dogs don't dare face 'em.  Mr.
          Lincoln, Wild Bill, now your 
          Brothers:  Illinois men all and
          All downed from behind by dirty
          Dogs and Democrats.  Guess an
          Ordinary man'd be out for
          Vengeance but I don't figure
          That'll answer here.  It's a 
          Reckoning you're after.

                     WYATT
          If the Lord is my friend.

                     WAGONMASTER
          Let not your heart be faint, let
          Your arm be steel-that's all you
          Need of the Lord.

Wyatt pauses, nodding, suddenly understanding the truth of it.  
Looking up, his eyes meet those of Lucinda.  She smiles, 
wiping flour from her hands.  Wyatt smiles thoughtfully, moved 
by this unexpected encounter....

EXT - WAGON TRAIN CAMP - MORNING

Next morning.  Doc gallops into camp with McMasters, Texas 
Jack Vermillion, and Turkey Creek Jack Johnson, exchanging 
greetings with Wyatt who leads him over to the center of the 
camp, then:

                     WYATT
          Know why you're here?


                     VERMILLION
          Way ahead of you, Wyatt.  You want 
          Us to help you get Ike Clanton
          And Johnny Behan.  Everybody knows
          They're the ones to blame for
          Your brothers.

                     WYATT
          They're nothing.  They're nobody.
          I want the Cowboys.  All of 'em.  I
          Mean to break 'em up, drive 'em
          Out of the territory.

                     JOHNSON
          Are you out of your mind?  What on 
          Earth'd make us-

                     WYATT
               (takes out wad of bills)
          I'll pay you 500 each in advance
          And I'll mount you on those.

He points to his 5 magnificent blacks tied nearby.  They look 
them over as Wyatt takes out a stack of warrants.

                     WYATT
          Got a sheaf of federal warrants.
          Being in the Territories it's up
          To our discretion how they're
          Served.  That means we got the
          Cowboys without quarter.  The
          Black flag, brother.  No
          Prisoners, no mercy, amen.

                     VERMILLION
               (to Johnson)
          500... Year's wages.  And I never
          even saw a horse like that.

                     JOHNSON
          You crazy?  It can't be done.

                     MCMASTERS
          It might be done.  If we hit the
          Waterholes through the southern
          Dragoons, the Whetstones and 
          Huachucas, we could take 'em on
          In pieces, run off their herds.
               (faces Wyatt)
          Keep your money, I'll show you 
          Where those waterholes are.  Just
          Promise me you'll finish it.  No
          Matter what happens you'll see it
          Through to the end.  I'll have 
          Your hand on that.

They shake.   Vermillion and Johnson confer in whispers, then:

                     VERMILLION
          We come through this in one
          Piece, can we keep the horses?

Wyatt nods.  Vermillion nods to Johnson who crouches down with 
a pair of dice.  He makes one pass, two passes... Finally:

                     JOHNSON
          Crapped out.  Okay, we're in.

EXP - WAGON TRAIN CAMP/DESERT - DAY

The thoroughbreds are saddled and waiting, each with a rifle 
in a scabbard and a double-barreled shotgun across the saddle 
fork.  Lucinda's son looks on with gathering awe as Wyatt's 
men, each carrying 2 pistols, face their boss.

                     WYATT
          The minute we start we'll be
          Going against local and county
          Law.  If we fail the U.S.
          Government won't be able to lift
          A finger to help us.  Nevertheless
          I want you to understand we carry
          The full force and authority of
          The law of this land.

They exchange glances, each man feeling a little shiver at the 
magnitude of what they're about to attempt.  Wyatt faces them:

                     WYATT
          Raise your right hands.  Do you
          Solemnly swear to uphold the laws
          And constitution of the United
          States of America and to protect
          her citizens to the best of your
          Ability, even at the cost of your
          Own life?

All chorus, "I do", except for Doc who rolls his eyes.  
Finally:

                     DOC
          Oh... All right.

Wyatt hands each a Federal Deputy's badges.  Doc waves his 
away:

                     DOC
          You know why I'm here.  My
          Hypocrisy only goes so far.

Wyatt shrugs.  They mount up, about to begin, but suddenly:

                     LUCINDA
          Wait!

Lucinda runs up to Wyatt, reaching up and tying a blue and 
gold silk scarf around his neck.

                     LUCINDA
          Your colors.

Wyatt nods his surprised thanks as the wagonmaster steps up:

                     WAGONMASTER
          Good luck, boys.  And give 'em hell!

They shake hands then Wyatt motions to his men.  They take off 
at a graceful lope, riding through camp toward the deadfall 
and the desert beyond.  Unable to contain himself any longer, 
Lucinda's son bounds up onto a wagon, waving and shouting, 
spurring them on with a spontaneous frontier toast:

                     LUCINDA'S SON
          Wyatt Earp, the two-gun man,
          Whistling death and bloody
          Murder!  Wyatt the widow-maker,
          Avenging and bright, purple
          Poison on horseback with
          Lightning in his eye and thunder
          In his heart!  Wyatt and his he-
          Devils, holy terrors and true,
          Five black centaurs blowin' fire
          And quicksilver!  Ride out and 
          Charge and shoot and strike and
          Cleave and hack and thrust home!
          Don't let up and give no rest and 
          Never call retreat till the last
          One's smashed and smote and
          Runnin' for cover.  Best 'em all
          And break 'em up and bang their
          Heads together in a bunch and
          Give no quarter though they be
          Ten times ten thousand!

Wyatt turns in the saddle, sweeping off his hat with a 
cavalier's flourish as he and his men take the deadfall in a 
single bound and pass into the desert.  An immigrant FATHER 
grabs his infant son, lifting him up.

                     ILLINOIS MOTHER
          What're you doing?

                     ILLINOIS FATHER
          Someday he'll be able to say he
          Was there when Wyatt Earp rode 
          Out to bring the law.

Music up, avenging and bright, as Wyatt and his men ride 
through the desert, 5 abreast on their giant chargers, glossy 
black coats shimmering in the sunlight, hoofbeats pounding in 
unison.

                     WYATT
          All right, let's wring 'em out!

They break into a dead run, streaking across the frame.  As 
they crest a rise the ground seems to drop from under them and 
for a single perfect moment it appears as if they're airborne, 
flying across the skyline like the winged horsemen of myth.  
Johnson turns to Vermillion, laughing at the sheer joy of 
being alive:

                     JOHNSON
          Like flyin', son.  Just like flyin'.

EXT - RUSTLERS PARK - LATE DAY

The sun just starts to dip behind the near end of the ridge 
overlooking the camp where on one side Florentino and several 
Cowboys sit in a circle, playing poker while others recline on 
bedrolls, laughing and drinking.  On the other side, at the 
foot of the ridge, Spence, Pony Deal, and 2 others crouch over 
a fire, cooking.  Suddenly the cattle nestled under the far 
end of the ridge start bleating.  Spence turns to Pony Deal 
who shrugs:

                     PONY DEAL
          Maybe they smell a wolf.

SPENCE
               (turns to other Cowboy)
          Go up there and take a look.

The Cowboy mount a pinto pony and lopes up and over the far 
side of the ridge.  Spence and the others continue cooking.  
Moments later a CRASHING SOUND comes echoing over the ridge 
like thunder.  The Cowboys look up, startled.  Pony Deal 
points:

                     PONY DEAL
          Look!

The pinto gallops riderless back over the ridge.  The Cowboys 
exchange confused glances, all attention focused on the far 
end of the ridge.  Then the five black horsemen ride out of 
the sun, gliding like apparitions up and over the near end of 
the ridge and bearing down on the unsuspecting camp with the 
speed of a flame.  They are within a few yards of the fire 
when Johnny Barnes suddenly spots them and:

                     BARNES
          Look out!

Spence and the others turn and just have time to gasp before 
Wyatt and his horsemen SLAM into them with terrifying impact, 
the bodies disappearing under their horses' hooves.  The 
Cowboys recoil in total shock, jumping up from bedrolls, 
stumbling in confusion, scrambling to get out of the way as 
the possemen plow through the fire and roar into camp, pistols 
BLAZING in air, horses rearing and snorting.

                     WYATT
          United States Marshals!  Reach!

Everyone freezes.  A worried-looking Florentino shrinks back 
behind the others, trying not to be spotted.  Meanwhile Doc 
leans down and pokes his pistol into a nearby Cowboy's 
forehead.

                     DOC
          Say something witty.

They herd the Cowboys over to one side of camp, shouting, "Get 
over there!",  "Move it!", etc.  But Barnes brazens up to 
Wyatt:

                     BARNES
          Hey, you can't come-

A loud crack as Wyatt's quirt lays his face open to the bone.

                     WYATT
          One more word and I'll blind you.
          Get over there!

                     PONY DEAL 
               (to McMasters)
          Hey brother, what're you doin'-

                     MCMASTERS
          I ain't your brother, I ain't
          None of your damn brothers.  Move!

                     WYATT
          All right, run 'em off.

Doc and Wyatt cover the Cowboys while the others scatter their 
herd with pistol shots.  Indignant, Swilling sneers at Wyatt:

                     SWILLING
          Bastard!  Stinkin' bastard!  Like
          To eat you blood raw!

A queer look in his eye, Wyatt dismounts and faces Swilling.

                     WYATT
          All right, breed.  Dig in.

And then Wyatt DRILLS him in the jaw with a straight right 
hand.  Swilling drops like a stone.  Wyatt hauls him up by the 
hair and hammers him left-right-left, steps around, digs down, 
and pile-drives a left hook to his gut.  Swilling topples back 
into a seated position then rolls over with a moan and passes 
out.  Meanwhile, seeing his chance, Florentino ducks down and 
makes for the remuda as Doc looks down at Swilling.

                     DOC
          It appears he missed an excellent 
          Chance to keep his mouth shut.

                     WYATT
               (faces Cowboys)
          Felt his liver go on that last
          One.  Get him to a doctor or he'll
          Be dead in a couple hours.

At the remuda Florentino leaps on a horse and gallops off 
bareback.  McMasters point, pulling his rifle from its 
scabbard:

                     MCMASTERS
          Florentino!  He's getting away!

                     WYATT
          Drop his horse.

McMasters draws a bead on the retreating form with his '76 
Winchester and FIRES.  100 yards away, the bullet hits 
Florentino's horse in the shoulder with a "thunk".  It drops, 
tumbling end over end and plunging Florentino face-first into 
the ground.  He jumps up, spitting out a mouthful, and starts 
running.  Wyatt leaps on this black and it streaks forward, 
closing the distance in seconds.  Florentino gasps and runs 
faster, pulling a bellygun from his sash, Wyatt almost on top 
of him.  He turns and FIRES on the run.  A branch next to 
Wyatt's head EXPLODES.  Wyatt keeps coming, drawing his 
Buntline, impervious, unstoppable.  Florentino turns for 
another shot just as the black PILES into him, sending him 
flying and tumbling him down an embankment.  He scrambles to 
his feet as Wyatt dismounts, starting toward him with 
deliberate step, eyes blazing, long-barreled pistol held in 
front of him.  Florentino backs up in terror, gun at his side, 
shaking his head:

                     FLORENTINO
          I don't kill your brother!  I 
          Don't even know him.  I was only
          Lookout.  It was money, they give
          Me twelve dollars!  It was money!

                     WYATT
          A human life.  Twelve dollars.

Wyatt nods, still coming, cold-blooded murder in his eye.  
Florentino screams, raising his gun:

                     FLORENTINO
          No!

Wyatt FIRES, blasting Florentino to the ground.  He advances, 
FIRING over and over, emptying his gun into him....

EXT - RUSTLER'S PARK - LATE DAY

The Cowboys watch as Wyatt gallops up, dragging Florentino's 
bullet-riddled body behind him.  He reins up, un-dallying the 
rope.  The corpse flops at their feet.  They jump back, 
horrified.

                     WYATT
          Look at him.  That's how you'll
          All end up if you don't get it
          Through your head: it's over,
          The Cowboys're finished.  Forever.
          So tell the others and get out of
          The Territory 'cause next time I
          Leave no one alive.  Understand?
          No one.  You been warned.
               (to his men)
          All right, burn it!  Everything!

As his men prepare to fire the camp, several Cowboys move to 
pick up Floretino's body, but:

                     WYATT
          Leave that trash where it lays.

EXT - RUSTLER'S PARK - DUSK

Wyatt and his men ride through the blazing camp, the flames 
lighting up his eyes like a demon's....

EXT - DESERT CAMP - NIGHT

The possemen crouch by their fire.  Doc sits shivering 
miserably by himself as Vermillion turns to Johnson.

                     VERMILLION
          You know, we might just pull this off.

                     JOHNSON
          Not so sure.  Somethin' tells me
          It gets harder from here in.
               (pauses)
          Should've held out for more money.

Meanwhile Wyatt and McMasters confer over a map.  Wyatt points 
to a specific point on the map, very interested:

                     WYATT
          I know that cut.  You mean there's
          A waterhole near there?

                     MCMASTERS
          But this time they'll be ready.

                     WYATT
          We'll see about that.

EXT - DESERT/MOUNTAIN CUT - DAY

Now we see what so interested Wyatt-it's the same mountain cut 
where he and Josephine met.  Pony Deal and a party of 10 
Cowboys ride through the desert 300 yards from the cut, 
pushing a herd.

                     PONY DEAL
          Keep your eyes open for Earp's 
          Bunch.  Swear to God, ain't gonna
          Get the drop on us this time.

                     1ST COWBOY
          Riders up ahead!  ...four, five.
          It's them all right!

They look.  Wyatt and his horsemen stand waiting at the mouth 
of the cut.  They tense, the 1st Cowboy squinting against the 
sun.  At the cut, Wyatt and his men poise themselves, Doc 
nodding:

                     DOC
          They saw us.  Here they come.

The Cowboys charge forward, outnumbering them better than 2 to 
1 and only 100 yards away.  The possemen choke up on their 
reins, alerting their horses for action as:

                     WYATT
          Wait... wait... steady...

75 yards and the first shots RING out, richochetting off the 
walls of the cut.  The others blanch but Wyatt stays cool, 
waiting, 50 yards... 40 yards... till we can see their eyes 
and:

                     WYATT
          Now!

They whirl around and disappear into the cut.  The Cowboys 
keep coming.  Wyatt's group reaches the little trail leading 
up the wall of the cut he used to avoid Josephine.  They 
clamber up the side of the cut at a bounding gallop, unseen, 
as moments later the Cowboys gallop by and continue through 
into the desert on the other side.  Wyatt's group careens up 
and around the high mountain wall as if on a roller-coaster, 
following the tiny, narrow path at a breathtaking clip, the 
trail finally plunging them back into the draw behind the 
Cowboys.  They speed up to the opposite mouth of the cut, 
drawing their pistols as the Cowboys gallop into the desert 
before them, unaware.

                     WYATT
          Lay on!

They CHARGE forward.  Seeing the empty desert ahead, the 
Cowboys pull up, looking around in confusion.  Suddenly a 
VOLLEY of GUNFIRE hits them from behind, knocking several from 
the saddle.  They spin around just as Wyatt's group SLAMS into 
them HEAD-ON, guns BLAZING, Cowboys tumbling from the saddle 
left and right, horses rearing and toppling over backwards.

                     PONY DEAL
          Run!

The remaining Cowboys turn and dash into the desert.  Wyatt 
shouts:

                     WYATT
          Come on!

Wyatt's group CHARGES, the thoroughbreds closing the distance 
in seconds.  Vermillion stands in his stirrups, roaring like 
an animal as he PLUNGES into them, swinging his quirt like a 
saber and LASHING a Cowboy across the face, making him tumble 
to the earth and bounce over the rocks like a rag doll.  
McMasters closes with another, throwing an arm around him and 
JERKING him from the saddle, SNAPPING his neck.  Doc overtakes 
a 3rd, jams his pistol into his face and FIRES point-blank, 
blackening his face with soot and BLOWING out the back of his 
head as he falls.  Reins in his teeth, shotgun at his 
shoulder, Johnson comes up behind a 4th and FIRES.  The 
Cowboy's head DISAPPEARS in a cloud of pink vapor, the body 
dropping like a stone....

Wyatt bears down on Pony Deal at a dead run.  Pony Deal turns 
in the saddle and FIRES at him.  We feel a surge of breathless 
exhilaration as Wyatt swings out of the saddle like a 
Commanche and ducks his body down against the side of his 
horse, hiding in its lee.  Pony Deal turns for another shot 
only to see an apparently riderless horse overtake him.  But 
in the next instant Wyatt darts around under his horse's neck 
and FIRES, blowing Pony Deal head-over-heels off the back of 
his horse.  Wyatt bounds back into the saddle as McMasters 
rides by, drawing a bead with his rifle on the lone survivor, 
the 1st Cowboy.  Only a few yards in front of them, he whips 
his horse frantically, trying to get away.  McMasters is about 
to fire when Wyatt rides up, deflecting the shot.  The Cowboy 
makes it over a rise and disappears.

                     MCMASTERS
          What'd you do that for?

                     WYATT
          So he can tell the story.

EXT - COWBOY CAMP - NIGHT

Curly Bill studies a map drawn in the dirt, listening with 
Ringo, Ike, etc. while the 1st Cowboy describes the battle:

                     1ST COWBOY
          Didn't make any sense.  One minute
          We're chasin' 'em, next they're
          Right on top of us.  We couldn't 
          Stop 'em, they got everybody.
          Just everybody!

                     CURLY BILL
          Easy now, it's only five men.
          Been havin' it their way 'cause
          They been surprising you.  Hittin'
          The waterholes and that Judas
          McMasters is showin' 'em right 
          Where they are.  Pretty damn cute.
          But nobody's cute as me.
               (points to dirt map)
          Next up's Black Draw.  But that
          Smart Wyatt'll say no, that's 
          Where they'll expect us to hit,
          We'll hit the one after.  Iron
          Springs.  That's where they show 
          Next.  Only I'm gonna be there
          First.  And throw a little party.

Curly Bill grins, his coarse face radiant in the firelight...

EXT - WYATT'S CAMP - NIGHT

Doc sits by the fire, shaking and shivering and sweating.  
Vermillion comes up and tries to cover him with a blanket, 
but:

                     DOC
          Don't touch me!

                     VERMILLION
          Sorry...

He pulls back.  Doc wraps himself in the blanket.  After a 
beat:

                     VERMILLION
          You really look awful.

                     DOC
          Not half as bad as I feel.

                     VERMILLION
          Then why in hell're you doin'
          This?  You ought to be in bed.

                     DOC
          Wyatt Earp is my friend.

                     VERMILLION
          Hell, I got lot's of friends.

                     DOC
               (turns, glares at him)
          I don't.

Meanwhile at the other side of the camp, Wyatt and McMasters 
huddle over the map, Johnson walks up:

                     JOHNSON
          Maybe you ought to have a talk
          With Doc, Wyatt.  I don't know if
          He's gonna make it.

                     WYATT
          There's no reasoning with him.

                     MCMASTERS
               (points to map)
          Next waterhole's Black Draw.  We
          Could be there by mid-morning.

                     WYATT
          They're wise by now.  Which is
          Next, Iron Springs?  Yeah, let's
          Try there, Iron Springs.

EXT - IRON SPRINGS - DAWN

A camp near a waterhole with 2 Cowboys crouched by a fire, 
sipping coffee.  Wyatt's men ride up to the rocks overlooking 
it and dismount, unseen.

                     MCMASTERS
          There they are.  No herd though.

                     WYATT
          We'll go around that way, come up on foot.

They pull shotguns from their saddles and start down over the 
rocks on foot, creeping up on the camp, seemingly undetected.  
But suddenly the Cowboys by the fire dive behind a log and:

                     MCMASTERS
          Ambush!  Get down!

And suddenly the deadfall on the opposite side EXPLODES IN 
GUNFIRE.  Vermillion takes a graze and drops with the others, 
hugging the rocks.  A bullet RICHOCHETS into a rock at 
Johnson's head, biting his face with fragments, making him 
wince:

                     JOHNSON
          Christ!

Hunched behind the logs on the opposite side with 15 more 
Cowboys, Curly Bill raises his head, grinning and shouting:

                     CURLY BILL
          Hey, Wyatt!  How the hell are you?

Wyatt and his men react to his voice.  The fire continues.  
Suddenly there's MOVEMENT in the rocks above them.  Doc 
points:

                     DOC
          Look!

                     CURLY BILL
          Got some boys workin' around
          Those rocks behind you.  Another
          Minute or two, gonna have you in 
          A crossfire!  How do you like that?

Seeing the spot they're in, McMasters turns to the silent 
Wyatt:

                     MCMASTERS
          He's right.  They get set up in
          Them rocks it's the end for us.

And now for the first time we see fear in these men, actual 
naked fear.  But Curly Bill laughs, having the time of his 
life.

                     CURLY BILL
          'Course you could give yourselves
          up and we could have a party!
          Then what larks!

Crouched by Curly Bill, Barnes chuckles.  A confident ripple 
of laughter goes through the Cowboy line-they know they've got 
them.  On the other side, Vermillion shakes his head grimly.

                     VERMILLION
          Ain't takin' me alive, damn it!

McMasters looks at the still silent Wyatt, shrugging 
helplessly:

                     MCMASTERS
          Think of somethin' fast or we're cooked.

They really are at the end of their rope, all looking to Wyatt 
for a solution.  He remains silent.  Then suddenly, in this 
supreme moment, a strange, almost supernatural calm seems to 
come over him and he says simply:

                     WYATT
          No.

                     JOHNSON
          What?

                     WYATT
          No.

And now we can almost hear the ether RINGING in our ears as 
Wyatt takes his shotgun and, while the others look on in 
horror, rises to his feet.

                     DOC
          Wyatt!

Bullets WHIZ around him.  Doc jumps up to grab him but a 
RICOCHET drives him back down.  Wyatt advances quickly across 
the clearing, walking right into the teeth of their guns, 
repeating:

                     WYATT
          No...

Wyatt's clothes jerk and ripple as bullets pass through, but 
he just keeps coming.  Seeing this, Curly Bill also stands, a 
weird, manic elation coming over him.  He hoots and howls:


                     CURLY BILL
          Look at that!  Yeah!  Come and get
          Some, boy!

                     WYATT
          No...

Curly Bill waves away his men's fire and walks toward Wyatt, 
12 gauge shotgun in one hand, .45 in the other, BLASTING away.

                     CURLY BILL
          Let me, let me, yeah!  Die, you 
          Bastard...

                     WYATT
          No...

Curly Bill FIRES again.  Wyatt's hat flies off.  He FIRES 
again, digging a gash in Wyatt's boot-heel.  Now Curly Bill 
takes dead aim with his .45 and-CLICK-it's empty.  He tosses 
it aside.  Suddenly a sharp wind gusts up, making the tails of 
Wyatt's duster swirl around him like a halo as he advances.  
Eyes wild with battle rage, Curly Bill quickly raises his 
shotgun.

                     CURLY BILL
          Die!  Son of a bitch!  Die!

He FIRES.  Wyatt's coattails EVAPORATE into swirling shreds as 
he takes deliberate aim with his mighty 10 gauge, hissing 
through clenched teeth:

                     WYATT
          No!

And with that, Wyatt lets go with BOTH BARRELS.  Curly Bill's 
mid-section VAPORIZES, the huge double-charge of buckshot 
RIPPING HIM COMPLETELY IN HALF.  The other Cowboys flinch as 
they're sprayed with flecks of blood and gore.  Barnes 
screams:

                     BARNES
          Jesus Christ!

                     WYATT
          No!

Eyes burning like two twin hells, Wyatt pulls his Buntline and 
FIRES.  Barnes doubles over.  Wyatt FIRES again.  Barnes 
drops.  The others recoil, their faces looking as if they are 
living in a waking nightmare as Wyatt advances on them, STILL 
FIRING.  Another goes down.  Doc leaps from the rocks, gun in 
hand, and:

                     DOC
          Come on!

Now they all rise and OPEN FIRE, advancing 4 abreast, a WALL 
OF GUNFIRE driving the remaining Cowboys off, running for 
their horses.  Wyatt keeps snapping his empty gun as the 
others run up.

                     WYATT
          No...

Beside himself, Doc helps Wyatt to a nearby rock, sitting him 
down and examining him, running his hands all over his body.  
The others FIRE at the Cowboys retreating on horseback.

                     DOC
          Wyatt, my God!  You're shot to pieces!

                     WYATT
          No...

                     VERMILLION
          Yeah, better run, you bastards!

                     JOHNSON
               (turn to Doc)
          How is he?

                     DOC
               (looks up, amazed)
          I don't believe it.  He's clean!

                     VERMILLION
          What?  But I saw 'em-

                     DOC
          I'm telling you, there isn't a
          Mark on him.

They look.  Meanwhile Wyatt starts to tremble....

EXT - CAMP - NIGHT

They're camped by a running stream.  Wyatt stares into the 
fire.  Doc crouches opposite him, shaking his head:

                     DOC
          I'm a man without fear, Wyatt.  I
          Literally don't care if I live or
          Die.  But even I can't fight human
          Instinct.  Somebody suddenly
          Starts shooting at me, I duck.
          But you... what on earth were
          You thinking about?

                     WYATT
          I don't know.  It all happened so
          Fast.  If I'd had a chance to
          Think about it I guess I probably
          Would've been scared but... Swear
          To God, Doc, I just don't know.

At the other end of camp, Vermillion and Johnson sit together.  
After a beat:

                     VERMILLION
          Hey Creek, you ever see anything
          Like that before?

                     JOHNSON
          Never even heard of anything like it.

Vermillion nods.  Both look shaken to the very core of their 
beings.  Finally:

                     VERMILLION
          I just thought of somethin' I 
          Never thought about before.
               (pauses, looks at him)
          I don't want to go to hell.

EXT - CAMP - MORNING

Wyatt sits by the fire, sipping coffee.  Vermillion and 
Johnson approach.  Johnson drops a wad of money on Wyatt's 
bedroll.  Wyatt looks up in surprise:

                     VERMILLION
          Talked it over.  We decided we
          Don't need the money.  Took out 13
          Dollars each, though.  Federal
          Posseman's fee.  That all right?

                     WYATT
          Sure...

                     JOHNSON
          One thing.  We come through this
          Alive, can we keep the badges?

Wyatt nods, picks up the money and quietly moves off toward 
the stream by himself.  Moments later, McMasters approaches:

                     MCMASTERS
          Where's Wyatt?

                     DOC
          Down at the creek.  Walking on water.

EXT - COWBOY CAMP - NIGHT

Ringo crouches by the fire with the other Cowboys, his face a 
deeply shadowed mask.  2 Iron Springs survivors stand before 
him:

                     1ST COWBOY
          We hit him half a dozen times but
          He just kept comin', walked right
          Up to Curly Bill with that 10
          Gauge and blew him up!

                     RINGO
          Curly Bill?  He killed Curly Bill?

Ringo starts making strange little inarticulate sounds, 
inhaling and exhaling like an animal, eyes swimming in 
panic....


                     2ND COWBOY
          He didn't just kill him, he
          Burned him down!  Blew him in
          Half!  I mean all the way in half,
          Like a melon!  Then he turned 
          Around with that big Colt and 
          Killed Johnny Barnes, shot up a
          Couple more 'fore we got out of 
          there.  But it was his face, you 
          should've seen his face.

                     RINGO
          He's just a man.

                     1ST COWBOY
          You didn't see his face

Ringo looks up at them, suddenly dead calm, his face a blank.

                     RINGO
          You see my face, don't you?

Out of nowhere, Ringo draws and FIRES 2 shots so quickly they 
sound like one.  The 2 survivors drop with bullets through 
their brains.  The others jump, transfixed by the insane 
brutality of what he's just done.  Ringo draws himself up, in 
full possession of the situation, the new leader, fearsome, 
matchless:

                     RINGO
          Everybody get this through their
          Heads.  Wyatt Earp dies.  I'm 
          Running the show now and I'm 
          Telling you, Earp dies.  His men
          Too.  They all die.  Understand?
          We're gonna kill 'em.  For what
          They did to Curly Bill we're
          Gonna ride 'em into the ground
          And slaughter 'em like rabbits.
          'Cause this is my time, children.
          This is where I get woolly.

EXT - COWBOY CAMP - NIGHT

Later.  Most of the others are asleep or talking among 
themselves as Billy Grounds turns to Zwing Hunt, whispering:

                     GROUNDS
          What d'you think?  I didn't think
          Curly Bill could be killed.  I'm 
          Tellin' you, this whole thing's
          Gone sour.  We got hands droppin'
          Like flies and Ringo's flat out
          Of his mind.  I mean, hell
          Brother, you feel like ridin'
          Against Wyatt Earp?

                     HUNT
          Hell no, brother.

                     GROUNDS
          Then brother let's you and me cut out.

                     HUNT
          Right with you, brother.

They steal away toward the horses as....

INT - ALLEN STREET - DAY

Ringo faces Behan, grim, intent, while Behan sputters, holding 
up a San Francisco newspaper:

                     BEHAN
          Are you crazy?  It's front page
          News all over the country.  It's
          Getting out of hand, Ringo.  If
          Things don't settle down soon-

                     RINGO
          You heard me, Behan.

                     BEHAN
          Ringo, you don't understand-

Ringo glares at Behan, his eyes burning, implacable:

                     RINGO
          No, you don't understand.

EXT - COWBOY CAMP - DAY

Ringo rides up with Behan and dismounts.  A 3rd Cowboy steps 
up:

                     3RD COWBOY
          Billy Grounds and Zwing Hunt ran
          Out.  Four, five others, too.

                     RINGO
          Who cares?  Separate the wheat
          From the chaff.

Behan looks worried as Ike and the other Cowboys gather 
around.  Just then Breakenridge rides up.

                     BEHAN
          What're you doing here, Billy?

                     BREAKENRIDGE
          Curly Bill was my friend.  I'd 
          Like to come with you.

                     RINGO
          Sure, why not?

Ringo slaps the little deputy on the back and turns to his 
men.  His unaccustomed good humor is very troubling.

                     RINGO
          I told you it was time to get
          Woolly.  Now gather 'round,
          Children, gather 'round.  And
          Raise your right hands.

EXT - DESERT - DAY

Now we've come full circle as Ringo rides across the desert at 
the head of his men 30 strong, armed to the teeth, full of 
fight-and all wearing Deputy Sheriff's BADGES, a posse of 
outlaws, a miserable Behan bringing up the rear....

EXT - DESERT PLATEAU - DAY

Wyatt and his men watch from a plateau as far out on the 
horizon, the Cowboy Posse rides out of the sun, drawing 
closer:

                     MCMASTERS
          That's Ringo out front.  And
          There's Behan.  Must be 30 of 'em.
          What the hell... they're wearin'
          Badges.

They all exchange looks of disbelief, then:

                     WYATT
          Mounts're getting jaded.  We're 
          Gonna have to find a place to
          Rest 'em up.

Suddenly looking very sick, Doc sways dizzily in the saddle.  
Wyatt dismounts, reaching for him.  The others do the same:

                     WYATT
          Doc...

                     DOC
          Don't touch me, God damn it!  Just
          Don't touch me!  Come on...

Doc turns his horse, as if to ride on, then faints dead away.

                     WYATT
          Grab him.

They all catch him, easing him to the ground as....

EXT - HOOKER'S RANCH - DAY

Wyatt's group rides over the hill overlooking the ranch house 
Vermillion keeping Doc in the saddle.  Hooker and 3 of his 
hands rides out to them:

                     WYATT
          Horse're pretty well fagged and
          We got a sick man with us.

                     HOOKER
          You can put up at my ranch if you want.

Wyatt nods.  Hooker motions down the hill toward his house....

INT- BEDROOM, HOOKER'S RANCH - LATE DAY

Doc lies in bed, semi-conscious, white as a sheet, drenched in 
sweat.  The others look on, worried.  Hooker shakes his head:

                     HOOKER
          I'm no doctor but he looks pretty bad.

His face creased with worry, Wyatt sits down next to Doc.  
McMasters motions to the others.  They file out, leaving Wyatt 
alone with his friend....

EXT - HILL OVERLOOKING CROSSROADS - SUNSET

Grounds and Hunt ride up and stop on the top of a hill 
overlooking a mountain crossroads somewhere in the Whetstones.

                     HUNT
          What's it gonna be, brother?

                     GROUNDS
          I don't care.  Colorado, New 
          Mexico, 'long as we're out of the 
          Territory.

Suddenly a STAGECOACH comes into view, making its winding way 
through the crossroads below.  Hunt points, grinning:

                     HUNT
          Just what we need.  Travelin' money.

They spur their horses down the hill, drawing their guns....

EXT - COWBOY CAMP # 2 - NIGHT

The Cowboy posse is camped in a draw up in the Whetstones.  
They look up as the stage rolls up and stops.  Shouting and 
commotion as Behan and Breakenridge approach and confer with 
the driver, then Behan turns to Ringo:

                     BEHAN
          Robbery.  2 men stuck 'em up and
          Killed a passenger.  One of 'em
          Rode a Mexican saddle, the other 
          Had a Mother Hubbard.  Billy
          Grounds and Zwing Hunt.

Behan opens the door.  Mr. Fabian lies inside cradled in 
Josephine's arms, surrounded by the other actors in the 
troupe.  Reclined at full length, head back, he looks like the 
dying Hamlet, even more beautiful than in life.  Breakenridge 
gasps:


                     BREAKENRIDGE
          Oh, no...

                     JOSEPHINE
          We're headed for a booking in
          Denver.  They tried to take my
          Watch.  He cursed them for cowards
          And they shot him.  He may've been
          Vain and an actor but he was
          Better than all of you.  And
          Gentler and braver.  I don't
          Understand any of this, I only
          Know it's ugly.  You're all ugly
          And he was beautiful, he tried to
          Put something fine into your ugly
          World and you killed him for it.
          Anyway the ones who did it are 
          headed north.  Not that you care.

Ringo shrugs.  His soft face suddenly turning resolute.  
Breakenridge goes to his horse and mounts.

                     BEHAN
          Where're you going?  Get back here!

The little deputy straightens his spectacles, turning to 
Behan:

                     BILLY
          I'm sorry, sir, but we got to 
          Have some law.

And he rides off alone into the Whetstones.  Behan sputters, 
but:

                     RINGO
          Let him go.  Who cares?

EXT - HOOKER'S RANCH - NIGHT

The stage is stopped out front.  The driver waters the horses 
and the actors mill around silently.  Wyatt and Hooker walk 
out:

                     HOOKER
          Had a holdup.  Came her to water
          Their horses before pushin' on.

Seeing each other, Wyatt and Josephine freeze.  Wyatt 
approaches:

                     WYATT
          Sorry about your friend.
               (pauses)
          And I'm sorry about...

                     JOSEPHINE
          I forgave you the moment you said it.

                     WYATT
          You did.  Well... thank you.

The driver jumps back onto the stage, motioning to the others.

                     JOSEPHINE
          I have to go.

                     WYATT
          Wait!

She stops.  Wyatt falters.  There's so much he wants to say, 
but... Finally:

                     WYATT
          Goodbye.

Wyatt opens the coach door for her.  She gets in.  It pulls 
out with a crack of the driver's whip.  She and Wyatt hold 
each other's gaze as the stage recedes into the distance.  
Then:

                     WYATT
          Damn... Damn!

Creek Johnson steps up next to him.  Wyatt looks at him:

                     WYATT
          See how she breezed out of here.
          Like she had wings.  Funny thing
          But I can't really remember how
          She looked.  I can remember parts
          Of her clear as crystal, her
          Mouth, her walk, how she shut her
          Eyes when she laughed, little
          Bits and pieces, but not the
          Whole package.  Can't put it
          Together for some reason.

                     JOHNSON
          Good God, you're really-

                     WYATT
          Cards in spades.  I'm in love with
          Every second of her life.  Hell,
          I'll probably love her when I'm dust.

EXT - COLD CAMP - NIGHT

A cold camp in the hollow of a mountain.  Wrapped n blankets, 
Grounds and Hunt sip cold coffee.  Grounds shivers.  Hunts 
pats him:

                     HUNT
          No fire tonight, son.  Too many 
          Riders out.


Grounds grunts.  Suddenly there's an O.S. SOUND.  Both jump 
up.

                     HUNT
          Who's that?

Breakenridge steps from the shadows, Winchester at his 
shoulder, squinting through the dark with his spectacles.

                     BREAKENRIDGE
          It's Deputy Breakenridge.

They relax and lower their pistols, heaving sighs of relief.

                     HUNT
          Sister Boy!  Thank God, we was afraid-

                     BREAKENRIDGE
          You shouldn't've killed Mr.
          Fabian.  You shouldn't've done
          That.  It was wrong.  I'm takin'
          You both in for it.

                     HUNT
          What?  You gotta be kiddin'.  Look,
          Just go home 'fore you get hurt.

                     BREAKENRIDGE
          Don't want to kill you but I will
          If I have to.  I'm warning you.

                     GROUNDS
          No, I'm warning you, Sister Boy!

Grounds steps forward menancingly.  Breakenridge tenses:

                     BREAKENRIDGE
          Don't try it!

                     GROUNDS
          Sister Boy, just go to hell!

Grounds raises his pistol.  Breakenridge recoils in fright, 
stumbling backward in the dark, and his rifle accidentally 
FIRES.  Grounds drops like a stone, a look of utter disbelief 
on his dying face.  Hunt looks at him in shock then turns on 
Breakenridge, raising his gun and snarling.  Breakenridge 
FIRES again.  Hunt grabs his midsection, dropping his gun and 
falling to his knees.  He looks up at Breakenridge who shrugs 
timidly:

                     BREAKENRIDGE
          Sorry.

Hunt falls over, dead.  Breakenridge stares at the bodies, 
hardly believing it himself....

EXT - FRONT PORCH, HOOKER'S RANCH - MORNING

Wyatt and his men are on the porch, listening to Hooker:

                     HOOKER
          ...brought 'em in draped over
          their saddles.  Little Billy
          Breakenridge.  Sister Boy.  He done
          It.  So I guess the law's finally
          Arrived in southeast Arizona.

Wyatt shakes his head, hardly comprehending what he 
started....

EXT - COWBOY CAMP #3 - DAY

The Cowboys are camped on a mountaintop overlooking Hooker's 
ranch in the valley below.  A messenger rides up with a letter 
for Behan as Ringo paces, studying the set up with Ike.

                     RINGO
          Hooker's got around 15 or 16 
          Hands.  We could take 'em right
          Enough but it might be a mess.
          Keep the place bottled up for 
          Now, see if we can figure a way
          To flush 'em.

Behan suddenly steps up, beside himself, holding up his 
message:

                     BEHAN
          It's too much!  It's completely
          Out of hand!  Governor Gosper's 
          Talking about asking the 
          President to send in the Army!  
          Listen Ringo, you've got to get 
          This over with and you've got to
          Do it now.  One way or another.

EXT - FRONT PORCH, HOOKER'S RANCH - LATE DAY

Wyatt stands on the front porch, looking through the front 
door to the back bedroom where Doc lies unconscious while 
Hooker and the others look on:

                     WYATT
          We should get moving.

                     VERMILLION
          Doc's just in no kinda shape.

                     HOOKER
          Don't have to bother about that.
          Took a vote.  Cowboys or not, you
          Can stay here as long as you want.
          Anyway maybe you done enough.  I
          Mean you whittled 'em down
          Considerable, now there's talk of
          Sendin' the Army in here.  Ask me,
          You done enough.

                     RANCH HAND 
               (rides up, points)
          Rider comin' in under a white flag

They look up as the 3rd Cowboy rides up with a white kerchief.

                     3RD COWBOY
          Got a message.  Ringo wants 
          McMaster to come over to our 
          Camp for a parley.

                     MCMASTERS
          He didn't figure on all the stink
          This is causin'.  Might be he's 
          lookin' to strike a bargain.  If
          So, he probably figures he needs
          Somebody like me who talks his
          Language.  Could be we got him.

                     WYATT
          I don't like it.

                     MCMASTERS
          Might as well hear him out.
          Anyways, what choice we got?
               (Mounts horse, whispers)
          But no matter what happens, see
          It through to the end.  If you 
          don't I'll curse the day I ever
          laid eyes on you.

Before Wyatt can answer, McMasters rides off with the 
Cowboy....

EXT - HOOKER HILL COWBOY CAMP #3 - LATE DAY

McMasters rides up with the 3rd Cowboy.  Riding through camp, 
all his former comrades flares at him with pure hate.  Only 
Ringo smiles, stepping up as McMasters dismounts.

                     RINGO
          Well hello, Sherm.

                     MCMASTERS
          You wanted to talk?

                     RINGO
          Yeah, kinda, wanted to see if 
          you'd join back up with us.

                     MCMASTERS
          That what you got me up here for?

                     RINGO
          You're a Cowboy, you're a 
          Brother.  Come back, no hard
          Feelings.

                     MCMASTERS
          Forget it, Ringo.

                     RINGO
          Isn't there anything I can say
          That'll change your mind?  You're
          Gonna stay with your new friends?

                     MCMASTERS
          'Least they don't scare women.

                     RINGO
          You're the boss.  One thing, though.

Ringo moves closer, looking him in the eye and smiling:

                     RINGO
          How you gonna get back to 'em?

EXT - HOOKER'S RANCH - LATE DAY

The 3rd Cowboy rides up to the ranch house, dumps a large 
SOMETHING in front, and gallops back to just within earshot as 
Wyatt and his men run up.  The object is a human corpse and 
though we can't see what was done to it, the expressions on 
their faces are plain enough. 

                     VERMILLION
          Why couldn't they've jus killed him?

                     3RD COWBOY
               (shouts)
          Ringo wanted to be sure he got
          Your attention, Marshal.  He wants
          A straight-up fight, just you and
          Him, settle this thing once and
          For all.  You win, we quit the
          Territory; Ringo wins, your
          Deputies get safe conduct to the 
          Colorado line.  Sundown today in
          The oak grove at the mouth of
          Sulphur Springs Canyon.  Ride out
          With your escort, we'll meet you.

                     WYATT
          You tell Ringo... just tell him
          I'll be there.

                     JOHNSON
          Wyatt, are you crazy?

                     WYATT
          I made a promise.

                     VERMILLION
          Wyatt, listen, you can't beat
          Him.  You're good and God knows 
          You got the courage, but you
          Ain't in Ringo's class.  Hell,
          He's the best that's ever been.
          'Cept maybe for Wild Bill.

                     JOHNSON
          He's right, Wyatt.  Ringo could
          Put five into you before you
          Could even get one into him.

                     WYATT
          But I'd do it, I'd get that one
          Into him.  So help me God, I would.

                     JOHNSON
          All right Wyatt, maybe you can.
          But you gotta die to do it.
          Understand?  You gotta die!

In tight on Wyatt as these words sink in and....

INT - BEDROOM, HOOKER RANCH - LATE DAY

It's late and the last rays of the sun come through the 
window, falling on the bed where Doc lies, awake but looking 
like hell.  Wyatt sits next to him, staring at the floor.  
After a moment:

                     WYATT
          What makes a man like Ringo, Doc?
          What makes him do the things he does?

                     DOC
          A man like Ringo's got a great
          Empty hole right through the
          Middle of him and no matter what
          He does he can't ever fill it.  He
          Can't kill enough or steal enough
          Or inflict enough pain to ever
          Fill it.  And it drives him mad.
          Sick mad.  Cold and dirty.

                     WYATT
          So what does he want?

                     DOC
          What does he want?  He wants revenge.

                     WYATT
          Revenge?  For what?

Doc looks at him, a look of purest sadness in his sunken eyes.

                     DOC
          Being born.

Wyatt looks down again and it's a long time before he speaks:

                     WYATT
          Remember how I said it all
          Happened so fast with Curly Bill
          I didn't have time to think about it?
          Well I've had plenty of time
          To think about this.  I spent most
          Of my life since I was born not
          Knowing what I want out of life,
          Just chasin' my tail.  But now,
          For the first time I know exactly
          What I want.  And who.  And that's
          The damnable misery of it.
               (pauses, looks at Doc)
          I can't beat him, can I?

Doc shakes his head.  Wyatt nods then stands, ready to exit, 
but:

                     DOC
          No, wait, I'll go with you...

Doc struggles to sit up, sweating and trembling, finally 
falling back down, almost passing out.  Wyatt puts a hand on 
his forehead.

                     DOC
          I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Wyatt.  God,
          I'm so sorry.

                     WYATT
          That's all right, Doc.  Don't worry.

                     DOC
          Never got to wear one of those.

Doc points to Wyatt's badge.  He takes it off, pressing it 
into Doc's hand.  Doc smiles then does pass out.  Wyatt 
exits....

EXT - FRONT PORCH, HOOKER RANCH - LATE DAY

It's late, almost sunset.  Wyatt steps onto the porch where 
Hooker and the others wait.  He glances back into the house, 
looking at the unconscious Doc through the open bedroom door.

                     HOOKER
          Don't worry.  They want him
          They'll have to go over us first.

Wyatt nods gratefully, offering his hand.  Hooker takes it, 
abashed.  Wyatt mounts up with Johnson and Vermillion.  They 
ride off at a slow gallop, 3 figures against the twilight 
sky....

EXT - HOOKER HILL/COWBOY CAMP #3 - LATE DAY

Ringo waits atop the hill with Ike and the 3rd Cowboy watching 
as Wyatt's group rides out:

                     RINGO
          Only three.  They left somebody
          Behind.  Let's go take a look.

EXT - HOOKER RANCH - LATE DAY

Ringo and the others ride up.  Hooker steps up with several 
hands.

                     HOOKER
          What're you doin' here?

                     RINGO
          Who's in there?

                     HOOKER
          It's Holliday.  He's sick.  Imagine
          He's dyin'.

Ringo squints through the front door of the house to the open 
bedroom where Doc lies unconscious, chest heaving, sweating.

                     RINGO
          Drag him out here, let's have a look.

                     HOOKER
          I looked the other way when you
          Did a lot of foul things but I
          Ain't lettin' you torment a dyin'
          Man.  Not as long as he's under my
          Roof.  I draw the line there.

Hooker and his men look resolute.  Ringo smiles, nodding:

                     RINGO
          All right, Hooker.  I'll be back
          In about an hour.  We'll see how
          Brave you are then.

                     HOOKER
          I'll be here.

Ringo and his men ride off.  At the crossroads they stop, Ike 
peeling off.

                     RINGO
          Soon as I'm through with Wyatt,
          Swarm down with the whole bunch
          And finish off Creek Johnson and
          Texas Jack.

And they gallop off in opposite directions as....

EXT - SULPHUR SPRINGS CANYON - LATE DAY

2 Cowboys, Ringo's seconds, ride up to where Wyatt and his men 
stand dismounted, waiting.  One points to a thicket nearby:

                     3RD COWBOY
          He's waitin' for you by the big
          Oak, quarter mile up that trail.

EXT - NORTH ROAD - LATE DAY

Behan and the other Cowboys wait at the road above the canyon.  
30 strong, mounted and ready.  Ike rides up, full of 
anticipation:

                     IKE
          Get ready.  Soon as Ringo's done
          We're gonna take care of the others.

                     BEHAN
          Aren't we giving them safe conduct?

                     IKE
          Sure we are.  All the way to hell.

EXT - SULPHUR SPRINGS CANYON - SUNSET

Sunset.  Ringo's seconds wait nearby as Wyatt whispers to his 
men:

                     WYATT
          They're not givin' you any safe
          Conduct.  Soon as the shooting
          Starts kick east for the New
          Mexico line.  Well...

Wyatt shakes hands with Vermillion who turns away with 
emotion, hiding his face.  Wyatt turns to Johnson.

                     JOHNSON
          Wyatt, I... I ain't got the words.

                     WYATT
          I know.  Me neither.

Wyatt pats his shoulder and walks off alone into the thicket, 
the only sound the musical clinking and chiming of his 
spurs....

EXT - THICKET - SUNSET

A gorgeous sunset, yellow and red and magenta.  Making his way 
down the trail, Wyatt looks up at the sky.  A flock of wild 
geese fly overhead in V-formation, oblivious to the human 
drama below.  Wyatt stops, drinking it all in, as if trying to 
grab all he can in the time left.  Suddenly he closes his 
eyes, falling to his knees, trembling, afraid for the first 
time.  He clasps his hands:

                     WYATT
          Dear God, this is the last 
          Battle.  I worked it out in my
          Head every which way and I know 
          There's no way I'm comin' through
          This alive.  You've preserved me
          This far so I only ask one more
          Favor: just let me live long
          Enough to kill that man.  Thy will
          Be done and there's an amen to it.

Wyatt stands back up, his fear gone, replaced by calm, his 
face luminous, almost angelic.  He walks on, spurs still 
chiming as....

EXT - OAK GROVE - SUNSET

A clearing by a creek with a cluster of small oaks.  Ringo  
leans against a tree, sipping from a hip flask, smoking a slim 
cheroot.  We HEAR the CHIMING spurs approach.  Ringo looks up 
as the tall silhouette of his enemy emerges from the shadows 
of the thicket.

                     RINGO
          Well, didn't think you had it in you.
               (smiles, sets himself)
          Shall we?

                     DARK SILHOUETTE
          I'm your huckleberry.

Ringo stiffens as the silhouette steps into the waning light.  
It's DOC, pale and drawn, looking like death itself, but awake 
and ready just the same:

                     DOC
          Why Johnny Ringo, you look like
          Somebody just walked over your grave.
               (sees his shock)
          Oh, I wasn't quite as sick as I 
          Made out.

                     RINGO
          My fight's not with you, Holliday.

                     DOC
          I beg to differ.  We started a
          Fight we never got to finish.
          Play for blood, remember?

                     RINGO
          I was kidding about that.

For the last time, that Cheshire cat smile comes over Doc's 
face:

                     DOC
          I wasn't.
               (pins on Wyatt's badge)
          And this time it's legal.

Ringo nods, his hock replaced by a growing malice.  As they 
set themselves, once again their eyes begin to blaze, boring 
into each other, their concentrated rage focusing on each 
other, about to reach critical mass....

                     RINGO
          All right, lunger.  Let's do it.

                     DOC
          Say when.

A long tense moment then both grunt in unison.  Blurred 
movement, the FLASH of a GUNSHOT.  Doc slaps his gun back in 
it's holster as Ringo stumbles, a bullet hole in the side of 
his head....

EXT - THICKET - SUNSET

Back in the thicket, Wyatt HEARS the gunshot and starts 
running...

EXT - OAK GROVE - SUNSET

Blood coursing from the hole in his head, frenzied messages 
flickering all through his shattered brain, going only on pure 
hate, Ringo stumbles and jerks, struggling to raise his 
pistol.  Doc dances in front of him, urging him on:

                     DOC
          Come on!  Come on!

But finally Ringo falls over into the crook of the oak tree, 
his pistol firing into the air harmlessly.  Doc looks down at 
him, shaking his head:

                     DOC
          Oh Johnny.  You're no daisy, no
          Daisy at all.

Just then Wyatt appears, looking at Doc in total shock.

                     WYATT
          What happened?

Doc looks at him like he's a fool then points to Ringo:

                     DOC
          Poor soul, he was so high-strung.
          Afraid the strain was more than 
          He could bear.

Suddenly we hear HORSES crashing through the brush toward 
them.

                     DOC
          Let's go!  My horse is over here.

They dash off into the thicket.  Moments later Ringo's seconds 
ride out into the grove.  Seeing Ringo's body, their jaws 
drop....

EXT - CANYON MOUTH - SUNSET

Vermillion and Johnson practically jump for joy as Wyatt and 
Doc emerge from the thicket, Doc leading his horse.

                     VERMILLION
          Praise Jesus!

                     JOHNSON
          I'll be dipped in shit.  I will, too.

EXT - NORTH ROAD - SUNSET

Alert by the shots, Ike turns to Behan and the others.

                     IKE
          All right, get ready...

EXT - CANYON MOUTH - SUNSET

Vermillion and Johnson are mounted, watching while Doc tries 
to climb up into the saddle with excruciating slowness.  
Though on his feet, it's clear Doc is as sick as ever, 
sweating and panting, running on sheer animal courage.  Wyatt 
stands behind him, his hands poised to help, trying to will 
him into the saddle, jerking his hands behind him every time 
Doc looks back.  Finally, with a last grunt, Doc throws a leg 
over his horse and drops into the saddle.  Wyatt mounts, turns 
to his men, pointing:

                     WYATT
          All right, what's it to be?  New
          Mexico's that way.

                     JOHNSON
          Colorado's closer

                     WYATT
          So're the Cowboys.  They're up
          That road right now, waiting to
          Jump us.

                     VERMILLION
          We're the law, ain't we?  Well the
          Law don't ride around vermin-

                     JOHNSON
          It rides right at 'em.  Like
          McMasters said, see it through to
          The end.

Wyatt looks at Doc, who shrugs.  Wyatt swings his horse 
alongside, suddenly noticing his badge on Doc's chest.  Doc 
smiles wanly:

                     DOC
          I just wanted to see what it felt
          Like.  Here...

He starts unpinning it but Wyatt stops him, pressing his palm 
onto the badge over Doc's heart.   A last look around each 
other then Wyatt signals and they start up the north road at 
the lope, four abreast, the last charge of Wyatt Earp and his 
immortals....

EXT - NORTH ROAD - SUNSET

From a lookout position above, a COWBOY calls down to the 
others:

                     4TH COWBOY
          Riders comin'.

Behan heaves a sigh of relief, glancing around at the others.

                     BEHAN
          Well I guess Ringo did it.

But suddenly Ringo's seconds gallop up from the flank:

                     3RD COWBOY
          Ringo's dead

                     BEHAN
          What?

Straining to see in the falling light, the cowboy on the rock 
shouts excitedly:

                     4TH COWBOY
          That's Wyatt Earp's bunch!

The word starts to spread, the crowd of horsemen BUZZING.  
Suddenly, off in the distance, the 4 horsemen come into view, 
coming straight at them at a lope.

                     3RD COWBOY
          They're comin' right at us!

Down the road, Wyatt asnd his men pull their shotguns, holding 
them at the ready as they break into a gallop.  The Cowboy on 
the rock jumps down, mounting his horse.

                     4TH COWBOY
          Here they come!  Get ready...

The Cowboys line-up on a rise, blocking the road.  They draw 
their guns.  Wyatt and his men keep coming, now 200 yards 
away.  Behan groans, panic sinking sour and heavy, churning 
his bowels:

                     BEHAN
          Oh, no...

Now Wyatt's men break into a dead run, hurtling toward them at 
top speed, their thoroughbreds eating up the distance, now 
only 100 yards away.  The Cowboys tense up more and more, 
biting lips, grinding teeth.  The 4th Cowboy turns to the 
nearby 3rd Cowboy:

                     4TH COWBOY
          What d'you think?

                     3RD COWBOY
          I think it's time to start
          Workin' for a livin'.

                     BEHAN
          Me too!

They break and run.  So does another.  Suddenly the whole mass 
of them EXPLODES in panic with horsemen riding in all 
directions, scurrying away like cockroaches from a light.  Ike 
looks around, screaming at them, beside himself as the 4th 
Cowboy rides by:

                     IKE
          Kill 'em!  Kill 'em!  It's only
          Four men!  Why don't you kill 'em?

                     4TH COWBOY
          Why don't you?

The others keep going, leaving him behind.  But seeing Wyatt 
bearing down on him, Ike finally bolts himself, pounding off 
hell-for-leather into the hills.  Wyatt and his men keep 
coming at a full gallop and as they crest the rise, suddenly, 
as before, the ground seems to fall out from under them and 
for another burning moment they once again appear airborne, 
grim-faced avenging angels on winged horses, now even more 
majestic in the twilight, like a myth made flesh, awesome, 
superb, and unutterably beautiful.  As they approach, only 
Breakenridge remains, giving them a tentative wave.  Wyatt 
points a finger at him as they ride by in a flash, cresting 
another rise and passing into legend....

INT - HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

The CLOCK on the wall of this private DENVER hospital room 
ticks gently but inexorably as Doc lies in bed with FATHER 
FEENEY, a Catholic priest, sitting at his side.  Painfully 
emaciated, his breathing shallow and labored, Doc is so weak 
it's all he can do to even move his eyes.  But he brightens as 
Wyatt enters:

                     DOC
          Well hell, Wyatt.  Wyatt, I want
          You to meet Father Feeney.  Father
          Feeney's just been initiating me
          Into the mysteries of the great
          And ancient Church of Rome.  You
          See, it appears my hypocrisy
          Knows no bounds.

                     WYATT
          How you feelin', Doc?

          Rather an obvious question under
          The circumstances, don't you
          Agree?  A better one might be how
          Do you feel?

                     WYATT
               (sits down, sighs)
          Hurts.  Hurts pretty bad.

                     DOC
          I imagine it would, yes.  So now
          We can add self-pity to your list
          Of frailties.

                     WYATT
          All right, Doc...

                     DOC
          You think I'm kidding.  You're the
          Most fallible, wrong-headed, self-
          Deluding, just generally
          Benighted jackass I've ever
          Known.  Yet, withal, even at your
          Worst, you're the only human
          Being in my entire life who ever
          Gave me hope.

                     WYATT
          All I ever wanted was to live a 
          Normal life.

                     DOC
          When will you wake up?  You
          Wouldn't know a normal life if it 
          Bit you in the ass.

                     WYATT
          That's great coming from you.

                     DOC
          I played the cards I was dealt, 
          Wyatt.  Your problem is you're 
          Always trying to play someone
          Else's.  Allow me to tell you the
          Truth and thus set you free:
          There is no happiness, Wyatt
          There is no normal life.  There's
          Only life, that's all.  Just life.
          The rest is relative.

                     WYATT
          Then what do I do?

                     DOC
          First you can grab that black-
          Haired woman and make her your own.

                     WYATT
          All right.  Then what?

                     DOC
          Run.  Take that girl and start
          Running.  Run and don't look back.
          All your life you been running
          And looking back and just barely
          Existing and calling it getting
          By.  This time run and don't look
          Back and call it living.  Live
          Every second, live it right up to
          The hilt.  Live, Wyatt...
               (pauses, takes his hand)
          Live for me.

Wyatt stares into his eyes, letting this sink in.  Just then, 
Doc looks up, as if something were pressing on him.  Then:

                     DOC
          Wyatt, please, if you were ever
          My friend, if you ever had even
          The smallest feeling for me, 
          Leave.  Leave now.  Please.

They look at each other and something passes between them, 
something so personal and powerful it transcends emotion.  
Wyatt starts to speak, but:

                     DOC
          Never mind, Wyatt.  I know.  Just go.

Doc turns away.  Wyatt exits.  Doc looks over at Father 
Feeney:

                     DOC
          Now let's see, Father.  What was
          That monkey show you were talking about?

                     FATHER FEENEY
          You mean Extreme Unction?

                     DOC
          That's it.  Better start that ball rolling.

Father Feeney nods, picking up his Missal.  As he starts to 
intone the Last Rites, Doc looks down at the end of the bed 
and sees his feet poking through the sheets.  They are bare.  
Doc smiles:

                     DOC
          I'll be damned...
               (looks at Feeney)
          This is funny.

INT - DENVER THEATER STAGE - NIGHT

A lively road company production of "H.M.S. Pinafore".  
Josephine and 3 chorus girls, all adorable in out-size sailor 
suits do the seamen's hornpipe to the resounding applause of 
the audience....

INT - DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Josephine and her fellow chorines, including the 1st Actress 
from before, all in various stages of undress, sit at the long 
mirror, removing their make-up and chatting:

                     1ST ACTRESS
          I can't get used to this thin air
          Here in Denver.  I thought I was 
          Going to faint on that last buck-
          And-wing.

                     JOSEPHINE
          I know, it's-

Suddenly the door bursts open.  Screams and stunned reaction.  
Wyatt rushes in and goes to Josephine who sits in stunned 
silence.  He falls to his knees and grabs the hem of her robe.

                     JOSEPHINE
          Wyatt!  My God...

                     WYATT
          Did you ever see the sun come up 
          Over the Rockies?  It hits all of
          A sudden and below there's
          California and you swear you're 
          Looking at heaven.

Wyatt stands, pulling her close, clasping her hands in his:

                     WYATT
          I have nothing left.  I have
          Nothing to give you.  I have no
          Pride, no dignity, no money.  I
          Don't even know how we'll make a
          Living.  But I promise I'll love
          You every second of your life.

                     JOSEPHINE
          Don't worry, Wyatt.  My family's rich.

INT/EXT - TRAIN - DAY

Brilliant sunlight, clean, crisp air as a train hurtles 
through a pass high up in the Rocky Mountains, blowing its 
whistle and sending a giant plume of steam billowing up over 
the sheer, towering, snow-topped mountain walls into the 
crystal-clear sky above.  Wyatt leads Josephine by the hand 
through the parlor car, both hardly able to contain 
themselves, brimming over with excitement and anticipation, 
like children waiting for Christmas morning and trying to 
ignore the group of REPORTERS dogging their footsteps, 
swarming around them, calling out to Wyatt:



                     1ST REPORTER
          Mr Earp!  One minute, please!  You
          And your four men have just
          Accomplished in one week what it
          Took the Texas Rangers four years
          To do.  Please, do you have any comment?

Wyatt and Josephine hunch down and duck through a knot of 
porters into the next car.  Only the 1st Reporter gives chase.  
Moving into the passenger car furthest forward, Wyatt leads 
her through the door to the platform over the coupling between 
cars.  Chugging up a steep grade toward a high crest, the 
train is immersed in shadows.  Wyatt points ahead to the 
approaching crest:

                     WYATT
          There.  It'll come up over that ridge.

Inside meanwhile, the 1st Reporter comes through the car and 
spots them up.  A business-type PASSENGER tugs on his sleeve:

PASSENGER
What's the commotion?  Who are they?

                     1ST REPORTER
          Don't you know?  That's Wyatt
          Earp, the Lion of Tombstone, and
          His lady fair.

Outside, still bathed in shadows, Wyatt and Josephine hang 
onto the railing and lean out, watching in as the train nears 
the top.

                     WYATT
          Get ready, here it comes!  Here it comes!

Then, as if on cue, they crest the mountain and are suddenly 
bathed in golden sunlight, their heads leaning from the train, 
Wyatt's blonde hair and Josephine's black tresses flowing in 
the breeze, their faces luminous, looking straight ahead 
toward their future.  Hold on this image as the sun gets 
brighter and brighter, finally making the frame white-out as 
we....

                                           FADE OUT:

EPILOG/DESERT : an OLD MAN and WOMAN walk arm-in-arm through 
the Mojave, tiny figures in a vast landscape, Sierras looming 
in the distance.

                     V.O. NARRATION
          "Wyatt and Josephine embarked on
          a series of adventures throughout
          the west, making and losing
          several fortunes, always living
          the high life, spending every
          winter, just the two of them,
          prospecting for gold in the
          desert foothills of southeastern
          California.  Up or down, thin or
          Flush, in 47 years they never
          Left each other's side."

The figures of the old man and woman fade away, leaving only 
the desert and the mountains which are eternal....

                     V.O. NARRATION
          "Wyatt Earp died in Los Angeles
          in 1929.  Among the pallbearers at
          his funeral were early western 
          movie stars William S. Hart and
          Tom Mix."

Flickering images from early Hollywood silent films split the 
frame: on one side the grim but impassioned figure of William 
S. Hart, the original western good-badman crouched menacingly 
behind a pair of sixguns, his costume dusty and severe; and on 
the other side Tom Mix, the original western fantasy hero, so 
light-hearted and optimistic with his sunny grin and fancy 
white outfit....

                     V.O. NARRATION
          "Tom Mix wept."


HOLD on these two images as the music swells and we....

                                           FADE TO BLACK.
THE END
TOMBSTONE

An original screenplay

                                           Fourth draft

                                           March 15, 1993




ROLL PROLOGUE OVER MAIN TITLE:  a collage of old photos, 
prints, etc., and silent live-action vignettes, all dark and 
heavily shadowed like a dimly-remembered dream.  The first 
images show the opulence of the Gilded Age, the epic vistas of 
the west, cattle drives and cowtowns with all their 
violence....

                     V.O. NARRATION
          "The economic explosion following
          the Civil War created an
          unprecedented nation-wide market
          for beef.  Previously worthless
          cattle running wild throughout
          Texas were gathered into herds 
          And driven north to the railheads 
          In Kansas.  Fortunes were made as 
          Cowtowns sprang up on the 
          Prairies, wide-open centers of
          Commerce and vice, their streets
          Choked with heavily-armed young
          Men fresh from the cattle drives.
          In those days the correct term
          For a cowhand was 'drover'.
          'Cowboy', like 'cowpoke', was
          originally an insult implying
          deviant sexuality and was rarely
          used.  But these invading drovers
          were a wild breed for soon
          shootings and wholesale drunken
          riots became so frequent that
          ordinary citizens literally could
          not walk down the street.  In fact
          at their height the cowtowns had
          higher murder rates than modern
          New York or Los Angeles and there
          Was no law but that of the gun."

A dashing FIGURE in a Prince Albert coat appears, long locks 
tumbling down his shoulders, twin Navy Colts thrust into a red 
sash at his waist, a tin star on his chest.  Next we see him 
in action, downing 3 barroom opponents at once, pistols 
FLASHING around the room like a strobe light:

                     V.O. NARRATION
          "Straight-up at 75 yards or eye-
          to-eye at point-blank range, the 
          greatest gunman of all time was
          an Illinois abolitionist farm boy
          named James Butler Hickok, better
          known as Wild Bill, the Prince of 
          Pistoleers.  But Wild Bill worked
          His trade on the side of justice
          And as marshal of cowtowns like
          Hays City and Abilene he became a
          Legend, the one man who stood
          Between law and chaos."

Now Hickock sits facing us, playing poker as a shabby-looking 
FIGURE with a gun steals up behind him and FIRES.....

                     V.O. NARRATION
          "Wild Bill's fame spread nation-
          wide but his end came quietly in 
          the spring of '76 when a strange
          cross-eyed little drifter put a
          bullet through the back of his
          head, apparently for no other
          reason than he wanted to kill a 
          celebrity."

Now a group of cowhands carouse a streetcorner, raising hell 
as 2 mustachiod young LAWMEN walk up, trying to quiet them 
down.

                     V.O. NARRATION
          "In Dodge City meanwhile, Wyatt 
          Earp and Bat Masterson were 
          Becoming known as fast-guns.  But
          Their fame had nothing to do with
          Shooting."

Seeing it's hopeless, the lawmen whip out their pistols and 
start clubbing the drover's making them stagger and grimace, 
holding their heads....

                     V.O. NARRATION
          "Earp and Masterson operated more
          like modern policemen, using 
          teamwork and persuasion to keep
          order.  Still, sometimes things 
          got out of hand."

An ARMED DROVER creeps up behind the lawmen, about to fire....

                     V.O. NARRATION
          "But Wyatt had a guardian angel."

A REED-THIN FIGURE with a sawed-off shotgun steps from the 
shadows behind the drover and FIRES.  The huge blast WHITES-
OUT the screen for an instant, making the drover seem to 
disappear.  The lawmen spin around.  The thin man breaks the 
shotgun open then calmly holds out his wrists to be cuffed.  
Earp looks at him in shock, mouthing the word "thanks".

                     V.O. NARRATION
          "John Henry 'Doc' Holliday was
          the son of an aristocratic,
          highly cultured southern family.
          Trained in Philadelphia, he had
          Embarked on a career as a society
          Dentist when he contracted
          Tuberculosis.  Advised to practice
          In the west where it was thought
          The climate and clean air would
          Prolong his life, Doc soon
          Realized it was all only a matter
          Of time and gave up dentistry to
          Become a professional gambler and 
          Gunman..."


The scene shifts to an elegant Victorian home: a stern Jewish 
patriarch orders his darkly beautiful DAUGHTER upstairs as her 
weeping mother looks on.  The girl huffs up the stairs 
followed by her little white dog.  Next, the girl and dog are 
seen escaping through a window to the street below and a 
waiting cab.

                     V.O. NARRATION
          "Others headed east.  Bent on
          becoming an actress.  Josephine
          Marcus defied her wealthy and
          Very proper San Francisco Jewish
          Family to run away with a 
          Traveling theatrical company,
          Braving the perils of the 
          Frontier on her own.  Dangerous as
          This might seem, it was another
          Age and women were so rare, their 
          Presence so cherished that they
          Could travel virtually anywhere
          In the west in perfect safety."

Now we see HORSEMEN silhouetted against the night sky, a hand 
knocking on a door, figures conferring in darkness, then more 
riders, moving west in restless haste toward the rising 
sun....

                     V.O. NARRATION
          "At about this time the Texas
          Rangers, having eliminated the
          Commanche threat, turned their 
          Attention to the outlaw gangs
          Marauding along the Rio Grande,
          Cleaning up the border strip in 4
          Years of hard riding.  Those they
          Could not indict or convict the 
          Rangers put down in their Black
          Book, letting it be known that
          They could either leave Texas or
          Face summary execution.  This
          Resulted in the mass migration of
          The absolute dregs of the Texas
          Underworld to the most dangerous,
          Uncivilized part of the entire
          Country, the southeast corner of 
          The Arizona Territory."

A jagged, moonlit landscape, a lone prospector and his burro 
moving along a ridge, a pick digging into a rocky ledge, an 
ore car emerging from a mine shaft, finally a hilltop cluster 
of tents becoming the skeletal wood-frame beginnings of a 
town....

                     V.O. NARRATION
          "Harsh and inhospitable, savaged
          in turn by the Apache and Mexican
          bandits, this had always been an
          accursed place, a virtual hell on
          earth where it was thought life
          itself could never prosper, much
                     V.O. NARRATION (cont.)
          less civilization.  Then in 1879,
          a prospector named Ed Schiefflin
          set off alone into the Dragoon
          Mountains.  Friends told him he
          Was crazy, that the only thing
          He'd find in this Godforsaken
          Place would be his tombstone.
          Instead he found silver, lots of 
          It, and overnight the town of
          Tombstone sprang up.  Mining
          Taking out millions in ore.  Land
          Value shot sky-high and
          Speculators and gamblers and
          Opportunists of all nations
          Scrambled in by the thousands to
          Make Tombstone queen of the
          Boomtowns, so rich that the
          Latest Paris fashions, hard to 
          Find even in the biggest cities, 
          Were sold there by the wagonload
          From the makeshift storefronts."

An engraving of a stagecoach holdup, herds of cattle moving 
north, a newspaper story of a massacre in Mexico, congressmen 
railing at each other, shaking their fists....

                     V.O. NARRATION
          "Meanwhile, the exile Texans had
          banded together to form the
          nucleaus of an organized gang.
          Seizing controp of the 
          Surrounding countryside they 
          Robbed stagecoaches at will while
          The big absentee business
          Interests employed them as tax
          Collectors and strongarm men.  But
          The backbone of their trade
          Remained border rustling,
          Periodic raids into Mexico to
          Steal cattle while engaging in
          What was described as a virtual
          Orgy of murder and violence.  The 
          Raids became so frequent and so
          Bloody that the Mexican
          Government formally protested to
          U.S. President Chester A. Arthur,
          Prompting heated debate in 
          Congress.  General Sherman
          Declared that the only possible 
          Way of bringing order was to send
          In the army but in the wake of
          Civil War Reconstruction federal
          Intervention in civilian affairs
          Was politically impossible."


Pounding hooves, flowing manes, a pack of night-riding 
HORSEMEN kicking hell-for-leather across the desert 
moonscape....

                     V.O. NARRATION
          "With only some 100 members, the 
          gang was an elite body of gunmen,
          known by the red silk sashes they
          wore around their waists.
          Fiercely proud of their
          Terrifying reputation and
          Answerable to no one, they were a
          Law unto themselves, finally 
          Emerging as one of the earliest 
          Examples in American history of
          Full-scale organized crime."

END MAIN TITLE as the screen fades to an ominous black and....

                     V.O. NARRATION
          "They called themselves the
          Cowboys."

EXT - SONORA DESERT/CANYON ENTRANCE - DAY

Burning daylight, hard reality.  A squad of uniformed MEXICAN 
RURALES rides through the Sonora desert, sabres glinting in 
the sun.  Approaching the mouth of a rocky canyon their hard-
bitten CAPTAIN signals them to stop, leaning down to study a 
jumble of hoofprints on the ground.  He turns to the anxious-
looking YOUNG RURALE on his right, speaking in Spanish via 
subtitle:

                     CAPTAIN
          It's them, only an hour north.

                     YOUNG RURALE
          But this is the border.

                     CAPTAIN
          You saw what those animals did at 
          That rancho.  You think a border
          Is going to stop me?  No, I'm 
          Going to see them suffer for what 
          They did!  I swear it on my soul!

The Captain spurs his horse and they ride on at a gallop, 
plunging into the canyon....

DELETED

EXT - SKELETON CANYON - NIGHT

The full moon throws fantastic shadows across the high walls 
of the canyon as the Rurales ride through.  At the bend the 
Captain halts them.  The young one starts to speak but the 
Captain shushes him, peering into the darkness.  A few beats 
then:

                     CAPTAIN
          Turn around!  Fast!  Now!

But suddenly GUNFIRE erupts from the shadows all around them, 
blasting them from the saddle, each powder flash lighting up 
the canyon for an instant, freezing each victim in the moment 
of his death.  Then, just as abruptly the firing stops, 
leaving only the Captain, the young Rurale, and a 3rd Rurale 
alive.  Dazed and bloody, they struggle to their feet as 6 
armed FIGURES emerge from the shadows, walking into the 
moonlight toward them.  With broad-brim hats swept up in 
front, silk scarves and red sashes, high boots and silver-
studded gunleather, they look like 17th century pirates.  
These are the Cowboys:  OLD MAN CLANTON, the ageless, white-
bearded leader;  CURLY BILL BROCIUS, 2nd-in-command, smiling, 
bull-necked;  IKE and BILLY CLANTON, the old man's sons;  
FLORENTINO, a Mexican half-breed;  and JOHNNY RINGO, dark, 
Byronic, with an air of something very strange.  The Old Man 
nods to Florentino:

                     OLD MAN CLANTON
          Tell 'em to get on their knees.

Florentino does so in Spanish.  The others kneel but the 
Captain remains on his feet, steely-eyed, defiant.

                     FLORENTINO
          He will not kneel.  He is proud.

                     CURLY BILL
          So how'd you like our little
          Carry-on over at that rancho?
          Kinda hit the spot didn't it?

                     CAPTAIN
          Animals!  Butchers!

                     OLD MAN CLANTON
          Hey, somebody get that stick on 
          His knees.

Curly Bill casually FIRES his shotgun into the Captain's legs, 
dropping him into a splayed lotus position.  Curly Bill knods.

                     CURLY BILL
          Gracias.

                     OLD MAN CLANTON
          They call me Old Man Clanton.  I'm
          What you might call the founder
          Of the feast.  Now maybe you ain't 
          Heard, but we skylark through
          Your dingy little country just
          About any time we damn well
          Please and big-hat, crummy-
          Lookin' free-holes stumblin'
          Around in the dark ain't allowed.
          Messican po-lice, huh?  Think
          You're bad medicine, don't you?  
          Hell, I've let stronger stuff run
          Down my leg.  So next time we come
          Better step aside.  Get in our
          Hair again, we'll saw your prods
          Off with butter knives and stuff
          'em in your gobs.  Ain't kiddin'
          neither.  You been told.  Now git.



The others rise and dash away but Curly Bill stops the 
Captain:

                     CURLY BILL
          Hold up, jefe.  Got a joke I wanna 
          Tell you.

The Captain speaks grimly in Spanish.  Florentino smiles.

                     FLORENTINO
          He say he know you killing him.

                     CURLY BILL
          Now how'd he figure that out?

                     FLORENTINO
          He say he is no' afraid, someone
          Will revenge for him.  A sick 
          Horse.

                     CURLY BILL
          A sick horse?  What the hell...

Scattered chuckles from the others but we notice Ringo frown 
and draw his pistol as the Captain repeats the words.

                     FLORENTINO
          Something, I don't know, he talk
          Fancy, you know, like a priest.
          Is like, "a sick horse who sits---"

                     RINGO
          That's not what he said, you
          Ignorant wretch.  Your spanish is
          Worse than your English.  Come on,
          Let's get it over with.

Ringo takes aim.  The Captain sneers, suddenly in English:

                     RURALE CAPTAIN
          You go to hell!

                     RINGO
          You first.

EXT - ARIZONA DESERT - DAWN

GUNSHOTS as the Cowboys fire their pistols and shout, running 
their stolen herd out of a draw into a clearing where the 
McLaury brothers wait:  FRANK, older, edgy; and TOM, younger, 
easy-going.

                     TOM
          Looks like you had a party!

                     CURLY BILL
          Oh, we had a big time!
          The Old Man, Curly Bill, and Ringo rein up and look out at the 
          sun rising magnificently from the desert floor.  The Old man 
          stretches his legs in the stirrups, taking out a whiskey 
          flask.

                     OLD MAN CLANTON
          Ain't that sweet?  That's why I 
          Stay out here.  Thank you, God.

He raises the flask and drinks.  Curly Bill turns to Ringo:

                     CURLY BILL
          What'd the Messican mean, a sick 
          Horse's gonna get us?  Didn't make
          No sense.

                     RINGO
          He was quoting the bible,
          Revelations: "Behold a pale horse
          And the one that sat on him was
          Death and Hell followed with him."

                     CURLY BILL
          Well now that's a little more 
          Like it.

EXT - TRAIN STATION PLATFORM/TELEGRAPH OFFICE - DAY

A BLACK HORSE, a fabulous thoroughbred stallion, rears and 
neighs on an open flat-car where it's tethered with 4 near-
identical geldings.  A small boy tries to pet it as a strong-
featured, fair-haired MAN appears, quieting the horse.  Tall 
and slim in a black frock coat and black flat-brim hat, he 
moves with assurance and grace, a man in control.  This is 
WYATT EARP.

                     DAKE
          "Dear Governor Gosper-in re
          yours directing action against
          Cowboys, stop.  Beg to inform have
          Twice sent deputies to serve
          Warrants on Cowboy suspects,
          Stop.  Nothing to show for it but
          2 dead deputies, stop.  Short of
          deputizing U.S. Army am at loss-

                     DEPUTY
               (points at Wyatt)
          The tall man over there, Marshal.
          I'm not sure but I think that's
          Wyatt Earp.

                     DAKE
          Wyatt Earp?  Oh, right, Dodge City.

Back down the platform Wyatt strokes the stallion gently, 
looking up as Dake approaches.

                     DAKE
          Mr. Earp?  My name's Dake, Crawley Dake.  I'm the U.S. Marshal 
          for-


                     WYATT
          Forget it.

                     DAKE
          Excuse me?

                     WYATT
          I said forget it, answer's no, I 
          Don't want the job and that's
          Final.  I'm going to Tombstone and
          Nothin' short of dyin's gonn
          Stop me.  Good day.

                     DAKE
          But wait, you don't understand-

                     WYATT
          No Marshal, you don't understand. 
          I'm through with lawing, I'm
          Through with the whole
          Proposition.  Forever.  I did my
          Duty, now I'd like to get on with
          My life.  That is if you don't 
          Mind.  Jesus.  Good day now.

                     DAKE
          I see, off to strike it rich,
          Huh.  All right, fine, wish you
          Luck.  Tell you this though, never
          Was a rich man yet didn't wind up
          With a guilty conscience.

                     WYATT
          Already got a guilty conscience,
          Might as well have the money too.

Dake retreats.  Wyatt turns back to his horse testily.  
Suddenly:

                     O.S. VOICE
          Boy, I'd know that sour face
          Anywhere.

Wyatt turns.  His brothers stand behind him, smiling.  Though 
VIRGIL is a little older and heavier.  MORGAN a little younger 
and slimmer, they're otherwise identical to Wyatt, right down 
to their style of dress.  Wyatt breaks into a grin, hugging 
them both, his cool replaced with an almost boyish enthusiasm.

                     MORGAN
          Well how do we look?

                     WYATT
          Hey!  Virgil!  My God!  Morgan!  Hey, 
          Boy!  You look great!  Both of you!

Virgil's blonde wife ALLIE, small, fierce, and Irish, steps up 
with Morgan's fair, cameo-lovely young LOUISA in tow.

                     VIRGIL
          Wyatt, you remember Allie

                     ALLIE
          Good God, well he better.

                     WYATT 
               (hugs her, laughing)
          Allie-girl...And Louisa!  You're
          So lovely.  I'm at your feet,
          Darlin'.  Just at your feet.
               (turns to Morgan)
          Guess it's only right.  Ma always
          Said you were the prettiest.

                     VIRGIL
          But she doted on the frowner

Wyatt's handsome blonde wife MATTIE enters from the street:

                     MATTIE
          Wyatt, I couldn't find a single
          Store that had laudanum any-

                     WYATT
          Mattie, they're here!  Folks this 
          Is Celia Ann but you can call her
          Mattie.  Or even Mrs.  Earp if you 
          Prefer.

                     VIRGIL
          Mrs. Earp?  Land O' love, it finally happened!  Mattie it's a 
          Pleasure!

All exchange greetings and hugs.  Wyatt positively beams:

                     WYATT
          Boy, I sure been dreamin' about 
          This.  God!  Since forever!  Wait!

He turns them toward the stationhouse window, arranging them 
in a group and pointing to their reflection.

                     WYATT
          There, look at that!  God
          Almighty

Wyatt smiles, shaking his head. Morgan's starts to speak, but:

                     WYATT
          Don't talk, just...yeah.

They stand silently, studying themselves, together as a 
family.  Wyatt still shaking his head happily, drinking it in.  
Finally:

                     WYATT
          All right, now let's go make our fortune.
          DELETED

EXT - WAGON - MAGIC HOUR

A large woman, Wyatt's black horses tied to the rear, crosses 
the majestic, forbidding Arizona desert with its red volcanic 
rocks and the giant saguaro cactus dotting the landscape so 
mysteriously, like huge, spiny hieroglyphics....

EXT - CAMP BY RIVER - NIGHT

A camp by the river under a clear night sky dripping with 
stars.  After dinner.  The women, Virgil, and Morgan sit by 
the fire.  Morgan petting his dog, a sweet little foxhound.  
Louisa sits behind him, twirling his silky blonde hair, 
turning to Mattie:

                     LOUISA
          Don't you love their hair?  They
          All have the same hair.

Just then Wyatt appears on his stallion, galloping across the 
moonlit plain toward them, sitting his horse like a centaur.  
It's clear he's a magnificent horseman.  Virgil smiles:

                     VIRGIL
          Look at him go, will ya?  I tell 
          You, that's the real Wyatt, born
          In the saddle.

                     MATTIE
          Oh, he can go all right.

                     ALLIE
          Can he then?

                     MATTIE
          Rather ride than eat.

The women cackle lasciviously.  Virgil groans at Allie:

                     VIRGIL
          Try to be a lady, will you?

Wyatt rides up and dismounts, unsaddling the horse.

                     MORGAN
          Give him some good exercise?  Sure
          Some stud.  Some string in fact.
          What're you gonna do, race 'em?

                     WYATT
          Hope so.  Clean up with this boy.

Louisa turns to Mattie, fishing in her bag:

                     LOUISA
          Mattie hon', did you say you
          Needed some laudanum?  I have a 
          Bottle right here.  Just be 
          Careful.  It's full of hop.

                     MATTIE
          You're a lifesaver!  Don't worry,
          I just get headaches sometimes.

As Wyatt leads the horse away the women get up, Allie and 
Louisa going to the river with dishes, Mattie crossing to the 
wagon.  Virgil and Morgan watch her appreciatively:

                     VIRGIL
          Mighty fine.  Wonder where he
          Found her.  Same place we found
          Ours probably

At the other end of camp Mattie climbs into the wagon and lies 
down.  Wyatt appears and starts to stroke her head.

                     WYATT
          Come up to the fire, honey.

                     MATTIE
          I think I'll just lie down awhile

A coyote starts HOWLING from the far darkness.  Mattie 
shudders:

                     MATTIE
          Long as I live I'll never
          Get used to that sound.

                     WYATT
          They're just lonely is all.  Hell,
          I howl myself sometimes.

                     MATTIE
          You get lonely?

She seems genuinely surprised.  Wyatt looks genuinely 
confused.  Over at the fire, Morgan hugs and mashes Louisa 
playfully.

                     MORGAN
          Come up, Lou.  Come up here, girl.

                     LOUISA
          Stop...

She fights loose.  Wyatt walks up, sits, shaking his gold 
watch.

                     WYATT
          Look at that.  Busted.  Brand new 
          Money Ward, too.  33 years old 
          And I don't even have a decent
          Watch.  'Bout time I started
          Lookin' out for myself.

                     VIRGIL
          Well here we are a family again.
          Been so long plain forgot how
          Good it feels.  Want to thank you
          For that, Wyatt.  All your doin'.

                     WYATT
          We're gonna do it, boys.  Gonna
          Get ours.  Feel it in my bones.
          All we have to do is keep our
          Eyes on that brass ring.

                     MORGAN
               (lies back)
          Boy, look at all those stars.  Bet 
          You can see every star there is.
          Practical touch 'em.  Kinda makes
          You think, you know?  I mean you
          Look up and you think God made 
          All that but he still remembered
          To make a little speck like me.
          Kinda flattering really.  Hey,
          Wyatt, you believe in God?  No,
          Come on, really, do you?

                     WYATT
          Maybe, yeah.  Hell, I don't know.

                     MORGAN
          Well what do you think happens
          When you die?

                     WYATT
          Got me.  Somethin'.  Nothin'.  I
          Don't know.

                     MORGAN
          I read this book, book on
          Spiritualism...

                     VIRGIL
          Oh, God, here he goes...

                     MORGAN
          ...said a lot of people, when 
          they're dyin', they see this
          light, like in a tunnel.  They say
          it's the light leading you to
          heaven.

                     WYATT
          Really?  What about hell?  They got
          A sign or what?

                     MORGAN
          Hey, Wyatt, God damn it, I'm serious!


                     WYATT
          Well that's your problem.  Hey 
          Virge, see anything of Doc while
          You were in Prescott?

                     VIRGIL
          Hit a streak when we left.  Him
          And Kate.

                     ALLIE
               (from the stream)
          Uh, that woman.

                     WYATT
          I miss Doc.  I miss that ol' rip.

                     VIRGIL
          I don't 

                     ALLIE
          Neither do I.

                     WYATT
          He makes me laugh.

INT - PRESCOTT SALOON - NIGHT

A handsomely appointed saloon.  At a corner table, the pot is 
so rich 2 players have folded leaving ED BAILEY, a big, 
sullen, tough-looking gambler, facing gaunt, elegant DOC 
HOLLIDAY.  Full of southern refinement and languid, almost 
feline grace.  Doc has such unerring style and aplomb that he 
makes his constant tubercular coughing sound as if he's merely 
clearing his throat.  Bailey leans forward, seething with 
impatience:

                     BAILEY
          I said that's 500 to you,
          Holliday.  In or out?

                     DOC
          500? Sly boots, must be a peach
          of a hand.

KATE HORONY, Doc's voluptuous Hungarian consort enters, 
refilling his engraved silver stirrup cup.  She has a faint 
accent:

                     KATE
          Here, Doc.

                     DOC
          Bless you, darling
               (puts arm around her)
          Darling!  Are you mad?  You're not
          Wearing a bustle.  How lewd!

                     BAILEY
          Oh, for Christ's sake!

          Ed Bailey, you look like you're
          Just ready to burst.  Well call me
          A fool but I guess I'll just have
          To call.  Cover your ears, darling.

Doc covers the bet and shows his hand.  Bailey pounds the 
table.

                     BAILEY
          God damn son of a...

                     DOC
          Isn't that a daisy?

                     BAILEY
          Just pick up your money and go.
          Sick of listening to you simper.

                     DOC
          Now Ed, are we cross?

Doc leans forward, revealing an ivory gun-butt under his coat.

                     BAILEY
          Skinny lunger, your guns don't 
          Impress me.  Wasn't for those guns
          You'd be nothin'.

                     DOC
          Why Ed, what an ugly thing to
          Say!  Does this mean you're not my
          Friend anymore?  You know, Ed, if
          I thought you weren't my friend I
          Don't think I could bear it.

Now a Cheshire cat smile we will soon come to know very well 
steals over Doc's face as he takes out his nickel-plated .38 
Colt Lightning and .45 Peacemaker and lays them on the table.

                     DOC
          There, now we can be friends
          Again.  But remember, Ed,
          Friendship is trust-so please
          Don't hurt me.

Doc bats his eyelashes.  Bailey jumps up, boiling.  A long, 
sweaty moment, then Bailey LUNGES.  Doc spring up, grabbing 
him by the hair and jabbing his fist into Bailey's armpit.  
Bailey screams and doubles over.  Doc gives him two more 
blows, so light they hardly seem capable of the effect they're 
having.  But as he turns to give him another we suddenly SEE 
that there's a KNIFE in Doc's hand.  The bartender reaches for 
the shotgun under the bar.  Kate pulls a Derringer from her 
muff and puts it to his ear.

                     KATE
          Touch that gun, I burn you down!

He backs off.  Kate covers the room.  Bailey drops to his 
knees.


                     BAILEY
          Oh, my God...

                     DOC
          Does it hurt?  A lot?  Good.

Eyes gleaming cruelly, Doc blows his cigarette smoke into 
Bailey's face.  Bailey sinks to the floor in a fetal position.  
Kate gathers up the pot as Doc retrieves his guns, looking 
around the room.  Then both back up to the door.

                     DOC
          Well, good evening then.

They exit.  The others look down at the groaning Bailey lying 
in a pool of his own blood.  A GAMBLER shakes his head:

                     1ST GAMBLER
          Judas...

EXT - STREET OUTSIDE - NIGHT

Doc and Kate stride quickly down the board sidewalk to the 
hotel.

                     DOC
          I calculate that's the end of 
          This town.  And let's don't bother
          About the luggage, darling.

Kate points to 2 horses saddled and packed outside the hotel.

                     DOC
          My sweet clever Magyar, so that's
          Why you're not wearing a bustle.

Doc gives Kate a peck on the cheek as they mount and ride 
off...

EXT - TOMBSTONE OUTSKIRTS/COTTAGES - DAY

A small cottage at the edge of town.  As the Earps drive up we 
SEE a sobbing woman sitting splay-legged in the middle of the 
street while her husband tries to comfort her.  3 small 
children stand alongside them, watching in stunned silence as 
Cowboys FRANK STILLWELL, cocky, arrogant, and PETE SPENCE, 
lean, dark, heave their furniture and belongings out of the 
cottage into the street while snarling things like, "shut 
up...deadbeats...move it!"  The Earps stop, staring at this 
scene in shock, Allie looking ready to fight.  Virgil 
restrains her, Stillwell looks up:

                     STILLWELL
          What're you lookin' at?

Virgil looks at Wyatt who shakes his head.  They drive on 
as....


EXT - ALLEN STRESS, TOMBSTONE - DAY

Unlike the dreary, weather-beaten western towns in movies, 
Tombstone is new and colorful, part town, part mining camp, a 
wild mixture of brightly painted wooden storefronts and half-
finished stone buildings rimmed by clusters of tents and 
shanties, all perched atop a hill with a magnificent view of 
the desert and the purple Dragoon mountains beyond.  We HEAR 
the vibrant din of hammers and saws, player pianos, hurdy-
gurdys, clip-clopping horses' hooves, and pealing laughter as 
the Earps drive up Allen Street, the main drag, lined with 
saloon after saloon, sidewalks bustling with drovers, miners, 
Chinamen, and sullen gun-toting hard-cases.  They pull up in 
front of the Grand Hotel and step down.  JOHNNY BEHAN, 
handsome, well-dressed, wearing an ornate crescent-shaped gold 
sheriff's badge and a ready smile walks up and shakes hands:

                     BEHAN
          Newcomers, eh?  Names John Behan,
          I'm Cochise County Sheriff.  Just
          Hit town?

                     WYATT
          Just this minute.  I'm Wyatt Earp,
          These're my brothers-

                     BEHAN
          Wyatt Earp...Dodge City, right?

                     WYATT
          Gave all that up.  Going into business.

                     BEHAN
          Well I'm the man to see.  Besides
          Sheriff I'm also tax collector, 
          Captain of the Fire Brigade, and
          Chairman of the Non-partisan Anti-
          Chinese league.  A man of many
          Parts.  Got a place to stay yet?  I
          Also sit on the Townlot
          Commission.  Got a couple of
          Lovely cottages coming up for
          Rent.  Here, let me show you...

EXT - TOMBSTONE OUTSKIRTS/COTTAGE - DAY

The Earps and Behan stand on the porch of the very same 
cottage we saw the Cowboys evict the family from.

                     BEHAN
          The one next door and the one
          Across the street are vacant too.
          Same rent and I'll throw in a 
          Good cleaning.  Believe me, you
          Won't find a better deal within
          Town limits.

Wyatt looks enquiringly at his brothers.  They shrug.  He's 
calling the shots.  Wyatt shrugs back.  Finally:

                     WYATT
          Guess we'll take all three.

EXT - O.K. CORRAL/ALLEN ST. - DAY

A large stable and corral backing up into a vacant lot.  
Wyatt's big horses feed in their stalls while Wyatt faces the 
stableboy:

                     WYATT
          ...and easy on the grain, I don't
          want 'em too fidgety.

Morgan and Virgil enter with FRED WHITE, the jovial old town 
marshal.  Shaking hands, all 4 go up Allen, taking in the 
town.

                     MORGAN
          Wyatt, meet Fred White, he's town marshal.

                     WYATT
          Lotta law around here.  Just met the Sheriff.

                     WHITE
          Who, Behan?  He ain't no law, only
          Real law here's the Cowboys.

                     VIRGIL
          The Cowboys, yeah.  I heard of 'em.

                     WHITE
          Nobody does nothin' without 'em.
          They're it.  Hell, even the 
          Apache're scared of 'em.  There's
          A couple right there: Sherman
          McMasters and Pony Deal.  Can
          Always spot a Cowboy, they all
          Wear those red sashes.

White points to SHERMAN MCMASTERS and PONY DEAL, a half-breed, 
standing over by the hotel, joking in sign language.

                     VIRGIL
          Look pretty rough.

                     WYATT
          Just like any other hard cases.
          Gotta know how to handle 'em.

                     WHITE
          Well I'm no Wild Bill.  Way I
          Handle 'em's just mainly live and
          Let live.  That usually answers 
          But even so, gets kinda spooky
          Sometimes.  Still somebody's gotta
          Do it, I mean how the hell else 
          You gonna walk down the street?

                     VIRGIL
          Doesn't anybody raise a stink?
          The hell kinda town is this?

                     WHITE
          Boomtown.  Wide open.  People
          Grabbin' with both hands ain't 
          Got time for any law and order.
          In fact the less law the more
          Opportunities there are for
          Makin' money.  Plain fact is the
          Cowboys're good for business.

                     WYATT
          What about all these saloons?

                     WHITE
          Ah, now that's the real mother-
          Lode in Tombstone.  Up and down
          Allen Street, full-blast 24 hours
          A day, liquor, hostesses,
          Gamblin', makin' money hand over
          Fist.  All except the Oriental.  On
          Account of the element.  Have a 
          Man for breakfast in there most
          Days.  Regular slaughter house.
          High-rollers won't go near it.
          Too bad, nice place.

Wyatt nods, suddenly very interested as they walk on and....

EXT - ORIENTAL SALOON - DAY

We feel the sensual delight of going from hot sun into cool 
dark as Wyatt enters, going up to the ornate mahogany bar.  
Though a large, handsome saloon complete with gaming tables, 
it has only a few patrons on hand.  "The Lilly and the Rose" 
is on the player piano as bartender MILT JOYCE appears:

                     JOYCE
          What can I get you?

                     WYATT
          Let me have one of those cigars.
               (lights up, looks around)
          Kinda nice in here.  You run it?

                     JOYCE
          Milt Joyce, owner-operator.

                     WYATT
          Well, excuse me for askin', Milt,
          But isn't it kinda dead in here?

Joyce points to the faro table in the corner where JOHNNY 
TYLER, an unshaven plug-ugly with a big D.A. Colt .45 carried 
ostentatiously in a shoulder holster, deals to a couple of 
scruffy-looking drifters.

                     JOYCE
          You see that bird at the faro
          Table?  That's Johnny Tyler.  He
          Barged in here one day, said he
          Was takin' over the game, started
          Slappin' customer, wavin' his 
          Gun around, scarin' off all the
          High-class play.  Only trade comes
          In here now's just bummers and
          Drovers, just the dregs.

                     WYATT
          Why don't you get rid of him and
          Get yourself straight dealer?

                     JOYCE
          Well sure, neighbor, easy to say.

INT - FARO TABLE - DAY

As Wyatt walks up Tyler starts snarling at one of the players:

                     TYLER
          You back that Queen again, you
          Son of a bitch, I'll blow you 
          Right out of that chair!
               (looks up, sees Wyatt)
          Somethin' on your mind?

                     WYATT
          Just wanted to let you know
          You're sitting in my chair.

                     TYLER
          That a fact?

                     WYATT
          Yeah.  It's a fact.

Tyler looks Wyatt over, noting he is unarmed.  He stands, 
sneering:

                     TYLER
          For a man that don't go heeled
          You run your mouth kinda reckless.

                     WYATT
          Don't need to go heeled to get
          The bulge on a dub like you.

                     TYLER
          That a fact?

                     WYATT
          Yeah.  It's a fact.

                     TYLER
          Well I'm real scared.


                     WYATT
          Damn right you're scared.  I can 
          See it in your eyes.

Wyatt steps forward suddenly, eyes cold and hard like a shark.  
Suddenly realizing he's in way over his head.  Tyler shrinks 
back reflexively, his hand moving toward his gun.  The other 
players scatter.  Wyatt nods, his voice calm and steady:

                     WYATT
          Go ahead.  Skin it.  Skin that
          Smoke wagon and see what happens.

                     TYLER
          Listen Mister, I'm getting' tired-

Wyatt abruptly SLAPS his face, making his teeth clack 
together.

                     WYATT
          I'm getting tired of your gas.
          Jerk that pistol and go to work.

Tyler goes pale, all pretense of courage gone.  Wyatt slaps 
him again.

                     WYATT
          I said throw down, boy.

Another slap.  Tyler stays frozen, blood dripping down his 
chin.

                     WYATT
          You gonna do something or just
          Stand there and bleed?

Tyler's done.  Wyatt plucks his gun away, handing it to Joyce.

                     WYATT
          No, I didn't think so.  Here,
          Milt.  Keepsake, hang it over the
          Bar.  All right, youngster.  Out
          You go...

Wyatt takes Tyler by the ear, dragging him across the room 
like an unruly child.  At the door he gives the ear a twist.

                     WYATT
          And don't come back.  Ever.

Tyler winces.  Wyatt shoves him out into the street then turns 
to Joyce casually:

                     WYATT
          See how easy that was?

EXT - CORNER OF ALLEN & 5TH STREET (STAGECOACH) - DAY

Later.  Wyatt walks up to his brothers at the corner.


                     WYATT
          Well we're off and running.  Just 
          Acquired us a quarter-interest in
          The game at the Oriental.

                     VIRGIL
          Acquired?

                     WYATT
          So to speak.

Down the block, unseen by the Earps, a wild-eyed Tyler is 
advancing on them with a sawed-off shotgun.  He is within 20 
feet when suddenly:

                     O.S. VOICE
          Why Johnny Tyler, you madcap,
          Where are you going with that
          Shotgun?

Tyler spins around to see Doc standing in a doorway, smiling.  
Tyler freezes.

                     TYLER
          Doc.  I didn't know you were in town.

Wyatt spots Doc and walks up, brothers in tow.  Though they 
don't so much as shake hands, we sense a strong bond between 
the 2 men.

                     WYATT
          Doc!  How the hell are you?

                     DOC
          Perfect, Wyatt.  Simply perfect.

                     TYLER
          Wyatt?  Wyatt Earp?

                     MORGAN
          Going into business for
          Ourselves.  Wyatt just got us a 
          Faro game.

                     DOC
          Since when is faro a business?

                     WYATT
          Didn't you always say gambling's 
          An honest trade?

                     DOC
          I said poker's an honest trade.
          Only suckers buck the tiger.  The
          Odds are all with the house.

                     WYATT
          Depends how you look at it.  I
          Mean it's not like anybody's
          Holding a gun to their heads.

                     DOC
          That's what I love about Wyatt.
          He can talk himself into anything.

They laugh.  Frozen there.  Tyler begins to tremble.  Finally:

                     DOC
          Oh sorry, Johnny, I forgot all
          About you.  You can go now.  Just 
          Leave the shotgun.

                     TYLER
          Thank you.

Tyler scuttles off as Behan approaches affably.  Doc sniffs.

                     WYATT
          Sheriff Behan, Doc Holliday.

                     DOC
          Forgive me if I don't shake hands.

                     BEHAN
          So how's Tombstone treating you?

                     WYATT
          Fine, fine.  But I was thinkin',
          You know what this town really
          Needs is a race track.

                     BEHAN
          Actually, you know, that's not a 
          Bad idea, send a signal we're
          Growing up.

                     DOC
          Little ahead of yourselves,
          Aren't you?  This is just a mining
          Camp.

                     BEHAN
          See how everyone dresses?  Awfully
          Toney for a mining camp.  No, the
          Die's cast, we're growing, be as
          Big as San Francisco in a few 
          Years.  And just as sophisticated.

                     DOC
          I can hardly wait.

As if on cue, a bullet WHIZZES past Behan's head.  Everyone 
ducks.  More GUNFIRE as a man holding a bloody hand to his 
throat reels out the door of the nearby Crystal Palace, his 
gun firing wildly like a sputtering engine before he pitches 
face first onto the sidewalk, dead.  Immediately 2 more men 
appear: a staggering DRUNK with a bullet hole in his shoulder; 
and TURKEY CREEK JACK JOHNSON, a leathery plainsman with his 
gun at the ready.  A crowd forms as the drunk raises his 
pistol, bellowing.

                     DRUNK
          You son of a bitch!

                     JOHNSON
          That's right, keep comin', keep comin'...

                     DOC
               (turns to Behan)
          Very cosmopolitan.

                     WYATT
          I know him.  That's Creek Johnson.

Suddenly a 3rd man, TEXAS JACK VERMILLION, long-haired, hawk-
nosed, appears, pistol at the ready, keeping bystanders at 
bay.

                     VERMILLION
          Easy, gents. Private affair...
               (spots Wyatt)
          Wyatt! Doc! Hey!

                     WYATT
          Jack...

                     DRUNK
          You bastard!

The drunk now has raised his gun to where it's almost level 
and:

                     JOHNSON
          Yeah, good.  Right about there.

Johnson FIRES.  The drunk drops in a heap.  Johnson spots 
Wyatt:

                     JOHNSON
          Hello, Wyatt!  Hiya Doc!

                     WYATT
          What was that all about?

                     VERMILLION
          Drunks.  Crawfished a bet, called 
          Him a liar.  I saw the whole thing.

                     DOC
               (turns to Behan)
          Sheriff, may I present a pair of
          Fellow sophisticates, Turkey
          Creek Jack Johnson and Texas Jack
          Vermillion?  Watch your ear, Creek.

Doc points to his bloody ear.  Johnson touches it, sees the 
blood, gives a silent start.  Just then White arrives, looking 
weary, facing Johnson and Vermillion.

                     WHITE
          'Fraid I'll have to have those guns.

                     JOHNSON
          Fair fight.  We were legal.

                     WHITE
          Sorry, boys.  Gotta take you 
          Before Judge Spicer.

                     VERMILLION
          Well law and order every time,
          That's us.

They hand over their guns while Virgil looks at the 2 dead men 
lying in the street, shaking his head:

                     VIRGIL
          What kinda town is this?

                     VERMILLION
          Nice scenery.

They look.  A stagecoach stops in the street.  JOSEPHINE 
MARCUS looks out the window, her little white dog under her 
chin.  She and Wyatt spot each other instantly, both 
impressed.

                     BEHAN
          That must be the theatrical 
          Troupe.  There's a show tonight at
          Schieffelin Hall.

                     JOHNSON
          Hey, Wyatt, you goin' to the
          Show?  Maybe we'll see you there.
               (turns to White)
          Won't we.

                     WHITE
          Yeah, probably.

White leads them off to jail.  Wyatt and Josephine hold each 
other's gaze as the coach drives on.  Doc smiles:

                     DOC
          Well, an enchanted moment

EXT - GRAND HOTEL (STAGECOACH) - DAY

Pony Deal and McMasters watch as the actors exit the coach for 
the hotel.  Josephine turns to the pretty 1st actress:

                     JOSEPHINE
          Interesting little scene.  I 
          Wonder who that tall man was.


                     1ST ACTRESS
          Typical frontier type.  Long and
          Lean.  And those gray eyes.  Like a 
          Wild hawk.  You see quite a few of
          His type out here.

                     JOSEPHINE
          Oh, I want one.

INT - LOBBY, GRAND HOTEL - DAY

The actors enter, going to the desk while Josephine looks for 
a place to sit.  A fat, well-dressed easterner with a 
newspaper sits nearby, ignoring her.  Seeing this from 
outside, McMasters instantly barges into the lobby, hoists the 
easterner out of his chair, and hurls him bodily out into the 
street.  Josephine nods her surprised thanks.  McMasters tips 
his hat shyly, exits as the 1st actress returns with her key.  
They exchange looks....

INT - SHIEFFELIN HALL - NIGHT

A full house, pandemonium.  Curly Bill, Ringo and their Cowboy 
entourage form a block in the center 
Rows while BILLY BREKENRIDGE, Behan's bespectacled, slightly 
effeminate little Deputy makes his timid way down the aisle, 
looking for a seat midst the off fist-fight and yelling match.  
2 cocky young Cowboys, BILLY GROUNDS and ZWING HUNT, call out 
to him:

                     HUNT
          Hey, Sister Boy!

                     CURLY BILL
          Shut up, Zwing.  Sit here, Billy.

Curly Bill beckons.  Happy as a lark, Breakenridge takes the 
seat next to him.  Up above, the Earps sit in a box, the women 
thrilled:

                     ALLIE
          This is so much fun!  We haven't
          Been to a show since years.

                     MATTIE
          I hope they're good.

                     STILLWELL
               (shouting from below)
          Lady, they better be good.

Doc enters, Kate on his arm.  The  women exchange uneasy nods.

                     DOC
          Kate, you know the Earps.

They sit as White enters with Mayor JOHN CLUM and wife.

                     WHITE
          Wyatt, this is Mayor Clum and his wife.



                     CLUM
          Your reputation precedes you.  I wonder -

                     WYATT
          Not a prayer.  Nice meetin' you.

While the orchestra tunes up and the crowd's excitement rises, 
White sits next to Wyatt, pointing out the different Cowboys 
and giving a thumbnail sketch of each as we PAN over them:

                     WHITE
          Well everybody's here except the
          Old Man.  Got the blade, Billy
          Grounds, Zwing Hunt, Billy
          Claiborne, Wes Fuller, Tom and
          Frank McLaury, Billy Clanton's 
          The youngest.  Wild one.  Then the
          Breeds, Hank Swilling, Pony Deal.
          Florentino's Mex-breed.  They all
          Hate Mex, but he hates 'em
          Special.  Johnny Barnes, Frank 
          Stillwell.  That's Behan's little
          Deputy, Billy Breakenridge.
          Follows the Cowboys around like a 
          Puppy.  And the big boys: Curly
          Bill Brocius, he's the Old Man's
          Rimrod; the one looks like an
          Actor, that's Johnny Ringo.  Best
          Gun alive they say.  He's kinda
          Different.  Curly Bill's the only
          One he talks to.  I mean they're 
          All rough boys, but Ringo... I
          Don't know.  I really don't

Music.  The house lights dim.  The audience hushes.  A 
spotlight hits easel at the end of the stage: "Professor 
Gillman and His Ballet of Gravity."  Out in the audience, 
Barnes groans:

                     BARNES
          Professor Gilllman?  Oh hell, I
          Seen him in Bisbee.  He catches stuff.

The curtain goes up.  PROFESSOR GILLMAN, a 3rd rate juggler in 
white tie, tailcoat, and black tights steps out and starts 
tossing Indian clubs in the air.  The audience starts groaning 
but the Professor's rictus-like smile never changes.  Having 
seen enough, Frank Stillwell stands up and shouts:

                     STILLWELL
          Hey profesor!  Catch this!

Stillwell raises his pistol and FIRES.  An Indian club 
explodes in the Professor's hand.  Screams and scattered 
laughter in the audience.  The Professor is frozen in utter 
shock, staring at the bullet graze on his hand and saying out 
loud:

                     GILLMAN
          They shot me!  I don't believe it!

A chord of music and the curtain drops like stone.  
Applause....

EXT - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

The other acotrs hustle the Professor off the stage, appalled.  
The 1st Actress turns to MR. FABIAN, a handsome, slightly 
raffish classical tragedian.

                     1ST ACTRESS
          My God, they're shooting at us!
          They're actually shooting at us!
          What'll we do?

                     FABIAN
          Only thing we can do, dear-be
          Good.  In any event, at least we
          Won't have to wait for our 
          Notices.  Exciting, isn't it?  Now 
          This is theater!

INT - SHIEFFELIN HALL - NIGHT

More music and another card reads: "Selections From the Bard 
of Mr. Romulus Fabian, Tragedian in Excelsis."  The curtain 
rises and Fabian steps out, a purple velvet cloak wrapped 
resplendently about him like a toga.  In the audience, Curly 
Bill's mouth drops:

                     CURLY BILL
          Prettiest man I ever saw

Fabian throws open his cloak, revealing his lithe form in 
doublet and tights.  The whores in the gallery hoot and cheer.  
Fabian bows.

                     STILLWELL
          How come he ain't wearin' no pants?

                     BARNES
               (points to whores)
          That's how come.

                     FABIAN
          Ladies and gentlemen, the St
          Crispin's Day Speech from Henry V.
          To set the Scene, England is
          Now at war with France. 
          Everything rests upon the battle
          About to begin.  Henry, the young
          King of England, addresses his men
          Thusly: "My cousin Westmorland?
          No, my fair cousin-"

Another GUNSHOT and a bullet SPANGS into the column next to 
Fabian with a shower of plaster.  Without missing a beat, 
Fabian casually flicks a chunk off his shoulder and continues:

                     FABIAN
          "If we are marked to die, we are
          enow/ To do our country loss; and
          if to live./ The fewer me, the
          greater the share of honour..."

In the audience Barnes holsters his smoke pistol reflectively.

                     BARNES
          He's got nerve, I'll say that.
          What do you think, Billy?

Starry-eyed, Breakenridge answers without thinking:

                     BREAKENRIDGE
          Oh, he wonderful!

                     GROUNDS
          Uh-oh, looks like somebody's in love.

Raw laughter from the others.  Breakenridge sinks in his seat.

                     CURLY BILL
          Let him alone.

On stage Fabian is in full cry, giving the local a slice of 
the ripest ham:

                     FABIAN
          "We few, we happy few, we band of
          brothers;/ For he today that
          sheds his blood with me/ Shall be
          my brother; be he ne'er so vile./
          This day shall gentle his 
          Condition;/ And gentlemen in
          England now a-bed/ Shall think
          Themselves accurs'd they were no
          Here./ And hold their manhood
          Cheap whiles any speaks/ That
          Fought with us upon Saint
          Crispin's day!"

Wild applause and cheering.  Fabian bows with elaborate 
modesty.

                     CURLY BILL
          That's great!  That's our kinda stuff!

The curtain falls.  Another card: "Faust - or the Devil's 
Bargain" and the orchestra whirls into "Danse Macabre" by 
Saint-Saens, the rising curtain revealing a wild pained 
backdrop, all black and red, covered with weird, Beardsley-
esque designs and images of death and damnation.  A light 
comes up, revealing an ancient white-bearded scholar sitting 
alone with his books.  Then a hooded Satan dances across the 
stage, slender and lissome in paned black doublet and breeches 
and black hose, tempting the old man with images of wealth and 
youth in the form of a shimmering blonde ballerina.  The old 
man succumbs, signing Satan's contract.  The audience watches 
in rapt attention, especially the Cowboys:

                     STILLWELL
          He's gonna some up short on that one.

                     CURLY BILL
          Know what I'd do?  I'd take the
          Deal then crawfish and drill that
          Ol' Devil in the ass.  How 'bout 
          You, Johnny?  What would you do?

                     RINGO
          I already did it.

Satan makes a flourish.  A flash-pad EXPLOSION transforms the 
old scholar into a young student.  The ballerina flits by.  
The student offers her gold.  They dance, swirling about the 
stage in a mad waltz with Satan hovering behind them, 
mirroring their every move like a puppet master.  Finally, 
having gotten all his gold, the Ballerina drifts away leaving 
the young student alone, lost in bitterness as he changes back 
into the old scholar sitting with his books.  Satan appears 
over him, exultant and triumphant, ready to collect the debt 
as the curtain falls with a final crashing chord.  Thunderous 
cheering and applause.  The curtain rises again and the 
performers come out for bows, all except Satan.

                     DOC
          Very instructive

                     WYATT
          But who was the Devil?

Suddenly Satan bounds out, removing the hood.  It's Josephine.

                     MORGAN
          It's that woman from the coach!

                     WYATT
          I'll be damned...

Josephine spots Wyatt's box and smiles.  Doc raises an 
eyebrow:

                     DOC
          You may indeed.  If you get lucky.

EXT - ALLEN STREET - NIGHT

After the show and theatergoers, including the Earps, stroll 
homeward arm-in-arm down Allen, all looking up at the clear 
night sky above.  At the Oriental Wyatt stops, turning to 
Virgil:

                     WYATT
          Comin' to the Oriental, Virge?

                     ALLIE
          Not tonight! Tonight me and my
          Old man're gonna have some fun.
          Get moving, old man!

She laughs, shoving Virgil down the street.  He looks at 
Wyatt:

                     VIRGIL
          Her maiden name was Sullivan.

                     WYATT
               (kisses Mattie)
          Better go with 'em, honey.  Here's
          Where I leave you.

                     MATTIE
               (grabs his hand)
          No, stay.  Please stay with me.

                     WYATT
          Honey, I gotta start makin' money.

                     MATTIE
          Oh, all right.

                     WYATT
          Well I guess I don't have to go 
          Right now.  I guess I could stay a little while.

                     MATTIE
          No, no, I don't want to keep you.

                     WYATT
          No really, I can stay a while.

                     MATTIE
          Just go.  It's all right.  Wyatt, 
          Really.  Work well.

                     WYATT
          All right, well, good night.

Another kiss and he heads for the Oriental with Morgan.  
Mattie walks on after the others, fishing through her bag for 
her bottle of laudanum....

DELETED

INT - ORIENTAL - NIGHT

The saloon is packed.  TRACK along the bar at floor level past 
a wild array of high-button shoes, patent leather pumps, and 
stack-heeled boots with jingling silver spurs.  Track again at 
shoulder level past an equally wild array of slouch hats, 
pork-pies, derbys, and wide-brim sombreros.  Wyatt sits 
against the wall, dealing faro with Doc at his side, Morgan on 
lookout while a sweaty overdressed HIGH ROLLER makes bets, 
gnashing his teeth and drumming his fingers n a fever of 
impatient greed:


                     HIGH ROLLER
          All right, I'm on fire!  Black
          Seven, seven stickin' spades.
          Let's go!

                     WYATT
          I'm your man...
               (deals card)
          You win again.  Well played, sir.
          You are on fire.

                     HIGH ROLLER
          Told you.  I'm red hot, I'm
          Blazin'!  Now, red seven.  Seven
          Stinkin' diamonds.  Look out!  Five
          Thousand!  Let's go!

                     WYATT
          Awful lot of money.

                     HIGH ROLLER
          Can't take the heat, get outta
          The kitchen.

                     WYATT
          You're the doctor.
               (deals card)
          sad news, friend.

                     HIGH ROLLER
          Damn!  All right, wait a minute...

The high roller lays a set of deeds out on the table as....

INT - ORIENTAL - NIGHT

A break in the game.  Wyatt studies the deeds as Morgan and 
Doc look on.  Kate sits to one side, blowing smoke rings 
contentedly.

                     WYATT
          So now we're in the mining 
          Business.  Turning into regular
          Tycoons.  Gonna call this one the
          Mattie Blaylock.  Mattie'll get a 
          Kick out of that, it's her maiden
          Name.

                     DOC
          And what a maiden, pure as the
          Driven snow, I'm sure.

                     MORGAN
          Hey Doc!  Come on now.

                     WYATT
          Just his style, Morg.  Doesn't
          Mean anything.

                     DOC
          So tell me, Wyatt.  I'm curious.
          Do you actually consider youself
          A married man?  Forsaking all
          Others?

                     WYATT
          Well yeah.  Pretty much.  I mean I
          Was no angel when we met but
          People change Doc.  I mean sooner
          Or later you gotta grow up.

                     DOC
          I see.  And what would you do if
          "she" walked in her right now?
                     WYATT
          "She"?

                     DOC
          You know damn well who I mean.
          That dusky-hued lady Satan.

                     WYATT
          I don't know.  Probably ignore her.

                     DOC
          Ignore her?

                     WYATT
          I'd ignore her.  People can 
          Change, Doc.

                     DOC
          I'll remember you said that.

Doc point.  Josephine has just walked in with the other 
actors.

                     WYATT
          Oh, hell...

She spots Wyatt and starts toward him but he looks away, as if 
ignoring her.  She stops.  Behan steps up to her, tipping his 
hat, very gallant.  They move toward the bar.  Wyatt turns to 
Doc.

                     WYATT
          Satisfied?

                     DOC
          I stand corrected.  Wyatt.  You're
          An oak.

Josephine and Behan chat at the bar.  White nudges Joyce:

                     WHITE
          Since when'd you start servin'
          Ladies in here?

                     JOYCE
          Actresses.  It's different.

Mr Fabian enters, dramatically gotten-up like Lord Byron.  The 
whole bar bursts into applause.  He bows.  Breakenridge jumps 
up from his table, excited:

                     BREAKENRIDGE
          Here, Mr Fabian, have this table.

          Oh, thank you.  You're very kind.

          Mr. Fabian, I've got to tell you,

                     WYATT
          Getting drunk, Doc.

Doc chuckles.  Suddenly Curly Bill looms over the faro table 
with Ringo and a drunken Ike Clanton.

                     CURLY BILL
          Wyatt Earp, huh?  I heard of you.

                     IKE
          Listen, Mr. Kansas Law-dog.  Law

          Good.  That's real good.

                     IKE
          Yeah, that's good, Mr. Law-dog, 
          'cause law don't go around here.

                     WYATT
          I heard you the first time.

                     CURLY BILL
          Shut up, Ike.

                     RINGO

          And you must be Doc Holliday.

          Evidently Mr. Ringo's an educated
          Man.  Now I really hate him.

Ringo looks at Doc, holding his gaze while suddenly whipping 
out his .45.  Everyone but Doc flinches.  Ringo does a 
dazzling series of twirls and tricks, his nickel-plated pistol 
flashing like a blaze of silver fire, finally slapping it back 
into his holster with a flourish.  Cheers and hoots.  Doc 
rolls his eyes, hooks a finger through the handle of his 
silver cup, then launches into an exact duplication of Ringo's 
routine using a cup instead of a gun.  The room bursts into 
laughter.  Doc shrugs.  Ringo lets a strange little hint of a 
smile cross his face then exits with the others.  White 
exhales, turns to Wyatt:

                     WHITE
          See what I mean about it getting
          Spooky?

                     WYATT
          Curly Bill, huh?  Who was that 
          Other idiot?

                     WHITE

          Son.  Know he ain't got the stuff,
          Makes him miserable.

                     WYATT
          Yeah, and dangerous.

Sitting up on the bar to see the show, Josephine turns to 
Behan:

                     JOSEPHINE
          The man dealing faro.  Who is he?

                     BEHAN
          That's Wyatt Earp.  Made quite a 
          Name for himself as a peace
          Officer in Kansas.

                     JOSEPHINE
          A peace officer... Impressive man

                     BEHAN

          Oh, so that's it...

EXT - ALLEN STREET/ORIENTAL - NIGHT

Curly Bill steps out with Ike and Ringo.  He looks around.

                     CURLY BILL
          I feel like doin' somethin'.
          Getting woolly.
               (looks up)
          Hey, Chinky!  Come here a minute...

An old Chinaman minces by.  Curly Bill dashes after him...

BACK & FORTH INT/EXT - ORIENTAL / ALLEN STREET - NIGHT

Later.  Doc is at the piano, drunk as a lord but playing 
Chopin flawlessly.  Kate pours him another drink.

                     KATE
          That's my lovin' man.  Just can't
          Get enough.

          Enough?  Never.

Now the High-Roller comes reeling up, loud and gratingly 
drunk.

                     HIGH ROLLER
          Hey, is that "Old Dog Tray"?
          Sounds like "Old Dog Tray".

          A which?

                     DOC
          You know, Frederic-fucking-Chopin.

Doc plays on.  Josephine leaves with Behan.  Morgan sighs:

                     MORGAN
          Now that wounds me.  Little tin
          Swain walkin' off with that black
          Beauty.  I mean I'm a married man
          And all but still, it ain't right.

Wyatt grunts and nods, perturbed.  Outside the others mount up 
but Curly Bill stands drugged-up in the middle of the street, 
arms out, head back, eyes closed, luxuriating in the 
moonlight.

                     CURLY BILL
          Boy, I feel great!  Full of that
          Hop I got from Chinky.  I feel 
          Just capitol!  You boys go ahead.
          I'm gonna stick around awhile,
          Howl at the moon.

The others shrug and ride off.  Curly Bill pulls his pistol, 
spinning it.  Back inside the Oriental it's late, few patrons 
remain.  A few beats then suddenly everyone jumps as GUNSHOTS 
echo from outside.  White goes to the window, looks outside:

                     WHITE
          Curly Bill.  He's over across the
          Street shootin' out the lights.

                     CLUM
          This is great, this is just great.

Just then Behan dashes in, white as a sheet, Josephine in tow:

                     BEHAN
          Have you been out in the street?
          Somebody's got to do something.

                     CLUM
          You're the Sheriff.

                     BEHAN
          It's not County business, it's a 
          Town matter.

Outside Curly Bill starts taking potshots at a passerby's 
feet, making him dance down the street and scurry for cover.  
Curly Bill cackles.  Inside White turns uneasily to Wyatt:

                     WYATT
          Why don't you just leave it alone?

                     WHITE
          No, I gotta do something.  I don't 
          Suppose you'd card-

                     WYATT
          None of my business, Fred.

Wyatt keeps dealing, Doc keeps playing.  White draws himself 
up and exits.  Outside, Curly Bill reloads and keeps shooting.  
White steps out into the street.  We feel a sense of inverted 
terror as he draws his gun and we SEE that his hand is 
trembling.  He crosses the street, coming up behind Curly 
Bill:

                     WHITE
          Hey, Curly?  Come on now, boy...

Curly Bill spins around.  White's gun stares him in the face.

                     CURLY BILL
          Well, howdy, Fred!

Back in the bar, Wyatt puts his cards down, looks over at Doc.

                     WYATT
          Maybe I ought to go out there.

                     DOC
          You will or you won't.  Don't look
          To me.  I'm going to sleep.

Doc lays his head down on the keys, passes out.  Wyatt frowns 
for a moment.  Finally he stands, turning to Morgan:

                     WYATT
          Go wake up Virgil.
               (turns to Joyce)
          Hey Milt, lend me a sidearm, will you?

Joyce hands him a Colt from under the bar.  Outside White 
covers Curly Bill, trembling harder now.  An adrenaline rush 
in a man White's age is hard to look at, he seems so frail, so 
vulnerable.  Even his voice has a quavering edge to it:

                     WHITE
          Hand that over.  Come on now.

                     CURLY BILL
          Why sure, dad.  I'm only in fun.
          Here she is.

With a reassuring smile, Curly Bill holds his pistol out butt-
first.  White reaches for it, visibly relieved.  But quick as 
a snake's tongue Curly Bill spins it around and FIRES POINT 
BLANK into White's chest, blowing him over backward, the blast 
so close it sets his clothes on fire.   Curly Bill turns just 
as Wyatt flashes into frame and SLAMS him over the head with 
his pistol barrel, laying him out in a groaning heap.  Wyatt 
glances at White lying semi-conscious in the street, chest 
heaving, eyelids fluttering, making weak little bird-like 
sounds, smoke rising from his smoldering shirt and vest.  Clum 
runs up:

                     WYATT
          Put his clothes out.

Clum pats the embers out in White's clothes but as Wyatt 
starts to haul Curly Bill up he suddenly finds himself 
surrounded by Ike, Billy Clanton, and six other Cowboys.

                     IKE
          Turn loose of him.

                     WYATT
          He just killed a man.

                     BILLY
          He said to turn loose of him.

                     WYATT
          Well I'm not so go home.

                     IKE
          Swear to God, Mister, step aside
          Or we'll tear you apart.

The Cowboys tense up, ready for action.  Wyatt holds his 
ground, his hard, steady gaze zeroing in on Ike:

                     WYATT
          You.  Come here a second.

Ike steps up, full of brass.  Without warning Wyatt jabs the 
muzzle of his pistol into his forehead, snapping his head 
back.  Wyatt cocks the pistol.  The other Cowboys hush.  Ike 
freezes.  Wyatt's eyes bore into him.

                     WYATT
          You die first, get it?  The others 
          Might get me in a rush but before
          That I'm gonna make your head
          Into a canoe.  Understand?

Ike stands stock still.  Billy steps forward, undaunted:

                     BILLY
          He's bluffin'!  Let's rush him!

This is it.  The Cowboys poise themselves, ready to start, 
but:

                     O.S. VOICE
          And you, you simpleton, you're next.

Again a hush.  Doc stands behind Wyatt, still drunk, but with 
his .38 trained on Billy.  Billy sneers:

                     BILLY
          Hell, he can't hit nothin'.  He's 
          So drunk he's probably seein'
          Double.

Doc pulls out his .45, training it, too, on Billy:

                     DOC
          I have two guns.  One for each of you.

Billy pauses, chastened.  Suddenly there's another commotion 
as Virgil and Morgan bull their way through the crowd from 
behind with shotguns.

                     VIRGIL
          All right, look out!  Break it up.
          Go home, all of you, go home now...

This breads the group's will and things suddenly calm down 
dramatically as the Cowboys disperse.  Wyatt lowers his 
pistol, heaving a sigh of relief as he pulls the still-groggy 
Curly Bill to his feet and hauls him reeling toward the jail.

                     WYATT
          Come on, you...

                     CURLY BILL
          Crack me back of the head like
          Some stinkin' bull.  Hell, you
          Ain't no fightin' man, you're
          Just a cop.

EXT - JAIL/ALLEN STREET/HOTEL - NIGHT

Later.  As the Earps and Doc step out on the sidewalk we can 
see the semi-conscious Curly Bill through the front door of 
the jail laying in one of the cells, holding a bloody kerchief 
to his head.  Wyatt closes the door, locks it, gives Clum the 
keys.

                     WYATT
          There.  He'll keep till morning

The street is quiet as they start back toward the Oriental.  
Virgil and Morgan following at a discreet distance, smirking:

                     VIRGIL
          Keep your eye on that brass ring.
          Don't let anything side-track you.

                     WYATT
          I know, I need a keeper.

Meanwhile across the street at the hotel Josephine turns to 
Behan.

                     BEHAN
          Well I guess you can see, never a 
          Dull moment.  Maybe you should
          Stay around to see what happens

Morgan's hound sleeps in the corner while Virgil and Morgan 
shoot pool.  Wyatt looking on.

                     WYATT
          ...but he says did I actually see
          it happen and I said, no, when I
          arrived Fred'd already been shot.
          So the judge said, can't have a
          Murder without a witness-case
          Dismissed.  Can you beat it?  After
          All that.  Oh hell, who cares,
          None of my business anyways.

Clum enters, frowning and anxious, just as Morgan sinks a 
shot.

                     MORGAN
          Boy, I love this game.  When we're
          Finally set we gotta each have a
          Billiard room in our houses.

                     CLUM
          Excuse me, Wyatt, just a moment,
          Please, I wanted to try and 
          Reason with you.  We still haven't

                     VIRGIL
          I'm busy.  We're all busy.  Sorry,

          Up the wrong tree.

                     WYATT
          You tell 'em, Virge.

Clum exits shaking his head.  They keep playing.  After a 
beat:

                     WYATT
          You know, I was thinkin', maybe
          We ought to open our own place.
          That's the real money.  Build it
          Up, milk it for all it's worth,
          Then sell it off for a bundle and
          Breeze out of this burg with more
          Money than Croesus and ready to
          Live like kings.  Let's you and me
          Take a walk around town, Virge,
          See if we can scout us out a 
          Couple of nice lots.

                     VIRGIL
          I can't hardly believe it.  It's 
          Working out just like you said,
          Wyatt.  We're lootin' this burg
          Six ways through Sunday.

                     WYATT
          Pretty fun too, isn't it?

                     VIRGIL
          Kinda, actually, yeah.  I gotta admit.

EXT - COTTAGE ON EDGE OF TOWN - DAY

Virgil and Wyatt walk down a quiet, tree-shaded lane on the 
outskirts of town.  Suddenly a rubber ball rolls into their 
path.  A small BOY plays in the front yard of a nearby 
cottage.  Virgil and Wyatt approach, Virgil returning the 
ball:

                     VIRGIL
          What're you up to today, son?

The boy stands stock still, staring at the men in silence.

                     WYATT
          Cat got your tongue?

He turns and walks back to the street without another word.

                     WYATT
          Wait a minute, Virgil!  Where you goin'?

Virgil keeps going.  Wyatt starts after him, leaving mother 
and child in confusion as....

INT - VIRGIL'S PARLOR - DAY

In tight on a gleaming silver shield, "Town Marshal, 
Tombstone, A.T."  PULL BACK to reveal it pinned to Virgil's 
breast.  He sits by his parlor hearth with Morgan at his side.  
Wyatt sits opposite with his head in his hands.

                     VIRGIL
          I couldn't help it, Wyatt.  I 
          Looked at that woman and it was
          Just like somebody slapping me in
          The face.  I mean these people're
          Afraid to even walk down the 
          Street and I'm trying to make
          Money off it like some kind of
          God damn vulture.  That's not me,
          That's somebody I don't even know.

                     WYATT
          Virgil, please.  Don't do this to me.

                     VIRGIL
          It's got nothin' to do with you, 
          Wyatt.  It's-

                     WYATT
          Nothing to do with me?  I'm your 
          Brother for Christ's sake.  God, I
          Don't believe this.
               (turns to Morgan)
          Talk to him, will you?  Or hit him.
               (no answer, pauses)
          Oh no, don't tell me...

Morgan looks down in sheepish silence.  Then he pulls back his 
coat, revealing the Deputy's badge on this vest.  Wyatt 
groans.

                     MORGAN
          Like you said, Wyatt.  We're
          Brothers.  Gotta back your
          Brother's play.  Just did like I
          Figured you would.


                     WYATT
          Listen to me, both of you.  This 
          Is no good.  This is trouble we
          Don't need.  For the first time in
          Our lives we got a chance to stop
          Wandering and finally be a
          Family.  Do this and you throw it
          All away.  You saw what happened
          To Fred White.

                     MORGAN
          Come on, we're not about pickin'
          Fights.  Just gonna keep a little
          Order, that's all.

                     WYATT
          Yeah?

                     MORGAN
          Like you said, just gotta know
          How to handle 'em.  Old Fred
          Wasn't up to it.  We know that
          We're doin', Wyatt.

                     WYATT
          All right, say you're right, say
          You don't get yourself killed.
          There's something else.
               (turns to Morgan)
          It's too late for Virge, he
          Already rolled his bone.  But it's 
          Not too late for you, Morg.

                     MORGAN
          What're you talkin' about?

Wyatt exhales wearily then crouches down in front of his baby 
brother, looking deep in his eyes, his voice soft, plaintive:

                     WYATT
          All the years I worked the
          Cowtowns, I was only ever mixed 
          Up in one shooting.  Just one.  A
          Man got killed.  Wasn't my fault,
          Just doin' my job.  I don't even 
          Know if it was my bullet that
          Dropped him, but... I don't kno,
          It's sort of hard to explain.  At
          First I just felt funny, you
          Know, kind of clammy inside.  But
          When it finally sunk in what I'd 
          Done... Believe me, boy, you
          Don't ever want to feel that way.
          Not ever.
               (pauses)
          Didn't even make a dent, did I?
               (stands, exits)
          You're both makin' a big mistake.

EXT - DESERT, HOOKER RANCH - DAY

Armed with a borrowed pistol and carbine, Wyatt gallops 
through the desert on one of his other big blacks, eyes 
scanning the tracks beneath him.  He rides up and stops at a 
well near a large ranch house.  He dismounts, studying tracks 
as rancher HENRY HOOKER rides up, strong, noble-looking, like 
something from a Frederic Remington canvas.  Wyatt nods.  
Hooker nods back.

                     WYATT
          This Hooker's ranch?

                     HOOKER
          That's right.  And I'm Hooker.

                     WYATT
          You seen anything of a man on
          Horseback leading a black
          Stallion?

Hooker suddenly falls silent, looking at the ground nervously.

                     WYATT
          Well you must've seen somethin',
          The trail runs right by your 
          Waterhole.
               (no answer)
          Oh, I see.  So it must've been a
          Cowboy, right?  Really got you
          People treed, don't they?

                     HOOKER
          Look, Mister, it's fine for you
          Boomers to court trouble, you're
          Just passin' through.  Us
          Cattlemen gotta live here.  Best I
          Can do's point you up to the cut.
          That's their roost.

Wyatt nods his thanks.  Hooker looks down, ashamed.  Wyatt 
stares at him a moment.  There's something genuinely troubling 
about so strong a man living in fear.  Wyatt rides on, shaking 
his head....

INT - DESERT CAMP - DAY

A small camp near a clump of trees.  Pony Deal brews coffee 
while McMasters leans against a fallen oak log feeding an 
eager pack of mongrel pups from a block of jerky as Wyatt 
rides up.

                     MCMASTERS
          Run for your lives, boys!  It's
          That great two-gun dog-catcher
          From Kansas!

                     WYATT
          McMasters, isn't it?  Listen, you
          Seen a black stallion with-

                     MCMASTERS
          Look, I got a rule.  I don't talk
          To lawmen.  Dog-catchers neither.

                     WYATT
          I'm not a lawman, I'm just a 
          Private citizen getting' my 
          Property back

                     MCMASTERS
          Well in that case, I saw your
          Horse.  Billy Clanton was takin'
          Him up to the Cut to show him 
          Off.  The boys're all up there
          Right now, branding.  And in a 
          Mood.  Still want your property
          Back, Mr. Private Citizen?

EXT - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

Wyatt and McMasters ride along side-by-side through the hills.

                     WYATT
          So what about you Cowboys anyway?

                     MCMASTERS
          If I had to explain it you
          Wouldn't understand.  Just say
          We're brothers to the bone.

                     WYATT
          Yeah, but some of the things they
          Say your brothers've done...

                     MCMASTERS
          There's all kinds of horses,
          Ain't there?  Same with Cowboys.
          What they do's their affair.  I
          Don't preach and I don't judge.  I
          Ain't no dog-catcher.

EXT - RUSTLER'S PARK - DAY

A wide plateau in the mountains dotted with tents, water and 
fee troughs, rope corrals, etc.  Cowboys cut out steers while 
others crouch around fires, cooking, looking up with naked 
hostility as Wyatt rides up.  McMasters points to the edge of 
camp where Billy Clanton is currying Wyatt's stallion.

                     MCMASTERS
          You seem like a nice fella.  Like
          To've know you better.  Had you lived.

Wyatt rides on, making for Billy.  Ike steps up with INDIAN 
HAWK SWILLING, the giant half-breed.  They walk alongside 
Wyatt.


                     IKE
          Hey, law-dog.  The hell you doin' here?

                     SWILLING
          How 'bout I just drag you off
          That horse and eat you blood raw?

Wyatt ignores them, riding up to within 20 feet of Billy and 
dismounting.  Billy looks up, supremely confident and 
unconcerned.

                     WYATT
          Where'd you get that horse?

                     BILLY
          Beauty, ain't he?

                     WYATT
          I asked where you got him.

                     BILLY
          Where do you think?  I stole him.

Everyone laughs.  More cowboys gather, jeering.  Wyatt steps 
closer.

                     WYATT
          Look, I don't want any trouble
          With you but that's my horse and
          I mean to have him back.  One way
          Or another.

                     BILLY
          Come and get him.

                     WYATT
          Look kid, I know what it's like, 
          I was a kid, too.  Even stole a
          Horse once.  But you can't--

                     IKE
          Don't sweet-talk him, make a move.

                     SWILLING
          Yeah, go ahead, Mister.  Make a move.

Billy steps back, poised.  Ike and Swilling do the same.  3 
more Cowboys move up behind him.  The scene seems on the brink 
of explosion when Curly Bill suddenly STREAKS into frame on 
his buckskin mare, majestic and 10 times life size as he pulls 
back and SKIDS to a stop in front of Wyatt, raising a giant 
roostertail of dust, making everyone but Wyatt recoil.

                     CURLY BILL
          Give him his horse, Billy.

                     IKE
          Come on, Curly!  Don't let him-


                     CURLY BILL
          Shut up.
          Give him his horse, Billy.

Billy reluctantly hands over the leadline.  Wyatt mounts and 
rides off with Dick Nailor in tow, Curly Bill riding 
alongside.

                     CURLY BILL
          Feel bad about ol' Fred.  Just
          Can't hold back when I'm feelin'
          Woolly.  Still, feel kinda bad.
          But now we're square.  Anyway no
          Use for holdin' a grudge.  I
          Deserved a rap in the head.

                     WYATT
          Make you a deal.  My brother took
          Over the Marshal's office in
          Tombstone.  Got it in his head
          He's gonna make the place safe
          For widows and orphans.  You and
          Your boys stay out of his way,
          I'll make sure he stays out of yours.

                     CURLY BILL
          Fair enough.  You know I got to 
          Admit, you got a lot of bark on
          You comin' up here like this.

                     WYATT
          They were all gonna jump me back
          There.  What ever happened to one
          Against one?

                     CURLY BILL
          Ain't our way.  We go all on one,
          One on all.  Fight one of us, you
          Fight us all.  That's the Cowboy way.

                     WYATT
          And how come you call yourselves
          Cowboys?  Cowhands ride for the brand.

                     CURLY BILL
          Oh, we ride for a brand all right.
               (gives Wyatt the finger)
          This brand.  How 'bout you?

                     WYATT
               (points thumb at self)
          This brand.

                     CURLY BILL
          We're gonna get along just fine.

EXT - ALLEN STREET - DAY

A lazy afternoon.  The Earps and Clum lounge in front of the 
hotel.

                     CLUM
          I can't thank you enough.  Since
          You took over there hasn't been a 
          Single problem.  We're finally
          Becoming a civilized town.

                     VIRGIL
          Nothin' to it.

                     WYATT
          Maybe I jumped the gun.  Maybe
          Those Cowboys aren't near as bad
          As they're painted.  You know I
          Was thinkin', there's a lot of
          Money in the cattle business...

                     VIRGIL
          Wait a minute, you thinkin' of
          Getting in bed with the Cowboys?

                     WYATT
          Business is business.  Don't have
          To love 'em to work with 'em.  Not
          If there's money in it.

                     VIRGIL
          You are the one, Wyatt.  You sure are.

EXT - GUADALOUPE CANYON - MAGIC HOUR

Old Man Clanton leads 4 other Cowboys with a herd through the 
rocky canyon, slipping a flask and singing as the first shot 
RINGS OUT from the rocks above, becoming a FUSILLADE.  When 
the dust settles, all are dead except the Old Man who lies 
pinned under his horse, semi-conscious.  FIGURES emerge from 
the shadows.  It's the Rurales led by the same Young Rurale 
from before.  He bends down to the dazed Old Man, speaking 
carefully:

                     YOUNG RURALE
          The old one you kill.  This was my father.

                     OLD MAN CLANTON
               (sits up suddenly)
          What, and I'm supposed to
          Tremble?  Kiss my ass, Messican.

Hissing gleefully, he jams a derringer under the Young 
Rurale's chin and FIRES, blowing off his sombrero as he falls.  
The other Rurales fire, emptying their guns into the Old Man 
as if he were some monstrous rattlesnake that might bite 
them....

EXT - RUSTLER'S PARK - NIGHT

Curly Bill, Ringo, and the others are by the fire, passing a 
bottle, as Frank Still well gallops up and dismounts, 
breathless:

                     STILLWELL
          Old Man Clanton's dead!  Ambushed 
          In Guadaloupe Canyon.  Messican's
          Got him.

In tight on Curly Bill as the news sinks in.  He clenches his 
fist in rage, then bites a knuckle, getting his control back.

                     CURLY BILL
          All right, first thing's first:
          It's my outfit now, I'm runnin'
          The show.  Ringo's number two man.

                     IKE
          Your outfit?  I'm next in line.

                     CURLY BILL
          You ain't got enough in your
          Britches.  Think you can prove
          Otherwise, go ahead.

Seething with humiliation, Ike mounts up and rides off.

                     CURLY BILL
          Anybody else?

No takers.  Curly Bill turns back to business:

                     CURLY BILL
          All right.  Billy, go after Ike
          And cool him off then go find the
          McLaurys, tell 'em what happened
          And keep an eye on things.  Wes
          Fuller and Bill Claiborne, too.
          Rest of you come with me.  We're
          Goin' to Mexico.

They mount in a bunch and take off south like the wind....

EXT - DESERT - DAY

Wyatt is up on his stallion, riding along the foot of a high 
hill.  Coming to a cut, he suddenly stops.  Josephine is 100 
yards up ahead, gorgeously impressive in a black velvet riding 
habit, riding side-saddle through the cut on a pretty mare.

                     WYATT
          Oh, hell...

Looking for an escape, Wyatt turns up a narrow trail on the 
side of the cut.  He follows it as it winds around the hill 
then abruptly drops back down and comes out on the other side 
of the cut right in front of Josephine.  She waves.  He 
groans:

                     JOSEPHINE
          Well, hello.


                     WYATT
          We've never actually met.  My
          Name's-

                     JOSEPHINE
          Wyatt Earp, I know.  I was
          Beginning to think we'd never
          Meet.  This is fortuitous.  That
          Means lucky.

                     WYATT
          I know what it means.

Suddenly Wyatt's stallion groans nervously, throwing its head, 
aroused by the presence of the mare.

                     JOSEPHINE
          What is it?

                     WYATT
          Easy now... That mare's in season.

                     JOSEPHINE
          Oh...
               (calms her horse)
          Now she's starting.  How do they know?

                     WYATT
          They know.  It's the scent.  We 
          Better split 'em up.

                     JOSEPHINE
          I have a better idea, let's run
          It out of them!

Before Wyatt can stop her she's off at a full gallop.  Wyatt 
pauses, debating with himself.  Finally:

                     WYATT
          Yeah, I'm an oak all right.

He takes off at a dead run.  Catching up, the horses find 
their rhythm, breaking into a smooth gallop, flying over a jet 
black plain of volcanic ash into a rolling meadow carpeted 
with yellow desert poppies, so bright it almost hurts your 
eyes to look at them.  Coming off a rise the desert floor 
shears off into a wide crevice.  Josephine heads right at it.

                     WYATT
          You're not that crazy, are you?

                     JOSPEHINE
          Oh, yes I am!

A crack of her crop and she streaks toward it.  Wyatt grits 
his teeth and follows suit.  The sound of their hoofbeats 
stops for a long instant as they take the jump together, 
sailing through the air side-by-side, Josephine giggling like 
a little girl.  They light on the other side and gallop on....

EXT - DESERT - MAGIC HOUR

They pull up at a huge desert stone formation, a canopy of 
white sandstone with vermillion streaks swirling through it 
looming over them like a giant oyster shell.  Wyatt dismounts, 
helping Josephine.  He takes his long duster from his saddle 
and lays it on a wide, table-shaped rock for them to sit on.

                     JOSEPHINE
          That was lovely!

                     WYATT
          You know you almost got us both
          Killed back there?

                     JOSEPHINE
          Fun though, wasn't it?

                     WYATT
          You'd die for fun?

                     JOSEPHINE
          Wouldn't you?  You're laughing!  I
          Was sure you never laughed.

                     WYATT
          I laugh sometimes

                     JOSEPHINE
          Yes, but how often?  Tell me, are 
          You happy?

                     WYATT
          Am I happy?  I don't know.  Happy 
          As the next man, I guess.  I don't
          Laugh all day long like an idiot,
          If that's what you mean.

                     JOSEPHINE
          You're a little touchy about it.

                     WYATT
          I'm not touchy, I just, it's a
          Silly question, that's all.  Am I
          Happy?  Are you happy?

                     JOSEPHINE
          Of course, I'm always happy.
          Unless I'm bored.  That blonde
          Woman, is that your wife?

                     WYATT
          What about her?

                     JOSEPHINE
          Nothing... Tell me, what do you
          Want out of life?

                     WYATT
          Where do you get these questions?

                     JOSEPHINE
          Just answer.

                     WYATT
          I don't know, make some money,
          Have some kids, you know.

                     JOSEPHINE
          Doesn't suit you.

                     WYATT
          How would you know?

                     JOSEPHINE
          Just doesn't, that's all.

                     WYATT
          Well I ought to know my own mind
          And I'm tellin' you what suits me
          Is a family and kids.  That suits
          Me right down to the ground.  In
          Fact, that's my idea of heaven.
               (pauses)
          All right, what's your idea of heaven?

                     JOSEPHINE
          Room service.

Wyatt laughs, almost in spite of himself.  Josephine beams.

                     JOSEPHINE
          See?  You're laughing again.  But
          That's what I want.  Go places and
          Move and never look back and just
          Have fun.  Forever.  That's my idea
          Of heaven.  Need someone to share
          It with, though.

                     WYATT
          You mean Behan?
               (sees her shrug)
          Then why are you with him?

                     JOSEPHINE
          Well he's handsome and he's
          Charming.  He's all right.  For
          Now.  Don't say it, I know, I'm 
          Rotten.  I can't help it.  I've
          Tried to be good but it's too
          Boring.

                     WYATT
          The way you talk.  Never heard a
          Woman talk like that.

                     JOSEPHINE
          Oh look, I haven't got time to be
          Proper, I want to live.  I'm a 
          woman, I like men.  If that's 
          Unladylike then I guess I'm not a
          Lady.  At least I'm honest.

                     WYATT
          Well you're different, no arguing
          That.  But you're a lady all right.
          I'll take my oath on it.

He looks at her, enchanted, but suddenly his face clouds.

                     JOSEPHINE
          What's wrong?

                     WYATT
          I don't know, doesn't make any
          Sense.  I almost can't look at
          You.  Like it hurts.

                     JOSEPHINE
          I know, me too.  What should we do
          About it?

He takes her in his arms and kisses her.  She sinks in his 
arms.  He kisses her again then falls to her knees, throwing 
his arms around her legs and pressing his face into the folds 
of her skirts.

                     WYATT
          God...

She runs a hand through his hair.  He stands, lifting her with 
him until they are face-to-face and she can feel him pressing 
into her.  After a beat:

                     JOSEPHINE
          You know this is adultery.  You
          Burn in hell for that.

                     WYATT
          Then let's make sure we get our
          Money's worth

EXT - DESERT - MAGIC HOUR

They loll on the rock, facing each other, clothes in disarray.

                     JOSEPHINE
          I must say this certainly has
          Been an unexpected little
          Windfall.

                     WYATT
          Fortuitous even.


                     JOSEPHINE
          And I don't even know your full name.

                     WYATT
          Easy to fix.  Wyatt Berry Stapp Earp.

                     JOSEPHINE
          And I'm Josephine Sarah Marcus.
          My friends call me Josie.

                     WYATT
          Josie... No, I'm gonna call you
          Sadie.

                     JOSEPHINE
          I hate Sadie.

                     WYATT
          Well you'll always be Sadie to me.

                     JOSEPHINE
          Always?

                     WYATT
          Getting late.  We better get back.

He looks away and stands, helping her up.  They go to their 
horses.  He lifts her up into her saddle and stands awhile, 
arranging the folds of her skirt.  After a beat:

                     JOSEPHINE
          So I assume we're regarding this
          As just a kind of interlude.

                     WYATT
          Look, it's too much of a tangle.
          I already cast my lot.  I can't go
          Back and I can't sneak, feel back
          Enough as it is.

                     JOSEPHINE
          You feel bad about this?  About me?

                     WYATT
          I didn't mean it that way.

                     JOSEPHINE
          You know you don't have to sneak.
          You could stay with me.  I know
          Things, Wyatt.  Sweet things.  I
          Could make you so happy.

                     WYATT
          I can't, I'm sorry.  Forgive me.

He mounts and rides off with a wave.  She watches him 
awhile....

INT - FLY'S PHOTOGRAPHIC GALLERY - DAY

A Victorian photographer's studio behind the O.K. Corral.  A 
large skylight overhead illuminates the backdrop as CAMMILIUS 
S. FLY, the prosperous-looking owner prepares his camera.  
Josephine is o.s. in the dressing room on the left:

                     FLY
          What mood would you like for this
          Picture, Miss Marcus?  Any
          Particular occasion you're 
          Commemorating?

                     JOSEPHINE O.S.
          I want to remember exactly how I
          Looked on this day so I want you
          To take a picture of me...

She steps out wearing a diaphonous veil shrouding her from 
head to toe.  Though it partially obscures her form, we can 
see that she's completely nude underneath.  Fly gasps.

                     JOSEPHINE
          ...all of me.

Fly fumbles with his camera, his composure gone.  She turns to 
a nearby mirror, studying herself-black tresses, rounded lips, 
maddening curves, and smokey eyes-a dark angel.  She smiles:

                     JOSEPHINE
          Because I'm wonderful.

INT - WYATT'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Mattie lies in bed, lost in an opium dream.  She snaps out of 
it and sits up as Wyatt enters and gives her a kiss, glancing 
at the half-empty laudanum bottle on the nightstand.

                     WYATT
          That the bottle Lou gave you?
          Better go easy on that stuff.

                     MATTIE
          I know what I'm doing.  Where have
          You been?

                     WYATT
          Out ridin'.  So... how you doin'?

                     MATTIE
          I don't know.  I'm all right.

                     WYATT
          Really?  You sure?

                     MATTIE
          Sure I'm sure.  What is this?

Wyatt sits down on the bed, suddenly intent, his face alight:

                     WYATT
          Well, I was thinking, we've
          Already made a pile of money.
          Maybe we should just pull up
          Stakes and move on.  And we could
          Stay on the move, you know?  Just
          Keep going, see the world.  Live
          On room service the rest of our 
          Lives.  How'd that be?

                     MATTIE
          Wyatt, what're you talkin' about?

                     WYATT
          Just thinkin' out loud.  Forget it.

INT - ORIENTAL - NIGHT

Dark circles under his eyes, looking dreadful, Doc is at the 
corner table with Virgil, Behan, Ike Clanton, and the 
McLaurys.  Josephine lounges by the piano, luscious in a white 
gown, singing "Frankie and Johnny" in a torchy voice.  Wyatt 
enters, blanching at the sight of Josephine.  Joyce appears at 
his elbow:

                     JOYCE
          New singer.  Ain't she somehin'?

Wyatt nods weakly.  Josephine gives him a half-smile.  Wyatt 
blushes.  Morgan approaches.

                     MORGAN
          Doc won't quit, been up 36 hours.
          Clanton came in an hour ago, they
          Switched over to poker.  Tried to
          Get him to bed but he just won't 
          Let go.

                     WYATT
          I know.  And nobody can make him.

They go over to Doc's table and sit down.  Doc beams 
drunkenly:

                     DOC
          Wyatt!  Just in time.  Pull up a chair.

                     WYATT
          Been hittin' it awful hard, Doc.

                     DOC
          Nonsense, I have not yet begun to
          Defile myself.

                     WYATT
               (touches his shoulder)
          But Doc-

                     DOC
          I won't be pawed at, thank you
          Very much

                     WYATT
          Sorry, sorry...

                     KATE
               (puts arm around Doc)
          That's right.  Doc can go all day
          And all night and then some.
          Doc's my man.  Doc's my lovin'
          Man.  Have another one, lovin' man.

She kisses Doc.  Behan nudges Wyatt:

                     BEHAN
          What d'you think of the singer?

                     WYATT
          Nice voice.

                     BEHAN
          That's not what I meant.

Behan gives him a wink.  Wyatt shifts uneasily in his seat.  
This hand is down to Doc and Ike and the pot is huge.  Doc 
shows his hand.  Ike throws his cards down in a drunken rage:

                     IKE
          Son of a bitch!  That's twelve
          Straight hands!  Nobody's that lucky.

The Earps stiffen as the Cheshire cat smile comes over Doc:

                     DOC
          Why, Ike, whatever do you mean?

                     VIRGIL
          Come on, boys, take it easy.

                     DOC
          Maybe poker's not your game, Ike.
          I know, let's have a spelling
          Contest!

                     IKE
               (stands)
          I'll wring your scrawny neck for you!

                     VIRGIL 
               (grabs him)
          That's enough, Clanton.

                     IKE
          You takin' his part?  I'm the one
          Was cheated. God damn pimps,
          You're all in it together.


                     VIRGIL
          Nobody's in anything, Clanton,
          You're drunk.  Go home and sleep
          It off.

                     IKE
          Get your God damn hands off me!
          Don't you ever put your hands on
          One of us!  Don't you ever try to
          Man-handle a Cowboy!  We'll out
          Your God damn pimp's heart out!
          Understand, pimp?

                     VIRGIL
          Don't you threaten me, you
          Little-

Violence seems imminent.  Wyatt jumps in, separating them.  
Behan notices as Josephine gasps, a look of alarm crossing her 
face.

                     WYATT
          Virgil, don't!  Take it easy!  Ike, 
          Just go home and forget it, will you?

                     IKE
          I ain't forgettin' nothin.

Ike lurches to the bar.  Behan takes Josephine aside, 
whispering:

                     BEHAN
          I saw that look on your face just now.
          What's between you and Wyatt?

                     JOSEPHINE
          Absolutely nothing.

                     DOC
          Well that certainly was a bust.  I
          Want my money back.  Come,
          Darling, let's seek our 
          Entertainment elsewhere.

Doc stands up, taking Kate's arm to leave.  But he falls back 
down dizzily, suddenly breaking out in a sweat and coughing.

                     KATE
          What's wrong, Doc?

                     DOC
          Nothing.  Not a thing.  I'm right
          As the mail.

Again he tries to stand.  This time he keels over onto the 
floor and starts coughing up blood.  Wyatt rushes to him.



                     WYATT
          Get a doctor!  Virgil, give me a hand.

They lift the unconscious Doc off the floor.  Ike turns to 
Joyce.

                     IKE
          What's wrong with him?

                     JOYCE
          Lunger.

DELETED

INT- DOC'S ROOM - NIGHT

Later.  Doc sits up in bed, revived but looking like death 
warmed over, mouth gaping open, eyes swimming with every 
breath.  DR. GOODFELLOW stands by the bed, putting on his 
jacket.

                     DR. GOODFELLOW
          Your condition is quite advanced.
          I'd say you've lost some 60 percent
          Of your lung tissue.  Maybe more.

                     DOC
          So what does that mean?

                     DR. GOODFELLOW
          Two years, two days, hard to say.
          If you have any chance, it's to 
          Stop now-smoking, drinking,
          Gambling, night-life.  You must
          Have a healthy diet and most
          Importantly, you must have
          Complete rest-meaning you must
          Attempt to deny your marital impulse.

                     DOC
          Well, that sounds inviting.

                     DR. GOODFELLOW
          Sorry but I'm afraid you've no choice.

He takes his bag and exits, leaving Doc alone with the abyss.  
Kate enters, going to his bedside, and starts rolling him a 
cigarette.

                     KATE
          How you feeling, Doc?

                     DOC
          Better.

                     KATE
          That's good.  I knew it wasn't nothin'.


                     DOC
          We must talk, darling.  It appears
          We have to... redefine the nature
          Of our association.

                     KATE
          What's that mean, Doc?  You know I
          Don't understand when you talk up
          High like that.  You mean you
          Don't want to be my lovin' man no more?

                     DOC
          Not exactly...

                     KATE
          I'm a good woman to you, Doc.
          Don't I always take care of you?
          Nobody cares for you like me.  I'm 
          A good woman.

                     DOC
          Yes, I know.  You are a good woman.

Kate smiles, licking the cigarette.  She puts it in his mouth 
and leans over to light it so her ample bosom bulges over her 
bodice.  As Doc stares at her chest something behind his eyes 
seems to shut down.  He takes a long drag from the cigarette.

                     DOC
          Then again, you may be the 
          Antichrist.

INT - ORIENTAL - DAWN

The cold blue light of dawn peeks through the windows.  Ike 
drinks at the bar, brooding.  He reaches behind the bar for 
his guns, leaning his rifle against the brass rail.

                     IKE
          Bastards think they can cheat me?

                     JOYCE
          Nobody cheated you, Ike.  Go home.

Ike reaches across the bar and slaps him.  Joyce scowls, more 
irritated than hurt and too tired to make anything of it.  The 
few other patrons left look up drowsily.  Ike nods in drunken 
satisfaction, picking up his rifle:

                     IKE
          And I don't take no mouth from
          Any bartenders neither.  There,
          See?  Give somebody a rap on the 
          beezer, get some God damn respect 
          Around here.  Now you tell the
          Earps and Doc Holliday if I see
          'em on the street, I'm gonna send
          'em all to hell on a shutter.  You
          tell 'em that.

Ike and the McLaurys storm off as Virgil and Morgan step out 
onto the street.  Wyatt turns to them in disbelief:

                     WYATT
          What the hell's going on?

EXT - ALLEN ST/TELEGRAPH OFFICE - DAY

Walking down Allen, Ike stops the group at the telegraph 
office:

                     IKE
          I want to send a telegram.

EXT - ALLEN STREET - DAY

We start to feel a growing sense of dread as 3 grim HORSEMEN 
come galloping out of the desert toward us.  Billy Clanton, 
Wes Fuller, and Billy Claiborne ride into town, trotting by 
the jail with the Earps looking on.

                     VIRGIL
          Billy Clanton, Wes Fuller, and 
          Billy Claiborne.  Now there's six
          Of 'em.  This is like a bad dream.

                     WYATT
          Just stay calm, use your head.
          It'll be all right.  Just the
          Same, though...
               (pauses, sighs)
          Guess you better swear me in.

INT - WYATT'S HOUSE - DAY

In tight on a brass-mounted wooden case.  It opens to reveal a 
gleaming Colt .45 with an extra long barrel, the gold shield 
inlaid on the burr walnut grips engraved with, "To Wyatt Earp, 
Peacemaker..."  This is the Buntline Special, Wyatt Earp's 
legendary sidearm.  Wyatt takes it from the case and puts it 
in his coat pocket as Mattie looks on.

                     MATTIE
          Thought you swore you'd never
          Carry that thing again.

                     WYATT
          Yeah, well, I swore a lot of things.

EXT - ALLEN STREET - DAY

Behan and Jospehine watch from the hotel as the 6 Cowboys, all 
but Ike armed with pistols, walk side-by-side down the middle 
of Allen.

                     BEHAN
          I'm terribly afraid this looks 
          Like the end of the Earp brothers.

Josephine goes pale...

EXT - ALLEN ST/JAIL - DAY

The Cowboys swagger by defiantly, giving the Earps sidelong 
glances.  Meanwhile, the street starts to BUZZ, townspeople 
beginning to notice that something is happening.

                     VIRGIL
          Here they are again.  Look at 'em.

                     WYATT
          Easy, Virge, they're just tryin'
          To egg us on.

Suddenly Doc appears from around a corner, a little the worse 
for wear in a long, dark Inverness cloak and carrying a big 
gold-headed walking stick.

                     MORGAN
          What're you doin' out of bed, Doc?

                     DOC
          What the hell's going on?  I've
          Had five people walk up to me
          Saying the Clantons and McLaurys
          Are gunning for me.

EXT - LOT BEHIND O.K. CORRAL - DAY

A vacant lot behind the OK Corral with Fly's Gallery on the 
left and the Harwood house on the right.  The Cowboys stand in 
a knot near their horses, passing a bottle around.

                     FRANK
          Like to teach those bastards a lesson.

                     BILLY
          Probably already scared them to death.

                     TOM
          You call it, Ike.  What're we gonna do?

                     IKE
               (grabs bottle)
          Gimme that.

EXT - ALLEN ST/JAIL - DAY

Virgil comes out of the nearby Wells Fargo office with a huge 
Stevens 10 gauge shotgun just as Joyce runs up.

                     JOYCE
          Those Cowboys're tellin'
          Everybody in town they're gonna
          Clean you out.  They're down in
          That lot right now behind the OK
          Corral.

                     WYATT
          Don't worry, Doc, it's not your problem.  
          You don't have to mix up in this.

Doc turns on Wyatt, genuinely shocked and hurt.

                     DOC
          That's a hell of a thing for you
          To say to me.

                     VIRGIL
          What the hell're we gonna do?

                     WYATT
          Wait till the liquor wears off.
          Once they start getting headaches
          They'll lose interest.

                     VIRGIL
          Wyatt, they're threatening our lives.

                     WYATT
          You'll never make that stick.

                     VIRGIL
          They're carrying guns in town.

                     WYATT
          Virge, that's a misdemeanor.  You
          Go down there to arrest 'em,
          Something goes wrong, maybe this
          Time somebody gets his head
          Broke, suddenly it's a mess and
          It won't end there, you'll have 
          Cowboys comin' around lookin' for
          Trouble from here to Christmas.
          You gonna risk all that over a
          Misdemeanor?

                     VIRGIL
               (pauses, thinking)
          No, damn it, it's wrong, they're
          Breakin' the law.

                     WYATT
               (pauses)
          All right, Virge, your call.  But
          Give Doc the shotgun.  They'll be
          Less apt to get nervy if they see
          Him on the street howitzer.

Virgil trades the shotgun for Doc's cane.  Doc folds the 
shotgun under his cloak.  They get set, waiting for Wyatt's 
cue.  Finally:


                     WYATT
          Well... Come on, boys.

They start down Allen, footsteps pounding the board sidewalk, 
Virgil and Wyatt in front, Morgan and Doc in the rear.  
Bystanders step aside, trading whispers as they pass, turning 
onto 4th St...

EXT - LOT BEHIND O.K. CORRAL - DAY

Behan dashes around the corner into the lot, facing the 
Cowboys.

                     BEHAN
          They're on their way over here.

EXT - FREMONT STREET/OK CORRAL - DAY

The Earps and Doc turn off 4th onto Fremont St. Creek Johnson 
and Texas Jack Vermillion watch as they pass the grocer's.

                     JOHNSON
          There they go.  Look kinda like preachers.

                     VERMILLION
          Yeah.  Or undertakers.

The vacant lot starts to come into view and the Earps are 
fighting nerves now.  Fists clenched, gritting their teeth, 
eyes darting all over the street, they look all too human and 
nothing like their legend.  It's only Doc, bringing up the 
rear, who couldn't care less.  Wyatt narrows his eyes:

                     WYATT
          Virge, you're makin' the arrest.
          You make contact, I'll back you
          Up.  Morgan'll back me up, Doc'll
          Keep an eye out for trouble.  And
          Keep your hands on your guns.
          They even look like they're gonna
          Start something, buffalo 'em.
          Right over the head.

                     VIRGIL
          Wyatt, I know what I'm doin'.

                     WYATT
               (sees onlookers)
          Look at 'em all.  They love it.
          How in the hell'd we get
          Ourselves into this?

Just then Behan walks up holding up his hands, reassuring:

                     BEHAN
          You don't have to worry about a
          Thing.  I just went down there and
          Disarmed them.

                     VIRGIL
          You did?  Great, thanks.  Come on, boys.

The Earps quicken their step as Behan enters Fly's gallery.  
Seeing the approaching Earp party, the Cowboys glance around 
at each other, setting themselves.  Now at the end of the 
sidealk, the Earps can see that the Cowboys are still armed 
and their relief evaporates.  Wyatt mutters under his breath:

                     WYATT
          Oh, great.  Disarmed my ass...

The Earps slow their step, gathering themselves.  This is it, 
no turning back now.  The Cowboys spread out.  As the Earps 
get closer and closer, it seems as if the very air is electric 
with tension.  But as they step into the street and fan out 
for their final approach, they suddenly do look like their 
legend, 4 tall figures in long black coats advancing in a 
line, grim and unstoppable, a fleeting moment in time frozen 
forever in our minds.  Finally they stop.  The 2 groups are 
facing each other, perhaps 20 feet apart.  Doc raises the 
shotgun, the Cheshire cat smile spreading over his face.  
Virgil steps forward, his face set, holding up Doc's cane:

                     VIRGIL
          We've come to arrest you.  Throw
          Up your arms!

A weird moment of confusion where nobody seems to know what to 
do.  Then Billy Clanton and Frank McLaury SLAP their hands to 
their guns.  The Earps instantly tense up, hands on their 
pistols.  Virgil waves his hands frantically, afraid they've 
misunderstood:

                     VIRGIL
          Hold!  I don't want that!

Suddenly realizing what's happening, Fuller and Claiborne bolt 
and dash into Fly's gallery.  Everyone else stands frozen, 
breath short, pulses pounding, each staring into the other's 
wide-open eyes.  Then something in Billy Clanton's eyes seems 
to go dead and Wyatt groans under his breath as the awful 
realization hits him:

                     WYATT
          Oh, my God...

Billy and Frank jerk their pistols and the scene EXPLODES, 
everything happening in SPLIT SECONDS as Wyatt draws and 
FIRES, knocking Frank down with a gutshot.  Morgan FIRES, 
blowing Billy back against the wall of the Harwood house.  Tom 
darts for the cover behind his horse as Ike dives onto Wyatt 
shrieking like a woman:

                     IKE
          No, no, please!  I don't have a gun!

                     WYATT
          This fight's commenced.  Get to
          Fightin' or get away!

Wyatt hurls him aside.  Ike sprints for the gallery.  Tom 
FIRES over his saddle at Doc who tries for a shot but is 
blocked by the horse.  Billly bounces back up, howling, and 
FIRES, the bullet piercing Virgil's calf.  He drops to one 
knee.  Tom FIRES again.  Doc FIRES one barrel into the air, 
the BLAST making the horse rear up, exposing Tom for a split 
second.  Doc FIRES again.  Tom's side EXPLODES into red mist, 
the full charge of red mist, the full charge of buckshot 
SLAMMING him into the Harwood house.  Tom drops his gun and 
teeters into the street, talking eerie little mincing steps, 
already dead but still moving, like a chicken with its head 
cut off.  Billy FIRES again, dropping Morgan with a hole in 
his shoulder.


                     MORGAN
          I'm hit.

Doc pull his Lightning and FIRES DOUBLE ACTION 1-2-3 times, 
hitting Billy in the abdomen while Frank bounds back into the 
fight, FIRING wildly.  Virgil gets up, FIRING BACK.  The whole 
scene now bathed in thick smoke, the fight starts swirling 
into the street, each man jockeying for position.  Inside the 
gallery, Behan and Fuller watch at the window as Ike dives in.  
He snatches Fuller's pistol and FIRES through the window.  
Ike's bullets WHIZ past Wyatt's ear.  He spins around, calling 
to Doc:

                     WYATT
          Behind us!

In a flashing move taking less than a heartbeat, Doc pivots, 
replacing the .38 in this right hand with his big .45, then 
with one pass of his left hand RAPID FIRES quick as a machine 
gun burst 1-2-3-4-5 times, the bullets RIPPING through the 
gallery, showering Ike and the rest with splinters and broken 
glass.

                     BEHAN
          Come on!

Behan hauls Ike up and they dash out the back door, Fuller and 
Claiborne right behind, all frantically running for their 
lives.  Outside Billy gets to his knees, seemingly 
indestructible, and FIRES at Wyatt,  Wyatt RETURNS FIRE.  Eyes 
wild and bulging, a bloody hand clutching his wounds, Frank 
staggers across the lot, bearing down on Doc through the 
smoke:

                     FRANK
          I got you now, you son of a bitch!

                     DOC
          You're a daisy if you do!

Doc opens his arms, giving Frank a clear shot at his chest.  
Frank FIRES.  The bullet grazes Doc's holster.  Frank trudges 
closer, about to fire again but Doc DRILLS him through the 
heart while in the next millisecond Morgan FIRES from his 
prone position on the ground, the big .45 BLAST carrying away 
the top of Frank's head.  As the last shot echoes through the 
hills, Frank flops limply to the ground like a rag doll while 
out in the street his brother Tom finally runs out of steam 
and pitches face first in the dirt, leaving only Billy, 
leaning against the Harwood house, legs splayed out in front 
of him, absolutely shot to pieces, clicking his empty gun and 
wailing piteously as the smoke clears:

                     BILLY
          More cartridges!  Somebody load my gun...

He keeps repeating it with sinking volume as townspeople step 
timidly into the street.  Fly bends down and takes Bill's gun 
from his hand and the fight is officially over, having lasted 
only some 20 seconds.  Wyatt helps Morgan to his feet as Behan 
strides briskly onto the scene, addressing Wyatt:

                     BEHAN
          All right.  You're all under
          Arrest.

Wyatt looks at him in utter disbelief.  Finally:

                     WYATT
          I don't think I'll let you arrest
          Us today, Behan.  Maybe tomorrow.

More bystanders arrive, a crowd scene rapidly developing.  The 
Earp women run up from the west end of Fremont.  Josephine 
fights her way through the crowd from the east.  She and Wyatt 
catch sight of each other.  She grins, tears in her eyes.  He 
nods, smiling.  Seeing the whole thing, Behan fumes.  And so 
does MATTIE who turns and walks away while Allie and Lou run 
to their men, hugging them.  Meanwhile Doc stands over Frank's 
body, fingering the graze over his thigh, jeering under his 
breath:

                     DOC
          You call that shooting?

                     FLY
               (comes up to Wyatt)
          The McLaurys are both dead.  Billy
          Clanton's just about gone.

Wyatt nods, pocketing his gun, sadly surveying the bloody 
scene.

                     WYATT
          Guess we did our good deed for today.

EXT - BOOT HILL - SUNSET

Fireworks EXPLODE in the darkening sky as a cortege of 50 
Cowboys in their finest parade down the street toward Boot 
Hill, the crude little grave yard, Curly Bill and Ringo in the 
lead, Ike right behind with the 3 coffins and a banner saying: 
"Murdered On The Streets Of Tombstone".  As they take places 
at the gravesite Wyatt approaches Curly Bill.

                     WYATT
          I'm sorry.  If there was any other-

                     CURLY BILL
          I know.  Just did what you had to.
          That banner and stuff, that's
          Just Ike.  Don't worry about it.

Wyatt nods, tips his hat, walks off.  Looking after him, Curly 
Bill whispers:

                     CURLY BILL
          Don't worry about a thing

INT- MORGAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Morgan lies in bed, his shoulder in bandages.  Wyatt sits by 
him

                     WYATT
          How you doin', boy?

                     MORGAN
          Fine.  Better.

Morgan looks out the window, staring at nothing.  He looks 
tired, older, all the fun and youthful zest gone from his 
face.

                     MORGAN
          You were right.  It's nothin' like
          I thought.  I almost wish...

                     WYATT
          I know, kid.  I know.  Me too.

Wyatt touches his arm, a look of unutterable sadness in his 
eyes.  This is the one thing he didn't want for his little 
brother....

EXT - RUSTLER'S PARK - NIGHT

The Cowboys are gathered around a huge bonfire, sparks 
drifting up toward the heavens, faces vivid in the firelight 
like an ancient warrior host.  Curly Bill faces them, bottle 
in hand:

                     CURLY BILL
          Here's to the memory of Billy
          Clanton and Tom and Frank
          McLaury.  They went out real
          Cowboys, dead game right up to 
          Their last kick.  They won their
          Places at the big table with Davy
          Crockett and Wild Bill and Old
          Man Clanton.  They're up there
          Right now tradin' shots with 'em.
          And they'll never be forgot.  Not
          Ever.  Hundred years from now
          There'll be men settin' around a
          Campfire, passin' a bottle,
          Tellin' stories about those boys.
          They're what you call immortal.
          And I say God bless 'em.

They all drink, long and deep, Ringo wiping away tears.  Then:

                     CURLY BILL
          All right, first we hang back,
          Just bide away till everybody
          Thinks this's blown over.  Then...

INT - DRESSING ROOM/BEDROOM, WYATT'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Mattie irons shirts in the adjoining bedroom while Wyatt 
finishes shaving in the dressing room, wiping foam from his 
face, looking in the cabinet for a towel.  Opening the bottom 
drawer, a nest of small brown bottles clatters onto the floor.  
Laudanum bottles, all empty.  Mattie looks up as Wyatt comes 
out, bottle in hand:

                     WYATT
          Mattie.  What about this?

                     MATTIE
               (looks up, keeps ironing)
          I need it.

                     WYATT
          'Least you admit it.

                     MATTIE
          Admit what, I'm an opium fiend?
          No, Wyatt, I just said I need it.
          I need something to keep me warm
          At night.

                     WYATT
          Look, Mattie, I know you're-

                     MATTIE
          You know nothing.  What you don't
          Know would fill a book.  Jesus, I 
          Feel like it's when you're around
          I need it most.  You're never
          Yourself, you never relax.  Never.
          Everything's so stiff and dead.
          You always have to keep a rein on
          Everything, ever yourself.  Oh,
          You smile sometimes, I've even
          Seen you laugh.  But there's no
          Light in your smile for me,
          Wyatt, nothing to keep me warm.
          And I get cold, Wyatt.  I get so cold.
               (pauses)
          What's between you and that Jew woman?

This catches Wyatt off-guard.  He looks at her.  She sneers.  
Then:

                     WYATT
          All right, look.  I can make it 
          Right, I can make this up to you,
          Mattie.  I can, I swear.

                     MATTIE
          Will you go to her and tell her
          Right in front of me she's
          Nothing to you?  Right out loud so
          I can hear?  Tell her she's
          Nothing, tell her she's nobody,
          Just dirt?  Will you do that?

Wyatt falls silent.  Mattie stands, staring at him a moment, 
then:

                     MATTIE
          Until you can do that we've got
          Nothing to talk about, Wyatt.
          Nothing.  Now leave me alone.

She keeps ironing.  Wyatt looks as if a building fell on 
him....

EXT - TOUGHNUT STREET - DAY

Behan comes out of Nellie Cashman's, spots Josephine going 
down Toughnut.  He catches up to her, pacing her.  She keeps 
walking.

                     BEHAN
          Listen, I want to talk to you.

                     JOSEPHINE
          Not now.  I don't have time.

                     BEHAN
               (grabs her)
          I saw that look pass between you
          And Wyatt at the fight.  Listen to
          Me!  You're mine!  Understand?
          You're my woman and I'm your man.

                     JOSEPHINE
          My man?  You told Wyatt you'd 
          Disarmed those men.  Do you
          Actually believe after that I
          Could see you as my man?  You're
          Just a dirty little fixer.

                     BEHAN
          You whore!  You filthy whore!

A HAND reaches into frame, spinning Behan around.  Morgan 
stands there, arm in a sling, red in his eye:

                     MORGAN
          You don't talk that way to a
          Female human being!  Not ever!

                     BEHAN
          Look, I don't want to take
          Advantage of an injured man but
          You better-

With his good arm Morgan SLUGS Behan in the mouth.  Behan 
drops like a leaf, as much to avoid a further injury as from 
the blow.  Morgan turns to Josephine, leading her away.  
Across the street Curly Bill and Ringo share a flask, 
watching, Ringo looking even odder than usual.  Curly Bill 
chuckles:

                     CURLY BILL
          So she's Wyatt's slice now.  Looks
          Like we got another name for the
          Tally book.

EXT - ALLEN STREET/ORIENTAL - LATE DAY

Later.  The Earp brothers stand in front of the Oriental.

                     MORGAN
          Dropped him, that was it.  Sorry
          If I made a worse mess for you.

                     WYATT
          I'm the one made a mess.  Made a
          Right fair mess of the whole thing.

Wyatt looks down, miserable.  Virgil looks up at the sky:

                     VIRGIL
          Getting warmer.  Guess spring's comin'.

Just then Morgan sees Breakenridge passing by in silence.

                     MORGAN
          Hello, Billy.  I say hello, Deputy.

                     BREAKENRIDGE
               (turns to them)
          I don't want to talk to you.  Those
          Men you killed were my friends.
          I'm just a nothing, but if I 
          Wasn't I'd fight you, I'd fight
          You right now.  So I don't wanna
          Talk to you.

He hurries away, eyes tearing up.  The Earps look on in 
amazement.

                     WYATT
          All they ever did was make fun of him.

                     O.S. VOICE
          Sister Boy should've stuck around.

They turn.  A liquored-up RINGO stands behind them on the 
sidewalk like an apparition, murder in his eyes, hands thrust 
into the pockets of a long black buffalo coat, ivory gunbutts 
peeking out.

                     VIRGIL
          What d'you want, Ringo?

                     RINGO
          I want your blood and I want you
          Souls and I want them both right now.

                     WYATT
          Don't want any more trouble, Ringo.

                     RINGO
               (steps up to Wyatt)
          Well you got trouble and it
          Starts with you.

                     WYATT
          I'm not gonna fight you, there's 
          No money in it.  Sober up.  Come
          On, boys.

Wyatt turns into the Oriental.  His brothers follow.  Ringo 
howls:

                     RINGO
          Wretched slugs, don't any of you
          Have the guts to play for blood?


                     O.S. VOICE
          I'm your huckleberry.

Ringo turns.  Doc stands there, smiling that Cheshire cat 
smile.

                     DOC
          That's just my game.

                     RINGO
          All right, lunger.  Have at it.

They face each other, eyes blazing, about to reach critical 
mass.

                     DOC
          On three?  You call it.

                     RINGO
          Here it come: one-two-

At the last possible instant, Curly Bill flashes into frame 
along with Stillwell and Spence, grabbing Ringo from behind 
while the Earps step in front of Doc.

                     CURLY BILL
          Johnny, don't, Jesus!  Come on,
          Son...
               (turns to Earps)
          Never mind.  He's drunk.

They haul Ringo up the street, out of earshot.  Ringo is 
boiling:

                     RINGO
          I want them spitting blood!

                     CURLY BILL
          Easy, Johnny.  Now ain't the time.
               (turns to others)
          I tell you, boys, even I'm
          Worried what'll happen once Ringo
          Runs this outfit!  God have mercy!

He pulls Ringo into a doorway, away from the others.  Tears in 
his eyes, clawing the air, Ringo is beside himself.

                     RINGO
          There's no God, there's no devil,
          I hate the God damn world!  I want 
          To die!

                     CURLY BILL
          Easy, son.  You just need to get
          Your feet back under you, that's
          All.  Come on, boy, let's kick
          South.  Down to the old playground.

INT - ADOBE HOUSE - NIGHT

An adobe rancho in the Sonora desert, small, humbly furnished.  
Inside a Mexican family, 3 children, a husband and young wife 
eat dinner.  Suddenly Curly Bill and Ringo BURST IN, guns 
drawn, shouting in Spanish.  Everyone freezes and as the 
children start crying we feel the family's sense of inner 
terror.  Curly Bill looks the trembling young wife over, 
nodding at Ringo:

                     CURLY BILL
          See son, there is a God after all!

EXT - ALLEN STREET/ORIENTAL - DUSK

Nightfall and the wind HOWLS down the street, kicking up dust 
in swirling columns.  A FLASH of lightning streaks down from 
the purple clouds and a THUNDERCLAP crashes in our ears, 
echoing through town into the hills, making the horses neigh 
and fidget...

INT- ORIENTAL - DUSK

But inside it's bright and warm.  Florentino is alone at the 
bar, nursing a drink while Wyatt deals for Morgan and a few 
others.  Virgil looks out at the storm, shaking his head:

                     VIRGIL
          Gonna be one of those nights.

EXT- RUSTLER'S PARK - DUSK

The Cowboys are gathered on a rise.  Curly Bill stands before 
them, silhouetted against the boiling sky, arms outstretched, 
exulting in the storm's fury.   He turns to his men, eyes 
ablaze:

                     CURLY BILL
          All right, boys.  Now's the time
          To get woolly.

INT - JOSEPHINE'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Josephine sits by the window, reading Swinburne.  A KNOCK at 
the door.  She answers it.  Behan enters.  She bristles, but:

                     BEHAN
          Easy.  I just wanted to tell you
          Things're about to start changing
          Around here.  Lots of so-called
          Hard cases and tough-nuts swagger
          Around this town but none of
          'em's got a clue about the real
          play.  None of 'em.

                     JOSEPHINE
          I don't understand.

                     BEHAN
          You will after tonight.  Bet on it.

INT - PARLOR, VIRGIL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Allie and Louisa sip tea by a blazing fire in the hearth, 
warming themselves against the storm's cold.  Mattie sits 
nearby, sewing.  

                     ALLIE
          God, it's a cold night.  Come up
          To the fire, Mattie.

Suddenly there's a KNOCK at the door.  Louisa looks out the 
window.  Outside is the tall silhouette of a WOMAN in a dark 
cloak.

                     LOUISA
          It looks like a woman.

Allie opens the door.  Josephine enter, breathless, comes into 
the parlor.  Mattie sits up in shock.  The others gather 
round.  

                     JOSEPHINE
          Please, I know it's awful me
          Coming here, but listen, I can't 
          Say why, but I think something is-

Another KNOCK.  Allie goes to the window.  There's a weird 
sense of déjà vu as outside we again see a cloaked woman's 
SILHOUETTE.

                     ALLIE
          Now who in... It's another woman.

Allie starts to open the door but Josephine suddenly leaps up 
and:

                     JOSEPHINE
          No!  Look out!

With her dancer's quickness she dashes across the parlor, 
grabbing Allie and pulling her to the floor just as a 
tremendous SHOTGUN BLAST rips through the open doorway.  The 
chandelier overhead explodes, showering the screaming women 
with broken glass and a harsh MALE VOICE cuts through the air 
as the shrouded figure dashes into the darkness:

                     MAN'S VOICE
          Everybody dies!

INT- ORIENTAL - NIGHT

The sound of the gunshots are lost in the wind and thunder as 
Virgil gets up, yawning:

                     VIRGIL
          Getting late.  Guess I'll turn in.

                     WYATT
          Bundle up, Virge.  Cold out there.

Virgil nods, exiting with a wave.  Wyatt and Morgan keep 
playing, hardly noticing as moments later, Florentino walks 
out....

EXT - CORNER OF ALLEN & 5TH STREET - NIGHT

Virgil turns off Allen onto 5th, the wind whipping his 
coattails.  He glances up as Florentino walks by, crossing 5th 
and ducking into a doorway.  Virgil stops.  SOMETHING seems to 
be moving in the shadows of an unfinished building on the 
opposite side of 5th....

INT - ORIENTAL - NIGHT

A BOOMING SOUND echoes outside, muffled by wind.  Morgan looks 
up:

                     MORGAN
          That thunder's sure somethin'.

                     WYATT
          That didn't sound like thunder.

Moments later Virgil walks back in, pale, hatless, a blank 
look on his face.  He moves with odd, shuffling steps, holding 
himself sideways.  Wyatt and Morgan exchange puzzled glances, 
then:

                     WYATT
          Virgil?

                     VIRGIL
          Wyatt...

Virgil does an unsteady stutter-step, his face taking on a 
pleading, almost childlike look of panic.  But as he turns his 
body toward Wyatt we suddenly see that his whole left side is 
in bloody shreds, his left arm dangling unnaturally by a few 
gory ribbons of flesh.  His voice is a frightened sob:

                     VIRGIL
          Wyatt!

He starts to swoon.  Wyatt rushes over and grabs him as....

INT- HOTEL ROOM (VIRGIL) - NIGHT

The hotel room where they've taken Virgil.  He's on the bed, 
wrapped in bandages, semi-conscious.  Wyatt and Morgan stand 
in the doorway with Doc and the women.  Allie is at Virgil's 
side, hands over her mouth as Dr. Goodfellow speaks in somber 
tones:

                     DR. GOODFELLOW
          I'm afraid your husband's been
          Very badly hurt.  I had to remove
          The entire left elbow joint.  What
          That means is, well I'm afraid-

                     ALLIE 
          Oh, no, no, no, NO!

She starts wailing.  Suddenly alert, Virgil sits up, taking 
her in his big right arm, pulling her close, his voice calm, 
reassuring:

                     VIRGIL
          No, no, don't worry, honey.  I
          Still got one arm left to hug you with.

She buries her face in his chest and sobs.  He holds her, 
rocking her back and forth.  Wyatt turns away, shutting his 
eyes.  

INT- HOTEL ROOM (VIRGIL) - DAY

Virgil lies in bed, staring blankly into space.  Wyatt sits at 
his side, hands over his face while Allie hovers in the b.g.

                     WYATT
          It's all my fault.  If I hadn't been
          So damn smart, if I'd just... Oh
          God, Virge, I'm so sorry.

                     ALLIE
          Look, Wyatt, I don't want to talk
          Right now.

                     WYATT
          Virgil, what am I going to do?

                     VIRGIL
          For God's sake, just leave me alone.

Virgil grimaces in hopeless agony.  Allie touches Wyatt's arm.

                     ALLIE
          He doesn't want to talk now.

Wyatt stands, backing away.  He turns pleadingly to Mattie 
standing in the doorway.  She looks away.  He walks out....

INT - HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

Wyatt comes into the lobby and freezes as McMasters 
approaches.  Wyatt starts to walk by him, but McMasters steps 
into his path:

                     MCMASTERS
          No, wait.  Please.  I know nothin'
          I say'll fix things but I want 
          You to know it wasn't me.

                     WYATT
          No?  Brothers to the bone, right?

                     MCMASTERS
          Not anymore, not after this.

Wyatt looks into McMasters' eyes and we can see he means 
it....

INT - ORIENTAL - NIGHT

Morgan is by himself in the empty saloon, calmly shooting 
pool, his dog jumping enthusiastically at every shot as Wyatt 
enters.

                     MORGAN
          Get down, boy.

                     WYATT
          Morgan, are you crazy?  They're
          Out gunning for us!  What the
          Hell're you doin'?

                     MORGAN
          What's it look like?  They want a
          Piece of me they can come and get
          It, I'm not crawlin' into my hole.

                     WYATT
          Morg, use your head.

                     MORGAN
          I am usin' it, Wyatt.  Been
          Wonderin' how the hell we got in
          This tangle.  You know they hit
          Clum's house, too?  Shot up his wife.
          His wife.  Who ever heard of 
          That?  Men sneakin' around in the
          Dark, back-shootin', scarin' 
          Women?  They're bugs, Wyatt.  You
          Know all your smart talk about
          Live and let live?  Ain't no live 
          And let live with bugs.

                     WYATT
          I know, I was wrong.  But Morg,
          Look, we got to get out.

                     MORGAN
          Listen to yourself, Wyatt.  Lie
          Down and crawl or you might get
          Hurt?  What kinda talk is that?
          That's Virgil lyin' over there,
          Wyatt.  Our own brother.  Ruined
          For life.  No sir, I ain't going
          No place.  You want to go, fine.
          I'm stayin' right here and have
          It out with those bastards.

Morgan pulls back his vest, revealing Virgil's badge.  Wyatt 
drops into a corner chair, defeated.  Morgan makes a shot, 
leaving only the 8 ball.  A few beats.  Seeing Wyatt's misery, 
Morgan softens, poking him with the cue.  Wyatt looks up.  
Morgan taps the middle pocket.  Wyatt shakes his head.

                     MORGAN
          How much you wanna bet?

Wyatt holds up his watch.  Morgan frowns.  Wyatt raises his 
brows:

                     WYATT
          I just got it fixed.

                     MORGAN
          You're on.

Morgan has to lean over the table but he sinks the 8 ball, 
looking over at Wyatt in triumph.  Wyatt applauds, rolling his 
eyes just as a BULLET SPANGS into the wall by his head.  Wyatt 
dives for the floor as ANOTHER SHOT pierces the window.  Wyatt 
jumps up, bounding to the door to see several FIGURES cash 
into the darkness.  Wyatt turns back and freezed.  Morgan lies 
across the table with one leg dangling over the edge, jerking 
and shuddering involuntarily.  Wyatt rushes to him.  The dog 
whines as Doc rushes in with Kate and McMasters.  Wyatt is 
trembling.

                     WYATT
          No, no!  Get the doctor!  Jesus Christ!

INTO - ORIENTAL - NIGHT

The curious crowd outside, watching through the windows.  
Morgan is on the pool table, lying on his side with his shirt 
pulled up.  The dog cowers in the corner, whining while Dr. 
Goodfellow digs into the wound with a steel probe, making 
Morgan writhe in perfect agony.  The doctor turns to Wyatt:

                     DR. GOODFELLOW
          Hold him.

Wyatt takes Morgan in his arms.  The doctor probes.  Morgan 
jerks violently.  Suddenly we hear a blood-curdling SCREAM.  
Louisa is in the doorway, tearing her hair, lost in utter 
hysterics.

                     WYATT
          Oh, no, get her out of her!  Jesus!

And now the whole scene sinks into hellish confusion with the 
dog whimpering, Louisa shrieking as others restrain her, and 
Morgan gives a violet jerk, breaking Wyatt's grip.  The doctor 
snarls, about at the end of his rope.

                     DR. GOODFELLOW
          I said hold him, God damn it!

                     WYATT
          Somebody shut that dog up!

Morgan takes Wyatt's arm, his voice like a child's.

                     MORGAN
          You were right, Wyatt.  They got
          Me good.  Don't let 'em get you
          Too.

                     WYATT
          Will somebody get the damn dog out-

                     MORGAN
          Remember about the light you're 
          Supposed to see when you're dyin'?

                     WYATT
          Easy Morg, don't think about that now.

                     MORGAN
          Isn't true.  I can't see a damn thing.

Tears well up in Wyatt's eyes.  He touches his brother's face.  
Morgan's eyelids start fluttering.  Wyatt squeezes his hand.

                     WYATT
          Morgan?  Morgan!

The dog starts howling, long and loud and pitiful-and in the 
next moment the air is FILLED with howls as every dog and 
coyote for miles joins in the mourning.  Wyatt backs away from 
his dead brother and trudges out onto the sidewalk, staring at 
the blood on his hands.  Standing in the crowd across the 
street, Josephine sees Wyatt and starts for him.  Behan grabs 
her.  She wrenches free and with the whole town watching, 
starts running toward Wyatt.  Seeing her, Wyatt backs away in 
horror, shaking his head:

                     WYATT
          No, no, get away, get away from me...

                     JOSEPHINE
          Wyatt...

She keeps coming.  Wyatt panics.  Finally, in desperation:

                     WYATT
          Whore!  Filthy whore!  Get away
          From me!

She pauses, unable to believe her ears, then runs away crying.  
Fuming with rage, Kate starts after Wyatt.  Doc pulls her 
back:

                     DOC
          Can't you see why he did it?

The howls continue as Wyatt trudges down the street alone.  
Suddenly he doubles over, clutching his abdomen in agony, 
staring at his bloody hands....

EXT - ALLEN STREET - DAY

The wagon bearing Morgan's pine coffin waits in the street, 
hitched and ready.  Virgil is up front with the women, arm in 
a sling, pale.  Doc and Kate wait on horses nearby.  Finished 
loading, Wyatt looks around.  People line the street, watching 
in silence.  Clum and his wounded wife turn away from the 
window of their lodgings next door, unable to meet his gaze.  
The very air feels charged with paranoia and recrimination, as 
if the whole town has suddenly become morally radio-active.  
Bystanders gape as Josephine steps out of the hotel, regal and 
impervious as a queen, wearing a gawking scorn like a mink 
coat, her little white dog scampering after her.  Passing 
Behan, he gives her nasty look and spits.  She doesn't even 
break stride.  Lounging in front of the Crystal Palace with 
the other Cowboys, Stillwell gives Curly Bill an enquiring 
look.

                     CURLY BILL
          Naw, she's nobody.  Wyatt junked her.

Passing Wyatt, she doesn't even glance at him.  Doc sighs:

                     DOC
          And so she walked out of our 
          Lives forever.

Without a word Wyatt climbs onto the wagon and shakes the 
reins, driving off.  He pulls up in front of the Cowboys.  
They make a show of pretending to hide their guns.  Wyatt 
looks straight ahead:

                     WYATT
          I want you to know it's over.
          We're leaving and we're not
          Coming back.

                     CURLY BILL
          Well... 'bye.

                     RINGO
               (sniffs)
          Hey, you smell that?  Smells like
          Something died.

                     CURLY BILL 
               (stifling a laugh)
          Oh, Jesus, Johnny...

Allie's eyes flare, Louisa stifles a sob.  The Cowboys 
snicker. Wyatt clenches his teeth, still staring straight 
ahead, and drives on.  A few beats then Curly Bill turns to 
Ike:

                     CURLY BILL
          Take Frank and finish it.

EXT - TRAIN STATION, TUCSON - NIGHT

A train pours steam onto the platform in puffs and clouds 
while 2 porters load Morgan's coffin into a boxcar.  Up ahead, 
Mattie and Louisa fumble with luggage while Allie boosts 
Virgil into a passenger car.  As we HEAR the conductor's voice 
shouting, " 'Board!", Ike and Stillwell emerge from the 
shadows near the scales, crouched behind shotguns.  They 
exchange nods and start forward, cocking their weapons, 
squinting through the steam:

                     STILLWELL
          That's Virgil with the women.  But 
          Where the hell's Wyatt?

                     O.S. VOICE
          Right behind you, Stillwell.

They spin around.  Wyatt stands behind them, looking down the 
barrels of Virgil's big 10 gauge.  Stillwell raises his 
shotgun, Wyatt FIRES.  Stillwell hits the floor in a crumpled 
heap, his torso a smoking bundle of bloody rags.  Screams

                     WAGONMASTER
          Rest of us're 3 months out of
          Independece but we're from
          Carthage, Illinois originally.

                     WYATT
          Carthage, really?  I'm from Monmouth.

                     WAGONMASTER
          Another Illinois man!  Practical
          Neighbors!  Step down, Marshal.
          Have a feed.

EXT - WAGON TRAIN CAMP - NIGHT

Lucinda's ever-silent son sits at a nearby wagon, staring at 
Wyatt while Lucinda rolls dough, lovely as ever.  Just 
finished telling his story, Wyatt sits by the fire with the 
wagonmaster and several others.  They shaker their head:

                     WAGONMASTER
          Ain't got law, ain't got nothin'.
          Only thing between us and the
          Animals.  Always the way it goes,
          Though.  Only way to down an
          Illinois man's from behind, the
          Dogs don't dare face 'em.  Mr.
          Lincoln, Wild Bill, now your 
          Brothers:  Illinois men all and
          All downed from behind by dirty
          Dogs and Democrats.  Guess an
          Ordinary man'd be out for
          Vengeance but I don't figure
          That'll answer here.  It's a 
          Reckoning you're after.

                     WYATT
          If the Lord is my friend.

                     WAGONMASTER
          Let not your heart be faint, let
          Your arm be steel-that's all you
          Need of the Lord.

Wyatt pauses, nodding, suddenly understanding the truth of it.  
Looking up, his eyes meet those of Lucinda.  She smiles, 
wiping flour from her hands.  Wyatt smiles thoughtfully, moved 
by this unexpected encounter....

EXT - WAGON TRAIN CAMP - MORNING

Next morning.  Doc gallops into camp with McMasters, Texas 
Jack Vermillion, and Turkey Creek Jack Johnson, exchanging 
greetings with Wyatt who leads him over to the center of the 
camp, then:

                     WYATT
          Know why you're here?


                     VERMILLION
          Way ahead of you, Wyatt.  You want 
          Us to help you get Ike Clanton
          And Johnny Behan.  Everybody knows
          They're the ones to blame for
          Your brothers.

                     WYATT
          They're nothing.  They're nobody.
          I want the Cowboys.  All of 'em.  I
          Mean to break 'em up, drive 'em
          Out of the territory.

                     JOHNSON
          Are you out of your mind?  What on 
          Earth'd make us-

                     WYATT
               (takes out wad of bills)
          I'll pay you 500 each in advance
          And I'll mount you on those.

He points to his 5 magnificent blacks tied nearby.  They look 
them over as Wyatt takes out a stack of warrants.

                     WYATT
          Got a sheaf of federal warrants.
          Being in the Territories it's up
          To our discretion how they're
          Served.  That means we got the
          Cowboys without quarter.  The
          Black flag, brother.  No
          Prisoners, no mercy, amen.

                     VERMILLION
               (to Johnson)
          500... Year's wages.  And I never
          even saw a horse like that.

                     JOHNSON
          You crazy?  It can't be done.

                     MCMASTERS
          It might be done.  If we hit the
          Waterholes through the southern
          Dragoons, the Whetstones and 
          Huachucas, we could take 'em on
          In pieces, run off their herds.
               (faces Wyatt)
          Keep your money, I'll show you 
          Where those waterholes are.  Just
          Promise me you'll finish it.  No
          Matter what happens you'll see it
          Through to the end.  I'll have 
          Your hand on that.

They shake.   Vermillion and Johnson confer in whispers, then:

                     VERMILLION
          We come through this in one
          Piece, can we keep the horses?

Wyatt nods.  Vermillion nods to Johnson who crouches down with 
a pair of dice.  He makes one pass, two passes... Finally:

                     JOHNSON
          Crapped out.  Okay, we're in.

EXP - WAGON TRAIN CAMP/DESERT - DAY

The thoroughbreds are saddled and waiting, each with a rifle 
in a scabbard and a double-barreled shotgun across the saddle 
fork.  Lucinda's son looks on with gathering awe as Wyatt's 
men, each carrying 2 pistols, face their boss.

                     WYATT
          The minute we start we'll be
          Going against local and county
          Law.  If we fail the U.S.
          Government won't be able to lift
          A finger to help us.  Nevertheless
          I want you to understand we carry
          The full force and authority of
          The law of this land.

They exchange glances, each man feeling a little shiver at the 
magnitude of what they're about to attempt.  Wyatt faces them:

                     WYATT
          Raise your right hands.  Do you
          Solemnly swear to uphold the laws
          And constitution of the United
          States of America and to protect
          her citizens to the best of your
          Ability, even at the cost of your
          Own life?

All chorus, "I do", except for Doc who rolls his eyes.  
Finally:

                     DOC
          Oh... All right.

Wyatt hands each a Federal Deputy's badges.  Doc waves his 
away:

                     DOC
          You know why I'm here.  My
          Hypocrisy only goes so far.

Wyatt shrugs.  They mount up, about to begin, but suddenly:

                     LUCINDA
          Wait!

Lucinda runs up to Wyatt, reaching up and tying a blue and 
gold silk scarf around his neck.

                     LUCINDA
          Your colors.

Wyatt nods his surprised thanks as the wagonmaster steps up:

                     WAGONMASTER
          Good luck, boys.  And give 'em hell!

They shake hands then Wyatt motions to his men.  They take off 
at a graceful lope, riding through camp toward the deadfall 
and the desert beyond.  Unable to contain himself any longer, 
Lucinda's son bounds up onto a wagon, waving and shouting, 
spurring them on with a spontaneous frontier toast:

                     LUCINDA'S SON
          Wyatt Earp, the two-gun man,
          Whistling death and bloody
          Murder!  Wyatt the widow-maker,
          Avenging and bright, purple
          Poison on horseback with
          Lightning in his eye and thunder
          In his heart!  Wyatt and his he-
          Devils, holy terrors and true,
          Five black centaurs blowin' fire
          And quicksilver!  Ride out and 
          Charge and shoot and strike and
          Cleave and hack and thrust home!
          Don't let up and give no rest and 
          Never call retreat till the last
          One's smashed and smote and
          Runnin' for cover.  Best 'em all
          And break 'em up and bang their
          Heads together in a bunch and
          Give no quarter though they be
          Ten times ten thousand!

Wyatt turns in the saddle, sweeping off his hat with a 
cavalier's flourish as he and his men take the deadfall in a 
single bound and pass into the desert.  An immigrant FATHER 
grabs his infant son, lifting him up.

                     ILLINOIS MOTHER
          What're you doing?

                     ILLINOIS FATHER
          Someday he'll be able to say he
          Was there when Wyatt Earp rode 
          Out to bring the law.

Music up, avenging and bright, as Wyatt and his men ride 
through the desert, 5 abreast on their giant chargers, glossy 
black coats shimmering in the sunlight, hoofbeats pounding in 
unison.

                     WYATT
          All right, let's wring 'em out!

They break into a dead run, streaking across the frame.  As 
they crest a rise the ground seems to drop from under them and 
for a single perfect moment it appears as if they're airborne, 
flying across the skyline like the winged horsemen of myth.  
Johnson turns to Vermillion, laughing at the sheer joy of 
being alive:

                     JOHNSON
          Like flyin', son.  Just like flyin'.

EXT - RUSTLERS PARK - LATE DAY

The sun just starts to dip behind the near end of the ridge 
overlooking the camp where on one side Florentino and several 
Cowboys sit in a circle, playing poker while others recline on 
bedrolls, laughing and drinking.  On the other side, at the 
foot of the ridge, Spence, Pony Deal, and 2 others crouch over 
a fire, cooking.  Suddenly the cattle nestled under the far 
end of the ridge start bleating.  Spence turns to Pony Deal 
who shrugs:

                     PONY DEAL
          Maybe they smell a wolf.

SPENCE
               (turns to other Cowboy)
          Go up there and take a look.

The Cowboy mount a pinto pony and lopes up and over the far 
side of the ridge.  Spence and the others continue cooking.  
Moments later a CRASHING SOUND comes echoing over the ridge 
like thunder.  The Cowboys look up, startled.  Pony Deal 
points:

                     PONY DEAL
          Look!

The pinto gallops riderless back over the ridge.  The Cowboys 
exchange confused glances, all attention focused on the far 
end of the ridge.  Then the five black horsemen ride out of 
the sun, gliding like apparitions up and over the near end of 
the ridge and bearing down on the unsuspecting camp with the 
speed of a flame.  They are within a few yards of the fire 
when Johnny Barnes suddenly spots them and:

                     BARNES
          Look out!

Spence and the others turn and just have time to gasp before 
Wyatt and his horsemen SLAM into them with terrifying impact, 
the bodies disappearing under their horses' hooves.  The 
Cowboys recoil in total shock, jumping up from bedrolls, 
stumbling in confusion, scrambling to get out of the way as 
the possemen plow through the fire and roar into camp, pistols 
BLAZING in air, horses rearing and snorting.

                     WYATT
          United States Marshals!  Reach!

Everyone freezes.  A worried-looking Florentino shrinks back 
behind the others, trying not to be spotted.  Meanwhile Doc 
leans down and pokes his pistol into a nearby Cowboy's 
forehead.

                     DOC
          Say something witty.

They herd the Cowboys over to one side of camp, shouting, "Get 
over there!",  "Move it!", etc.  But Barnes brazens up to 
Wyatt:

                     BARNES
          Hey, you can't come-

A loud crack as Wyatt's quirt lays his face open to the bone.

                     WYATT
          One more word and I'll blind you.
          Get over there!

                     PONY DEAL 
               (to McMasters)
          Hey brother, what're you doin'-

                     MCMASTERS
          I ain't your brother, I ain't
          None of your damn brothers.  Move!

                     WYATT
          All right, run 'em off.

Doc and Wyatt cover the Cowboys while the others scatter their 
herd with pistol shots.  Indignant, Swilling sneers at Wyatt:

                     SWILLING
          Bastard!  Stinkin' bastard!  Like
          To eat you blood raw!

A queer look in his eye, Wyatt dismounts and faces Swilling.

                     WYATT
          All right, breed.  Dig in.

And then Wyatt DRILLS him in the jaw with a straight right 
hand.  Swilling drops like a stone.  Wyatt hauls him up by the 
hair and hammers him left-right-left, steps around, digs down, 
and pile-drives a left hook to his gut.  Swilling topples back 
into a seated position then rolls over with a moan and passes 
out.  Meanwhile, seeing his chance, Florentino ducks down and 
makes for the remuda as Doc looks down at Swilling.

                     DOC
          It appears he missed an excellent 
          Chance to keep his mouth shut.

                     WYATT
               (faces Cowboys)
          Felt his liver go on that last
          One.  Get him to a doctor or he'll
          Be dead in a couple hours.

At the remuda Florentino leaps on a horse and gallops off 
bareback.  McMasters point, pulling his rifle from its 
scabbard:

                     MCMASTERS
          Florentino!  He's getting away!

                     WYATT
          Drop his horse.

McMasters draws a bead on the retreating form with his '76 
Winchester and FIRES.  100 yards away, the bullet hits 
Florentino's horse in the shoulder with a "thunk".  It drops, 
tumbling end over end and plunging Florentino face-first into 
the ground.  He jumps up, spitting out a mouthful, and starts 
running.  Wyatt leaps on this black and it streaks forward, 
closing the distance in seconds.  Florentino gasps and runs 
faster, pulling a bellygun from his sash, Wyatt almost on top 
of him.  He turns and FIRES on the run.  A branch next to 
Wyatt's head EXPLODES.  Wyatt keeps coming, drawing his 
Buntline, impervious, unstoppable.  Florentino turns for 
another shot just as the black PILES into him, sending him 
flying and tumbling him down an embankment.  He scrambles to 
his feet as Wyatt dismounts, starting toward him with 
deliberate step, eyes blazing, long-barreled pistol held in 
front of him.  Florentino backs up in terror, gun at his side, 
shaking his head:

                     FLORENTINO
          I don't kill your brother!  I 
          Don't even know him.  I was only
          Lookout.  It was money, they give
          Me twelve dollars!  It was money!

                     WYATT
          A human life.  Twelve dollars.

Wyatt nods, still coming, cold-blooded murder in his eye.  
Florentino screams, raising his gun:

                     FLORENTINO
          No!

Wyatt FIRES, blasting Florentino to the ground.  He advances, 
FIRING over and over, emptying his gun into him....

EXT - RUSTLER'S PARK - LATE DAY

The Cowboys watch as Wyatt gallops up, dragging Florentino's 
bullet-riddled body behind him.  He reins up, un-dallying the 
rope.  The corpse flops at their feet.  They jump back, 
horrified.

                     WYATT
          Look at him.  That's how you'll
          All end up if you don't get it
          Through your head: it's over,
          The Cowboys're finished.  Forever.
          So tell the others and get out of
          The Territory 'cause next time I
          Leave no one alive.  Understand?
          No one.  You been warned.
               (to his men)
          All right, burn it!  Everything!

As his men prepare to fire the camp, several Cowboys move to 
pick up Floretino's body, but:

                     WYATT
          Leave that trash where it lays.

EXT - RUSTLER'S PARK - DUSK

Wyatt and his men ride through the blazing camp, the flames 
lighting up his eyes like a demon's....

EXT - DESERT CAMP - NIGHT

The possemen crouch by their fire.  Doc sits shivering 
miserably by himself as Vermillion turns to Johnson.

                     VERMILLION
          You know, we might just pull this off.

                     JOHNSON
          Not so sure.  Somethin' tells me
          It gets harder from here in.
               (pauses)
          Should've held out for more money.

Meanwhile Wyatt and McMasters confer over a map.  Wyatt points 
to a specific point on the map, very interested:

                     WYATT
          I know that cut.  You mean there's
          A waterhole near there?

                     MCMASTERS
          But this time they'll be ready.

                     WYATT
          We'll see about that.

EXT - DESERT/MOUNTAIN CUT - DAY

Now we see what so interested Wyatt-it's the same mountain cut 
where he and Josephine met.  Pony Deal and a party of 10 
Cowboys ride through the desert 300 yards from the cut, 
pushing a herd.

                     PONY DEAL
          Keep your eyes open for Earp's 
          Bunch.  Swear to God, ain't gonna
          Get the drop on us this time.

                     1ST COWBOY
          Riders up ahead!  ...four, five.
          It's them all right!

They look.  Wyatt and his horsemen stand waiting at the mouth 
of the cut.  They tense, the 1st Cowboy squinting against the 
sun.  At the cut, Wyatt and his men poise themselves, Doc 
nodding:

                     DOC
          They saw us.  Here they come.

The Cowboys charge forward, outnumbering them better than 2 to 
1 and only 100 yards away.  The possemen choke up on their 
reins, alerting their horses for action as:

                     WYATT
          Wait... wait... steady...

75 yards and the first shots RING out, richochetting off the 
walls of the cut.  The others blanch but Wyatt stays cool, 
waiting, 50 yards... 40 yards... till we can see their eyes 
and:

                     WYATT
          Now!

They whirl around and disappear into the cut.  The Cowboys 
keep coming.  Wyatt's group reaches the little trail leading 
up the wall of the cut he used to avoid Josephine.  They 
clamber up the side of the cut at a bounding gallop, unseen, 
as moments later the Cowboys gallop by and continue through 
into the desert on the other side.  Wyatt's group careens up 
and around the high mountain wall as if on a roller-coaster, 
following the tiny, narrow path at a breathtaking clip, the 
trail finally plunging them back into the draw behind the 
Cowboys.  They speed up to the opposite mouth of the cut, 
drawing their pistols as the Cowboys gallop into the desert 
before them, unaware.

                     WYATT
          Lay on!

They CHARGE forward.  Seeing the empty desert ahead, the 
Cowboys pull up, looking around in confusion.  Suddenly a 
VOLLEY of GUNFIRE hits them from behind, knocking several from 
the saddle.  They spin around just as Wyatt's group SLAMS into 
them HEAD-ON, guns BLAZING, Cowboys tumbling from the saddle 
left and right, horses rearing and toppling over backwards.

                     PONY DEAL
          Run!

The remaining Cowboys turn and dash into the desert.  Wyatt 
shouts:

                     WYATT
          Come on!

Wyatt's group CHARGES, the thoroughbreds closing the distance 
in seconds.  Vermillion stands in his stirrups, roaring like 
an animal as he PLUNGES into them, swinging his quirt like a 
saber and LASHING a Cowboy across the face, making him tumble 
to the earth and bounce over the rocks like a rag doll.  
McMasters closes with another, throwing an arm around him and 
JERKING him from the saddle, SNAPPING his neck.  Doc overtakes 
a 3rd, jams his pistol into his face and FIRES point-blank, 
blackening his face with soot and BLOWING out the back of his 
head as he falls.  Reins in his teeth, shotgun at his 
shoulder, Johnson comes up behind a 4th and FIRES.  The 
Cowboy's head DISAPPEARS in a cloud of pink vapor, the body 
dropping like a stone....

Wyatt bears down on Pony Deal at a dead run.  Pony Deal turns 
in the saddle and FIRES at him.  We feel a surge of breathless 
exhilaration as Wyatt swings out of the saddle like a 
Commanche and ducks his body down against the side of his 
horse, hiding in its lee.  Pony Deal turns for another shot 
only to see an apparently riderless horse overtake him.  But 
in the next instant Wyatt darts around under his horse's neck 
and FIRES, blowing Pony Deal head-over-heels off the back of 
his horse.  Wyatt bounds back into the saddle as McMasters 
rides by, drawing a bead with his rifle on the lone survivor, 
the 1st Cowboy.  Only a few yards in front of them, he whips 
his horse frantically, trying to get away.  McMasters is about 
to fire when Wyatt rides up, deflecting the shot.  The Cowboy 
makes it over a rise and disappears.

                     MCMASTERS
          What'd you do that for?

                     WYATT
          So he can tell the story.

EXT - COWBOY CAMP - NIGHT

Curly Bill studies a map drawn in the dirt, listening with 
Ringo, Ike, etc. while the 1st Cowboy describes the battle:

                     1ST COWBOY
          Didn't make any sense.  One minute
          We're chasin' 'em, next they're
          Right on top of us.  We couldn't 
          Stop 'em, they got everybody.
          Just everybody!

                     CURLY BILL
          Easy now, it's only five men.
          Been havin' it their way 'cause
          They been surprising you.  Hittin'
          The waterholes and that Judas
          McMasters is showin' 'em right 
          Where they are.  Pretty damn cute.
          But nobody's cute as me.
               (points to dirt map)
          Next up's Black Draw.  But that
          Smart Wyatt'll say no, that's 
          Where they'll expect us to hit,
          We'll hit the one after.  Iron
          Springs.  That's where they show 
          Next.  Only I'm gonna be there
          First.  And throw a little party.

Curly Bill grins, his coarse face radiant in the firelight...

EXT - WYATT'S CAMP - NIGHT

Doc sits by the fire, shaking and shivering and sweating.  
Vermillion comes up and tries to cover him with a blanket, 
but:

                     DOC
          Don't touch me!

                     VERMILLION
          Sorry...

He pulls back.  Doc wraps himself in the blanket.  After a 
beat:

                     VERMILLION
          You really look awful.

                     DOC
          Not half as bad as I feel.

                     VERMILLION
          Then why in hell're you doin'
          This?  You ought to be in bed.

                     DOC
          Wyatt Earp is my friend.

                     VERMILLION
          Hell, I got lot's of friends.

                     DOC
               (turns, glares at him)
          I don't.

Meanwhile at the other side of the camp, Wyatt and McMasters 
huddle over the map, Johnson walks up:

                     JOHNSON
          Maybe you ought to have a talk
          With Doc, Wyatt.  I don't know if
          He's gonna make it.

                     WYATT
          There's no reasoning with him.

                     MCMASTERS
               (points to map)
          Next waterhole's Black Draw.  We
          Could be there by mid-morning.

                     WYATT
          They're wise by now.  Which is
          Next, Iron Springs?  Yeah, let's
          Try there, Iron Springs.

EXT - IRON SPRINGS - DAWN

A camp near a waterhole with 2 Cowboys crouched by a fire, 
sipping coffee.  Wyatt's men ride up to the rocks overlooking 
it and dismount, unseen.

                     MCMASTERS
          There they are.  No herd though.

                     WYATT
          We'll go around that way, come up on foot.

They pull shotguns from their saddles and start down over the 
rocks on foot, creeping up on the camp, seemingly undetected.  
But suddenly the Cowboys by the fire dive behind a log and:

                     MCMASTERS
          Ambush!  Get down!

And suddenly the deadfall on the opposite side EXPLODES IN 
GUNFIRE.  Vermillion takes a graze and drops with the others, 
hugging the rocks.  A bullet RICHOCHETS into a rock at 
Johnson's head, biting his face with fragments, making him 
wince:

                     JOHNSON
          Christ!

Hunched behind the logs on the opposite side with 15 more 
Cowboys, Curly Bill raises his head, grinning and shouting:

                     CURLY BILL
          Hey, Wyatt!  How the hell are you?

Wyatt and his men react to his voice.  The fire continues.  
Suddenly there's MOVEMENT in the rocks above them.  Doc 
points:

                     DOC
          Look!

                     CURLY BILL
          Got some boys workin' around
          Those rocks behind you.  Another
          Minute or two, gonna have you in 
          A crossfire!  How do you like that?

Seeing the spot they're in, McMasters turns to the silent 
Wyatt:

                     MCMASTERS
          He's right.  They get set up in
          Them rocks it's the end for us.

And now for the first time we see fear in these men, actual 
naked fear.  But Curly Bill laughs, having the time of his 
life.

                     CURLY BILL
          'Course you could give yourselves
          up and we could have a party!
          Then what larks!

Crouched by Curly Bill, Barnes chuckles.  A confident ripple 
of laughter goes through the Cowboy line-they know they've got 
them.  On the other side, Vermillion shakes his head grimly.

                     VERMILLION
          Ain't takin' me alive, damn it!

McMasters looks at the still silent Wyatt, shrugging 
helplessly:

                     MCMASTERS
          Think of somethin' fast or we're cooked.

They really are at the end of their rope, all looking to Wyatt 
for a solution.  He remains silent.  Then suddenly, in this 
supreme moment, a strange, almost supernatural calm seems to 
come over him and he says simply:

                     WYATT
          No.

                     JOHNSON
          What?

                     WYATT
          No.

And now we can almost hear the ether RINGING in our ears as 
Wyatt takes his shotgun and, while the others look on in 
horror, rises to his feet.

                     DOC
          Wyatt!

Bullets WHIZ around him.  Doc jumps up to grab him but a 
RICOCHET drives him back down.  Wyatt advances quickly across 
the clearing, walking right into the teeth of their guns, 
repeating:

                     WYATT
          No...

Wyatt's clothes jerk and ripple as bullets pass through, but 
he just keeps coming.  Seeing this, Curly Bill also stands, a 
weird, manic elation coming over him.  He hoots and howls:


                     CURLY BILL
          Look at that!  Yeah!  Come and get
          Some, boy!

                     WYATT
          No...

Curly Bill waves away his men's fire and walks toward Wyatt, 
12 gauge shotgun in one hand, .45 in the other, BLASTING away.

                     CURLY BILL
          Let me, let me, yeah!  Die, you 
          Bastard...

                     WYATT
          No...

Curly Bill FIRES again.  Wyatt's hat flies off.  He FIRES 
again, digging a gash in Wyatt's boot-heel.  Now Curly Bill 
takes dead aim with his .45 and-CLICK-it's empty.  He tosses 
it aside.  Suddenly a sharp wind gusts up, making the tails of 
Wyatt's duster swirl around him like a halo as he advances.  
Eyes wild with battle rage, Curly Bill quickly raises his 
shotgun.

                     CURLY BILL
          Die!  Son of a bitch!  Die!

He FIRES.  Wyatt's coattails EVAPORATE into swirling shreds as 
he takes deliberate aim with his mighty 10 gauge, hissing 
through clenched teeth:

                     WYATT
          No!

And with that, Wyatt lets go with BOTH BARRELS.  Curly Bill's 
mid-section VAPORIZES, the huge double-charge of buckshot 
RIPPING HIM COMPLETELY IN HALF.  The other Cowboys flinch as 
they're sprayed with flecks of blood and gore.  Barnes 
screams:

                     BARNES
          Jesus Christ!

                     WYATT
          No!

Eyes burning like two twin hells, Wyatt pulls his Buntline and 
FIRES.  Barnes doubles over.  Wyatt FIRES again.  Barnes 
drops.  The others recoil, their faces looking as if they are 
living in a waking nightmare as Wyatt advances on them, STILL 
FIRING.  Another goes down.  Doc leaps from the rocks, gun in 
hand, and:

                     DOC
          Come on!

Now they all rise and OPEN FIRE, advancing 4 abreast, a WALL 
OF GUNFIRE driving the remaining Cowboys off, running for 
their horses.  Wyatt keeps snapping his empty gun as the 
others run up.

                     WYATT
          No...

Beside himself, Doc helps Wyatt to a nearby rock, sitting him 
down and examining him, running his hands all over his body.  
The others FIRE at the Cowboys retreating on horseback.

                     DOC
          Wyatt, my God!  You're shot to pieces!

                     WYATT
          No...

                     VERMILLION
          Yeah, better run, you bastards!

                     JOHNSON
               (turn to Doc)
          How is he?

                     DOC
               (looks up, amazed)
          I don't believe it.  He's clean!

                     VERMILLION
          What?  But I saw 'em-

                     DOC
          I'm telling you, there isn't a
          Mark on him.

They look.  Meanwhile Wyatt starts to tremble....

EXT - CAMP - NIGHT

They're camped by a running stream.  Wyatt stares into the 
fire.  Doc crouches opposite him, shaking his head:

                     DOC
          I'm a man without fear, Wyatt.  I
          Literally don't care if I live or
          Die.  But even I can't fight human
          Instinct.  Somebody suddenly
          Starts shooting at me, I duck.
          But you... what on earth were
          You thinking about?

                     WYATT
          I don't know.  It all happened so
          Fast.  If I'd had a chance to
          Think about it I guess I probably
          Would've been scared but... Swear
          To God, Doc, I just don't know.

At the other end of camp, Vermillion and Johnson sit together.  
After a beat:

                     VERMILLION
          Hey Creek, you ever see anything
          Like that before?

                     JOHNSON
          Never even heard of anything like it.

Vermillion nods.  Both look shaken to the very core of their 
beings.  Finally:

                     VERMILLION
          I just thought of somethin' I 
          Never thought about before.
               (pauses, looks at him)
          I don't want to go to hell.

EXT - CAMP - MORNING

Wyatt sits by the fire, sipping coffee.  Vermillion and 
Johnson approach.  Johnson drops a wad of money on Wyatt's 
bedroll.  Wyatt looks up in surprise:

                     VERMILLION
          Talked it over.  We decided we
          Don't need the money.  Took out 13
          Dollars each, though.  Federal
          Posseman's fee.  That all right?

                     WYATT
          Sure...

                     JOHNSON
          One thing.  We come through this
          Alive, can we keep the badges?

Wyatt nods, picks up the money and quietly moves off toward 
the stream by himself.  Moments later, McMasters approaches:

                     MCMASTERS
          Where's Wyatt?

                     DOC
          Down at the creek.  Walking on water.

EXT - COWBOY CAMP - NIGHT

Ringo crouches by the fire with the other Cowboys, his face a 
deeply shadowed mask.  2 Iron Springs survivors stand before 
him:

                     1ST COWBOY
          We hit him half a dozen times but
          He just kept comin', walked right
          Up to Curly Bill with that 10
          Gauge and blew him up!

                     RINGO
          Curly Bill?  He killed Curly Bill?

Ringo starts making strange little inarticulate sounds, 
inhaling and exhaling like an animal, eyes swimming in 
panic....


                     2ND COWBOY
          He didn't just kill him, he
          Burned him down!  Blew him in
          Half!  I mean all the way in half,
          Like a melon!  Then he turned 
          Around with that big Colt and 
          Killed Johnny Barnes, shot up a
          Couple more 'fore we got out of 
          there.  But it was his face, you 
          should've seen his face.

                     RINGO
          He's just a man.

                     1ST COWBOY
          You didn't see his face

Ringo looks up at them, suddenly dead calm, his face a blank.

                     RINGO
          You see my face, don't you?

Out of nowhere, Ringo draws and FIRES 2 shots so quickly they 
sound like one.  The 2 survivors drop with bullets through 
their brains.  The others jump, transfixed by the insane 
brutality of what he's just done.  Ringo draws himself up, in 
full possession of the situation, the new leader, fearsome, 
matchless:

                     RINGO
          Everybody get this through their
          Heads.  Wyatt Earp dies.  I'm 
          Running the show now and I'm 
          Telling you, Earp dies.  His men
          Too.  They all die.  Understand?
          We're gonna kill 'em.  For what
          They did to Curly Bill we're
          Gonna ride 'em into the ground
          And slaughter 'em like rabbits.
          'Cause this is my time, children.
          This is where I get woolly.

EXT - COWBOY CAMP - NIGHT

Later.  Most of the others are asleep or talking among 
themselves as Billy Grounds turns to Zwing Hunt, whispering:

                     GROUNDS
          What d'you think?  I didn't think
          Curly Bill could be killed.  I'm 
          Tellin' you, this whole thing's
          Gone sour.  We got hands droppin'
          Like flies and Ringo's flat out
          Of his mind.  I mean, hell
          Brother, you feel like ridin'
          Against Wyatt Earp?

                     HUNT
          Hell no, brother.

                     GROUNDS
          Then brother let's you and me cut out.

                     HUNT
          Right with you, brother.

They steal away toward the horses as....

INT - ALLEN STREET - DAY

Ringo faces Behan, grim, intent, while Behan sputters, holding 
up a San Francisco newspaper:

                     BEHAN
          Are you crazy?  It's front page
          News all over the country.  It's
          Getting out of hand, Ringo.  If
          Things don't settle down soon-

                     RINGO
          You heard me, Behan.

                     BEHAN
          Ringo, you don't understand-

Ringo glares at Behan, his eyes burning, implacable:

                     RINGO
          No, you don't understand.

EXT - COWBOY CAMP - DAY

Ringo rides up with Behan and dismounts.  A 3rd Cowboy steps 
up:

                     3RD COWBOY
          Billy Grounds and Zwing Hunt ran
          Out.  Four, five others, too.

                     RINGO
          Who cares?  Separate the wheat
          From the chaff.

Behan looks worried as Ike and the other Cowboys gather 
around.  Just then Breakenridge rides up.

                     BEHAN
          What're you doing here, Billy?

                     BREAKENRIDGE
          Curly Bill was my friend.  I'd 
          Like to come with you.

                     RINGO
          Sure, why not?

Ringo slaps the little deputy on the back and turns to his 
men.  His unaccustomed good humor is very troubling.

                     RINGO
          I told you it was time to get
          Woolly.  Now gather 'round,
          Children, gather 'round.  And
          Raise your right hands.

EXT - DESERT - DAY

Now we've come full circle as Ringo rides across the desert at 
the head of his men 30 strong, armed to the teeth, full of 
fight-and all wearing Deputy Sheriff's BADGES, a posse of 
outlaws, a miserable Behan bringing up the rear....

EXT - DESERT PLATEAU - DAY

Wyatt and his men watch from a plateau as far out on the 
horizon, the Cowboy Posse rides out of the sun, drawing 
closer:

                     MCMASTERS
          That's Ringo out front.  And
          There's Behan.  Must be 30 of 'em.
          What the hell... they're wearin'
          Badges.

They all exchange looks of disbelief, then:

                     WYATT
          Mounts're getting jaded.  We're 
          Gonna have to find a place to
          Rest 'em up.

Suddenly looking very sick, Doc sways dizzily in the saddle.  
Wyatt dismounts, reaching for him.  The others do the same:

                     WYATT
          Doc...

                     DOC
          Don't touch me, God damn it!  Just
          Don't touch me!  Come on...

Doc turns his horse, as if to ride on, then faints dead away.

                     WYATT
          Grab him.

They all catch him, easing him to the ground as....

EXT - HOOKER'S RANCH - DAY

Wyatt's group rides over the hill overlooking the ranch house 
Vermillion keeping Doc in the saddle.  Hooker and 3 of his 
hands rides out to them:

                     WYATT
          Horse're pretty well fagged and
          We got a sick man with us.

                     HOOKER
          You can put up at my ranch if you want.

Wyatt nods.  Hooker motions down the hill toward his house....

INT- BEDROOM, HOOKER'S RANCH - LATE DAY

Doc lies in bed, semi-conscious, white as a sheet, drenched in 
sweat.  The others look on, worried.  Hooker shakes his head:

                     HOOKER
          I'm no doctor but he looks pretty bad.

His face creased with worry, Wyatt sits down next to Doc.  
McMasters motions to the others.  They file out, leaving Wyatt 
alone with his friend....

EXT - HILL OVERLOOKING CROSSROADS - SUNSET

Grounds and Hunt ride up and stop on the top of a hill 
overlooking a mountain crossroads somewhere in the Whetstones.

                     HUNT
          What's it gonna be, brother?

                     GROUNDS
          I don't care.  Colorado, New 
          Mexico, 'long as we're out of the 
          Territory.

Suddenly a STAGECOACH comes into view, making its winding way 
through the crossroads below.  Hunt points, grinning:

                     HUNT
          Just what we need.  Travelin' money.

They spur their horses down the hill, drawing their guns....

EXT - COWBOY CAMP # 2 - NIGHT

The Cowboy posse is camped in a draw up in the Whetstones.  
They look up as the stage rolls up and stops.  Shouting and 
commotion as Behan and Breakenridge approach and confer with 
the driver, then Behan turns to Ringo:

                     BEHAN
          Robbery.  2 men stuck 'em up and
          Killed a passenger.  One of 'em
          Rode a Mexican saddle, the other 
          Had a Mother Hubbard.  Billy
          Grounds and Zwing Hunt.

Behan opens the door.  Mr. Fabian lies inside cradled in 
Josephine's arms, surrounded by the other actors in the 
troupe.  Reclined at full length, head back, he looks like the 
dying Hamlet, even more beautiful than in life.  Breakenridge 
gasps:


                     BREAKENRIDGE
          Oh, no...

                     JOSEPHINE
          We're headed for a booking in
          Denver.  They tried to take my
          Watch.  He cursed them for cowards
          And they shot him.  He may've been
          Vain and an actor but he was
          Better than all of you.  And
          Gentler and braver.  I don't
          Understand any of this, I only
          Know it's ugly.  You're all ugly
          And he was beautiful, he tried to
          Put something fine into your ugly
          World and you killed him for it.
          Anyway the ones who did it are 
          headed north.  Not that you care.

Ringo shrugs.  His soft face suddenly turning resolute.  
Breakenridge goes to his horse and mounts.

                     BEHAN
          Where're you going?  Get back here!

The little deputy straightens his spectacles, turning to 
Behan:

                     BILLY
          I'm sorry, sir, but we got to 
          Have some law.

And he rides off alone into the Whetstones.  Behan sputters, 
but:

                     RINGO
          Let him go.  Who cares?

EXT - HOOKER'S RANCH - NIGHT

The stage is stopped out front.  The driver waters the horses 
and the actors mill around silently.  Wyatt and Hooker walk 
out:

                     HOOKER
          Had a holdup.  Came her to water
          Their horses before pushin' on.

Seeing each other, Wyatt and Josephine freeze.  Wyatt 
approaches:

                     WYATT
          Sorry about your friend.
               (pauses)
          And I'm sorry about...

                     JOSEPHINE
          I forgave you the moment you said it.

                     WYATT
          You did.  Well... thank you.

The driver jumps back onto the stage, motioning to the others.

                     JOSEPHINE
          I have to go.

                     WYATT
          Wait!

She stops.  Wyatt falters.  There's so much he wants to say, 
but... Finally:

                     WYATT
          Goodbye.

Wyatt opens the coach door for her.  She gets in.  It pulls 
out with a crack of the driver's whip.  She and Wyatt hold 
each other's gaze as the stage recedes into the distance.  
Then:

                     WYATT
          Damn... Damn!

Creek Johnson steps up next to him.  Wyatt looks at him:

                     WYATT
          See how she breezed out of here.
          Like she had wings.  Funny thing
          But I can't really remember how
          She looked.  I can remember parts
          Of her clear as crystal, her
          Mouth, her walk, how she shut her
          Eyes when she laughed, little
          Bits and pieces, but not the
          Whole package.  Can't put it
          Together for some reason.

                     JOHNSON
          Good God, you're really-

                     WYATT
          Cards in spades.  I'm in love with
          Every second of her life.  Hell,
          I'll probably love her when I'm dust.

EXT - COLD CAMP - NIGHT

A cold camp in the hollow of a mountain.  Wrapped n blankets, 
Grounds and Hunt sip cold coffee.  Grounds shivers.  Hunts 
pats him:

                     HUNT
          No fire tonight, son.  Too many 
          Riders out.


Grounds grunts.  Suddenly there's an O.S. SOUND.  Both jump 
up.

                     HUNT
          Who's that?

Breakenridge steps from the shadows, Winchester at his 
shoulder, squinting through the dark with his spectacles.

                     BREAKENRIDGE
          It's Deputy Breakenridge.

They relax and lower their pistols, heaving sighs of relief.

                     HUNT
          Sister Boy!  Thank God, we was afraid-

                     BREAKENRIDGE
          You shouldn't've killed Mr.
          Fabian.  You shouldn't've done
          That.  It was wrong.  I'm takin'
          You both in for it.

                     HUNT
          What?  You gotta be kiddin'.  Look,
          Just go home 'fore you get hurt.

                     BREAKENRIDGE
          Don't want to kill you but I will
          If I have to.  I'm warning you.

                     GROUNDS
          No, I'm warning you, Sister Boy!

Grounds steps forward menancingly.  Breakenridge tenses:

                     BREAKENRIDGE
          Don't try it!

                     GROUNDS
          Sister Boy, just go to hell!

Grounds raises his pistol.  Breakenridge recoils in fright, 
stumbling backward in the dark, and his rifle accidentally 
FIRES.  Grounds drops like a stone, a look of utter disbelief 
on his dying face.  Hunt looks at him in shock then turns on 
Breakenridge, raising his gun and snarling.  Breakenridge 
FIRES again.  Hunt grabs his midsection, dropping his gun and 
falling to his knees.  He looks up at Breakenridge who shrugs 
timidly:

                     BREAKENRIDGE
          Sorry.

Hunt falls over, dead.  Breakenridge stares at the bodies, 
hardly believing it himself....

EXT - FRONT PORCH, HOOKER'S RANCH - MORNING

Wyatt and his men are on the porch, listening to Hooker:

                     HOOKER
          ...brought 'em in draped over
          their saddles.  Little Billy
          Breakenridge.  Sister Boy.  He done
          It.  So I guess the law's finally
          Arrived in southeast Arizona.

Wyatt shakes his head, hardly comprehending what he 
started....

EXT - COWBOY CAMP #3 - DAY

The Cowboys are camped on a mountaintop overlooking Hooker's 
ranch in the valley below.  A messenger rides up with a letter 
for Behan as Ringo paces, studying the set up with Ike.

                     RINGO
          Hooker's got around 15 or 16 
          Hands.  We could take 'em right
          Enough but it might be a mess.
          Keep the place bottled up for 
          Now, see if we can figure a way
          To flush 'em.

Behan suddenly steps up, beside himself, holding up his 
message:

                     BEHAN
          It's too much!  It's completely
          Out of hand!  Governor Gosper's 
          Talking about asking the 
          President to send in the Army!  
          Listen Ringo, you've got to get 
          This over with and you've got to
          Do it now.  One way or another.

EXT - FRONT PORCH, HOOKER'S RANCH - LATE DAY

Wyatt stands on the front porch, looking through the front 
door to the back bedroom where Doc lies unconscious while 
Hooker and the others look on:

                     WYATT
          We should get moving.

                     VERMILLION
          Doc's just in no kinda shape.

                     HOOKER
          Don't have to bother about that.
          Took a vote.  Cowboys or not, you
          Can stay here as long as you want.
          Anyway maybe you done enough.  I
          Mean you whittled 'em down
          Considerable, now there's talk of
          Sendin' the Army in here.  Ask me,
          You done enough.

                     RANCH HAND 
               (rides up, points)
          Rider comin' in under a white flag

They look up as the 3rd Cowboy rides up with a white kerchief.

                     3RD COWBOY
          Got a message.  Ringo wants 
          McMaster to come over to our 
          Camp for a parley.

                     MCMASTERS
          He didn't figure on all the stink
          This is causin'.  Might be he's 
          lookin' to strike a bargain.  If
          So, he probably figures he needs
          Somebody like me who talks his
          Language.  Could be we got him.

                     WYATT
          I don't like it.

                     MCMASTERS
          Might as well hear him out.
          Anyways, what choice we got?
               (Mounts horse, whispers)
          But no matter what happens, see
          It through to the end.  If you 
          don't I'll curse the day I ever
          laid eyes on you.

Before Wyatt can answer, McMasters rides off with the 
Cowboy....

EXT - HOOKER HILL COWBOY CAMP #3 - LATE DAY

McMasters rides up with the 3rd Cowboy.  Riding through camp, 
all his former comrades flares at him with pure hate.  Only 
Ringo smiles, stepping up as McMasters dismounts.

                     RINGO
          Well hello, Sherm.

                     MCMASTERS
          You wanted to talk?

                     RINGO
          Yeah, kinda, wanted to see if 
          you'd join back up with us.

                     MCMASTERS
          That what you got me up here for?

                     RINGO
          You're a Cowboy, you're a 
          Brother.  Come back, no hard
          Feelings.

                     MCMASTERS
          Forget it, Ringo.

                     RINGO
          Isn't there anything I can say
          That'll change your mind?  You're
          Gonna stay with your new friends?

                     MCMASTERS
          'Least they don't scare women.

                     RINGO
          You're the boss.  One thing, though.

Ringo moves closer, looking him in the eye and smiling:

                     RINGO
          How you gonna get back to 'em?

EXT - HOOKER'S RANCH - LATE DAY

The 3rd Cowboy rides up to the ranch house, dumps a large 
SOMETHING in front, and gallops back to just within earshot as 
Wyatt and his men run up.  The object is a human corpse and 
though we can't see what was done to it, the expressions on 
their faces are plain enough. 

                     VERMILLION
          Why couldn't they've jus killed him?

                     3RD COWBOY
               (shouts)
          Ringo wanted to be sure he got
          Your attention, Marshal.  He wants
          A straight-up fight, just you and
          Him, settle this thing once and
          For all.  You win, we quit the
          Territory; Ringo wins, your
          Deputies get safe conduct to the 
          Colorado line.  Sundown today in
          The oak grove at the mouth of
          Sulphur Springs Canyon.  Ride out
          With your escort, we'll meet you.

                     WYATT
          You tell Ringo... just tell him
          I'll be there.

                     JOHNSON
          Wyatt, are you crazy?

                     WYATT
          I made a promise.

                     VERMILLION
          Wyatt, listen, you can't beat
          Him.  You're good and God knows 
          You got the courage, but you
          Ain't in Ringo's class.  Hell,
          He's the best that's ever been.
          'Cept maybe for Wild Bill.

                     JOHNSON
          He's right, Wyatt.  Ringo could
          Put five into you before you
          Could even get one into him.

                     WYATT
          But I'd do it, I'd get that one
          Into him.  So help me God, I would.

                     JOHNSON
          All right Wyatt, maybe you can.
          But you gotta die to do it.
          Understand?  You gotta die!

In tight on Wyatt as these words sink in and....

INT - BEDROOM, HOOKER RANCH - LATE DAY

It's late and the last rays of the sun come through the 
window, falling on the bed where Doc lies, awake but looking 
like hell.  Wyatt sits next to him, staring at the floor.  
After a moment:

                     WYATT
          What makes a man like Ringo, Doc?
          What makes him do the things he does?

                     DOC
          A man like Ringo's got a great
          Empty hole right through the
          Middle of him and no matter what
          He does he can't ever fill it.  He
          Can't kill enough or steal enough
          Or inflict enough pain to ever
          Fill it.  And it drives him mad.
          Sick mad.  Cold and dirty.

                     WYATT
          So what does he want?

                     DOC
          What does he want?  He wants revenge.

                     WYATT
          Revenge?  For what?

Doc looks at him, a look of purest sadness in his sunken eyes.

                     DOC
          Being born.

Wyatt looks down again and it's a long time before he speaks:

                     WYATT
          Remember how I said it all
          Happened so fast with Curly Bill
          I didn't have time to think about it?
          Well I've had plenty of time
          To think about this.  I spent most
          Of my life since I was born not
          Knowing what I want out of life,
          Just chasin' my tail.  But now,
          For the first time I know exactly
          What I want.  And who.  And that's
          The damnable misery of it.
               (pauses, looks at Doc)
          I can't beat him, can I?

Doc shakes his head.  Wyatt nods then stands, ready to exit, 
but:

                     DOC
          No, wait, I'll go with you...

Doc struggles to sit up, sweating and trembling, finally 
falling back down, almost passing out.  Wyatt puts a hand on 
his forehead.

                     DOC
          I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Wyatt.  God,
          I'm so sorry.

                     WYATT
          That's all right, Doc.  Don't worry.

                     DOC
          Never got to wear one of those.

Doc points to Wyatt's badge.  He takes it off, pressing it 
into Doc's hand.  Doc smiles then does pass out.  Wyatt 
exits....

EXT - FRONT PORCH, HOOKER RANCH - LATE DAY

It's late, almost sunset.  Wyatt steps onto the porch where 
Hooker and the others wait.  He glances back into the house, 
looking at the unconscious Doc through the open bedroom door.

                     HOOKER
          Don't worry.  They want him
          They'll have to go over us first.

Wyatt nods gratefully, offering his hand.  Hooker takes it, 
abashed.  Wyatt mounts up with Johnson and Vermillion.  They 
ride off at a slow gallop, 3 figures against the twilight 
sky....

EXT - HOOKER HILL/COWBOY CAMP #3 - LATE DAY

Ringo waits atop the hill with Ike and the 3rd Cowboy watching 
as Wyatt's group rides out:

                     RINGO
          Only three.  They left somebody
          Behind.  Let's go take a look.

EXT - HOOKER RANCH - LATE DAY

Ringo and the others ride up.  Hooker steps up with several 
hands.

                     HOOKER
          What're you doin' here?

                     RINGO
          Who's in there?

                     HOOKER
          It's Holliday.  He's sick.  Imagine
          He's dyin'.

Ringo squints through the front door of the house to the open 
bedroom where Doc lies unconscious, chest heaving, sweating.

                     RINGO
          Drag him out here, let's have a look.

                     HOOKER
          I looked the other way when you
          Did a lot of foul things but I
          Ain't lettin' you torment a dyin'
          Man.  Not as long as he's under my
          Roof.  I draw the line there.

Hooker and his men look resolute.  Ringo smiles, nodding:

                     RINGO
          All right, Hooker.  I'll be back
          In about an hour.  We'll see how
          Brave you are then.

                     HOOKER
          I'll be here.

Ringo and his men ride off.  At the crossroads they stop, Ike 
peeling off.

                     RINGO
          Soon as I'm through with Wyatt,
          Swarm down with the whole bunch
          And finish off Creek Johnson and
          Texas Jack.

And they gallop off in opposite directions as....

EXT - SULPHUR SPRINGS CANYON - LATE DAY

2 Cowboys, Ringo's seconds, ride up to where Wyatt and his men 
stand dismounted, waiting.  One points to a thicket nearby:

                     3RD COWBOY
          He's waitin' for you by the big
          Oak, quarter mile up that trail.

EXT - NORTH ROAD - LATE DAY

Behan and the other Cowboys wait at the road above the canyon.  
30 strong, mounted and ready.  Ike rides up, full of 
anticipation:

                     IKE
          Get ready.  Soon as Ringo's done
          We're gonna take care of the others.

                     BEHAN
          Aren't we giving them safe conduct?

                     IKE
          Sure we are.  All the way to hell.

EXT - SULPHUR SPRINGS CANYON - SUNSET

Sunset.  Ringo's seconds wait nearby as Wyatt whispers to his 
men:

                     WYATT
          They're not givin' you any safe
          Conduct.  Soon as the shooting
          Starts kick east for the New
          Mexico line.  Well...

Wyatt shakes hands with Vermillion who turns away with 
emotion, hiding his face.  Wyatt turns to Johnson.

                     JOHNSON
          Wyatt, I... I ain't got the words.

                     WYATT
          I know.  Me neither.

Wyatt pats his shoulder and walks off alone into the thicket, 
the only sound the musical clinking and chiming of his 
spurs....

EXT - THICKET - SUNSET

A gorgeous sunset, yellow and red and magenta.  Making his way 
down the trail, Wyatt looks up at the sky.  A flock of wild 
geese fly overhead in V-formation, oblivious to the human 
drama below.  Wyatt stops, drinking it all in, as if trying to 
grab all he can in the time left.  Suddenly he closes his 
eyes, falling to his knees, trembling, afraid for the first 
time.  He clasps his hands:

                     WYATT
          Dear God, this is the last 
          Battle.  I worked it out in my
          Head every which way and I know 
          There's no way I'm comin' through
          This alive.  You've preserved me
          This far so I only ask one more
          Favor: just let me live long
          Enough to kill that man.  Thy will
          Be done and there's an amen to it.

Wyatt stands back up, his fear gone, replaced by calm, his 
face luminous, almost angelic.  He walks on, spurs still 
chiming as....

EXT - OAK GROVE - SUNSET

A clearing by a creek with a cluster of small oaks.  Ringo  
leans against a tree, sipping from a hip flask, smoking a slim 
cheroot.  We HEAR the CHIMING spurs approach.  Ringo looks up 
as the tall silhouette of his enemy emerges from the shadows 
of the thicket.

                     RINGO
          Well, didn't think you had it in you.
               (smiles, sets himself)
          Shall we?

                     DARK SILHOUETTE
          I'm your huckleberry.

Ringo stiffens as the silhouette steps into the waning light.  
It's DOC, pale and drawn, looking like death itself, but awake 
and ready just the same:

                     DOC
          Why Johnny Ringo, you look like
          Somebody just walked over your grave.
               (sees his shock)
          Oh, I wasn't quite as sick as I 
          Made out.

                     RINGO
          My fight's not with you, Holliday.

                     DOC
          I beg to differ.  We started a
          Fight we never got to finish.
          Play for blood, remember?

                     RINGO
          I was kidding about that.

For the last time, that Cheshire cat smile comes over Doc's 
face:

                     DOC
          I wasn't.
               (pins on Wyatt's badge)
          And this time it's legal.

Ringo nods, his hock replaced by a growing malice.  As they 
set themselves, once again their eyes begin to blaze, boring 
into each other, their concentrated rage focusing on each 
other, about to reach critical mass....

                     RINGO
          All right, lunger.  Let's do it.

                     DOC
          Say when.

A long tense moment then both grunt in unison.  Blurred 
movement, the FLASH of a GUNSHOT.  Doc slaps his gun back in 
it's holster as Ringo stumbles, a bullet hole in the side of 
his head....

EXT - THICKET - SUNSET

Back in the thicket, Wyatt HEARS the gunshot and starts 
running...

EXT - OAK GROVE - SUNSET

Blood coursing from the hole in his head, frenzied messages 
flickering all through his shattered brain, going only on pure 
hate, Ringo stumbles and jerks, struggling to raise his 
pistol.  Doc dances in front of him, urging him on:

                     DOC
          Come on!  Come on!

But finally Ringo falls over into the crook of the oak tree, 
his pistol firing into the air harmlessly.  Doc looks down at 
him, shaking his head:

                     DOC
          Oh Johnny.  You're no daisy, no
          Daisy at all.

Just then Wyatt appears, looking at Doc in total shock.

                     WYATT
          What happened?

Doc looks at him like he's a fool then points to Ringo:

                     DOC
          Poor soul, he was so high-strung.
          Afraid the strain was more than 
          He could bear.

Suddenly we hear HORSES crashing through the brush toward 
them.

                     DOC
          Let's go!  My horse is over here.

They dash off into the thicket.  Moments later Ringo's seconds 
ride out into the grove.  Seeing Ringo's body, their jaws 
drop....

EXT - CANYON MOUTH - SUNSET

Vermillion and Johnson practically jump for joy as Wyatt and 
Doc emerge from the thicket, Doc leading his horse.

                     VERMILLION
          Praise Jesus!

                     JOHNSON
          I'll be dipped in shit.  I will, too.

EXT - NORTH ROAD - SUNSET

Alert by the shots, Ike turns to Behan and the others.

                     IKE
          All right, get ready...

EXT - CANYON MOUTH - SUNSET

Vermillion and Johnson are mounted, watching while Doc tries 
to climb up into the saddle with excruciating slowness.  
Though on his feet, it's clear Doc is as sick as ever, 
sweating and panting, running on sheer animal courage.  Wyatt 
stands behind him, his hands poised to help, trying to will 
him into the saddle, jerking his hands behind him every time 
Doc looks back.  Finally, with a last grunt, Doc throws a leg 
over his horse and drops into the saddle.  Wyatt mounts, turns 
to his men, pointing:

                     WYATT
          All right, what's it to be?  New
          Mexico's that way.

                     JOHNSON
          Colorado's closer

                     WYATT
          So're the Cowboys.  They're up
          That road right now, waiting to
          Jump us.

                     VERMILLION
          We're the law, ain't we?  Well the
          Law don't ride around vermin-

                     JOHNSON
          It rides right at 'em.  Like
          McMasters said, see it through to
          The end.

Wyatt looks at Doc, who shrugs.  Wyatt swings his horse 
alongside, suddenly noticing his badge on Doc's chest.  Doc 
smiles wanly:

                     DOC
          I just wanted to see what it felt
          Like.  Here...

He starts unpinning it but Wyatt stops him, pressing his palm 
onto the badge over Doc's heart.   A last look around each 
other then Wyatt signals and they start up the north road at 
the lope, four abreast, the last charge of Wyatt Earp and his 
immortals....

EXT - NORTH ROAD - SUNSET

From a lookout position above, a COWBOY calls down to the 
others:

                     4TH COWBOY
          Riders comin'.

Behan heaves a sigh of relief, glancing around at the others.

                     BEHAN
          Well I guess Ringo did it.

But suddenly Ringo's seconds gallop up from the flank:

                     3RD COWBOY
          Ringo's dead

                     BEHAN
          What?

Straining to see in the falling light, the cowboy on the rock 
shouts excitedly:

                     4TH COWBOY
          That's Wyatt Earp's bunch!

The word starts to spread, the crowd of horsemen BUZZING.  
Suddenly, off in the distance, the 4 horsemen come into view, 
coming straight at them at a lope.

                     3RD COWBOY
          They're comin' right at us!

Down the road, Wyatt asnd his men pull their shotguns, holding 
them at the ready as they break into a gallop.  The Cowboy on 
the rock jumps down, mounting his horse.

                     4TH COWBOY
          Here they come!  Get ready...

The Cowboys line-up on a rise, blocking the road.  They draw 
their guns.  Wyatt and his men keep coming, now 200 yards 
away.  Behan groans, panic sinking sour and heavy, churning 
his bowels:

                     BEHAN
          Oh, no...

Now Wyatt's men break into a dead run, hurtling toward them at 
top speed, their thoroughbreds eating up the distance, now 
only 100 yards away.  The Cowboys tense up more and more, 
biting lips, grinding teeth.  The 4th Cowboy turns to the 
nearby 3rd Cowboy:

                     4TH COWBOY
          What d'you think?

                     3RD COWBOY
          I think it's time to start
          Workin' for a livin'.

                     BEHAN
          Me too!

They break and run.  So does another.  Suddenly the whole mass 
of them EXPLODES in panic with horsemen riding in all 
directions, scurrying away like cockroaches from a light.  Ike 
looks around, screaming at them, beside himself as the 4th 
Cowboy rides by:

                     IKE
          Kill 'em!  Kill 'em!  It's only
          Four men!  Why don't you kill 'em?

                     4TH COWBOY
          Why don't you?

The others keep going, leaving him behind.  But seeing Wyatt 
bearing down on him, Ike finally bolts himself, pounding off 
hell-for-leather into the hills.  Wyatt and his men keep 
coming at a full gallop and as they crest the rise, suddenly, 
as before, the ground seems to fall out from under them and 
for another burning moment they once again appear airborne, 
grim-faced avenging angels on winged horses, now even more 
majestic in the twilight, like a myth made flesh, awesome, 
superb, and unutterably beautiful.  As they approach, only 
Breakenridge remains, giving them a tentative wave.  Wyatt 
points a finger at him as they ride by in a flash, cresting 
another rise and passing into legend....

INT - HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

The CLOCK on the wall of this private DENVER hospital room 
ticks gently but inexorably as Doc lies in bed with FATHER 
FEENEY, a Catholic priest, sitting at his side.  Painfully 
emaciated, his breathing shallow and labored, Doc is so weak 
it's all he can do to even move his eyes.  But he brightens as 
Wyatt enters:

                     DOC
          Well hell, Wyatt.  Wyatt, I want
          You to meet Father Feeney.  Father
          Feeney's just been initiating me
          Into the mysteries of the great
          And ancient Church of Rome.  You
          See, it appears my hypocrisy
          Knows no bounds.

                     WYATT
          How you feelin', Doc?

                     DOC
          Rather an obvious question under
          The circumstances, don't you
          Agree?  A better one might be how
          Do you feel?

                     WYATT
               (sits down, sighs)
          Hurts.  Hurts pretty bad.

                     DOC
          I imagine it would, yes.  So now
          We can add self-pity to your list
          Of frailties.

                     WYATT
          All right, Doc...

                     DOC
          You think I'm kidding.  You're the
          Most fallible, wrong-headed, self-
          Deluding, just generally
          Benighted jackass I've ever
          Known.  Yet, withal, even at your
          Worst, you're the only human
          Being in my entire life who ever
          Gave me hope.

                     WYATT
          All I ever wanted was to live a 
          Normal life.

                     DOC
          When will you wake up?  You
          Wouldn't know a normal life if it 
          Bit you in the ass.

                     WYATT
          That's great coming from you.

                     DOC
          I played the cards I was dealt, 
          Wyatt.  Your problem is you're 
          Always trying to play someone
          Else's.  Allow me to tell you the
          Truth and thus set you free:
          There is no happiness, Wyatt
          There is no normal life.  There's
          Only life, that's all.  Just life.
          The rest is relative.

                     WYATT
          Then what do I do?

                     DOC
          First you can grab that black-
          Haired woman and make her your own.

                     WYATT
          All right.  Then what?

                     DOC
          Run.  Take that girl and start
          Running.  Run and don't look back.
          All your life you been running
          And looking back and just barely
          Existing and calling it getting
          By.  This time run and don't look
          Back and call it living.  Live
          Every second, live it right up to
          The hilt.  Live, Wyatt...
               (pauses, takes his hand)
          Live for me.

Wyatt stares into his eyes, letting this sink in.  Just then, 
Doc looks up, as if something were pressing on him.  Then:

                     DOC
          Wyatt, please, if you were ever
          My friend, if you ever had even
          The smallest feeling for me, 
          Leave.  Leave now.  Please.

They look at each other and something passes between them, 
something so personal and powerful it transcends emotion.  
Wyatt starts to speak, but:

                     DOC
          Never mind, Wyatt.  I know.  Just go.

Doc turns away.  Wyatt exits.  Doc looks over at Father 
Feeney:

                     DOC
          Now let's see, Father.  What was
          That monkey show you were talking about?

                     FATHER FEENEY
          You mean Extreme Unction?

                     DOC
          That's it.  Better start that ball rolling.

Father Feeney nods, picking up his Missal.  As he starts to 
intone the Last Rites, Doc looks down at the end of the bed 
and sees his feet poking through the sheets.  They are bare.  
Doc smiles:

                     DOC
          I'll be damned...
               (looks at Feeney)
          This is funny.

INT - DENVER THEATER STAGE - NIGHT

A lively road company production of "H.M.S. Pinafore".  
Josephine and 3 chorus girls, all adorable in out-size sailor 
suits do the seamen's hornpipe to the resounding applause of 
the audience....

INT - DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Josephine and her fellow chorines, including the 1st Actress 
from before, all in various stages of undress, sit at the long 
mirror, removing their make-up and chatting:

                     1ST ACTRESS
          I can't get used to this thin air
          Here in Denver.  I thought I was 
          Going to faint on that last buck-
          And-wing.

                     JOSEPHINE
          I know, it's-

Suddenly the door bursts open.  Screams and stunned reaction.  
Wyatt rushes in and goes to Josephine who sits in stunned 
silence.  He falls to his knees and grabs the hem of her robe.

                     JOSEPHINE
          Wyatt!  My God...

                     WYATT
          Did you ever see the sun come up 
          Over the Rockies?  It hits all of
          A sudden and below there's
          California and you swear you're 
          Looking at heaven.

Wyatt stands, pulling her close, clasping her hands in his:

                     WYATT
          I have nothing left.  I have
          Nothing to give you.  I have no
          Pride, no dignity, no money.  I
          Don't even know how we'll make a
          Living.  But I promise I'll love
          You every second of your life.

                     JOSEPHINE
          Don't worry, Wyatt.  My family's rich.

INT/EXT - TRAIN - DAY

Brilliant sunlight, clean, crisp air as a train hurtles 
through a pass high up in the Rocky Mountains, blowing its 
whistle and sending a giant plume of steam billowing up over 
the sheer, towering, snow-topped mountain walls into the 
crystal-clear sky above.  Wyatt leads Josephine by the hand 
through the parlor car, both hardly able to contain 
themselves, brimming over with excitement and anticipation, 
like children waiting for Christmas morning and trying to 
ignore the group of REPORTERS dogging their footsteps, 
swarming around them, calling out to Wyatt:



                     1ST REPORTER
          Mr Earp!  One minute, please!  You
          And your four men have just
          Accomplished in one week what it
          Took the Texas Rangers four years
          To do.  Please, do you have any comment?

Wyatt and Josephine hunch down and duck through a knot of 
porters into the next car.  Only the 1st Reporter gives chase.  
Moving into the passenger car furthest forward, Wyatt leads 
her through the door to the platform over the coupling between 
cars.  Chugging up a steep grade toward a high crest, the 
train is immersed in shadows.  Wyatt points ahead to the 
approaching crest:

                     WYATT
          There.  It'll come up over that ridge.

Inside meanwhile, the 1st Reporter comes through the car and 
spots them up.  A business-type PASSENGER tugs on his sleeve:

PASSENGER
What's the commotion?  Who are they?

                     1ST REPORTER
          Don't you know?  That's Wyatt
          Earp, the Lion of Tombstone, and
          His lady fair.

Outside, still bathed in shadows, Wyatt and Josephine hang 
onto the railing and lean out, watching in as the train nears 
the top.

                     WYATT
          Get ready, here it comes!  Here it comes!

Then, as if on cue, they crest the mountain and are suddenly 
bathed in golden sunlight, their heads leaning from the train, 
Wyatt's blonde hair and Josephine's black tresses flowing in 
the breeze, their faces luminous, looking straight ahead 
toward their future.  Hold on this image as the sun gets 
brighter and brighter, finally making the frame white-out as 
we....

                                           FADE OUT:

EPILOG/DESERT : an OLD MAN and WOMAN walk arm-in-arm through 
the Mojave, tiny figures in a vast landscape, Sierras looming 
in the distance.

                     V.O. NARRATION
          "Wyatt and Josephine embarked on
          a series of adventures throughout
          the west, making and losing
          several fortunes, always living
          the high life, spending every
          winter, just the two of them,
          prospecting for gold in the
          desert foothills of southeastern
          California.  Up or down, thin or
          Flush, in 47 years they never
          Left each other's side."

The figures of the old man and woman fade away, leaving only 
the desert and the mountains which are eternal....

                     V.O. NARRATION
          "Wyatt Earp died in Los Angeles
          in 1929.  Among the pallbearers at
          his funeral were early western 
          movie stars William S. Hart and
          Tom Mix."

Flickering images from early Hollywood silent films split the 
frame: on one side the grim but impassioned figure of William 
S. Hart, the original western good-badman crouched menacingly 
behind a pair of sixguns, his costume dusty and severe; and on 
the other side Tom Mix, the original western fantasy hero, so 
light-hearted and optimistic with his sunny grin and fancy 
white outfit....

                     V.O. NARRATION
          "Tom Mix wept."


HOLD on these two images as the music swells and we....

                                           FADE TO BLACK.
THE END
