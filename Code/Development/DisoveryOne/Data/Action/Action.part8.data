FADE IN:

EXT. A HYPERBLUE LOS ANGELES SKY -- DAY

The sky is overlaid with the slow whup-whup-whup of an LAPD
helicopter flashing through the frame, here and gone.

LAPD radio transmissions crackle like static electricity
around a dirty clapboard bungalow that looks like the
puckered asshole of Eagle Rock.

A man's terrified voice screams invisibly from the house --

                     MALIK'S VOICE
           I'm gonna kill this dog!  You make my
           wife talk to me or I'm gonna shoot this
           fuckin' dog!

A five-member SWAT tactical team appears out of nowhere--full
black assault gear, M5s, gloved and masked--hustling into
position on either side of the front door.  Only now do we
get the full picture:  Helicopters overhead, radio cars
surrounding the house, an army of cops itching the pull the
trigger --

When the tac team is good to go, the team leader gives a
thumbs-up to --

SERGEANT JEFF TALLEY AND LT. MURRAY LEIFITZ

Talley and Leifitz are hunkered behind the LAPD Command and
Control van.  Leifitz is the Crisis Response Team SWAT 
commander; Talley, the primary negotiator.  It's so hot out
here that Talley has stripped down to a tee-shirt and vest.

                     LEIFITZ
           They're good to go, Talley.  Your word,
           and we're in the house.

                     TALLEY
           No one's going anywhere, L-T.  We can
           talk this guy down.

Talley lifts a dedicated crisis phone that's been hardlined
into the house, his tone reasonable and friendly --

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
               (into the phone)
           Hey, George?  George, don't kill the dog,
           okay?  We don't want to hear a gun go off
           in there.

A phone crashes through the window and lands in the front
yard --

                     MALIK'S VOICE
               (screaming from the house)
           Fuck you!

                     LEIFITZ
           I don't think he wants to talk.

Frustrated, Talley slumps back against the van as the SWAT
Intelligence Officer, Lloyd Keith, scuttles up to them --

                     TALLEY
           Where's the guy's wife?

                     KEITH
           She didn't take the kid to her sister's.
           The neighbors were wrong.

                     TALLEY
           Goddamnit, you said we had her.  I told
           him we had her!

                     KEITH
           We got bad information, Talley.  I can't
           pull her out of my ass!

Up at the house, George Edward Malik steps into the window.
Malik is a forty-year-old freaked-out loser who has turned
the corner on insanity --

                     MALIK
               (shouting at Talley)
           You said my wife was gonna talk to me,
           you lying fuck!  I'm gonna kill her dog,
           then shoot myself!  I mean it!

Talley stares at Malik, thinking, then abruptly grabs Keith
by the collar --

                     TALLEY
               (to Keith)
           Pull the dog's name out of your ass.  Get
           the dog's name.

Talley steps out from behind the command van so that Malik
can see him.

                     LEIFITZ
               (alarmed by Talley's move)
           Talley!  You're in the line of fire!

Talley ignores Leifitz; he is totally focused on Malik and on
defusing the situation --

                     TALLEY
           I didn't lie to you, George.  You scared
           your wife pretty good last night.  We're
           having a hard time finding her.

                     MALIK
           She better talk to me!  I'm gonna kill
           her goddamned dog!

                     TALLEY
           You and I have been talking for, what, 
           sixteen hours?  Keep talking.  Is that
           your dog, too?

Malik steps away from the window --

                     MALIK'S VOICE
           I don't know whose dog it is.  She lied
           about everything else, so she probably
           lied about the dog.

                     TALLEY
           I know you're hurting.  You lose your
           job, you find out your wife's fucking
           another guy . . . but don't give up.
           We'll have her talk to you.

                     MALIK'S VOICE
           Then why won't she open her mouth?!  Why
           doesn't the bitch say something??? 

Something about Malik's statement bothers Talley.  The
wording is odd, suspicious --

                     TALLEY
           George?  Come back to the window.

                     MALIK'S VOICE
           STOP LOOKING AT ME!!!

Talley grows even more concerned.  Was Malik talking to him?

                     TALLEY
           George?  Leave the dog alone and come to
           the window.

Talley sees Keith rejoin Leifitz --

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
               (to Leifitz)
           What's the dog's name?

                     LEIFITZ
           The neighbors say he doesn't have a dog.

The pieces fall into place for Talley:  The wife that no one
can find, the dog that doesn't exist....

                     MALIK'S VOICE
           OPEN YOUR GODDAMNED MOUTH OR I'M GONNA
           SHOOT THIS DOG!

In a single terrible moment, Talley realizes that Malik is
not talking to him; he's talking to his wife --

                     TALLEY
           Murray!!  They're in the house!  His
           wife's in the house!

Even as Talley screams, a gunshot echoes from the house,
freezing the moment.  A second shot follows the first as the
tactical team breaches the front door --

Talley sprints forward, running as hard as he can in
nightmare slow motion --

INT. MALIK'S HOUSE -- DAY

Talley shoulders inside on the heels of the tactical team
through drifting gun smoke and lancing sunlight.  SWAT cops
are cuffing Malik even though he's already dead of a self-
inflicted gunshot wound; Malik's wife is sprawled on the
couch where she has been dead for fourteen hours; two tac
officers are trying to stop the geyser of arterial blood that
sprays from the neck of Malik's nine-year-old son even as one
of them screams for the paramedics --

Talley is numb; it's all too much, too heavy, too horrible.
He kneels between to the tactical cops and takes the boy's
hand.  He stares into the boy's eyes, and the boy stares
back.  The child's face grows pale as he drains of blood.  We
hear his heart beating.  We hear it slow.  We hear it stop.

Talley stares at the dead boy.  The dead boy's lifeless eyes
stare at nothing.

TITLES

Another hyperblue sky, but now we're in an upscale bedroom
community in the sun-scorched high desert north of LA --

A legend appears:  One Year Later.

EXT. KIM'S MINIMARKET AND GAS STATION -- DAY

A rotted-out Toyota pickup lurches to a stop alongside the
minimart, white-boy hip-hop booming on the radio which dies
with the engine --

Dennis Rooney is driving; twenty-three years old, working-
class desert trash with a high opinion of his own brooding
good looks.  In the middle: Kevin Rooney, nineteen, scared
shitless at what they're about to do.  Riding shotgun:  Mars
Krupchek, twenty-four, a large pasty guy with a shaved head
and faraway eyes.

                     KEVIN
           C'mon, Dennis, this is stupid.  I thought
           we were gonna go to the movies.

                     DENNIS
               (grins past Kevin to Mars)
           Mars?!  Whattaya think, dude?  Out here
           on the edge, no one around, it's perfect,
           right?

                     MARS
           I'll check it out.

Mars slides out of the truck.  He has a tattoo on the back of
his tattoo that says:  BURN IT.

As soon as Mars is gone, Dennis frowns at Kevin --

                     DENNIS
           Try to act cool, okay?  He's gonna think
           you're a dick.

                     KEVIN
           Robbing this place is gonna put you back
           in prison.

                     DENNIS
           Not if they don't catch us, Kevin.

                     KEVIN
           We got jobs, man; we're working.  Why
           even take the chance?

                     DENNIS
           Because if you don't take the chance,
           you're already dead.

Dennis pulls a pistol from his pants to check the magazine.

                     DENNIS (CONT'D)
           Thirty seconds, we'll be down the road.
           Thirty seconds.  Then we'll go to the
           movies.

Mars returns and nods his approval --

                     MARS
           It's perfect.

That's all it takes.

INT. KIM'S MINIMART -- DAY

Junior Kim, Jr., is short, squat, and forty-two years old.
He's reading a magazine behind the counter when Dennis and
Mars enter; Dennis trying to disarm him with a smile --

As Dennis reaches the counter, he lifts his tee-shirt to
reveal the butt of his pistol --

                     DENNIS
           A pack of Marlboros for my friend and all
           your cash, you gook motherfucker!

But Junior Kim is ready.  He lurches to his feet, bringing up
a pistol of his own --

                     MARS
           He's got a gun!

Dennis lunges across the counter, grabbing Kim's gun, and the 
two men are suddenly locked in a ferocious death-struggle for
possession of the weapon --

                     DENNIS
           Mars, help me --

Dennis and Kim bounce from the counter to the Slurpy machine,
the Glock locked between them, pointing first one way, then
the other, their eyes meeting as -- BAM -- the gun goes off.

Junior Kim's eyes widen.  Dennis and Junior both look down at
the red blossom that grows on Junior Kim's chest --

                     KEVIN
               (screaming in the background)
           Dennis!  Dennis, someone's coming!

Kim falls into the Slurpy machine, then slides to the floor.
Dennis scrambles over the counter and sprints for the door. 

But Mars hesitates.  Instead of running, he picks up Kim's
gun, then leans over the counter to look at Kim's body.  We
cannot see his face --

EXT. THE MINIMART -- DAY

A forty-something soccer mom named Margaret Hammond is about
to enter the minimart when Dennis and Kevin burst out,
knocking her on her ass.  Mars follows a moment later --

Margaret watches their red pickup lurch away, then rushes
into the store --

INT. THE TRUCK -- DAY

Dennis power-shifts into gear, clashing tortured metal as he
pushes the Toyota as hard as it will go.  No one is talking;
they're screaming --

                     KEVIN
           There's fuckin' blood all over you!

                     DENNIS
           I didn't know he would have a gun!  It
           just went off!

Dennis sees himself in the rearview mirror.  His face is 
splattered with red dew, the sight of it freaking him out --

                     DENNIS (CONT'D)
           Jesus!  Fuckin' Jesus, it's on my face!

The trunk careens crazily off the road.  Mars calmly runs a
hand over Dennis's face --

                     MARS
           Relax.  It's only blood.

Dennis upshifts hard again, the truck lurching as the tranny
howls --

                     DENNIS
           FUCK you, Mars!  I got it all over me!

-- whereupon the tortured transmission gives with a loud BANG
and the truck loses power --

                     DENNIS (CONT'D)
           MotherFUCKING piece of SHIT!!!

EXT. FLANDERS ROAD -- DAY

Flanders Road is lined with trees, hedges, and the exclusive
housing developments that dot the countryside around Bristo
Camino.

The Toyota jerks to a stop well off the road, and Dennis,
Mars, and Kevin pile out, stuffing pistols and bullets into
their pockets --

                     KEVIN
           That woman's gonna call the cops.

                     DENNIS
           Shut up, goddamnit!  Just calm down!

                     KEVIN
           What if he's dead?  What if you killed
           him?

Dennis grabs him by the throat; Mars steps between them --

                     MARS
           People are looking.

Dennis sees that Mars is right; people in passing cars are
looking.  He releases his brother --

                     DENNIS
           That's why we gotta keep going.  I'm not
           gonna go in for murder.

                     KEVIN
           We're on foot.  We can't get away.

                     DENNIS
           We're surrounded by houses, dumbass.
           Every house has a car in the garage.
           All we have to do is take one.

Dennis and Mars take off for the wall, Kevin reluctantly
following --

EXT. WALTER SMITH'S HOME -- THE CUL-DE-SAC -- DAY

The camera reveals a two-story California Mediterranean home
in the exclusive housing development known as York Estates.
You can't get in the door for less than one-point-five, and
this house costs more:  Eight thousand square feet of used
brick and custom tile set on a lushly landscaped acre --

                     WALTER SMITH'S VOICE
           You can pick them up whenever you want.

INT. WALTER SMITH'S OFFICE -- DAY

Walter Smith is at his computer behind his desk.  He's forty
and fit, casually dressed with thinning hair and glasses,
currently leaning back as he talks on his phone --

                     WALTER
               (into the phone)
           I have his corporate and personal on two
           disks, labeled Marlon and Al.

As Smith talks, he ejects a Zip disk from his computer,
attaches a label reading Al, then places it in a palm-sized
case beside the first disk, Marlon --

                     WALTER (CONT'D)
           What, you don't have a sense of humor?
           He's going to love it.

Walter's ten-year-old son, Thomas, suddenly charges around
the desk and pulls at his father's arm --

                     THOMAS
           My stomach is eating me!

                     WALTER
               (into the phone)
           Yeah, that's Thomas, the human piranha.
           I have to feed the animals while Pam's in
           Florida with her sister.

                     THOMAS
           My stomach has teeth!  It's eating my
           guts!

                     WALTER
               (still with the phone)
           Listen, is Glen on his way?  Great.  The
           paper's bagged and ready to go.  Bye.
               (hangs up; then)
           All right, all right, all right--it's 
           feeding time!

Walter allows his son to pull him around the desk to --

EXT. THE SMITHS' BACK YARD -- THE POOL -- DAY

A boom box blasts the latest teendiva megahit as Walter's
sixteen-year-old daughter, Jennifer, stretches out in cutoff
shorts and a bikini top, working on her tan.

Walter and Thomas appear in the French doors that open from
the back of the house --

                     WALTER
               (calling)
           Jen!  Come feed your brother!  He's
           wasting away!

                     JENNIFER
           Can't we send him to Florida?

                     WALTER
           Jen, c'mon, chop-chop!  I've got to
           finish my work!

Jennifer rolls her eyes, rises from the chaise longue, and
pads to the house.  As she clears the frame, the camera
swings toward the overgrown wall at the edge of the property.
Dennis silenty drops into the bushes --

EXT. BRISTO CAMINO PATROL CAR -- DAY

A sky blue Bristo Camino patrol car cruises along Flanders
Road --

INT. THE CRUISER -- OFFICER MIKE WELCH -- DRIVING

Welch is a young officer with an innocence to his eyes that
you don't find in urban cops.  He keeps a photo of his wife
and toddler son taped to the dash.

                     RADIO
           Four, base.  You there, Mike?

Welch picks up the radio microphone --

                     WELCH
           Four.  I'm gonna hit the Krispy-Kreme.
           You want a dozen?

                     RADIO
           Armed robbery, Kim's Minimart on Flanders
           Road, shots fired with a man down.

This is so unexpected that Welch waits for the punchline --

                     WELCH
           Are you kidding me?

                     RADIO
           Ah, suspects are three white males
           driving a red pickup last seen eastbound
           on Flanders.

Welch turns on his lights just as he sees the red Toyota
pickup abandoned on the side of the road and stands on his
brakes --

INT. THE SMITHS' KITCHEN -- A FEW MINUTES LATER

The Smiths' home sports an open floor plan with the kitchen
centrally located between a large family room, a hall that
leads to the front of the house, and the French doors that
open onto the pool area.

Jennifer is putting the finishing touches on three tuna
sandwiches as she calls to her brother --

                     JENNIFER
           Tell Daddy that lunch is ready.
               (no answer)
           Thomas, don't be a turd.  Tell --!

She turns to find herself face-to-face with Dennis, who
clamps a hand over her mouth --

                     DENNIS
               (quietly)
           I'm not going to hurt you.

Mars is holding Thomas.  Kevin is by the French doors --

                     DENNIS (CONT'D)
           Stop fighting.  Relax, and I'll let go.

Jennifer struggles until she sees that Mars is holding a
pistol to Thomas's head --

                     DENNIS (CONT'D)
           That's better.  Be cool and we'll be
           outta here in five minutes.  Understand?

Jennifer nods, and Dennis removes his hand.  He has her
pinned to the counter, his body pressed into her's; she is
suddenly very aware that she is almost naked --

                     DENNIS (CONT'D)
           Who else is here?

                     JENNIFER
           My father.

Dennis grabs her hair and pulls her away --

INT. SMITHS' OFFICE -- DAY

It happens fast:  Dennis shoves Jennifer into the room, and
Mars and Kevin follow with Thomas --

Walter is feeding a computer print-out into a paper shredder
as they burst through the door --

                     DENNIS
           Get your ass in the chair!  Sit down!

Dennis shoves Jennifer to the floor and stalks directly
across the room, his gun trained on Walter.

Walter freezes, hands motionless, letting the paper feed into
the shredder.  Strangely, he has little outward reaction --

                     WALTER
               (quietly)
           Jen?  Are you all right?

                     DENNIS
           She'll be dead if you don't put your ass
           in that chair!

Walter carefully sits.  He is amazingly calm in the face of
this invasion.

                     DENNIS (CONT'D)
           Kevin!  Don't stand there, asshole, close
           the windows!  Mars, keep him covered,
           dude!

Mars pushes Thomas down beside Jennifer, then aims his gun at
Walter.  Kevin closes the shutters as Dennis rips the 
electric cord from a lamp --

                     WALTER
           Who sent you?

                     DENNIS
           Don't go Rambo and you'll tell'm about
           this on the back nine.  I'm gonna tie you
           up, then we're gonna take your car.

Walter glances toward the shredder; the final page of paper
emerges as spaghetti and then the shredder stops --

                     WALTER
           The car.  All you want is the car?

                     DENNIS
           Am I talkin' raghead?!  I want your car!
           Gimme the goddamned keys!

A strange smile flickers at the corner of Walter's mouth as
if there's a joke within all this, then --

                     WALTER
           The keys are on the wall by the garage.
           Take it.  The tank's almost full.

                     KEVIN
           Dennis!  The cops!

Dennis rushes to the window --

EXT. THE SMITHS' HOUSE -- CUL DE SAC -- DAY

Mike Welch climbs out of the patrol car and keys his shoulder
mike as he appraises the house --

                     WELCH
               (into his radio mike)
           They had to go through the yard at 455
           Castle Way.  I'm going to approach.

Welch slowly moves up the walk toward the front door --

INT. THE ENTRY -- DAY

Dennis shoves Jennifer to the door --

                     DENNIS
           Open it!  You remember I'm right here!

EXT. THE HOUSE -- WITH WELCH

Welch is halfway up the walk when the door opens and
Jennifer, clearly terrified, peers out.  Welch hesitates --

                     WELCH
               (into his mike)
           Teenage female opened the front door.
               (to Jennifer)
           Miss, I found an abandoned vehicle on the
           other side of your wall.  Did three young
           men run through the area?

Jennifer doesn't answer.  Her eyes fill until two huge tears
roll down her cheeks.  Welch grows uneasy.  Something is
wrong, but he doesn't know what.  He stays where he is --

                     WELCH (CONT'D)
           Miss?

                     JENNIFER
           I didn't . . . see anyone.

Welch stares into Jennifer's eyes, pointedly shifting his
gaze to ask the silent question:  Are they here?

INT. WALTER'S OFFICE -- MARS AND KEVIN

are peering out the shutters when --

Mars suddenly shouts --

                     MARS
           He's going for his gun!

Mars opens fire, shooting through the window as --

DENNIS

kicks the door closed and fires through the door, Jennifer
screaming, as --

EXT. THE HOUSE -- DAY -- MIKE WELCH

tumbles backward, struggling weakly to pull his gun as blood
bubbles in his mouth.  He tries to rise, but can't --

                     WELCH
               (into his radio)
           Officer down.  Jesus, I've been shot.

                     RADIO VOICE
           Mike?  Mike, what did you say?!

Mike Welch blinks at the sky, but cannot answer -- 

INT. BRISTO CAMINO POLICE DEPARTMENT -- DAY

It's the kind of small-town police facility you might expect:
A general room with desks and computers, a coffee machine,
and a desk officer who thinks that crime is two teenagers
egging a house.

The camera establishes the low-key atmosphere, during which
it finds a glass door labeled J. Talley, chief of police --

INT. TALLEY'S OFFICE -- DAY

Jeff Talley is behind the desk, his voice muted because he is
locked in a painful phone conversation --

                     TALLEY
               (into phone)
           It's really hard, Jane.  This isn't the
           way I want it.

INT. JANE'S KITCHEN -- DAY

Jane Talley is an attractive woman in her mid-thirties.  She
has the efficient manner of a registered nurse, which she is,
and right now she's using all of her professional detachment
to keep herself together --

                     JANE
               (into phone)
           No?  Then whose idea was it for you take
           a job in the middle of nowhere?

Intercut Talley, who considers the photographs that decorate
his wall:  Shots of Talley in happier times with Jane and
their teenaged daughter, Amanda; Talley as a young SWAT
officer; the framed headline from the Bristo Weekly Standard
proclaiming:  EX-SWAT COP NEW BRISTO CHIEF!

                     TALLEY
           I need to work out some stuff.

                     JANE
           You're hiding, Jeffrey.  You're hiding
           from the job and you're hiding from me.

                     TALLEY
           I still see that boy's eyes.

Jane softens; she knows that a part of him is in terrible
pain.  But she's in pain, too --

                     JANE
           That happened a year ago.  You've been
           gone for almost six months.  How long do
           you have to punish yourself for something
           that wasn't your fault?

Talley studies the picture of his wife and daughter.  He
focuses on Amanda --

                     TALLEY
           Is Amanda there?

Jane cups the phone and calls to her daughter.  Amanda enters
and goes to the refrigerator.  She's fifteen and carrying the
weight of a seriously bad attitude --

                     JANE
               (to Amanda)
           It's Dad.  He wants to speak with you.

                     AMANDA
               (doesn't even glance over)
           I'm gonna see him later.

                     JANE
               (back to Talley)
           She has to go to the bathroom.

Jane turns away and lowers her voice, not wanting Amanda to hear --

                     JANE (CONT'D)
           You're not only punishing yourself, Jeff.
           Amanda and I are in this, too.

Talley knows, and he hurts like hell because of it --

                     TALLEY
           Can we talk some more when you get here?

                     JANE
           We'll see you in a couple of hours.

Jane hangs up without waiting for a response, then closes her
eyes, trying hard to keep herself together.

                     AMANDA
           I don't wanna go up there.  I want to 
           stay here with my friends.

                     JANE
           Pack your things.  You're going.

Jane stalks away without a glance back, and Amanda angrily
flips off her mother --

WITH TALLEY

He is clearly shaken by the call, but his thoughts are
interrupted when his assistant, an older woman named Louise
Vance, bursts in --

                     LOUISE
           Mike's been shot!  Someone shot Junior
           Kim, too --

Talley comes around his desk --

                     TALLEY
           What are you talking about, shot?  What
           happened?

                     LOUISE
           Three white males shot Junior.  Mike
           followed them to York Estates --

                     TALLEY
           Where are they?

                     LOUISE
           York Estates.  Four-five-five Castle Way.
           Anders and Jorgenson are on the way.

Talley charges out --

EXT. YORK ESTATES -- CASTLE WAY -- DAY

Talley wheels into a wide, spacious cul-de-sac lined with
expensive estate homes, and pulls up behind another radio
car.  Anders and Jorgenson are crouched in the street --

Bullets snap into Talley's windshield, starring the glass --

                     TALLEY
           Sonofabitch.

Talley scrambles out of his car --

EXT. THE SMITHS' HOUSE -- TALLEY'S CAR -- DAY

Talley takes cover behind his front wheel.  Anders and
Jorgenson are young guys; they've never worked a high-crime
area; they've never made a felony arrest; and right now
they're scared shitless.

Mike Welch lies on the Smiths' front lawn, forty feet away --

                     ANDERS
           Welch is down!  They shot him!

                     JORGENSON
           We think it's the three guys who robbed
           Kim's.

                     TALLEY
           Are civilians inside?

                     JORGENSON
           He said something about a girl --

                     TALLEY
           Holster your guns!

Another shot cracks from the house as we hear the faint wail
of approaching sirens.  Talley edges around his car, trying
to see Welch --

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
               (calling)
           Mike!  Mike, can you hear me?

                     ANDERS
           I think he's dead!

                     TALLEY
           Don't shout, Larry.  I'm three feet away.

Talley considers the situation and comes up with a plan --

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
           We have to cordon off the streets, then
           evacuate these houses.

                     JORGENSON
           What are we going to do about Mike?

                     TALLEY
           Keep your head down.

Talley scrambles back into his car.  He backs up, then powers
the car up the drive and onto the front lawn --

WITH WELCH

Talley roars to a stop between Welch and the house, using the
car as a shield.  More shots ping off his car as Talley
climbs out --

                     TALLEY
           How you doing, buddy?  You still alive?

Welch moans.  His shirt is soaked with blood where the
bullets caught him beneath his vest.  Talley can't waste
time.  The siren is closer now --

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
           Jesus.  You hang on.

Talley hoists Welch into the backseat, then dives behind the
wheel.  He fishtails off the lawn and up the street --

EXT. THE CUL-DE-SAC INTERSECTION -- DAY

The ambulance waits as Talley powers to a stop --

                     TALLEY
           He's in the backseat!

Paramedics pull Mike Welch from the car as Talley gets out.
He can see into the cul-de-sac from here, where Anders and
Jorgenson still hunker behind their car.  Talley keys his 
radio --

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
           This is Talley.  Who's on?

His radio crackles with overlapping voices --

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
           One at a time!  Clear the air!
               (as they settle)
           Louise?  Talk to me.  What do we have?

                     LOUISE'S VOICE
           Junior Kim was DOA at the hospital.

Frantic voices once more overlap --

                     COP VOICES
           What about Mike?  Is Welch alive?  What
           happened?

                     TALLEY
               (forcefully)
           Quiet!  I want radio discipline.
               (as they quiet)
           Mike's hanging in.  Larry, Jorgy?  Listen
           up.

                     JORGENSON'S VOICE
           Go, Chief.

                     TALLEY
           Find out who lives at four-five-five.  We
           gotta know who's in there.

                     LOUISE'S VOICE
           Chief?  Mike said a young girl answered
           the door.

                     TALLEY
           Did he say if she was shooting at him?

                     LOUISE'S VOICE
               (hesitant)
           He didn't say.

                     TALLEY
           Then we don't know if she's part of this
           or not.  Mickey, you up?

                     MIKKELSON'S VOICE
           We're out two minutes, me and Dreyer.

                     TALLEY
           Mike found a red pickup abandoned on
           Flanders.  You see it?

                     MIKKELSON'S VOICE
           It's right in front of us.

                     TALLEY
           Run a DMV on the plate for the owner's
           name.

                     LOUISE'S VOICE
           I pulled Mickey and Dreyer off the
           minimart.

                     TALLEY
           Jesus Christ, Louise, we can't leave a
           crime scene like that.  Put a unit out
           there.

                     LOUISE'S VOICE
           We only have eight officers on duty,
           Chief.

More sirens are approaching, but their help seems too little,
too late.  Talley stares up the cul-de-sac at the Smiths'
house as if this was a terrible nightmare --

                     TALLEY
               (to himself)
           That's not enough.

                     LOUISE
           What's that, Chief?  Say again.

                     TALLEY
           Get everyone out here.  Then call the
           Sheriffs.  Tell them we have a possible
           hostage situation.

INT. WALTER SMITH'S OFFICE -- DAY

Gunsmoke fills the air.  Kevin is freaking.  He throws a
magazine at Mars --

                     KEVIN
           We could've gone out the back!  You
           didn't have to shoot!

                     DENNIS
           Stop it!  They found the truck, Kev!
           They're already behind us!

                     KEVIN
           We should give up.  All we're doing is
           making it worse.

                     JENNIFER 
           Get out of our house!

Her voice cuts through the din.

Jennifer and Thomas are huddled with their father on the
floor, Jennifer's arms crossed to cover herself --

                     WALTER
               (softly)
           Quiet, Jen.

                     JENNIFER 
           Why don't they go?!  Why don't they leave
           us alone and go?!

Dennis charges up to her, screaming and waving his gun --

                     DENNIS
           Shut up!  Shut the fuck up!

Walter Smith slowly stands --

                     WALTER
           None of you will get out of this.

Dennis spins toward Walter, leveling his gun --

                     DENNIS
           Stay down!  Stay down, goddamnit!

                     WALTER
           I'm going to my desk.

                     DENNIS
           You're not goin' anywhere!  Get on the
           fuckin' floor!

Dennis raises the gun to Walter's face.  Walter is in
complete command of himself and nowhere near scared, but
Jennifer grabs his legs --

                     JENNIFER
           Daddy, don't!

                     WALTER
               (casually; to Dennis)
           Take it easy, son.  I'm only going to my
           desk.

Walter eases past Dennis, who doesn't know what to do --

                     DENNIS
           Get on the floor!

                     WALTER
           I have contacts in Los Angeles.  Lawyers
           and judges who can help you.

Walter slips open the center drawer.  Dennis thinks that
Walter might go for a gun.  He screams louder and aims
between Walter's eyes --

                     DENNIS
           I'll fuckin' kill you!

                     JENNIFER AND THOMAS
           Daddy!  Please!

Walter checks that the computer disks are in the disk case.
We can see their names clearly:  MARLON and AL.  He drops the
case into the drawer, then lifts out a thick booklet --

                     WALTER
           This is every criminal lawyer in 
           California.  If you give up now, right 
           now, I'll buy you the best lawyer in the
           state.

Dennis slaps the book aside, even more angry --

                     DENNIS
           We just killed a cop!  We killed a fat
           chinaman!  We'll get the death penalty!

Dennis suddenly screams at Mars and Kevin --

                     DENNIS (CONT'D)
           Mars, watch the cops!  Kevin!  Watch the
           back of the house!

                     WALTER
           You won't die if you let me help.

                     DENNIS
           Bullshit!

                     WALTER
           But if you stay in this house, I can
           promise you this --

                     DENNIS
               (shouting over him)
           Shut up!  Shut up and get on the floor!

                     WALTER
           You can't imagine the fucking you're
           going to get.

Dennis snaps.  He swings the gun hard and smashes Walter on
the temple.  Walter drops like a rock.

                     JENNIFER
           Leave him alone!!

Jennifer rushes to her father's side, but Walter's out cold --

EXT. TALLEY'S CAR -- THE INTERSECTION -- A FEW MINUTES LATER

Talley is at his car with Anders and two other officers,
Leigh Metzger, a woman in her early thirties, and Cliff
Campbell, a slender guy who looks like a retired security
cop.  Talley is getting information reports both in person
and over the radio --

                     ANDERS
               (referring to notes)
           The house belongs to Walter and Pamela
           Smith.  They've got two kids, a girl
           about fifteen and a boy younger, Jennifer
           and Thomas.

                     TALLEY
           That would be the girl who opened the
           door.  Are the others inside?

                     ANDERS
           The mother is in Florida visiting her
           sister.  The father works at home, so
           he's probably inside.

Talley keys his mike --

                     TALLEY
               (into his mike)
           Louise?

                     LOUISE'S VOICE
           Go, Chief.

                     TALLEY
           Get a phone number for the Smiths.

                     MIKKELSON'S VOICE
               (from the radio)
           Chief, Mikkelson.

                     TALLEY
           Go, Mickey.

                     MIKKELSON'S VOICE
           The truck is registered to Dennis James
           Rooney, white male, twenty-two.  He has
           an Agua Dulce address.

                     TALLEY
           Contact the landlord.  I want to know
           employment, friends, family, anything we
           can find out about this guy.

A news helicopter swoops overhead in a tight turn.  The cops
look up --

                     CAMPBELL
           What in hell is that?

                     TALLEY
               (grimly)
           News hawks.  There'll be more.  They
           monitor our frequencies.

Talley realizes that his officers are staring at the
helicopter as if they've never seen one; these people have
never dealt with a crime this large, and have probably never
even seen a felon.  Talley keys the mike again --

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
           Everyone be cool.  That's our job right 
           now--stabilize the situation and don't 
           let things get out of hand.  All we have
           to do is hang on until the Sheriffs take
           over.  That's all we have to do.

No one looks particularly convinced --

                     METZGER
           How do we do that?

                     TALLEY
           That's my job, Metzger.  That's why I get
           the big bucks.

Talley puts away his mike --

INT. WALTER'S OFFICE -- DAY

Jennifer and Thomas are bent over their father, wanting to
help but not knowing how.  Walter's eyes flicker as if he's
dreaming, and the lump on his head is bleeding --

                     JENNIFER
           He's not waking up.  He should be awake.

Jennifer abruptly stands and faces Dennis --

                     JENNIFER (CONT'D)
           He needs a doctor.

                     DENNIS
           Shut up and sit down.  You think
           someone's gonna make a house call?

Jennifer is scared--really, really scared--but she doesn't
sit down.  Both Dennis and Mars are staring at her.  She
feels naked and vulnerable.  She crosses her arms again --

                     JENNIFER 
           At least let me get some ice for his
           head.

Dennis finally relents and shrugs at Mars --

                     DENNIS
           Make sure Kevin isn't fucking off back
           there.

Jennifer hurries out as Mars follows --

INT. THE KITCHEN -- DAY

Jennifer goes to the counter.  Kevin is at the French doors,
nervous and scared; Mars is a dark shadow behind her --

She kneels to a low cabinet when Mars kicks it shut --

                     MARS
           I thought you wanted ice.

Mars towers over her, his groin inches from her face --

                     JENNIFER
           I'm getting a wash cloth for the ice.

Mars gazes down at her, enjoying his size and power.  He
steps closer, bringing his groin closer to his face.
Jennifer stands, holding her arms across her breasts --

                     JENNIFER (CONT'D)
           Please get away from me.

                     KEVIN
               (from the background)
           Mars?  What are you doing?

Kevin's intrusion shatters the moment.  Jennifer quickly
snatches a wash cloth from the cabinet, then takes an ice
tray from the freezer and brings it back to the counter --

As Jennifer puts ice in the wash cloth, she sees the paring
knife that she used for the sandwiches partially hidden by
paper towels --

She glances at Kevin, but cannot see Mars; he's at the
refrigerator behind her.  Jennifer slowly reaches for the
knife --

                     MARS 
           Hey.

Jennifer freezes, terrified.  She pushes the knife behind the
Cuisinart to hide it, then turns.  Mars is offering her a
beer.

                     MARS (CONT'D)
           Want one?

                     JENNIFER
           I don't drink beer.

                     MARS
           Mommy won't know.  You can do anything
           you want right now.  Mommy won't know.

                     JENNIFER
           What I want is to help my father.

Jennifer hurries past him and disappears down the hall.  Even
as she leaves the phone starts ringing --

INT. WALTER'S OFFICE -- DAY

The phone seems to ring louder here.  Dennis stands over it,
watching the phone as if it's alive.  The phone rings again 
and again.  Finally, he answers --

                     DENNIS
           Hello?

EXT. TALLEY'S CAR -- IN THE CUL-DE-SAC -- DAY

Talley is once more behind his car.  He's on his cell phone,
with Jorgenson nearby --

                     TALLEY
               (into his phone)
           My name is Jeff Talley.  Is this Dennis
           Rooney?

Intercut Dennis on the phone in Walter's office --

                     DENNIS
           You with the cops?

                     TALLEY
           The Bristo Police Department.  Look out
           the window.  You see the car?

Dennis peers through the shutters --

                     DENNIS
           Yeah.  I'm Rooney.

                     TALLEY
           We had an awful lot of shooting.  You
           need a doctor in there?

Dennis shoots a guilty glance at Walter, then lies --

                     DENNIS
           We're cool.

                     TALLEY
           Let me speak to Mr. Smith.  I want to
           hear it from him.

                     DENNIS
           Fuck you.  I'm running this shit.  You
           talk to me.

                     TALLEY
           How about your two friends?  You don't
           have a man dying in there, do you?

                     DENNIS
           They're fine.

Talley cups the phone to tell Jorgenson --

                     TALLEY
           All three subjects are confirmed inside.
           Call off the house-to-house.
               (back to the phone)
           Okay, Dennis, I want to explain your
           situation --

                     DENNIS
               (interrupting)
           You don't have to explain shit!  That
           Chinaman pulled a gun.  We wrestled for
           it.  That Chinaman shot himself.

                     TALLEY
           Mr. Kim didn't make it, Dennis.  He died.

                     DENNIS
           How about the cop?

                     TALLEY
           Dennis?  I want you to release those
           people.

                     DENNIS
           Fuck that.  They're the only thing
           stopping you from blowing us away.

                     TALLEY
           We're not coming in there by force, okay?
           No one wants to hurt you.

                     DENNIS
           I got these people!  You try to come get
           me, I'll kill every fuckin' one of them!

The phone clicks in Talley's ear as Dennis slams down the
phone --

INT. WALTER'S OFFICE -- AT THAT MOMENT

Dennis is livid with fear and rage.  He paces through the
office like a trapped cat --

                     DENNIS
           That fuckin' Chinaman is dead!  That's
           murder-one, dude.  That's the needle!

Kevin appears in the entry, drawn by Dennis's raving --

                     DENNIS (CONT'D)
           Get back where you belong, asshole!
           Mars, keep and eye on the cops; I gotta
           find a way out of here --

Dennis shoves Kevin out of the office and stalks after him --

INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALL -- DAY

Kevin dogs along beside Dennis, speaking softly so that Mars
doesn't overhear --

                     KEVIN
           I have to tell you something --

                     DENNIS
           We gotta find a way outta here is what we
           gotta do!

                     KEVIN
           It's about Mars --

They reach the master bedroom suite, a huge room with sliding
glass doors that overlook the pool --

                     KEVIN (CONT'D)
           That cop didn't pull his gun.  Mars lied.
           He just started shooting!

                     DENNIS
           Bullshit.  Why would Mars do that?

                     KEVIN
           I was there, Dennis!  I saw!  It's like
           he wanted to shoot that cop.

                     DENNIS
           You're being stupid.  Check out the
           bathroom.  Maybe we can sneak out a
           window --

Dennis shoves Kevin toward the bathroom, then steps into --

INT. THE SECURITY CLOSET -- DAY

One side is filled with racks of clothes, but the opposite 
side is an industrial bank of video monitors showing a dozen
views of the house, both inside and out --

Dennis sees this stuff and stops in his tracks, awed --

                     DENNIS
           Kev.

Kevin steps in beside him.

                     KEVIN
           Jesus.  What is this?

                     DENNIS
           Are you totally stupid?  What does it
           look like?

One monitor shows Mars and the Smiths in the office, another
the kitchen, another Jennifer's room, another the front of
the house, the rear, the sides--every room and most of the
exterior can be seen --

                     DENNIS (CONT'D)
           Look, that's the master bedroom out here.

Dennis goes out into the master, looking for the camera, and
appears on the bedroom monitor --

                     KEVIN
           I can see you!

Dennis steps back into the closet, and this time he examines
the door.  He closes it enough to reveal thick throw-bolts --

                     DENNIS
           Dude, this is solid steel.  They gotta be
           hiding something.

Dennis glances over to his brother, and finds Kevin on his
knees with two black travel bags beneath the clothes --

                     KEVIN
           Dennis --

Kevin pushes the clothes aside to reveal an open bag.  It's
filled with hundred dollar bills.  Dennis kneels beside his
brother and opens the second bag.  It's filled with hundred
dollar bills, too --

                     DENNIS
           Go get Mars.

INT. MRS. PENA'S FAMILY ROOM -- DAY -- ON A TELEVISION

We're watching a grainy black and white security tape of
Junior Kim's robbery/homicide.  It shows Kim behind the
counter as Dennis and Mars enter --

                     MIKKELSON
           One in front is Dennis James Rooney.

Talley, Mikkelson, Dreyer, and Anders are watching the tape,
which is currently being played in the home of Mrs. Estelle
Pena, who lives two blocks from the Smiths.

Mikkelson is a tall, strong woman; Dreyer is her opposite, a 
short, dumpy man --

                     MIKKELSON (CONT'D)
           Dennis has a younger brother, Kevin Paul--
           that's him entering now, the third guy.

                     TALLEY
           Has Dennis done time?

                     MIKKELSON
           Just pulled thirty days for misdemeanor
           burglary.  He shows car theft,
           shoplifting, and DUI.

Talley steps closer to the television, and taps Mars --

                     TALLEY
           Who's this?

                     DREYER
           We don't know.

                     TALLEY
           Have still prints made from the tape.
           Show the landlord.  Maybe we can get a
           fast ID.

Talley looks closer.  With the way Mars is positioned, we can
see part of the tattoo on his head --

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
           Here on his head.  Is that a tattoo?

                     MIKKELSON
           I can't make it out.

                     TALLEY
           Says...burn it.

On the tape, Kim slumps to the floor.  Dennis vaults across
the counter and runs to the door.  Mars, however, calmly
picks up Kim's gun and leans across the counter.  We couldn't
see this before, but now we see a strange smile play over his
face --

                     DREYER
           What's he doing? 

                     TALLEY
           He's watching Kim die.

Talley watches Mars, and knows that this guy is seriously
disturbed.  He is still watching the tape when Leigh Metzger
calls from the door --

                     METZGER
           Chief?

Talley turns.  Metzger is with Amanda and Jane --

EXT. MRS. PENA'S HOUSE -- DAY

Talley, Jane, and Amanda are walking to the street.  Amanda
is excited; she thinks this is cool --

                     AMANDA
           Are men with guns really barricaded in a
           house?

                     TALLEY
           Just around the corner and up that
           street.  See the helicopters?

Five news choppers now hover high over the house.  The crime
scene is only two blocks away.  Close.

                     JANE
           Wait by the car, Mandy.  Give me a minute
           with Dad.

They wait until Amanda is gone, then --

                     TALLEY
               (apologizing)
           I should've called.  This thing broke
           right after we spoke, then everything
           happened so fast --

                     JANE
           Don't worry about it.  How are you doing?

                     TALLEY
           The Sheriffs will take over when they get
           here.

                     JANE
           But they're not here yet.  Tell me about
           you.

Jane touches his arm --

                     JANE (CONT'D)
           Jesus, you're shaking.

Self-conscious, Talley moves away so that he's out of reach --

                     TALLEY
           Why don't you guys grab some dinner at
           the Thai place?  I'll meet you there as
           soon as I can.

                     JANE
           You sure?

                     TALLEY
           I don't know how long I'll be stuck here.

                     JANE
           I'm in no rush.  Maybe later we can talk.

Talley gives her a gentle nod, then watches her walk away
until --

                     TALLEY
           Jane?

She turns back, her eyes asking 'what?'

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
           I'm scared shitless.

                     JANE
           That's okay.  I love you anyway.

Talley and Jane share the moment, and then she walks away.

EXT. YORK ESTATES -- DAY

A news chopper swings by overhead bringing us to the main
entrance of York Estates.  The entrance has been blocked, and
cars are being turned away, so traffic is backed up both ways
along the street --

INT. GLEN HOWELL'S CAR -- DAY

Glen Howell is a nice-looking man in his early forties:
Sport coat, gold Rolex, deep tan.  He hammers the horn of his
Mercedes S600 sedan, but it does no good; traffic is frozen --

A news van trying to work up the line pulls alongside, then
gets jammed by the crunch like everyone else.  Howell rolls
down the window --

                     HOWELL
           Hey, you guys know what's going on?

An attractive Asian-American reporter leans from her window
to answer --

                     REPORTER
           Three men took a family hostage.

                     HOWELL
           Jesus, no shit?  My client lives in
           there.

The reporter checks her notes --

                     REPORTER
           It's a family named Smith, Walter and
           Pamela Smith.  Do you know them?

Howell stares at her emptily, then shakes his head --

                     HOWELL
           No.  No, I don't know them.  Thanks for
           your time.

Howell pulls a U-turn to get out of traffic.  He flips open
his cell phone and presses the speed dial --

                     HOWELL (CONT'D)
               (into his phone)
           We have a problem out here.

INT. SONNY BENZA'S OFFICE -- PALM SPRINGS -- DAY

We're in a palatial home on the ridge overlooking Palm
Springs.  On the cut, Sonny Benza, Phil Tuzee, and Charlie
Fischer are watching TV news coverage of the situation in
Bristo Camino --

                     TUZEE
           Worst case, it's a bloodbath.  The
           detectives come out with Smith's
           computer, and we go directly to jail, do
           not pass Go.

                     BENZA
           Maybe Glen already picked up the disks.

                     TUZEE
           I took the call from Glen personally.
           They're still in Smith's house.

Fischer tries being positive --

                     FISCHER
           Maybe we're getting too dramatic.  It's
           three kids.  They'll give up, the cops
           will arrest them, and that's that.  Why
           would they search the house?

                     BENZA
           You think we should take that chance?

                     FISCHER
               (on the spot)
           I guess not.

                     BENZA
           I guess not, too.  How much information
           is in the house?

                     TUZEE
           Smith was cooking the books for the IRS.
           That means he has it all:  The cash flow,
           where it comes from, how we launder it,
           our split with the East.

                     FISCHER
           It's on two computer disks he calls
           Marlon and Al.

                     BENZA
           What, he's cute?  That's his idea of
           humor?

                     FISCHER
           If the Feds get those disks, the East
           Coast is gonna take a hit, too.  You
           should let them know.

                     BENZA
           No way.  I tell them, that Old Man is
           gonna handle this from back there.

                     TUZEE
           You should warn them, Sonny.
 
                     BENZA
           Fuck them!  Now get your head in the
           game, Phil--we have to handle this.

Benza turns back to the television --

                     BENZA (CONT'D)
           Put our people on the scene.  Smith might
           talk just to cut a break for his kids.

                     TUZEE
           He knows better than that.

                     BENZA 
           Bullshit--a man will do anything to save
           his family.  Who's running the show up
           there?

                     FISCHER
           They have a chief of police, a guy named
           Talley.  I saw him being interviewed.

The television suddenly shows Talley making a statement.  He
looks tired and haggard --

                     FISCHER
               (pointing)
           Hey, that's him.  That's Talley right
           there!

Benza studies Talley, then looks at his lieutenants --

                     BENZA
           Find out how we can hurt him.  By the end
           of the day, I want to own him.

                     TUZEE
           It's happening right now.

That's exactly what Benza wanted to hear.

EXT. THE DESERT ROSE MOTEL -- DAY

A low-rent motel on the road between Bristo Camino and
Newhall.  Glen Howell's Mercedes is parked on the side, along
with several other cars.

It's late-afternoon going into evening.  The sun is sinking 
fast --

INT. HOWELL'S ROOM -- DAY

Howell is being briefed by his operators, four men and two
women.  There's a minimum of bullshit; these people are
professionals --

Ken Seymore is an intense, compact man who talks fast --

                     SEYMORE
           L.A. County Sheriffs are inbound from a
           bank robbery in Pico Rivera.

                     HOWELL
           Give me an ETA.

                     SEYMORE
           An hour, tops.  Might be sooner.

Duane Manelli speaks up --

                     MANELLI
           When the Sheriffs get here, how many we
           looking at?

                     SEYMORE
               (checking his notes)
           A command team, a negotiating team, a
           tactical team--the tac team includes a
           perimeter team, the assault team, 
           snipers, and breachers--thirty-five new
           bodies.

                     HOWELL
           How many locals?

Gayle Devarona, one of the women, leans forward --

                     DEVARONA
           Fourteen officers and two civilians.  I
           have their names and most of their
           addresses.

She tosses a yellow legal pad onto the table --

                     HOWELL
           And Talley?

                     DEVARONA
           Married but separated, ex-LAPD.  The fam
           doesn't live here, but they're coming up
           today.  I got his address there.

                     MANELLI
           The cops I talked to, they said Talley
           was a hostage negotiator in LA.

                     DEVARONA
           His last three years on the job.  Before
           that, he was SWAT.

Mike Ruiz joins in --

                     RUIZ
           How's a SWAT negotiator make it up here
           to this shithole?

                     DEVARONA
           I make him for a stress release.

                     HOWELL
           Good work, Gayle--everybody.  Now stay
           ahead of the curve.  I want to know
           everything that happens before it
           happens.  I'll cover Talley.

Howell tears Talley's address off the yellow pad.  This
meeting is over --

                     SEYMORE
           What if it goes south?

                     HOWELL
           What do you mean?

                     SEYMORE
           If things get wet, we're going to need
           someone who can handle that end.

                     HOWELL
           You worry about your end.  I got my side
           covered.

Howell tucks the address in his pocket and goes to the door.

EXT. DONUT SHOP -- NEWHALL, CALIFORNIA -- NIGHT

The sun has set.  The donut shop glows greasily at the end of
a strip mall.  It is empty except for the overweight woman
behind the counter and a lone man seated at a window booth --

INT. THE DONUT SHOP -- NIGHT

The man in the booth is named Marion Clewes.  He's an average
looking guy, more or less, except for the strange cant to his
right eye and the thin black tie he wears over his white J.
C. Penney shirt.  His jacket doesn't fit quite right, but not
so much as you'd notice.  Marion could disappear into a crowd
just by being so ordinary.  That's the point.

A fat black desert fly, heavy with juice and thorny with
coarse hair, buzzes past --

Marion watches it, only his eyes moving --

The fly lands in the sprinkles of sugar on the table --

Marion watches it, then, suddenly, with no warning, his hand
flashes out, slamming down on the table.

He holds his hand in place, feeling for movement, then slowly
peeks under his hand --

The fly oozes sideways, legs kicking, trying to walk.  One
wing beats furiously; the other is broken --

Marion examines his hand.  A smear of fly goo and a single
black leg streaks his third finger.  Marion touches his
tongue to the smear --

The woman behind the counter watches this, her eyes widening
with disgust --

Marion holds the fly in place with his left index finger, and
uses his right to break away another leg.  He eats this leg,
too --

The woman disappears into the rear --

Headlights flash across the glass, and Marion swivels around
to see Howell's Mercedes pull up --

Marion carefully pushes the still-alive fly aside as Glen
Howell takes a seat across from him.  Howell puts the yellow
slip with Talley's address on the table --

                     HOWELL
           Talley lives here.  I don't know if the
           place has security or not.

                     MARION
           It won't be a problem.

                     HOWELL
           He has a wife and kid.  That's how
           we'll get to him.

                     MARION
           Okey-doke.

                     HOWELL
           We have to own this guy, Marion.  We
           don't want him dead; we need to use him.

Marion puts Talley's address into his pocket.

                     MARION
           Can we make him dead after we use him?

Glen Howell slides out of the booth without answering.
Marion creeps him out --

                     HOWELL
           Whatever you want.  Page me when you're
           done.

Howell starts away, then turns back --

                     HOWELL (CONT'D)
           Donuts here any good?

                     MARION
           I don't eat junk food.

Howell frowns like he might've known, then walks away.
Marion turns back to the fly --

It lays there, still, until Marion prods it.  The remaining
wing flutters --

Marion breaks off the remaining wing and eats that, too.

EXT. COMMAND STREET -- NIGHT

Talley and Leigh Metzger stride through a pool of street light
as she reports --

                     METZGER
           PacBell shows six lines into the house.
           They blocked all six like you wanted.

                     TALLEY
           I have the only number that can call into
           the house?

                     METZGER
           Yes, sir.  They'll only accept calls from
           your cell.

                     TALLEY
           Way to go.

They arrive at Larry Anders, who is waiting at his car with a
slim, nervous cement contractor named Brad Dill --

                     ANDERS
           Chief, this is Brad Dill.  Dennis and
           Kevin work for him.

                     DILL
           I didn't know anything about this.  I
           didn't know what they were gonna do.

                     TALLEY
           Mr. Dill, these pricks didn't know what
           they were going to do until they did it.
           I want you to take a look at something.

Metzger holds out a still picture that was made from Junior
Kim's security tape --

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
           Can you identify this man?

                     DILL
           That would be Mars Krupchek.  Jesus, he
           works for me, too.

                     TALLEY
               (to Metzger)
           Have Louise run the name 'Mars Krupchek'
           through DMV and NCIC.  Tell her to list
           the tattoo as an identifier.

Metzger hurries away as Talley turns back to Dill --

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
           Is Krupchek an aggressive guy?  Hot-
           tempered?  Anything like that?

                     DILL
           Keeps to himself, more like.

                     TALLEY
           You have his address?

                     DILL
           Pretty sure I do.  Yeah, here we go --

Dill pulls out a tattered address book.  Talley hands the
book to Anders, who copies the address --

                     TALLEY
               (to Anders)
           Call the Palmdale City Attorney for a
           telephonic search warrant.  When you get
           the warrant, have Mikkelson and Dreyer
           search his house.

                     ANDERS
           Yes, sir.

Anders turns away as Metzger calls from Mrs. Pena's door --

                     METZGER
           Chief!  The Sheriffs are ten minutes out!

Talley has wanted to hear that, but now his sense of relief
is tempered by something he did not expect:  Loss.

Talley keys his shoulder mike --

                     TALLEY
               (into his radio)
           Louise?

                     LOUISE'S VOICE
           Go, Chief.

                     TALLEY
           Call Jane for me.  She's at the little
           Thai place.

                     LOUISE'S VOICE
           I know the one.

                     TALLEY
           Tell her I'm almost home.

INT. SMITH'S SECURITY CLOSET -- NIGHT

Dennis is on the floor with the money, touching it, feeling
it, smelling it.  Mars is standing over him, profoundly
unmoved --

                     DENNIS
           There's gotta be a million bucks here.
           Maybe two million!

Mars turns away from the money to consider the monitors and
the door --

                     MARS
           It's a safety room.  If anyone breaks
           into your house, you can hide.

                     DENNIS
           Who gives a shit, Mars?  Check out the
           cash!  We're rich.

                     MARS
           We're trapped in a house.

Mars walks away --

INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALL -- NIGHT

Dennis and Mars are returning to the front of the house,
Dennis irritated at Mars's lack of enthusiasm --  

                     DENNIS
           We can take it with us.

                     MARS
           You can't run with suitcases.

Dennis grabs Mars by the arm, stopping him --

                     DENNIS
           Then we'll stuff it up our asses.  This
           is the payoff.  This is every dream you
           ever had, all in those two bags.

Mars continues on without responding, Dennis angrily
following --

INT. WALTER'S OFFICE -- NIGHT

Kevin is grimly watching news coverage of their standoff as
Mars and Dennis enter.  A female anchor is reporting on the
events at York Estates with Dennis's booking photo cut into
the picture --

                     ANCHOR
               (from the tube)
           -- thought to be Dennis James Rooney.
           Rooney was recently released from the
           Antelope Valley Correctional Institute
           where he served time for robbery.

Dennis spots himself on television and breaks into a big
smile --

                     DENNIS
               (thrilled)
           Check me out!  I look like fuckin' Jon
           Bon Jovi.

Kevin is anything but thrilled --

                     KEVIN
           Everyone knows what we look like, Dennis. 
           We won't be able to hide. 

                     DENNIS
           Jesus, first Mars, now you.  You two need
           anti-depressants.

Across the room, Walter Smith shudders and moans; his face is
swollen and covered with clammy sweat --

Jennifer is sick with worry and can't stand seeing her father
like this --

                     JENNIFER
           My father needs a doctor.  Please.

                     DENNIS
           Hey, I've got a situation here, in case
           you haven't noticed.

                     JENNIFER
           All you're doing is watching yourself on
           TV.  Look at him.

                     DENNIS
           Use more ice.

                     JENNIFER
           I'm getting a doctor!

Jennifer lurches to her feet and runs toward the front door.
Dennis catches her in two steps and backhands her exactly the
way his old man used to smack his old lady, knocking her to
the floor --

                     THOMAS
           Jen!!!

Thomas charges into Dennis like an angry midget.  Kevin jumps
between them --

                     KEVIN
           Stop it!  Stop it, Dennis!  Jesus!

Mars steps forward and jerks Thomas into the air.  Mars'
physical presence is suddenly so imposing that everyone stops
fighting --

                     MARS
               (quietly)
           We should tie them.  We can put them
           upstairs out of the way.

It takes Dennis a moment to come up to speed with that, but
then he nods --

                     DENNIS
           That's right.  That's a good idea, Mars.

                     MARS
               (to Kevin)
           Find something:  Extension cords, rope,
           wire--we'll have to tie them tight.

                     DENNIS
           Find something, Kevin.  Don't just stand
           there.
               (waves at Walter)
           And tie this bastard, too.  I don't want
           him waking up and goin' Rambo on us.

Mars nods his approval.  Subtly, there is the beginning of a
shift in power --

INT. JENNIFER'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Mars pushes Jennifer inside.  Kevin follows her with duct 
tape and a couple of extension cords.  Mars, holding Thomas,
pauses in the hall --

                     MARS
           Tie her to the chair.  I'll take care of
           the windows when I finish with the boy.

Mars disappears with Thomas down the hall.  Jennifer stands
by the chair, arms once more crossed over her breasts. 
Kevin can see that she's scared.  He takes a T-shirt from 
where she's left it on the floor and hands it to her --

                     KEVIN
           Here.  Put this on.

She pulls it over her head --

                     KEVIN (CONT'D)
           You gotta pee?

                     JENNIFER
           I don't see why you can't just lock me
           in.  It's not like I can go anywhere.

                     KEVIN
           Either I'm going to tie you or Mars will
           tie you.  Which do you want?

Jennifer sits.  Kevin pulls her hands behind the back of the
chair.  As he ties her, Jennifer decides that if any of them
can be reached, it's Kevin --

                     JENNIFER
           Thanks for the shirt.

                     KEVIN
           Whatever.

                     JENNIFER
           Kevin, my father needs a doctor.
                     
                     KEVIN
           He's just knocked out.  I've been knocked
           out.

                     JENNIFER
           If my father dies they'll charge you with
           his murder.  Can't you make Dennis see
           that?

Kevin leans back.  He knows she's right, but he doesn't
believe he can do anything about it --

                     KEVIN
           I can't make Dennis see anything.

A shadow moves behind Kevin.  It's Mars, standing in the
door.  He holds up a wicked claw hammer --

                     MARS
           Look what I found.

He enters and tests at Jennifer's binds --

                     MARS (CONT'D)
           You tied her like a pussy.  Make it
           tight.

As Kevin reties the bindings, Mars rips the phone from the
wall.  He smashes the phone jack with the hammer, crushing
it.  Then he goes to the window and drives a heavy nail into
the sill, nailing the window closed --

Mars returns to Jennifer and once more checks her binds --

                     MARS (CONT'D)
           Better.

He tears off a strip of duct tape and presses it over her
mouth --

                     KEVIN
           Make sure she can breathe.

Mars rubs his fingers hard over the tape covering her mouth.
He massages the tape into her skin, slow, sensual --

                     MARS
           Go downstairs, Kevin.

Jennifer looks at Kevin, her eyes pleading that he not leave,
but Kevin is cowed; he leaves --

Jennifer looks back at Mars --

Mars leans close to her.  She is terrified that he is going
to kiss her, but, instead, he sniffs, smelling her --

                     MARS (CONT'D)
           I want to show you something.

Mars hooks the claw hammer under his shirt and lifts to
expose his chest.  A large tattoo in flowing script is lined
across his body:  A Mother's Son.

                     MARS (CONT'D)
           It cost two hundred forty dollars, but I
           was happy to spend it.  I love my mom.
           You see these?

Mars points out hard gray knots that speckle his chest as if
he were diseased.  He fingers the lumps sensuously as if
touching them excites him --

                     MARS (CONT'D)
           My mom burned me with cigarettes.

Jennifer is both disgusted and terrified.  Mars stares at her
emptily for another moment, then lowers his shirt and leaves 
without another word.

INT. THOMAS'S ROOM -- NIGHT

The room is dark.  Thomas is tied firmly to the bed.  The 
cords cut into Thomas's wrists and Thomas can't reach the
knots, but Mars made one mistake:  He tied Thomas to the
headboard posts, and one of the newels has been loose for
years --

Thomas stretches against the ropes to reach the newel, then
twists it back and forth.  He works it harder and harder
until the newel slides off its pin, and suddenly his hand is
free, though still tied to the newel --

Thomas peels the tape from his mouth, then unties the
remaining binds and frees himself from the newel.  He slips
off his bed and crawls along the wall to his closet --

INT. THOMAS'S CLOSET -- NIGHT

A service hatch that opens into the attic crawlspace is built
into the wall beneath Thomas's clothes.  Thomas prys open the
hatch, then reaches inside for a small flashlight.  He flicks 
it on, then climbs into the eaves of the roof --

INT. CRAWLSPACE -- NIGHT

The crawlspace is a long triangular tunnel that follows the
edge of the roof.  It was built for plumbers and air
conditioning technicians, but Thomas has taken the space for
his own:  Witness the stack of Penthouse, pictures of sports
heroes tacked to the rafters, and old soda cans strewn 
between the joists --

Thomas scurries quietly through the tunnel, heading for --

INT. JENNIFER'S CLOSET -- NIGHT

Thomas pushes through a hatch identical to the one in his own
closet, then creeps to the door --

                     THOMAS
               (whispers)
           Jen!

INT. JENNIFER'S ROOM -- NIGHT

Jennifer twists around to see him, mumbling through the tape --

                     THOMAS
           Sit still!  If they're in the security
           room, they can see you on the monitors.

Jennifer quiets.  Thomas slips out of the closet and creeps
toward her along the wall --

                     THOMAS (CONT'D)
           I figured out what these cameras can see
           last year when Mom and Dad went to Lake
           Arrowhead.  It can't see me over here,
           but it's looking at you, so don't move!

Thomas reaches up from behind Jennifer and jerks the tape off
her mouth --

                     JENNIFER
           Ow!  Shit!

                     THOMAS
           Be quiet!  Listen!

Thomas is hiding behind Jennifer so that the camera cannot
see him --

                     JENNIFER
           No one's coming.

                     THOMAS 
           That big asshole nailed my windows.

                     JENNIFER
           Mine, too.

                     THOMAS
           We can use the crawlspace to get
           downstairs.  Then we can run for it.

                     JENNIFER
           No!  I'm not going to leave Daddy with
           them!

Thomas thinks about that and decides that he can't leave
their father, either --

                     THOMAS
           We can't carry him.

                     JENNIFER
           You go, Thomas.  You get out, and I'll
           stay with Daddy.

                     THOMAS
           I'm not gonna leave you!

                     JENNIFER
           Go!  If you get out, maybe you can help
           the police!

Thomas suddenly realizes what he has to do --

                     THOMAS
           We'll all go, Jennifer.  All of us or 
           none of us.  I know where Daddy keeps a
           gun.

Jennifer jerks so hard that she almost tips over the chair --

                     JENNIFER
               (loud)
           You leave that gun alone!

                     THOMAS
           Shh, they'll hear you!

                     JENNIFER
               (louder)
           Better than you getting killed!  Don't
           touch that gun!  Daddy says --

Thomas slaps the tape back over her mouth.  Jennifer 
struggles helplessly as Thomas slips back into the closet,
and is gone --

EXT. YORK ESTATES -- STREET -- NIGHT

The Sheriff's Crisis Response Team rolls through the streets
like an invading army:  A brown sedan leads a huge van known
as the Mobile Command Post, which is followed by a Sheriff's 
SWAT support vehicle, two SWAT Suburbans, and four radio 
units.

Pools of light from the helicopters follow their progress --

EXT. COMMAND STREET -- NIGHT

Talley walks out to meet the lead vehicle as the convoy
stops.  Up and down the row, uniformed Sheriffs pile out of
their vehicles and off-load their gear --

Two people climb out of the lead car:  Will Maddox, a
bespectacled African-American Sheriff's SWAT negotiator, and
Captain Laura Martin, the CRT commander --

                     TALLEY
           I'm Talley.  Who's in charge?

                     MARTIN
           Laura Martin.  This is Will Maddox, the
           primary negotiator --

                     MADDOX
           Is the perimeter around the house secure?

                     TALLEY
           I've got fourteen officers on my
           department including me.  We're as secure
           as we can be.

                     MADDOX
               (to Martin)
           Permission to deploy the line?

                     MARTIN
           Do it.

                     TALLEY
               (to Maddox)
           Don't crowd the house.  The alpha's a kid
           named Rooney.  He's amped up and
           volatile.

Maddox turns away to bark orders into his shoulder mike --

                     MARTIN
           Sounds like you know the job.

                     TALLEY
           I've done it once or twice.  I blocked
           their phones to incoming calls, so you'll
           have to cut in a hard line to talk to 
           him.

                     MARTIN
               (over her shoulder)
           Maddox!  You got that?

                     MADDOX
           Doing it now!

                     MARTIN
               (back to Talley)
           I'd like you to brief my supervisors
           before we take over the scene.

                     TALLEY
           Whatever you want.

Talley and Martin hurry toward her troops --

INT. THE SMITHS' GARAGE -- NIGHT

The garage is dark, lit only by the light that comes from the
kitchen's open door, as Dennis, Mars and a reluctant Kevin
enter --

                     KEVIN
           Someone should stay with Mr. Smith.  What
           if he wakes up?

                     DENNIS
               (annoyed)
           That's why we tied him, dumbass.  Now
           come here and see this --

Dennis shows them a small casement window, and pushes open
the window to reveal a thick hedge --

                     DENNIS (CONT'D)
               (excited)
           These bushes follow the wall into the
           neighbor's yard.  All we need is some
           kind of diversion and we're home free.

                     KEVIN
           That's crazy, Dennis.  The cops will see
           us.

                     DENNIS
           Not if they're looking at something else.

                     KEVIN
           Like what?

                     MARS
           Let's burn the house.

Mars says it so simply that the moment is frozen.  Mars is
holding the big claw hammer, kneading it as if it was a
living thing.  His face is masked by shadows, but his eyes
both glow as if already reflecting flame --

INT. CRAWLSPACE ABOVE THE LAUNDRY ROOM -- NIGHT

We see Dennis, Kevin, and Mars through a slit overhead as
they emerge from the garage and move back into the house --

Thomas is watching them.  He has cracked open the service
hatch in the laundry room ceiling to make sure that his way
is clear --

INT. LAUNDRY ROOM -- NIGHT

The room is dark.  When Dennis and the others are gone, the
ceiling hatch lifts, and Thomas lets himself down.  He slides
onto the washing machine and then to the floor --

Thomas cups one hand over his flashlight and turns it on.  He
lets light leak through his fingers so that he can see.  The
beam cuts across a door to the garage, car keys on key hooks,
and Jennifer's purse hanging from one of the hooks --

INT. HOBBY ROOM -- NIGHT

This is a small room off the end of the laundry with a work
bench, a stool, and shelves above the bench for Walter's
hobby supplies --

Thomas shines the light over the shelves, spotting the hard
plastic pistol case on the highest shelf.  That's the target;
that's the goal --

Thomas uses the stool to climb onto the bench --

INT. MASTER BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Dennis is in the doorway to the security closet, handing out
one of the money bags to Kevin --

                     KEVIN
           We can't carry all this.  It's too heavy.

                     DENNIS
           I've been carrying you our whole fuckin'
           lives.

Kevin drops the bag and tries to reason with his brother --

                     KEVIN
           Everything we're doing is making it
           worse.  You can't let him burn this
           house.

Dennis abruptly grabs Kevin by the throat, his face hard with
fury --

                     DENNIS
           Nothing's worse than listening to you.
           I'm warning you, Kevin--stop holding me
           back.  Now you pick up that fuckin' money
           and get ready to go.

Dennis glares at Kevin another moment, then lets go and steps
back into the closet --

INT. THE CLOSET -- NIGHT

Dennis lifts the second bag of cash when the monitors catch
his eye:  The Sheriffs SWAT unit can be seen moving into
position.  Dennis totally freaks --

                     DENNIS
           They're coming!  Kev, Mars, they're
           coming!!!

Dennis drops the cash and bolts out of the closet --

INT. KITCHEN -- NIGHT

Mars is placing two buckets of gasoline in the hall as Dennis
and Kevin pound down the hall --

                     DENNIS
           The cops are comin'!

                     MARS
           I got the gasoline --

                     DENNIS
           We don't have time!

Dennis runs to the French doors.  He sees lights at the rear
of the property and SHOOTS through the glass --

                     DENNIS (CONT'D)
           Get the kids!  They're our only chance!

Dennis FIRES AGAIN and runs for the stairs --

INT. HOBBY ROOM -- NIGHT

Thomas is straining to reach the pistol which is a fraction
of an inch beyond his grasp when he hears Dennis shouting --

Thomas glances helplessly at the gun case--so near, yet so
far--then scrambles off the bench and --

INT. LAUNDRY ROOM -- NIGHT

Thomas is climbing onto the washing machine when he once more
sees Jennifer's purse hanging on a key hook --

Thomas jumps from the washer, grabs the purse, then scrambles
into the ceiling as GUNSHOTS ECHO through the house --

EXT. COMMAND STREET -- NIGHT

Martin, Maddox, and her supervisors are gathered around
Talley when the gunshots crack across the neighborhood --

                     TALLEY
               (startled)
           Who's that shooting?  Martin, what's
           going on?

Radio transmissions crackle over Martin's radio --

                     RADIO VOICES
           Shots fired!  We are taking fire on the
           back wall!

Talley immediately knows what's happening, and he knows why --

                     TALLEY
           They're too close!  I told you not to
           crowd him!  Pull back your people; do not
           breach that house!

Talley sprints toward the cul-de-sac --

INT. CRAWLSPACE -- NIGHT

Thomas races through the narrow black tunnel.  He slips off
the rafters and almost falls through the ceiling.  He's
losing precious time --

INT. THE STAIRWELL -- NIGHT

Dennis and Mars pound up the stairs, getting closer to his
room --

INT. THE CRAWLSPACE -- NIGHT

Thomas pushes his way into his closet --

INT. UPSTAIRS HALL -- NIGHT

Dennis and Mars reach the second floor --

INT. THOMAS' ROOM -- NIGHT

Thomas scrambles into bed just before Dennis jerks open the
door.  Dennis drags him off the bed and carries him out of
the room --

EXT. CUL-DE-SAC -- NIGHT

Talley, Martin, and Maddox run into position behind a
Sheriff's unit where a deputy has set up the dedicated crisis
phone --

Talley grabs up the phone --

                     TALLEY
               (to the deputy)
           This thing good?

Talley doesn't wait for the confused deputy to answer; he
presses the button in the handle that dials the phone --

                     MADDOX
           What in hell are you doing?  He's
           shooting at my men!

The phone rings in Talley's ear --

                     TALLEY
               (to Maddox)
           Then get your men off the wall!
               (to Martin)
           You breach that house, we're gonna have a
           bloodbath!  I know this guy, Captain --
           I can talk to him.

                     MARTIN
               (to Maddox)
           Order your men to stand down.

The phone is still ringing.  Talley pulls the mike from the
deputy's car and speaks over the public address --

                     TALLEY
               (over the p.a.)
           Look out the window, Dennis.  We are NOT
           entering the house.  We're pulling back.

INT. SMITH'S OFFICE -- NIGHT

Dennis is holding Thomas around the neck, using the boy as a
shield.  Kevin is cowering on the floor and Mars is holding
Jennifer.  Dennis snatches up the phone --

                     DENNIS
               (screaming into the phone)
           You fuck!  I got a fuckin' gun to this
           kid's head!  I'll kill'm, you fuck!

Intercut Talley outside --

                     TALLEY
           It's over now, Dennis!  Don't hurt
           anyone.

                     DENNIS
               (still screaming)
           We'll burn this fuckin' place down!  I
           got gasoline all over in here!

Talley takes a deep breath; he forces himself to speak
quietly, calmly --

                     TALLEY
           No one's coming in.  A couple of guys out
           here got carried away.

Dennis peers out the front.  Talley's careful manner is
calming him --

                     DENNIS
           Goddamned right they got carried away.
           It looks like an army out there.

Talley mutes the phone to speak to Martin --

                     TALLEY
               (to Martin)
           It's over.  He's cooling off.

Talley glances at Maddox.  Maddox nods, his expression saying
that Talley was right --

                     DENNIS
           Talley?

                     TALLEY
               (back into the phone)
           I'm here.

                     DENNIS
           I want a helicopter to take us to Mexico.

                     TALLEY
           That's not going to happen, Dennis.  They
           won't give you a helicopter.

                     DENNIS
           I'll give you these people.

                     TALLEY
           The Mexican police would arrest you as
           soon as it landed.  There's only one way
           out and you're doing it right now--just
           keep talking to us.
               (mutes phone; to Martin and
                Maddox)
           I think we could make the transition now.
           Maddox, you good to go?

Maddox nods at Martin; he's good to go --

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
               (to Dennis)
           Hey, Dennis?  Can I let you in on a
           personal secret?

                     DENNIS
               (hesitantly)
           What?

                     TALLEY
           I gotta piss real bad.

Dennis can't help himself; he laughs --

                     DENNIS
           You're a funny guy, Talley.

                     TALLEY
           I'm going to put on an officer named Will
           Maddox.  You talk to him for a while.

Talley hands the phone to Maddox, who moves past Talley for a
better view of the house.  Talley looks grimly at Martin --

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
           He says he has gasoline set to burn the
           place.

                     MARTIN
           Jesus.  He must've siphoned it from the
           cars.

                     TALLEY
           If you go in, you can't use tear gas or
           flashbangs.  The whole place would go up.

                     MARTIN
               (not without humor)
           Looks like you're bailing out at the
           right time.

                     TALLEY
               (returns her smile)
           That's why you get the big bucks,
           Captain.

Talley is moving away when his radio pops --

                     LOUISE'S VOICE
           Chief, base.

                     TALLEY
               (keying his shoulder mike) 
           Go.

                     LOUISE'S VOICE
           I couldn't find Jane.  She wasn't at the
           restaurant.

                     TALLEY
           You have her cell number?

                     LOUISE'S VOICE
           She didn't answer.

                     TALLEY
           They might be at the house.  Keep trying
           and let me know.  I'm going to be here a
           little while longer.

Talley closes his phone and continues away --

INT. WALTER'S OFFICE -- NIGHT

Dennis and Kevin are at the television, watching an aerial
view of the Sheriffs deploying around the house.  Jennifer
and Thomas are huddled by their father --

                     KEVIN
           We're surrounded.  They're all over the
           neighborhood.

Mars enters carrying candles and flashlights.  He lights a
candle and place it on a table --

                     DENNIS
           What the fuck is that?

                     MARS
           They'll cut the power.

Mars tosses a flashlight to Dennis --

                     JENNIFER
           What about my father?

                     DENNIS
           Aw, Jesus, not more of this.

                     JENNIFER
           Look at him!  I think he's dying!

                     DENNIS
               (to Kevin and Mars)
           Take'm back upstairs, but don't tie'm
           like before.  That little fuck untied
           himself anyway.

Dennis returns to the shutters as Mars and Kevin take the
kids --

INT. THOMAS' ROOM -- NIGHT

Mars shoves Thomas into the room, then lifts the claw hammer.
For an instant, we think he's going to hit the boy--but he
smashes off the door knob, instead.

Mars glares at Thomas, then pulls the door closed.  The knob
on Thomas's side is gone; there's no way for Thomas to open
the door.

But that's okay by Thomas.  He waits until he's sure that
Mars is gone, and then he hurries back to his closet --

INT. THOMAS' CLOSET -- NIGHT

Thomas pulls open the hatch, fishes out his flashlight, then
dumps the contents of Jennifer's purse on the floor.

He picks up her cell phone.

INT. MRS. PENA'S BATHROOM -- NIGHT

Talley closes his eyes with a blissful expression as a
familiar sound fills the bathroom; he's taking a piss.

His radio crackles --

                     LOUISE'S VOICE
           Chief, base.

Talley finishes his business, and keys his mike --

                     TALLEY
           Did you find Jane and Mandy?

                     LOUISE'S VOICE
           Could you call me back on your phone?
           Right away.

                     TALLEY
           What's wrong with the radio?

                     LOUISE'S VOICE
               (hesitantly)
           Other people can hear us.  Just call.
           Please.

                     TALLEY
           Stand by.

Now Talley is worried.  He pulls out his phone and punches
the speed dial.  It rings only once --

Intercut Louise, at her desk outside Talley's office --

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
           Is something wrong with Jane?

                     LOUISE
           We have a boy on the line.  He says he's
           Thomas Smith and he's calling from the
           house.

                     TALLEY
           It's a crank, Louise.  C'mon, don't waste
           my time with that!

                     LOUISE
           His cell number belongs to the Smiths.  I
           think it's real, Chief.  I think this boy
           is inside that house.

Talley worries it only for a moment --

                     TALLEY
           Put him on.

Talley pushes out of the bathroom into --

INT. MRS. PENA'S FAMILY ROOM -- NIGHT

He flags Leigh Metzger as he cups the phone --

                     TALLEY
               (to Metzger)
           Get Martin.  Right away.

As Metzger hurries away, we intercut Thomas, hiding in the
shadows on his bed, whispering so as not to be overheard --

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
               (into the phone)
           This is Chief Talley.  Tell me your name, 
           son.

                     THOMAS 
           Thomas Smith.  I'm in the house that's on
           TV.  Dennis hit my dad and now he won't
           wake up.  You gotta help him.

Talley can tell by the tremor in the boy's voice--this is for
real --

                     TALLEY
           Slow down, Thomas.  Take it easy and talk
           to me.  Was your father shot?

                     THOMAS
           Dennis hit him.  His head's all big and
           he won't wake up.  I'm really scared.

                     TALLEY
           How about you and your sister?

                     THOMAS
           We're okay.

                     TALLEY
           Where are you right now?

                     THOMAS
           In my room.

Talley hurries to a large sketch of the Smiths' floor plan
laid out on the dining room table --

                     TALLEY
           That's on the second floor.  Could you
           climb out your window if we were
           downstairs to catch you?

                     THOMAS
           They nailed the windows.  I can't get'm
           open.

Martin enters with Leigh Metzger.  Talley cups the phone to
give her the headline --

                     TALLEY
               (to Martin)
           I've got the boy on the phone.  He's
           using a cell phone.
               (back to Thomas)
           What was that, son?  I didn't hear you.

                     THOMAS
           If I try to climb out they'll see me on
           the security cameras.  They would see you
           outside, too --

Thomas hears someone outside his door --

                     THOMAS (CONT'D)
           They're coming!

Thomas hangs up, jamming his phone behind the bed --

                     TALLEY
           Thomas?  Thomas...?

Talley lowers the phone --

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
           He says that his father's hurt.

                     MARTIN
           If we have a man dying in there, we'll
           have to go in.

                     TALLEY
           They have security cameras.  Rooney would
           see you coming.

                     MARTIN
           Did the boy say that any of them are in
           immediate danger?

                     TALLEY
           No.  He said that his father's
           unconscious; he didn't say he was dying.

                     MARTIN
           Then I think we should wait.  Do you
           agree?

Talley finally nods --

                     TALLEY
           You want me to stick around, I could --

                     MARTIN
           You've been here all day, Chief.  Take a
           break.  See your family.  If I need you,
           I'll call.

Talley looks like the most tired guy in the world.  He nods
his good-night, then turns away --

INT. TALLEY'S CAR -- NIGHT

Talley slides into his car outside Mrs. Pena's home.  He's
got a lot on his mind, and not all of it centers around 455
Castle Way.  He punches a number into his cell phone --

He listens to ringing, and then his own voice answers --

                     TALLEY'S VOICE MESSAGE
           This is Jeff Talley.  Leave your name and
           number after the beep.

We hear the beep, then --

                     TALLEY
               (into his phone)
           Jane?  If you're there, pick up, okay?
           Mandy?

No one answers.  Talley closes his phone, his apprehension
increasing --

EXT. YORK ESTATES FRONT GATE -- NIGHT

The Bristo officers manning the gate swing the blockade aside
and wave Talley through --

EXT. MEDIA AREA -- NIGHT

The assembled television microwave vans, radio newsvans, and
reporters are parked together in an empty lot one block from
the front gate.

Ken Seymore steps into the street, speaking into a cell phone
as he watches Talley drive away --

                     SEYMORE
               (into his phone)
           He's leaving now.

EXT. RED LIGHT INTERSECTION -- DAY

A traffic light on the outskirts of town, deserted until
Talley's car pulls to a stop --

INT. TALLEY'S CAR -- NIGHT

Suddenly, two masked men point guns at his head, one from the
driver's side, one from the passengers.  They're wearing
jackets, black ski masks, and gloves.  The man on the
passenger side sports a big gold Rolex, so we'll call him the
Watchman --

                     THE WATCHMAN
               (meaning the gun)
           Do you see the fuckin' gun?!  Look at it!

Talley freezes.  He's been blindsided by this insane shit,
but he knows better than to move --

                     TALLEY
           Take it easy.

The man on the driver's side gets into the backseat, then the
Watchman gets into the passenger side.  The man behind Talley
hooks an arm around Talley's throat while the Watchman 
searches for Talley's gun --

                     THE WATCHMAN
           Where's your gun?

                     TALLEY
           I'm the Chief.  I don't carry it.

The Watchman nods at the backseater, who releases Talley.

A dark green Mustang roars up ahead of Talley's car.  A 
second car tucks in tight on Talley's rear --

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
           Who are you?

                     THE WATCHMAN
           Follow the Mustang.  We won't go far.

The Mustang pulls out, and Talley follows.

EXT. A DESERTED ALLEY -- NIGHT

The three cars turn into the alley.  They stop, the first and
last cars bumper-to-bumper with Talley's.  The cars are so 
close to Talley that his own vehicle is pinned; he couldn't 
drive away now even if he wanted --

INT. TALLEY'S CAR -- NIGHT

The Watchman puts Talley's car in park, turns off the
ignition, and takes the key.

                     THE WATCHMAN
           I know you're scared, but unless you do
           something stupid we're not going to hurt
           you.  You understand?

Two more masked men approach from the other cars, one coming
to Talley's window, the other getting into the back seat
behind the Watchman.

                     THE WATCHMAN (CONT'D)
           Don't just fuckin' sit there, dumbass. 
           Do you understand?

                     TALLEY
           What do you want?

                     THE WATCHMAN
           These guys are going to take hold of you.
           Don't freak out.  It's for your own good.

The three men take hold of Talley, the man behind again
looping his arm around Talley's neck, the other two each
twisting Talley's arms --

                     TALLEY
           What is this?

The Watchman holds a distinctive white cell phone to Talley's
ear --

                     THE WATCHMAN
           Say hello.

                     JANE'S VOICE
           Jeff?  Is that you?

Talley goes berserk.  He bucks and tries to pull away, but
the three men hold tight --

The Watchman closes the phone --

                     THE WATCHMAN
               (trying to calm Talley)
           I know, I know--she's all right.  Your
           kid's all right, too.  C'mon, now, relax.
           From this point on, you control what 
           happens to them.

Talley can barely breathe, they're holding him so tight --

                     THE WATCHMAN (CONT'D)
           Can we let go?  You past your shock and
           all that, we can turn you loose and you
           won't do something stupid?

                     TALLEY
           You can let go.

The Watchman glances at the men; they let go --

                     THE WATCHMAN
           Here's the deal--Walter Smith has two
           computer disks like this in his house.
           They're labeled 'Marlon' and 'Al.'

The Watchman holds up a thick black Zip disk.  Talley's
expression tells us that this is the weirdest shit he's ever
heard --

                     TALLEY
           Marlon and Al....

                     THE WATCHMAN
           We want them.  You will not let anyone go
           into that house--or anything come out--
           until my people recover these disks.

                     TALLEY
           I can't control what happens.  The
           Sheriffs are running the scene.

                     THE WATCHMAN
           You will re-assume command.  In two
           hours, a group of my people will arrive
           at York Estates.  You will tell the
           Sheriffs that they are an FBI tactical
           team.

The Watchman puts the white cell phone into Talley's hand --

                     THE WATCHMAN (CONT'D)
           When this phone rings, you answer.  It
           will be me.  I'll tell you what to do.
           When I have what I want, you get your
           family.

                     TALLEY
           You want . . . Marlon and Al.

                     THE WATCHMAN
           I have people in York Estates right under
           your nose.  If you do anything except
           what I'm telling you, you'll get Jane and
           Amanda back in the mail.  We clear on 
           that?

                     TALLEY
           These disks . . . where are they?

                     THE WATCHMAN
           Smith will know.

The Watchman and the others get out of Talley's car.  The
doors slam shut.  The Watchman leans in --

                     THE WATCHMAN
           When it rings, answer.

The Watchman tosses the keys into Talley's lap.  We hear car
doors open and close; the cars, front and back, roar to life
and speed away --

Talley focuses on the Mustang's license plate, frantically
scratching down the number --

INT. BRISTO CAMINO POLICE DEPARTMENT -- NIGHT

The place is deserted except for Louise, currently at her
desk to monitor radio communications.

Talley enters, looking as if he's stricken.  Louise can't
help herself but to react --

                     LOUISE
           You look terrible.  Chief, are you all
           right?

Talley barely glances at her, going directly to his office --

INT. TALLEY'S OFFICE -- NIGHT

Talley steps inside and peels off his uniform shirt.  He
takes a bullet-resistant vest and a black sweatshirt from his
closet.  He straps on the vest, then pulls on the sweatshirt.

Talley sits at his desk and lifts out a ballistic nylon
pistol case from the lower drawer.

He takes out his old SWAT combat piece:  This isn't a pussy
9mm; it's a finely tuned .45-caliber Colt Model 1911.  One
shot, one kill.  Talley ejects the empty magazine, then loads
it with a deadly efficiency.  He slams home the magazine --

Talley clips the gun to his belt under his sweatshirt.  He's
ready to rock.  The camera finds the photograph of Talley
during his days as a SWAT tactical officer --

He was one bad motherfucker.

INT. THE MAIN ROOM -- NIGHT

Talley heads for the front door --

                     TALLEY
           I'm going back to York.  Have Larry meet
           me at the front gate.

Talley exits without a backward glance --

EXT. YORK ESTATES FRONT GATE -- NIGHT

The helicopters orbit in the distance; the empty lot with the
news vans is in the background.

Talley turns into the development, then stops at the side of
the street where Larry Anders is waiting --

INT. TALLEY'S CAR -- NIGHT

Anders slides into the passenger seat.  He sees a different
Talley now, focused and grim --

                     ANDERS
           What's up, Chief?

Talley stares at Anders, trying to decide:  Can I trust him?
Will he rat me out to the Watchman and cost the lives of my
wife and child?

                     ANDERS (CONT'D)
           Did I do something wrong?

Talley gives him a slip of paper --

                     TALLEY
           I want you to run this license plate and
           phone number.  Then I want you to find
           out everything you can about Walter
           Smith.
                     ANDERS 
           The guy in the house?

                     TALLEY
           Go back to the office.  Run his name
           through the FBI and the NLETS database.
           I think he's involved with illegal activity
           or he associates with people who are.

Anders glances at the slip again, then tucks it away --

                     ANDERS
           Wow.  Sure, right away, Chief.

                     TALLEY
           Don't tell anyone what you're doing, not
           Louise, not the other guys, not the
           Sheriffs.  You understand me, Larry?
 
                     ANDERS
           I guess so. 

                     TALLEY
           Fuck guessing.  You keep your mouth shut.

                     ANDERS
           I will, Chief.  Absolutely.

                     TALLEY
           Get to work.

Anders climbs out and Talley rockets away --

EXT. COMMAND STREET -- NIGHT

Talley pulls up behind the Sheriffs' command van.  Martin,
surprised to see Talley, steps from the van --

                     TALLEY
           I'm re-assuming command of the scene.
                   
Martin is surprised and angry --

                     MARTIN
           Excuse me?  You requested our help.  You
           turned over command --

                     TALLEY
           And now I'm taking it back.  We're
           getting Smith out of the house.

Talley heads for the cul-de-sac --

INT. JENNIFER'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Jennifer is on her bed in the darkness, groggy with fear and
fatigue.  She hears someone outside in the hall --

                     JENNIFER
           Thomas?

The door knob rattles.  Jennifer slides out of bed and goes
to the door --

                     JENNIFER (CONT'D)
           Thomas, is that you?

The door suddenly opens, and Mars is framed in the dim light.
Jennifer jumps back, terrified --

                     JENNIFER (CONT'D)
           What do you want?

                     MARS
           We can't make the microwave work.

That seems so outlandish that Jennifer is confused --

                     JENNIFER
           What?

                     MARS
           We're hungry.  You're going to cook.

Mars grabs her hair, and pushes her out the door --

INT. KITCHEN -- NIGHT

Mars shoves Jennifer into the kitchen.  Two frozen pizzas are
waiting on the counter --

                     MARS
           Make the pizza.  I want scrambled eggs
           and hot dogs on mine.

                     JENNIFER
               (under her breath)
           How about dog shit?

Mars takes a carton of eggs and a package of hot dogs from
the refrigerator --

                     MARS
           With hot sauce and butter.

Jennifer takes a bowl from the cupboard.  When she sets down
the bowl, she sees the handle of the paring knife by the food
processor.  Jennifer breaks eggs into the bowl --

                     JENNIFER
           I need a frying pan.  Would you get one?
           Over there, under the range.

As soon as Mars turns away, Jennifer palms the knife and
pushes it into the waist of her shorts --

EXT. THE CUL-DE-SAC -- NIGHT

Talley joins Maddox behind the car --

                     MADDOX
           What put a wild hair up your ass?

                     TALLEY
           I changed my mind.  That's all you need
           to know.

Talley picks up the dedicated crisis phone that's been cut
into the Smiths' telephone line.  He lifts the receiver and
presses a button.  The phone inside the house rings --

Intercut Dennis inside Smith's office.  He answers --

                     DENNIS
           That you, Talley?

                     TALLEY
           The one and only.  We got a little
           problem out here, Dennis.

                     DENNIS
           You oughta try on the problem I got in
           here.

                     TALLEY
           I need you to let me talk to Mr. Smith.

Dennis shoots a nervous glance at Walter, who's twitching and
shuddering on the couch --

                     DENNIS
           We been through that.  Forget it.

                     TALLEY
           We can't forget it.  The Sheriffs think
           you won't let me talk to Smith because
           he's dead.  They think you murdered him.

Maddox can't believe that Talley is saying this --

                     MADDOX
               (low, so that Dennis can't
                hear)
           What in hell are you doing?!

                     DENNIS
           That's bullshit!  The guy's right here!
           He's alive!

                     TALLEY
               (pressing Dennis harder)
           If you don't let me talk to him, they're
           going to attack the house.

Maddox grabs Talley's arm, his voice a low hiss --

                     MADDOX
           You're gonna set him off, goddamnit!
           That's crazy!

                     DENNIS
               (screaming)
           They better not!

Talley pushes Maddox away and amps the pressure on Dennis --

                     TALLEY
           Help me keep them out!  Let me speak to
           Smith, Dennis.  Let me speak to him right
           now.

Dennis is freaking.  He believes that the Sheriffs are about 
to crash through the doors --

                     DENNIS
           SHIT!!!!

Now Talley throttles back; he senses that Dennis is at the 
breaking point and wants to coax him back from the edge --

                     TALLEY
               (calmer; coaxing)
           Talk to me, Dennis.  Help me help you. 
           Why can't you put Smith on the phone?

Dennis finally makes the admission --

                     DENNIS
               (quietly)
           He got knocked out.  It's like he's
           sleeping.  He just lays there.

Talley gives a thumbs-up to Maddox, who sits back in awe.
This crazy shit is working --

                     TALLEY
               (to Dennis)
           Now I understand.  That helps.  I can
           make them understand that.

                     DENNIS
           Okay.

                     TALLEY
           Let me come get him.

                     DENNIS
           Fuck that!  You bastards will jump me!

                     TALLEY
           If you won't let me come in, then put him
           outside.

                     DENNIS
           You'll cap my ass as soon as I step out
           the door!

                     TALLEY
           You've already helped yourself once,
           Dennis; be smart again.  If you save his
           life, it'll help when you get to court.

Dennis is at the edge; he's looking straight down into his
deepest fears.  He finally relents --

                     DENNIS
           Fuck you, Talley, fuck you!  You and one
           other guy, but that's it!  I want you
           stripped!  I gotta know you don't have
           guns!

Dennis slams down the phone --

Talley lowers the crisis phone, then looks at Maddox --

                     TALLEY
           Bring up the ambulance.

EXT. THE CUL-DE-SAC -- A FEW MINUTES LATER

Mobile banks of flood lamps illuminate the front of the
house.  The ambulance waits behind the lights; tactical
officers with M5s and M16s hunker in position in case the
program goes south --

Talley and a paramedic named Bigelow emerge between the
lights, wearing only shorts and shoes.  Bigelow is carrying a
collapsable stretcher --

They stop in the mouth of the drive with a full view of the 
front door.  Talley lifts his cell phone --

                     TALLEY
               (into the phone)
           Okay, Dennis, we won't approach the house
           until you've closed the door.

The front door opens, a crack at first, then wider.  The line
of officers behind the lights shifts --

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
               (over his shoulder)
           Easy....

Kevin and Mars waddle out with Walter Smith between them.
They put him down about six feet from the front door, then
return to the house --

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
               (to Bigelow)
           Let's do it.

Talley and Bigelow move forward.  When they reach Walter,
Bigelow opens the stretcher and locks out the frame.  He
peels back Walter's eyelids and flashes a penlight --

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
           How's he look?

                     BIGELOW
           He's got a concussion for sure.  I'm
           going to brace him.

As Bigelow sets a cervical neck brace, Talley gets the creepy
feeling that he's being watched.  He turns toward the
shutters, and finds a pair of eyes only inches from his own.
It's Mars.

Talley stares at Mars, and Mars stares back.  It's as if 
they're locked in a contest of wills until --

                     BIGELOW (CONT'D)
           Let's get him on the stretcher.

Talley turns away to help Bigelow --

                     BIGELOW (CONT'D)
           I'll support his head and shoulders.  You
           lift his hips and knees.  On three.
           Three.

As they carry Walter away, Talley glances back at the eyes.
Mars is still watching him --

IN THE CUL-DE-SAC--TALLEY AND BIGELOW

are surrounded by cops as soon as they step into the shadows
behind the lights.  Another paramedic takes the stretcher
from Talley.  Maddox is waiting with Talley's clothes --

                     MADDOX
           You ready to tell me what's going on?

Talley pulls on his pants --

                     TALLEY
           No.

Talley stalks straight to the ambulance, pulling on his
sweatshirt as he goes --

INT. THE AMBULANCE -- NIGHT

A young physician named Klaus is examining Walter as Talley
steps up into the ambulance --

                     TALLEY 
           I'm the chief of police here.  I have to
           talk to him.

                     KLAUS
           Ain't gonna happen.  We've got unequal
           pupilation.  He could have an 
           intracranial hematoma or a fracture or
           both.

Talley ignores the doctor and shakes Walter by the face --

                     TALLEY
           Smith!  Wake up!

                     KLAUS
           What are you doing?!  Stop that!

Walter's eyes flutter, one more open than the other.  Talley
leans closer --

                     TALLEY
               (to Smith)
           Wake up, goddamnit.  Who are you?

Klaus tries to shove Talley away, but it's like pushing a
wall --

                     KLAUS
           This man needs a hospital!  Stop it!

Talley grabs Klaus by the arm, trying to make him see --

                     TALLEY
           Use smelling salts, give him a shot, 
           whatever.  I just need a minute.

Bigelow climbs behind the wheel and starts the ambulance.
Talley pounds on the wall, shouting --

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
           Stop the fuckin' engine!

Klaus and Bigelow are both staring at Talley.  Sheriffs and
Talley's own officers have gathered at the open rear of the
ambulance to see what all the shouting is about --

Klaus pointedly looks at Talley's hand gripping his arm.  He
speaks slowly, trying to make Talley understand --

                     KLAUS
           I'm not going to wake him.  I don't even
           know that I can.

                     TALLEY
           Just one question.  Please.

                     KLAUS
           He.  Can't.  Answer.

Talley stares at Walter Smith.  So close.  So damned close.
Walter knows about the disks.  Walter might even know who has
Jane and Amanda.  But now Walter can't talk --

Talley turns away and climbs out of the ambulance --

EXT. THE CUL-DE-SAC -- NIGHT

As Talley emerges from the van, he pulls Metzger aside --

                     TALLEY
           I want you waiting in Smith's lap.  I
           want to know the second--and I mean the
           second--that he wakes up.

As Metzger hurries after the ambulance, a phone in Talley's
pocket rings.  He's startled and scared; it might be the
Watchman.  Talley takes out the Watchman's white phone, but
it's not ringing.

He answers his other phone --

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
               (into phone)
           Talley.

                     ANDERS' VOICE
           It's me, Chief.  Can you talk?

Talley notices that Martin, Maddox, and the others are
staring at him.  He turns away --

                     TALLEY
               (into his phone)
           What'd you find out?

                     ANDERS' VOICE
           The cell phone is registered to a jewelry
           store in Beverly Hills.  The phone
           company shows no unusual --

                     TALLEY
               (cutting him off)
           Dead end--it's a clone.  What about the
           Mustang?

                     ANDERS' VOICE
           It was stolen.

Talley lowers the phone in frustration, then --

                     TALLEY
           You get anything on Smith?

                     ANDERS' VOICE
           Chief...it's like none of this exists.
           I'm sorry.

                     TALLEY
           Keep trying.

Talley pockets his phone.  He watches the ambulance pull
away, then strides back through the banks of lights to the
nearest patrol car.  He grabs the dash mike and keys the
public address --

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
               (through the p.a.)
           Call me.  If you're safe, call me.

Talley's voice echoes across the neighborhood.  Every cop in
the cul-de-sac stares at him.  He has addressed the house
for, apparently, no reason.  Dennis shouts from his window --

                     DENNIS
           I'll be safe when I'm outta here, you
           asshole!  I'm not talking any more!

Talley drops the mike without a word and walks away --

INT. GLEN HOWELL'S MOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

Howell is on the phone with Ken Seymore, watching the
televised news coverage with increasing alarm --

                     HOWELL
           Was Smith talking?

Intercut Seymore, who is reporting from the York front gate
as the ambulance roars away, siren wailing --

                     SEYMORE
           I heard he's fucked up.  They're taking
           him to the hospital.

                     HOWELL
           Goddamnit, tell me what you know.  Did
           the cops go in?  Did Smith have the
           disks?

                     SEYMORE
           I don't know.  Talley talked those punks
           into letting Smith out.  He's fucking us 
           over, Glen.  That guy is fucking us over.

                     HOWELL
           What hospital?

                     SEYMORE
           Canyon Country.

Howell slams down the phone.  He breathes deeply, taking a
moment to center himself.  He lifts the phone and punches a
number --

                     HOWELL
           I have another job for you.

EXT. COMMAND STREET -- NIGHT

Talley is by himself, pacing at the curb well away from the
other officers.  He is holding his cell phone.  Waiting.

Finally, it rings.  Talley answers, listens, then --

                     TALLEY
           Put him on.

Intercut Thomas, phoning Talley in his room --

                     THOMAS
           Is my daddy okay?

                     TALLEY
           The doctors are taking care of him right
           now.  Thomas . . . are you safe?  Can you
           talk?

                     THOMAS
           I think so.

                     TALLEY
           I need your help with something.  But if
           you think those guys could catch you, 
           then I don't want you to do it, okay?

                     THOMAS
           Okay.

                     TALLEY
           I'm serious, Thomas; I don't want you to
           get hurt.

                     THOMAS
           What do you want me to do?

                     TALLEY
           Your dad has two computer disks.  They
           have funny names:  Marlon and Al.

                     THOMAS
           He has lots of disks.

                     TALLEY
           I think he was working on them today, so
           they're probably in his office.  Could
           you find them and see who they belong to?

                     THOMAS
           Dennis won't let me go to the desk.  He
           makes me sit on the floor.

Talley absorbs the bad news like his last best hope of saving
his family is circling the drain --

                     THOMAS (CONT'D)
           But I might be able to sneak into the
           office if they're not around.  Then I
           could open the disks here in my room.

                     TALLEY
           I thought they locked you in your room.

                     THOMAS
           I can get into the crawlspace from my
           closet and climb all over the house.

                     TALLEY
           Can you get into the office?

                     THOMAS
           I can get into the den.  The office is
           right across the hall.

Talley thinks about what the boy is saying, and what he'll
have to do to get Marlon and Al --

                     TALLEY
           If I get Rooney into the back of the
           house, can you find the disks without
           being caught?

                     THOMAS
           Yes, sir.

Talley glances toward the SWAT Command Van as he comes up
with a plan --

EXT. THE COMMAND VAN -- NIGHT

Martin, Maddox, and several of her supervisors are gathered
outside the van as Talley approaches --

Martin sees him coming and steps away to meet him.  She's
pissed off and she wants answers --

                     MARTIN
           I want to know what in hell you're doing.

                     TALLEY
           I'm looking for you.  I need your
           tactical unit.

                     MARTIN
           I'm not stupid!  You can't get out of
           here fast enough, then you take back
           command; you agree to wait on Smith, then
           you risk everything in a stupid stunt to 
           get him out --

                     TALLEY
               (interrupting)
           Don't question me, Captain!  This is my
           crime scene!

                     MARTIN
               (shouting over him)
           -- then when you get him, you damn near
           assault the man in the ambulance!  What
           is going on?

Talley glares at her, half-a-heartbeat from going off, and
then he throttles back --

                     TALLEY
               (simply)
           I'm a negotiator, Captain.  I negotiate.
           That's all you need to know.  Now are you
           going to help me or not?

Martin weighs the determination in his eyes.  She's angry,
she's resentful, and she wants to knock Talley onto his ass--
but, instead, she glances back to her van --

                     MARTIN
           Maddox!  Let's give the man a hand!

INT. SMITHS' DEN -- NIGHT

Dennis steps through the double doors that open from the
entry and admires the room--rich paneled walls, soft leather
couches and chairs, and a lush beaten-copper bar.  Walter
Smith's office is directly across the hall.

Dennis saunters behind the bar, letting his fingers play over
the copper, then pours a stiff Ketel One on the rocks.

Kevin appears behind him, watching, as Dennis takes a seat on
one of the leather bar stools, then peels a hundred off a
thick roll and drops it on the bar --

                     DENNIS
               (to an imaginary bartender)
           Keep the change, m'man.

Dennis takes a deep drink of the vodka as Kevin approaches --

                     KEVIN
           We're fucked.

                     DENNIS
           We're fucked until we think of a way out;
           then we're rich.

                     KEVIN
           There is no way out.

                     DENNIS
           For chrissake, please!  Help me
           celebrate!  I figured it out!

                     KEVIN
           Celebrate what?  Going to prison?

Dennis enjoys another stiff belt --

                     DENNIS
           No, dumbass--Talley.  Talley's the guy
           who keeps us in here, and Talley's the
           guy who can let us out.

Dennis grins as if he's discovered the wisdom of the ages --

                     DENNIS (CONT'D)
           Cops want to be rich like everyone else.
           All we have to do is share.
               (leans closer and lowers his
                voice)
           And if he wants someone to swing for the
           Chinaman, we'll give'm Mars.

                     MARS
           Dennis.

Mars is standing in the doors, large and ominous.  For an
insane moment Dennis thinks that Mars has heard, but then --

                     MARS (CONT'D)
           The food's ready.

Dennis grins, then shoves Kevin out of the room ahead of him,
the three of them disappearing toward the kitchen as --

The camera drifts up to an air vent in the ceiling, through
the slats in the grate to --

INT. CRAWLSPACE -- NIGHT

Thomas watches them leave through a hole in the air duct.
When he's confident that they are gone, he continues along
the crawlspace to a service hatch that opens down into --

INT. WINE CELLAR - NIGHT

The "wine cellar" is a climate-controlled closet behind the
bar fitted with floor-to-ceiling wine racks.

The ceiling hatch lifts, and Thomas climbs down the racks to
the floor.  He eases open the door and peeks out behind the
bar.  The den is bright with light, and empty --

Thomas lifts his cell phone --

                     THOMAS
               (whispers into the phone)
           It's me, Chief.  I'm in the den.

EXT. SMITHS' REAR WALL -- NIGHT

Talley, Maddox, and several tactical officers are lined along
the rear wall, watching the house.  Talley, with a phone to 
his ear, is looking through a night-vision scope --

He can see into the kitchen through the French doors.  Mars
and Jennifer are inside, and, as we watch, Dennis and Kevin
enter --

                     TALLEY
               (into his phone)
           Okay, bud, here we go.

Talley hands the scope to Maddox, then keys his radio mike --

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
               (into his mike)
           Captain?  Kill the lights.

INT. SMITHS' KITCHEN -- NIGHT

Dennis and Kevin are digging into plates of pizza and eggs
when the house goes dark --

                     DENNIS
           Shit!  It's the cops!

The backyard ERUPTS; explosions from Starflash grenades JUMP
and CAREEN over the swimming pool like New Year fireworks.
It sounds like World War III --

Dennis throws himself behind the kitchen counter --

INT. THE DEN -- NIGHT

The house now dark, Thomas scurries to the double doors.  He
peeks around the corner to see if the coast is clear, then
darts across the hall to --

INT. WALTER'S OFFICE -- NIGHT

The office is lit only by the flickering candles.  Thomas
checks his father's computer--no disks.  He searches through
the papers scattered over the desk, but finds nothing --

Then he opens the drawer --

The disk case that his father put there earlier is waiting.
Thomas opens the case --

Marlon.  Al.

He found them.

INT. THE KITCHEN -- NIGHT

The Starflash grenades burn out as Talley's amplified voice
echoes into the house --

                     TALLEY'S VOICE
           It's time to talk face-to-face, Dennis.
           Come out, just you, and we'll talk.

                     KEVIN
           What's he doing?  What's going on?!

                     DENNIS
           Mars!  They're trying to blindside us!
           Check the front!

Mars lurches to his feet and hurries to the office --

INT. THE OFFICE -- NIGHT

Thomas is heading for the door when he hears footsteps coming
fast toward the office --

Thomas reverses course and ducks under the desk.  He pulls
himself into a ball and tries not to breathe --

Mars is in the room.

The desk is a great oak monster, big as a boat.  It sits on
curvy legs that leave a gap between the desk and the floor.
Thomas can see feet --

The feet go to the windows --

                     DENNIS'S VOICE
           What's going on out front?

The feet turn toward the desk.  Thomas tries to squeeze
himself smaller --

                     DENNIS'S VOICE (CONT'D)
           Mars?!  What the fuck are they doin'?

The feet come to the desk --

                     DENNIS'S VOICE (CONT'D)
           Mars!  Something's happening!  Get back
           here!

The feet hesitate, then, finally, walk away --

Thomas scrambles from under the desk and darts across the
hall --

EXT. THE BACKYARD -- NIGHT

Talley approaches the house.  He can see flashlights moving
in the kitchen --

                     TALLEY
           Come on, Dennis.  Talk to me.

Dennis doesn't answer, so Talley moves closer.  He spreads
his hands wide --

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
           I'm unarmed.  I'm looking at you.  Get
           out here and let's talk.

Dennis comes to the French doors.  He stuffs his pistol into
his pants, and opens the doors --

                     DENNIS
           You got a sniper out there, gonna shoot
           me?

                     TALLEY
           Only if you try to grab me.  We could've
           shot you from the wall.

Dennis considers that and accepts it.  He steps out of the
house and walks over to Talley --

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
           You've been in there a long time.
           What're you waiting for?

                     DENNIS
           Would you be in a hurry to go to prison
           for the rest of your life?

                     TALLEY
           I'd be trying to get the best deal that I
           could.

                     DENNIS
           Maybe that's what I'm doing.  Can I reach
           in my pocket, show you something?

Dennis Rooney steps closer because he doesn't want anyone
else to see the wad of money he pulls out --

                     DENNIS (CONT'D)
           That's fifty hundred-dollar bills.  Five
           grand.  They got money in this house,
           Talley, more than you've ever seen.

Dennis pushes the money back into his pocket.

                     DENNIS (CONT'D)
           How much would it be worth to you,
           getting me out of here?

So that's what keeps Dennis in the house--money.  This is the
first that Talley has heard of the money --

                     TALLEY
           You picked a bad house to hole up in,
           son.

                     DENNIS
           Two hundred thousand cash, right in your
           pocket, no one needs to know.

                     TALLEY
           Give up.

                     DENNIS
           There's a million dollars in there, maybe
           two million.  I'll give you half.

Talley stares at Dennis, wondering how much to tell him and
whether or not it will do any good --
  
                     TALLEY
           The man you sent to the hospital is a
           criminal.  He has partners.  This is
           their house and their money and they want
           it back.

These simple facts settle on Dennis like a funeral shroud--
everything that Smith said earlier now makes a horrible
sense:  You can't imagine the fucking you're going to get.

Dennis's eyes fill with defeat and helplessness --

                     DENNIS
           It ain't been a good day, Chief.

                     TALLEY
           Give up, Dennis.  Let these people go.
           At least you'll have your life.

Dennis steps inside and pulls the door closed, the darkness
in the house swallowing him like dirty water.

The power is turned on.  The house comes to life --

As Talley turns away, his phone once more rings --

INT. THOMAS' ROOM -- NIGHT

Thomas is hunkered with his computer behind his bed so that
the camera can't see him.

                     THOMAS
           I got'm!

Intercut Talley, now back in the cul-de-sac --

                     TALLEY
           Can you open them?

                     THOMAS
           I opened Marlon.  I think it's somebody's
           taxes.

                     TALLEY
           Look for names.  Does it say whose taxes
           they are?

Thomas scrolls through a spread sheet --

                     THOMAS
           I don't see any people names.  It's all
           businesses.

                     TALLEY
           Try Al.  See if you can open Al.

Thomas changes disks and opens Al --

                     THOMAS
           Yeah!  Here's a name.  This is somebody's
           personal tax --

                     TALLEY
           Who is it?

                     THOMAS
           Charles G. Benza.
               (then; noise in the hall)
           They're coming!

Thomas abruptly hangs up and the line goes dead in Talley's
ear.

Talley recognizes the name as easily as an East Coast cop
would recognize John Gotti, and realizes the stunning import
of Smith possessing Sonny Benza's financial records --

                     TALLEY
           Sonny Benza.  Oh, fuck.

Talley sprints across the cul-de-sac to his nearest officer,
Jorgenson, and keys Jorgenson's shoulder mike --

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
               (into the mike)
           Leigh?  Metzger, answer me!

                     METZGER'S VOICE
           I'm at the hospital.

                     TALLEY
           Put a guard on Smith!  I want you with
           Smith until I get there!

                     JORGENSON
           What's going on?

                     TALLEY
           Get in the car.  Now.

Talley drops the mike and shoves Jorgenson toward the car --

EXT. CANYON COUNTRY HOSPITAL -- NIGHT

Marion Clewes is stepping from his car as Talley's police
unit rips into the parking lot with flashing lights --

Marion watches Talley and Jorgenson rush into the ER, then he
frowns and punches the speed dial on his phone --

                     MARION
               (into his phone)
           We're too late.  The police are here.

INT. EMERGENCY ROOM CORRIDOR -- NIGHT

Talley and Jorgenson huddle in the hall with Klaus and the ER
supervisor, Dr. Estelle Reese.  Metzger is outside Walter's
room in the background --

                     TALLEY
           I'm posting a guard outside his room, but
           we'll need help from hospital security.

                     REESE
           Is my staff in danger?

                     TALLEY
           Not with my officers here, no, ma'am.

Metzger steps into Walter's room, then reappears --

                     METZGER
           Hey!  He's waking up!

Talley and Klaus press for the room --

INT. WALTER'S ROOM -- NIGHT

Walter's eyes flutter open.  His voice is slurred, but
understandable --

                     WALTER
           Where am I?

Klaus peels open Walter's eyes, passing his penlight over
one, then the other --

                     KLAUS
           Canyon Country Hospital.  Do you remember
           your name?

It takes Walter a few moments to answer --

                     WALTER
           Walter Smith.

All of Walter's memories come flooding back, and he tries to
sit up.  Klaus forces him down --

                     WALTER (CONT'D)
           Where are my children?

                     TALLEY
           They're still in the house.

Walter looks at Talley.  He has never seen Talley and has no
idea who he is --

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
           I'm Jeff Talley, the Bristo chief of 
           police.  So far as we know, your children
           are okay.

                     KLAUS
           Chief Talley is the one who got you out.

                     TALLEY
               (to Klaus)
           I need to talk to him.  Alone.

This time, Klaus is hard-pressed to refuse.  He nods, then
steps away --

Talley turns back to Walter Smith, and lowers his voice --

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
           Sonny Benza has my wife and daughter.  He
           wants the disks, Marlon and Al.  He took
           my family to make me help.

Talley's eyes fill.  His tears drip on the sheets.  Walter
looks away --

                     WALTER
           I don't know what you're talking about.

                     TALLEY
           He's going to kill you.  Don't you know
           that?  He can't take the chance that
           you'll talk.

Klaus returns and places a hand on Talley's shoulder --

                     KLAUS
           That's enough.

                     TALLEY
           Another minute.  Please --

But when he looks back at Walter, he realizes that another
minute will do no good:  Walter's eyes are once more closed.

EXT. HOSPITAL PARKING LOT -- NIGHT

Talley is pacing by his car in the deserted parking lot.  He
pounds the hood, cursing, awash in rage and frustration --

And then a phone rings.

Talley takes out the phones.  The white phone is ringing.
The Watchman's phone --

Talley answers furiously, the two of them instantaneously
screaming at each other --

                     THE WATCHMAN'S VOICE
           You dumb fuckwad cop, you fucked up bad!

                     TALLEY
           Do you think I'm going to let you murder
           someone?!

                     THE WATCHMAN'S VOICE
           You want a blowtorch on your daughter's
           pretty face?!

                     TALLEY
           I'll go in that fuckin' house right now!
           I'll give those disks to the real FBI,
           you COCKSUCKINGMOTHERFUCKER!!  And I've
           got Smith!  I've got Smith!!

A profound silence fills the parking lot, both men now
purged.  When the Watchman speaks again, his voice is
measured --

                     THE WATCHMAN'S VOICE
           I guess we each have something the other
           wants.

                     TALLEY
           I guess we do.

                     THE WATCHMAN'S VOICE
           My people are good to go.  You know who I
           mean?

                     TALLEY
           Your phony FBI assholes.

                     THE WATCHMAN'S VOICE
           We're almost home, you and me.  Keep your
           shit together.  This isn't L.A.

                     TALLEY
           What do you mean by that?

                     THE WATCHMAN'S VOICE
           You don't want another dead child on your
           conscience.

The line goes dead --

INT. THE SMITHS' DEN -- NIGHT

Dennis is pouring another stiff glass of Ketel One --

                     DENNIS
           I shouldn't have told him about the
           money.  Now Talley is gonna keep it for
           himself.

Kevin joins him at the bar.  Mars is by the doors --

                     KEVIN
           He said that?

Dennis downs a big hit of vodka, then moves to the couch --

                     DENNIS
           If we don't escape, we gotta get the word
           out about the cash.  That's how we'll
           stay alive.

                     KEVIN
           What are you talking about?

                     DENNIS
           The only way he can keep the cash is if
           nobody knows about it.  He's gotta cap
           all three of us before they even read our
           rights.  He's probably planning it right
           now.

                     KEVIN
           That's crazy.  He's not going to kill us.

                     DENNIS
           Kevin, you're so fuckin' stupid...

Kevin follows his brother to the couch and stares at him;
Dennis has clearly lost his mind, and Kevin has reached the
end of his rope --

                     KEVIN
           It's over.  We have to give up.

                     DENNIS
           Fuck it's over.  That money's mine.

                     KEVIN
           That money's fucked up your brain.
           Talley's going to get tired of waiting
           for us to give up, and we'll all be
           fuckin' killed!

Dennis tips his glass, like a toast --

                     DENNIS
           Then we might as well die rich.

                     KEVIN
           I'm not going to die for this!

Kevin slaps the glass away.  Dennis boils up from the couch.
He grabs his brother and the two of them fall over the coffee
table, Dennis hammering Kevin in a furious rage until he runs
out of gas --

                     DENNIS
           You're my fuckin' anchor, Kevin, the
           fuckin' lead around my life that I've
           been draggin' like a cripple leg!

Dennis gets up and steps back --

                     DENNIS (CONT'D)
           Get this into your stupid head, Kevin.
           We're not leaving without the money.

Beaten and whimpering, Kevin crawls away.  Dennis watches him
crawl out of the room, then looks at Mars --

                     DENNIS (CONT'D)
           You got something to say?

                     MARS
           I like it here, Dennis.  I'm never going
           to leave.

                     DENNIS
           Fuckin' A.

Dennis returns to the bar.  When he looks around again, Mars
is gone--melted into the darkness.

INT. JENNIFER'S ROOM -- NIGHT

Jennifer is hiding in her shadows when her doorknob moves.  She
reaches pulls the knife from her shorts, keeping it hidden as
she backs away --

Kevin steps inside, leaving the door ajar --

                     JENNIFER
           What do you want?

                     KEVIN
           Keep your voice down.  I'm taking you and
           your brother out of here.

Jennifer now sees the marks and cuts on his face --

                     JENNIFER
           What happened?

                     KEVIN
           Do you want to go or not?  I'm offering
           you a way out of here.

                     JENNIFER
           I can't go without Thomas.

                     KEVIN
           All three of us will go, but we have to
           move fast.  Mars and Dennis don't know
           I'm doing this.

                     JENNIFER
           How can we get out?

                     KEVIN
           Dennis and Mars are in the den.  I'll get
           your brother, then come back for you.
           We'll go down the stairs and out the
           front door, you understand?

                     JENNIFER
           Yes.

Kevin goes back to the door, then considers her.  Maybe he
wants to apologize for all this, but the best he can manage
is --

                     KEVIN
           Put on some shoes.

Kevin slips out and pulls the door closed.

INT. SECOND FLOOR HALL -- NIGHT

As Kevin emerges from the room, he comes face-to-face with --

Mars.

Mars is a great black shadow in the dark, only inches away.
Kevin steps back --

                     KEVIN
           You scared the shit out of me.  I was
           looking for you.  Dennis wants you to
           watch the monitors.

                     MARS
           I heard you with the girl.

Kevin takes another step back, but Mars follows him, staying
uncomfortably close --

                     KEVIN
           It's over, Mars.  If we stay the cops
           will kill us.  Don't you get that?

Mars seems thoughtful, steps aside --

                     MARS
           I get it.  If you want to go, go.

Kevin expected Mars to stop him, but Mars is letting him go.
Kevin turns away and hurries down the hall --

EXT. YORK ESTATES MAIN ENTRANCE -- NIGHT

Talley is returning to the hospital.  As he turns into York
Estates, he's stopped by one of his officers, Dale Cooper.
Talley rolls down his window to see what Cooper wants --

                     COOPER
           Come FBI guys showed up, Chief.  They
           said you were expecting them.

                     TALLEY
           They here now?

                     COOPER
           You'll see'm up the street.

Talley nods, and continues through the gate --

EXT. STREET -- NIGHT

Two gray Econoline vans are parked at the curb beneath a
street light, four men in the lead van, two in the rear.

Talley pulls up behind them, then gets out of his car.  He
walks up the middle of the street to the lead van, eyeballing
the men in the vans:  They all have short haircuts and are
wearing black tactical fatigues.  Some of them wear ball caps
that say FBI.

                     THE DRIVER
           You Talley?

                     TALLEY
           Yeah.

The man in the passenger seat, Mr. Jones, gets out.  He looks 
the part of FBI SWAT:  black tac fatigues, jump boots, buzzed
hair.  A pistol hangs under his left arm in a ballistic
holster --

                     MR. JONES
           Let me see some ID.  Something with a
           picture.  I don't give a shit about your
           badge.

Talley takes out his wallet and flashes his photo ID.  Jones
does the same in return --

                     MR. JONES (CONT'D)
           Okay, here's mine.  My name is Special
           Agent Jones.

                     TALLEY
           Are all of you named Jones?

                     MR. JONES
           Don't be funny, Chief.  You can't afford
           it.

Jones slaps the side of the van.  Doors open, and the
remaining five men climb out.  They strap into vests with FBI
emblazoned on the back, then pass out load-bearing gear, knit
masks, and flash-bang grenades.

                     MR. JONES (CONT'D)
           In a few minutes the white phone is going
           to ring.  So let's get our shit straight
           before that happens.

                     TALLEY
           You used to be a cop.  All of you used to
           be cops.  I can tell by the way you move.

                     MR. JONES
           Don't worry about what we used to be.

                     TALLEY
           How do you people expect this to work?
           The Sheriffs have a Crisis Response Team
           here.

                     MR. JONES
           What's my name?

                     TALLEY
           What?

                     MR. JONES
           I asked you my name.  You just saw my
           commission slip.  What's my fucking name?

                     TALLEY
           Special Agent Jones.

                     MR. JONES
           Think of me that way and you won't fuck
           up.  I'll handle the Sheriffs.

The men at the second van are now passing out MP5s, CAR-15s, 
and loaded magazines --

                     TALLEY
           What are you people going to do?

                     MR. JONES
           You and I are gonna straighten this out
           with the Sheriffs, and then we'll wait
           for the man to call.  When he gives the
           word, we move.

                     TALLEY
           What does he have on you?  I know why I'm
           doing this, but what does he have on you?

One of the other men hands an MP5 to Mr. Jones.  Jones
jacks the bolt to chamber a round.  He slings his gun without
answering --

                     MR. JONES
           Let's go, Chief.  Time to get real.

Jones walks away, and all Talley can do is follow --

EXT. MARS KRUPCHEK'S TRAILER -- NIGHT

We're at the end of a gravel road in the low foothills of
Pearblossom, a farm community of fruit orchards in the low
foothills.

A Bristo Camino police car pulls up outside a thirty-foot
Caravan trailer, and Mikkelson and Dreyer get out.  Mikkelson
lights up the trailer with the radio car's spotlight --

                     DREYER
           Krupchek lives in a shithole.

The trailer is dark and silent.  They walk to the door
carrying their Maglites.  Mikkelson tries the knob --

                     MIKKELSON
           I guess we could jimmy it.

                     DREYER
           I don't want to pay for breaking it.

Mikkelson pulls hard and the door pops open.  Both officers
cringe as a smell like simmering mustard greens rolls out at
them --

                     MIKKELSON
           Christ, that stinks.

INT. THE TRAILER -- NIGHT

Mikkelson switches on the lights as they step inside.  Dreyer
sees it first --

                     DREYER
           Mickey?  Look at this shit.

Mikkelson joins Dreyer in the trailer's tiny kitchen where
teetering stacks of folded cereal boxes fill the counters and
sink and floor.  Hundreds and hundreds of Captain Crunch and
Count Chocula boxes, all neatly folded and stacked --

                     DREYER (CONT'D)
           He's burned them.

                     MIKKELSON
           What?

Dreyer shows her a box.  The nose of each character has been
burned with a cigarette --

                     DREYER
           He burned their noses.

                     MIKKELSON
           Okay, this is creeping me out.

Mikkelson opens the oven.  It's empty.  She opens a cupboard.
It's filled with large glass jars.  She opens another 
cupboard.  More jars.  Shapes float in the jars, suspended in
yellow fluid.  Mikkelson and Dreyer examine the shapes --

                     DREYER
           What are those, rats?

Mikkelson opens the fridge, then slams it, looking like she
wants to puke --

                     MIKKELSON
           Ohmigod.  We gotta call Talley.

Dreyer sees the expression on her face, then looks at the
fridge, wondering --

EXT. CUL-DE-SAC -- NIGHT

Talley, Jones, and Jones's phony "FBI" team are moving down
the cul-de-sac toward the house with Martin at their heels --

                     MR. JONES
           Walter Smith is in the Federal Witness
           Protection program.  When Washington
           learned about the situation here, they
           asked Chief Talley for his cooperation.

                     MARTIN
           This is bullshit.  I should've been
           notified.

                     MR. JONES
           I'm sure you will be, Captain, but it's
           after midnight.  Now, if you'll pull your
           people off the perimeter, I want to get
           my people in position.

Martin looks like she wants to spit bullets --

                     TALLEY
           Let it go, Captain.

                     MARTIN
           Goddamned small town bullshit.

Martin relents and stalks away just as Talley's phone rings.

Both Talley and Jones tense at the ring, thinking it might be
the white phone, but it's not --

                     TALLEY
           It's mine.
               (into his phone)
           Talley.

                     MIKKELSON'S VOICE
           Chief, it's Mikkelson.

                     TALLEY
           Go, Mickey.

EXT. KRUPCHEK'S TRAILER -- NIGHT

Both Mikkelson and Dreyer are leaning against their car.
They look shellshocked.  Mikkelson is making the call --

                     MIKKELSON
           Chief, we just found Krupchek's trailer.
           We just went in there.

She trails off and looks at Dreyer for help:  How do I say
this?  Dreyer, at a loss, looks away --

                     MIKKELSON (CONT'D)
           He has human body parts in his 
           refrigerator.  He has five human heads.

Mikkelson can't handle it any more.  She lowers the phone --

WITH TALLEY

The shock that Mikkelson is feeling sweeps over Talley as
well.  He takes a moment to get his head around this --

                     TALLEY
               (into his phone)
           Mickey?  Call the state Homicide Bureau.
           Don't touch anything, just sit back and
           wait.

                     MIKKELSON'S VOICE
           Yes, sir.

Talley lowers the phone as he stares at the house, wondering
what sort of monster is in there with Thomas and Jennifer.

His gaze shifts to Mr. Jones, who is watching him --

                     TALLEY
           We're getting those kids out of there.

INT. THE SMITHS' DEN -- NIGHT

Dennis is sprawled on the couch, sucking the last few drops
of Ketel One from the bottle.  He frowns at the empty bottle,
then lumbers to his feet --

                     DENNIS
               (calling)
           Kev?  Key, Kevin, c'mon back.  I'm sorry
           I hit you.

Dennis weaves through the door, carrying the empty bottle
like his dearest friend --

INT. THE KITCHEN -- NIGHT

Dennis staggers into the kitchen --

                     DENNIS
           C'mon, Kev, don't fuckin' pout!  You're
           right.  It's time to call it a game.

                     MARS'S VOICE
           Kevin left.  He didn't want to be here
           anymore.

The voice from the other side of the kitchen startles him.
Mars steps out of the shadows --

                     DENNIS
           You mean he left, as in went out the
           front door?

                     MARS
           I overheard him with the girl.

                     DENNIS
           Shit!  That fuck!  Even when I want to
           turn myself in he screws it up!  Did he 
           take the kids with him?

                     MARS
           I don't know.

                     DENNIS
           Jesus, get upstairs and find out!  If he
           took those kids, we're fucked!

Mars cross the kitchen and goes for the stairs without
another word --

                     DENNIS (CONT'D)
           KEVIN!!!  You ASSHOLE!!!

Dennis throws the bottle across the room --

INT. THE HOBBY ROOM -- NIGHT

Thomas is scared by all the shouting, but he waits in the
darkness until Dennis quiets, and then we notice that he is
no longer in his room; he's in the hobby room, once more
trying to reach the gun --

Thomas stacks two phone books on the bench, then uses the
phone books as an extra step to reach the high shelf --

He can finally reach the gun case!  He puts it on the bench,
then climbs down, and opens the case.  Thomas is bouyant with
confidence; now, he can protect himself and his sister!

Thomas shoves the gun into his pants and creeps back into --

INT. THE LAUNDRY ROOM -- NIGHT

Thomas is climbing onto the washing machine when his foot
slips and he bangs his head --

It's so dark in ehre that Thomas can't see what made him 
slip, but he tests the floor.  His shoe makes a tacky sound.

Thomas cups his hand over his flashlight like before, and
turns it on.  A dark liquid like oil is spreading on the
floor.

Thomas follows it with his light to the broom closet.  He
lets out more light and sees that the oil is red.

Thomas knows that something terrible is behind the door, but
he is drawn to it.  He reaches out --

Kevin's lifeless body topples out, collapsing in a heap at
Thomas's feet.  His neck is cut so deeply that his head is
almost severed --

His eyes are open.

Thomas screams!

INT. JENNIFER'S ROOM -- NIGHT

Jennifer is anxiously waiting for Kevin.  When she hears
someone in the hall, she thinks that it's Kevin, but when the
door opens --

It's Mars.

He steps inside, tall, wide, and massive as a bear.  He's
carrying the claw hammer.  Jennifer backs away --

                     MARS
           Kevin left without you.

                     JENNIFER
           I don't know what you're talking about.

Mars turns off the lights.

                     JENNIFER (CONT'D)
           Don't do that.  Turn on the lights.

Jennifer grows even more frightened.  Mars follows her across
the room until she backs into the window --

                     JENNIFER (CONT'D)
           You'd better get out of here!  Kevin's
           coming back!

                     MARS
           Kevin's gone, your daddy's gone, 
           everybody's gone.

When Mars reaches her, he touches the hammer to the chest,
pressing to make it hurt --

                     MARS (CONT'D)
           Now we can do whatever we want.

                     JENNIFER 
           Stop it.

Mars rakes the claws slowly between her breasts as Jennifer
finds the knife in her shorts.  She jerks free the blade and
stabs blindly burying the knife high in his chest, but Mars
doesn't even step back --

He grips the handle, moaning hideously as he pulls out the
knife.  A red flower blossoms from the wound.

Jennifer tries to get past him, but he grabs her throat and
pins her to the wall --

                     MARS
           You're going to enjoy this.

He raises the knife to her face --

INT. KITCHEN -- NIGHT

The scream from the laundry room having scared the shit out
of Dennis, he has his gun out --

                     DENNIS
           Who's that?  Goddamnit, who's there?

Dennis turns on his flashlight and sweeps the beam across the
kitchen --

                     DENNIS (CONT'D)
           Kev?  Is that you?  Talley?

Dennis weaves across the kitchen, pushing the gun ahead of
him --

                     DENNIS (CONT'D)
           Kevin, if that's you, say something.
           Mars said you left.

Dennis steps through the door into --

INT. THE LAUNDRY ROOM -- NIGHT

Dennis shines the light on the floor and sees the red ooze.
He follows the blood to Kevin's body, but even then doesn't
realize what he's seeing --

                     DENNIS
           Kevin, what the fuck?  Get up.

Dennis steps closer, and now he sees the open neck, the
grotesque white bone within the flesh --

Only one other person in the house could have done this --

                     DENNIS (CONT'D)
           MARS?!?!

Dennis hears Jennifer screaming upstairs --

                     DENNIS (CONT'D)
           MARS!!!

Dennis rushes from the room --

INT. JENNIFER'S ROOM -- NIGHT

Dennis slams through the door so heard that the door crashes
into the wall.  Mars is across the room, still holding
Jennifer by the neck --

Dennis aims his gun --

                     DENNIS
           You're dead, you fuck.

Mars calmly pulls the girl in front of him, blocking Dennis's
aim.

                     MARS
           What's wrong, Dennis?  Why're you so
           pissed off?

It's weird the way Mars is acting, so calm and all.  But
Dennis can see the feat in Jennifer's face and her swollen
eyes.  She manages one word --

                     JENNIFER
           Please...

Dennis tries to aim past her --

                     DENNIS
           This fuck killed Kevin.  There's blood
           everywhere down there --

Jennifer sobs.  And when she does --

Mars charges across the room holding Jennifer like a shield.
Dennis hesitates only a heartbeat, and then it's too late --

Jennifer crashes into him, the full force of Mars's weight
behind her, knocking Dennis backward into the hall --

INT. SECOND FLOOR HALL -- NIGHT

They fall through the door into a tangle on the floor.  Mars
raises the hammer, then brings it down, smashing Dennis over
and over --

INT. JENNIFER'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Thomas emerges from the closet to see the carnage in the
hall:  Mars over Dennis, grunting like a pig as he turns
Dennis into pulp, and Jennifer crawling away, splattered with
blood --

Thomas pulls the gun from his pants and darts past Mars into
the hall --

INT. UPSTAIRS HALL -- NIGHT

Thomas grabs Jennifer's arm and pulls her toward the stairs --

                     THOMAS
           C'mon, Jen!  Run!

Mars heaves to his feet and turns after them --

Thomas jerks up the pistol with both hands --

                     THOMAS (CONT'D)
           I'll shoot you!

Mars stops, blood dripping from his face and hands and the
hammer.  Jennifer pulls her brother --

                     JENNIFER
           Keep going!

They back toward the stairs, Thomas trying to hold the gun
steady.  Mars follows, spreading his arms wide as if to
embrace them --

                     MARS
           Everyone's gone.  We can do whatever we
           want.  We can do anything.

                     THOMAS
           I'll shoot you!  I'm not kidding, you
           better stay away!

Mars keeps coming --

Thomas pulls the trigger.  Click.

Mars stops, frozen by the sharp sound --

Thomas pulls again.  Click click click --

No bullets.

                     JENNIFER
           Run!!!!!

Thomas and Jennifer sprint for the stairs --

INT. FRONT ENTRY -- NIGHT

Jennifer and Thomas crash down the stairs and spill into the
entry.  Thomas goes to the front door but Jennifer pulls him
away --

                     JENNIFER
           No!  They have everything nailed!

They race away down the hall just as Mars reaches the bottom
of the stairs --

INT. THE SMITHS' BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Mars is closing.  Jennifer and Thomas scramble through the
bedroom only paces ahead of him.  They run straight into --

INT. THE SAFE ROOM -- NIGHT

Jennifer and Thomas slam the door and throw the bolts just as
Mars crashes into the door --

Jennifer and Thomas have made it.  They are shaking and
scared, but they are safe.

                     JENNIFER
           He can't reach us in here.  We're safe.

                     THOMAS
           I know.

Mars pounds on the door with the hammer.  They can see him on
the monitors.  Slow rhythmic pounding.  Then he walks away --

                     JENNIFER
           What's he doing?

They can see him on the monitors--moving through the hall,
going into the entry....

Mars picks up a bucket of gasoline.  He splashes gas on the
walls and floor all the way back to the bedroom, and then he
empties the bucket on the security room's door --

Mars looks up at the camera again and takes out a match.  He
flicks it with his thumbnail and it flares --

                     JENNIFER (CONT'D)
           Ohmigod, he's going to burn us!

Mars tosses the match, and the room erupts into flame --

EXT. THE CUL-DE-SAC -- NIGHT

Talley is arguing with Jones, trying to convince the man that
they need to move into the house now --

                     TALLEY
           We've got to get those kids out of there!

                     MR. JONES
           Not until the man calls.

                     TALLEY
           Those kids are in there with a fucking
           psychopath!  He kills people!

                     MR. JONES
           They've been in there all day.

Talley's phone rings.  Again, they both think that it's the
white phone, but instead it's Talley's personal phone --

                     TALLEY
               (into his phone)
           Talley.

It's Thomas.  His voice cuts in and out, broken by static --

                     THOMAS'S VOICE
           Mars killed Kevin and Dennis!  We're in
           the security room.  He's burning the
           house --

Thomas' phone cuts out.  Talley turns toward the house and
sees a growing column of smoke.  He looks back at Jones --

                     TALLEY
           You do what you have to do; I'm getting
           those kids.

Talley hurries away.  Jones stares after him, then comes to
his own agonized decision.  He catches up --

                     MR. JONES
           Talley!  We'll secure the house, but then
           we get the disks.

Talley accepts that; they move toward the house --

EXT. THE SMITHS' HOUSE -- NIGHT

The banks of floodlights abruptly shut off, plunging the
house and grounds into darkness --

INT. THE MASTER BEDROOM -- NIGHT

The fire is spreading, following the gasoline trail through
the hall and the rest of the house; a thick layer of smoke 
covers the ceiling --

Mars sees that the outside lights have been turned off, and
senses that the cops are making their move.  That's all right
with Mars--he's been waiting to die for most of his life --

Mars checks the load in his pistol, then melts away into the
dark --

A moment later, throbbing music pounds the house --

EXT. SMITHS' HOUSE -- NIGHT

Talley and Jones slip up to a side window at the front of the
house.  Both are carrying fire extinguishers.  They peer
inside, then Jones uses a pry bar to lift the window --

INT. FRONT GUEST ROOM -- NIGHT

Talley enters first, followed by Jones.  The air is thick
with smoke, and the music is confusing; the hall outside the
room is filled with flames --

Talley points toward the bedroom, then uses hand signals to
countdown the launch--three...two...one --

Jones keys his throat mike to launch the strike --

                     MR. JONES
           Go --

They blast the flames with their fire extinguishers, then
plunge into the hall --

INT. MASTER BEDROOM -- NIGHT

The sliding glass doors shatter as one of Jones's men
breaches the door.  As he rolls to his feet, Mars shoots him
from the flames --

A second man rolls through the door, and Mars shoots again,
laughing as the man writhes in flames --

INT. HALL -- TALLEY AND JONES

fight back the flames with their fire extinguishers, working
their way into --

INT. THE MASTER BEDROOM -- NIGHT

It's an inferno as Talley and Jones come through the door.
They spot the two men on the floor just as --

Mars rears up behind the flames.  He is shirtless and 
glistening, screaming maniacally is he fires his gun --

Talley and Jones fire in unison, pounding Mars with bullets
and knocking him into the fire.  Mars thrashes and screams,
burning alive --

Talley hears pounding inside the safe room:  Jennifer and
Thomas!  He fights his way to the security door, which is
covered with flames --

                     TALLEY
           The kids are in here!

                     MR. JONES
           Where's the office?

                     TALLEY
           Help me, goddamnit, we can get the disks
           later!

Talley expects that Jones will help, but Jones is aiming his
gun --

                     MR. JONES
           We don't need you any more, Chief.  We
           can get the disks on our own.

But before Jones can kill Talley, Mars heaves himself up from
the flames, firing wildly.  He hits Jones in the head --

Talley fires reflexively, his powerful .45 kicking Mars
across the room and out the glass doors.  Talley turns back
to the burning door and douses the flames with his fire
extinguisher --

                     TALLEY
           Thomas!  Thomas, it's me!

Thomas and Jennifer jerk open the door, but shrink from the
heat.  Talley uses the last of his fire extinguisher, then
pulls them into his arms --

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
           Stay close.  We're going to move fast --

INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALL -- NIGHT

Talley shepherds Jennifer and Thomas past the flames --

INT. THE ENTRY -- NIGHT

They reach the entry, and Talley uses his pry bar to break
open the door --

A wall of cops are out on the street, waiting --

                     TALLEY
               (to Thomas)
           Are the disks still in your room?

                     THOMAS
           No!  They're right here --

Thomas pulls Marlon and Al from his pocket --

Talley clutches the disks and pulls the boy close in a
spontaneous hug.  They run out the door as we --

                                                      CUT TO:

INT. WALTER SMITH'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- LATER THAT NIGHT

Walter is resting comfortably when Talley steps up beside his
bed.  Talley is a mess--smokey, dirty, greased with sweat --

                     TALLEY
               (quietly)
           Smith.

Walter opens his eyes, then Talley steps away.  Jennifer and
Thomas are standing behind him.  They rush to their father --

                     JENNIFER/THOMAS
           Daddy!

                     WALTER
           Thank God!  Are you guys all right?
           You're not hurt?

                     THOMAS
           Our house is on fire!  We almost burned!

Both children burst into tears, and Walter hugs them.  He
looks up at Talley, then gently eases his kids away --

                     WALTER
               (to Jennifer and Thomas)
           You guys step out for a second.  I have
           to talk to the Chief.

Walter waits until his children are gone, and then --

                     WALTER (CONT'D)
           Did you find the disks?

                     TALLEY
           Yes.

                     WALTER
           Then you have everything.  You can put
           them away.

                     TALLEY
               (touches his wrist)
           A man has my family.  Gold watch here.
           Dark tan.

                     WALTER
           That would be Glen Howell.  He was on his
           way for the disks.

                     TALLEY
           How do I reach him?

EXT. HOSPITAL PARKING LOT -- NIGHT

Talley is alone in his car, his phone to his ear, listening
to the ring at the other end of the line.  A familiar voice
answers --

                     HOWELL'S VOICE
           Hello?

                     TALLEY
           Two words:  Glen Howell.

Intercut Howell in his motel room.  He is thrown by getting
this call --

                     HOWELL
           How did you get this number?

                     TALLEY
           Mr. Jones is dead.  So are two of his
           men.  The other three are in jail.  I
           have the disks.  I have Walter Smith.
           And you know what, you motherfucker?  I
           have you.

                     HOWELL
           I have your fucking family.  Don't forget
           that.

                     TALLEY
           I also have a couple of million in cash.
           Call Sonny Benza.  Ask if I can keep it.

This throws Howell, too.  He didn't expect anything like
this; not from Talley --

                     HOWELL
           What do you want?

                     TALLEY
           My wife and my daughter and the money.
           I'll bring the disks to the mall by the
           freeway, you bring my family.  We'll
           trade.

                     HOWELL
           Fuck that!  You think I'm crazy?!

                     TALLEY
           I think you got no choice.

Howell thinks about it.  It's a tough call because Talley
might be setting him up, but they're playing even hands--
Talley still has the disks --

                     HOWELL
           Fuck the mall.  You know that motel on
           the road west of town?

                     TALLEY
           Yeah.

                     HOWELL
           You got ten minutes.  If you're one
           minute late, we won't be here to find.

Talley tosses his phone aside, then drives away --

EXT. NEW YORK CITY -- NIGHT

A graphic identifies our location:  New York City.

INT. VICTOR CASTELLANO'S BROWNSTONE -- NIGHT

Victor Castellano is "the old man" that Benza's people have
mentioned.  He is not a happy man in the best of
circumstances and is even less happy now --

Castellano's assistant, Jamie Beldone, is briefing him on
events in the West --

                     BELDONE
           The house is in flames, Benza's
           accountant is with the cops, and they're
           stacking the bodies like cordwood.

                     CASTELLANO
           Jesus Christ, it's a clusterfuck.

                     BELDONE
           You wanted to let Sonny handle it.  I
           would've moved in when we first found
           out.

Castellano scowls at the younger man --

                     CASTELLANO
           And by doing so, he would've known we
           have spies in his organization.

                     BELDONE
               (embarrassed)
           Yes, sir.  But what about the disks?  If
           the cops end up with the disks, we're
           gonna see a whole lot of heat.

                     CASTELLANO
           I hate that Mickey Mouse bastard.  I
           hated his father, and I hate Sonny, too.
           Always with the tan.

                     BELDONE
           What do you want to do?

                     CASTELLANO
           Our people out there, they good people?
           People in the right place?

                     BELDONE
           The best.

                     CASTELLANO
           Sonny's a fuckup.  If he pulls this off,
           fine--life goes on.  But if the cops end
           up with those disks, we cut our losses.

                     BELDONE
           I understand.

                     CASTELLANO
           I want a message sent:  No fuckups
           allowed.

                     BELDONE
           I'll make the call.

Vic Castellano watches Beldone depart as he considers what is
about to come --

EXT. MOTEL -- NIGHT

The motel floats like an island of light in the middle of
nowhere.  A few cars are scattered throughout the quiet 
parking lot --

MIKE RUIZ

is hiding in weeds across from the motel, keeping an eye on
the road for Talley's approaching vehicle.  A radio
transmission crackles quietly --

                     MANELLI'S VOICE
           You see anything?

Ruiz keys the mike --

                     RUIZ
           Not yet.

Talley steps silently behind him and presses his gun to Mike
Ruiz's ear --

LOU BUSTER

Buster is on the dark side of thge parking lot, standing watch
outside the pool of light in the shadows --

Gravel crunches behind him; Buster turns, and --

Talley cracks him across the face with his .45 --

WITH TALLEY

He edges along the perimeter of the parking lot, working as
close as he can to a Fat Man who is leaning against the green
Mustang --

The door to a ground floor room opens, and Glen Howell steps
out.  Talley recognizes Howell from the big gold watch --

                     HOWELL
               (to the Fat Man)
           Keep your eyes open.  He should've been
           here.

Howell returns to the room.  The Fat Man steps away from the
Mustang, and --

Talley slams into his blindside, using the .45 as a club.
The Fat Man staggers, and Talley wraps an arm around his neck
in a choke hold, running him at the door --

Talley rams the Fat man into the door, knocking it open and
shoving the Fat Man through --

INT. HOWELL'S MOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

Talley explodes through the door with the Fat Man in front of
him like a shield --

                     TALLEY
               (screaming)
           Police!

Glen Howell jerks out his pistol as he drops behind the bed.
Duane Manelli rolls out of a chair, aiming from the floor in
a two-handed grip --

                     HOWELL
           Don't shoot!  Don't shoot him!

Talley shifts his aim back and forth between the two men.  He
has his back to the wall and the Fat Man in front of him --

                     TALLEY
           Where's my family?!  Where's my family,
           you fuck?!

All three men are sucking air like freight engines.  No
one is shooting, but if one person fires, everyone will fire.
Everybody has something the other guy wants.  That's the only
thing holding them back --

                     HOWELL
           Take it easy.  Just take it easy.  We're
           here to do business.

                     TALLEY
           You said they would be here, goddamnit!
           Where are they?

Howell releases his grip on the gun, and lets it swing free
on his finger.  He's trying to cool Talley --

                     HOWELL
           They're close.  Let me make a call.  You
           can see they're okay.

                     TALLEY
           You said they would be here!

Howell takes out his phone and presses a number.  Talley
shifts his aim from Howell to the Fat Man to Manelli --

                     HOWELL
               (into the phone)
           Put on the woman.

Howell offers the phone, but Talley is wary--he can't let go
of the Fat Man and he won't put down his pistol.  Howell
carefully holds the phone to Talley's ear --

                     TALLEY
               (into the phone)
           Jane?

                     JANE'S VOICE
           Jeff, we're --

Howell backs away with the phone --

                     HOWELL
           You have the disks?

Talley takes out a single disk.  It's the one labeled
'Marlon.'  He tosses it onto the bed --

                     TALLEY
           You get the other one when I have my
           girls.  Not talk to them; have them.

                     HOWELL
           Where is it?

                     TALLEY
           Close.

Howell considers the disk.  If Talley has the second disk in
his pocket, Howell could just shoot him.  But Howell can't be
sure --

                     HOWELL
           I have to see if it's real.

Howell brings the disk to a lap top computer set up in the 
corner.  He inserts the disk, and waits for it to read.  He's
satisfied with what he sees --

                     HOWELL (CONT'D)
           All right.  Now the second one.

                     TALLEY
           First my girls.  I get my girls, you get
           the other disk.

Howell stares at Talley again, then picks up his phone --

                     HOWELL
               (into the phone)
           Bring them.  Stop the car outside the
           room, but don't get out.

The car pulls up directly outside the door.  It was only
seconds away.  Marion Clewes is driving; Jane and Amanda are
wedged into the front seat beside him, Jane next to Marion,
Amanda on the far side.  They are bound tight with their
mouths taped, immobile and helpless, their eyes wide with
fear --

                     HOWELL (CONT'D)
               (into his phone)
           Aim your gun at the woman's head.  If he
           doesn't give me the disk, kill her.

Marion presses a gun to Jane's temple --

Talley jerks his gun toward Howell --

                     TALLEY
           I'll kill you!  You won't get the other
           disk!

                     HOWELL
           If you shoot me, he'll kill your
           daughter.  Do you want to lose both of
           them?

Talley aims at the man in the car; he aims at Howell.  He
tried so hard to save his family, and now Howell has him
boxed --

                     HOWELL (CONT'D)
           The negotiation is over, Talley.  I won.
           Now give me the disk or he'll put her
           brain on the glass.

Talley looks at Jane and Amanda, and his eyes fill.  He
mouths the words --

                     TALLEY
           I love you.

He's saying good-bye.

Talley drops his gun and releases the Fat Man, who stumbles
away.  Talley tosses a second disk onto the bed.  Manelli
scoops it up and tosses it to Howell as Mation appears in the
door --

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
           I gave the other one to the Sheriffs and
           they're giving it to the real FBI.  This
           one's a fake.

                     HOWELL
           You'd better be kidding.

Howell anxiously pushes the disk into his lap top --

                     TALLEY
           I'm a cop, you asshole!  What did you
           expect me to do?  Pretend all this never
           happened?

Howell stares at the lap top with the withering face of a man
reading his own death sentence.  There is nothing on this
disk.

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
           Benza's over.  You're over.  I just want
           to take my family home.

Howell stands like a mechanical man; incredulous --

                     HOWELL
           Are you out of your mind?

                     MARION
               (quietly)
           You fucked up, Glen.

Howell looks over as if seeing Marion for the first time, and
gives him the order --

                     HOWELL
           Kill them.

Marion aims his gun directly between Talley's eyes, then
points it at Howell --

                     MARION
           No fuckups allowed.

Marion shoots Howell in the head, then the Fat Man, then
Manelli--bambambam--one shot, one kill.

He lowers his gun, considers Talley.  Talley doesn't
move.

                     MARION (CONT'D)
           It's like a storm, isn't it?  This raging
           force that you can't control does
           whatever it wants, and the best you can
           do is survive.  A winner survives.

                     TALLEY
           Why...?

The question being:  Why aren't I dead?  Why aren't you
killing me?

                     MARION
           What good would it do to kill you?  The
           police already have the disk.

Marion considers Talley another moment --

                     MARION (CONT'D)
           Your wife is a very nice lady.

Marion goes to his car.  He helps out Jane and Amanda, then
gets into his car and drives away.

EXT. THE PARKING LOT -- SUNRISE

Talley stumbles out of the room and runs to his family.  He
scoops up Jane and Amanda, hugging them tightly as the camera 
pulls up and away, rising, leaving this reunited family as
Marion Clewes disappears like a passing thunderhead --

CLOSING CREDITS

The credits roll to black, then--

EXT. SONNY BENZA'S HOME -- DAWN

The garage door slides up.  Benza backs out in his Mercedes,
then roars to the front door.  He pops the trunk, then gets
out and hurries to the front door.  He sticks his head inside
and calls to his wife --

                     BENZA
           The fucking jet's waiting!  Would you get
           your shit out here?!

He picks up two bags from inside the door and brings them to
the car --

AT THE TRUNK

Benza steps behind the raised trunk to put away his bags.
When he steps back around again, a nondescript sedan is
waiting in the drive --

                     A VOICE
           No fuckups allowed.

Gunfire erupts on the quiet ridge above Palm Springs.

FADE OUT

                                                 May 5th, 2014


                         

           EXT. OPEN SEA - DAY


                         
           Hiccup and Toothless BLUR PAST, leaving a wake that leads...                         

                         

           EXT. BERK - DAY

           (Sequence 0200 - New Berk)
           To the island village of Berk, festively adorned with flags
           and banners. Major new additions alter its familiar skyline.

           HICCUP (V.O.)
           This... is Berk. The best kept
           secret this side of, well,
           anywhere. Granted, it may not look
           like much, but this wet heap of
           rock packs more than a few
           surprises.

          ON A CLUSTER OF SHEEP, hiding nervously between buildings as
          shadows of passing dragons race by. The group moves as one,
          receding into a shadowy alley, pushing one sheep out into the
          light. It's suddenly snatched and carried into the air!

                         

           HICCUP (V.O.)
           Life here is amazing, just not for
           the faint of heart. See, where most
           folks enjoy hobbies like whittling
           or needlepoint, we Berkians prefer
           a little something we like to call--

          WHOOSH, WHOOSH, WHOOSH! A wash of VIBRANT COLORS blurs by.
          DRAGONS BARREL PAST at a dizzying speed. Their RIDERS SWIPE,
          KICK, and ROLL into one another while they WEAVE neck in neck
          between the houses, docks, and revamped structures of Berk.

           HICCUP (V.O.)

           DRAGON RACING!

          It's like an aerial version of the Monte Carlo race.
          Spectators ROAR from wooden bleachers, fastened to cliff
          faces and perched over the sea.

                         
          FISHLEGS, now 20 and even larger, rides his gronkle, MEATLUG,
          who carries the sheep in her claws, until...

                         
          SNOTLOUT, also 20, but every bit as juvenile, and his
          Monstrous Nightmare, HOOKFANG, steal the sheep from them.
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 2.

                         

                         

                          SNOTLOUT
           Oh, I'm sorry, Fishlegs! Did you
           want that?

                         

                          FISHLEGS
           Snotlout! That's mine!
          Snotlout FALLS BACK toward RUFFNUT and TUFFNUT, who lag on
          their two-headed Zippleback, BARF & BELCH.

                          SNOTLOUT
           Here ya go, babe.
          With a chivalrous grin, Snotlout tosses the sheep to Ruffnut.
          She SNATCHES it with a sneer and a GRUMBLE.

                          SNOTLOUT (CONT'D)
           Did I tell you that you look
           amazing today? `Cause you do.

                          RUFFNUT
           Come on, Barf. It's starting to
           stink around here.
          Barf starts to peel off, spewing gas. Tuffnut mocks Snotlout
          with a mugging grin.

                          TUFFNUT
           Nope. Still hates you. Let's blow
           this place, Belch!
          Belch ignites the gas, sparking a flashy explosion, and
          leaving Snotlout behind in the smoke.
          As they rush past the main bleachers, Ruffnut DROPS her sheep
          into one of five baskets suspended over a chasm at the lap
          crossing. Each backboard bears an image of its corresponding
          dragon. The Barf/Belch basket filled to the brim with sheep.
          Presiding over the game, STOICK turns to the frenzied crowd.

                          STOICK
           That's nine for the Twins, Astrid
           lags with three, Fishlegs and
           Snotlout trail with NONE!
          Stoick eyes an empty basket at the far end, its backboard
          painted with an image of Toothless.

                         

                          STOICK (CONT'D)
           And Hiccup is... nowhere to be
           found. Hmmm.
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 3.

                         

                         

                          GOBBER
           Scared him off with the big talk,
           didn't ya, Stoick?
          WHACK! Snotlout, still smoldering from the blast, gets
          CLIPPED from behind. ASTRID, rolls in, astride STORMFLY --
          spirited and competitive as ever, and beautiful despite
          herself.

                          ASTRID
           What are you doing, Snotlout?!
           They're going to win now!

                          SNOTLOUT
           She's my princess! Whatever she
           wants, she gets.

                          ASTRID
           Ruffnut?! Didn't she try to bury
           you alive?!

                         

                          SNOTLOUT
           Only for a few hours!
          BACK TO THE RACERS, as they peel away, pouring on the speed.

           HICCUP (V.O.)
           Dragons used to be a bit of a
           problem here. But that was five
           years ago. Now they've all moved
           in. And, really, why wouldn't they?
          The racers chase each other through a sprawling hangar and
          into a vast cave, teeming with colorfully painted dragon
          stables. They exit through the far side and circle back
          through the village, blasting past many of its dragon-
          friendly additions.

           HICCUP (V.O.)
           We have custom stables... all-you-
           can-eat feeding stations... a full
           service dragon wash...

                         
          In the village, a baby Gronkle sneezes, accidentally setting
          one of the Viking houses aflame.

           HICCUP (V.O.)
           Even top-of-the-line fire
           prevention, if I do say so myself.
          Astrid rolls her eyes, peels away from the other dragon
          racers, and yanks open a spout on the overhead network of
          aqueducts, dousing the flames with a surge of water.
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 4.

                         

                         
          BACK TO STOICK, amused as he watches the racers round the
          island, searching for sheep. He turns to Gobber and nods.

                         

                          STOICK
           It's time, Gobber.

                         

                          GOBBER
           Righty-ho!
           (aloud, to the crowd)
           Last lap!
          A HORN sounds. The racers all turn to each other, excited.

                          ASTRID
           The black sheep! Come on, Stormfly!
           We can still win this thing!

                         

                          RUFFNUT
           Come on, Barf!

                         

                          TUFFNUT
           Let's go!

                         

                          FISHLEGS
           Go, Meatlug!
          GOBBER loads the BLACK SHEEP onto a catapult.

                         

                          GOBBER
           This is your big moment. Have a
           nice flight!

                         
          He pulls the trigger, LAUNCHING the black sheep into the air.
          Astrid spots it and steers Stormfly into a steep climb toward
          it.

                         

                          ASTRID
           Up, up, up!
          In a flash, Fishlegs and Meatlug blur past, NABBING the
          sheep.

                          ASTRID (CONT'D)
           No!

                          FISHLEGS
           Good job, Meatlug!
          Fishlegs tosses his captured prize to Ruffnut.

                          FISHLEGS (CONT'D)
           Here you go, darling. Mine's worth
           ten!
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 5.

                         

                         

                          RUFFNUT
           Yeah! The Black Sheep!
          Snotlout sighs, frustrated.

                          ASTRID
           You guys are fighting for Ruffnut?!

                          RUFFNUT
           I'm totally winning!

                         
          Fishlegs hovers up nest to Ruffnut with a starry-eyed smile.

                         

                          FISHLEGS
           We're winning together!
          She RAMS BARF into Meatlug, sending Fishlegs into an
          uncontrolled SPIN. He SLAMS into Snotlout, sending their
          dragons TUMBLING head over tail. The crowd goes wild.

                          RUFFNUT
           No one can stop me now!

                          TUFFNUT
           Except for me. We're attached,
           genius!

                         
          He GRABS at the sheep. Ruffnut fights back, inciting a tug-of-
          war.

                          TUFFNUT (CONT'D)
           Quit trying to steal all my glory!
          And while they're distracted, Astrid steers Stormfly toward
          them, CLOSING IN.

                         

                          STOICK
           Get `em, Astrid!

                         

                          TUFFNUT RUFFNUT
          It's MY glory! No sheep, no You're always ruining
          glory! EVERYTHING!
          Astrid leaps off of Stormfly, runs up Belch's spindly neck,
          and PLUCKS the black sheep from the Twins' hands.

                          ASTRID
           Gotcha!

                         
          She tumbles through the air onto Stormfly, sticking a perfect
          landing, black sheep in hand.

                         

                          RUFFNUT
           Astrid!
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 6.

                         

                         

                         
          BACK TO STOICK, beside himself. The crowd ROARS.

                         

                          STOICK
           Well played! Hahaha!
           (gloating, to the crowd)
           That's my future daughter-in-law!

          BACK TO ASTRID ON STORMFLY
          eyeing the fast-approaching FINISH LINE, unaware as...
          FISHLEGS suddenly RAMS Meatlug into Stormfly, sending Astrid
          off-course. She recovers and sees Snotlout flying headlong
          toward her, war hammer cocked, aiming at Astrid.

                          SNOTLOUT
           Uh, excuse me.

                          ASTRID
           Stormfly!
          Snotlout HURLS his hammer. Astrid ducks and rolls Stormfly
          out of the way. The hammer catches Fishlegs in the face with
          a CLANG. The crowd collectively winces.

                         
          Astrid and Stormfly recover from their roll, loop over the
          water, and they BLAST past the finish line, DUNKING the black
          sheep into their basket!

                         

                          STOICK
           That's thirteen! Astrid takes the
           game!
          The crowd COMES UNHINGED. Astrid flies over the crowd,
          basking in her victory.

           HICCUP (V.O.)
           Yep. Berk is pretty much perfect.
           All of my hard work has paid off.
           And it's a good thing, too, because
           with Vikings on the backs of
           dragons, the world just got a whole
           lot bigger.

                         

          EXT. OPEN SKY/ISLAND COASTLINE - DAY

          (Scene 0300 - AWOL Part One)
          A boundless sky. Vast. Clear. Crisp. And from it, a BLACK
          SPECK rockets across the horizon. The image of unbridled
          freedom.
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 7.

                         

                         
          Tucked into his riding position, HICCUP appears to be part of
          TOOTHLESS. They dip, roll and dive, over a sea teeming with
          Thunderdrums, pulling off daring maneuvers with honed
          refinement, making them seem effortless.

                          HICCUP
           Yeah!
          They jackknife, heading skyward, rolling and tumbling through
          the ethereal cloud-scapes and joining high-flying Timberjacks
          as they soar in formation.
          Hiccup is bound head-to-toe in a snug, aerodynamic flight
          suit -- an asymmetrical, functional design of leather and
          articulated plates. It has an air of Viking bike leather.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           What do you think, bud? Wanna give
           this another shot?

                         
          Toothless grumbles in protest.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Toothless! It'll be fine.
          With a click of a lever, he LOCKS the pedals in the flared
          tail position. Hiccup then unhooks himself from the saddle.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Ready?
          Toothless SNORTS unenthusiastically.
          Suddenly, Hiccup SLIDES OFF of Toothless, peeling away from
          him like a skydiver from a plane, YELLING as he plummets.

                         
          Toothless dives after him. They spiral through the air, face-
          to-face. Toothless is having fun, despite himself.
          Hiccup slips his forearms through a pair of tucked leather
          flaps... and YANKS, unfurling SHEETS OF LEATHER as he extends
          his arms. They catch the wind, SNAPPING OPEN like WINGS...
          and sending him GLIDING -- out of control, at first, then
          stabilizing. The turbulence buffets his flight suit heavily.
          But he's flying!
          Toothless unfolds his wings, too, catching up with Hiccup.
          The freedom is palpable. Hiccup and Toothless are, for the
          moment, the same. Feeling the same rush of adrenaline.
          Independently together.
          They PLUNGE past cloud formations, splitting apart then
          crossing paths again.
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 8.

                         

                         
          Impressive as it is, Hiccup is gliding at a steep angle.
          Toothless launches fireballs ahead of Hiccup, boosting him
          higher with the expanding heat bursts.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           This is amazing!
          A cloud layer washes past, exposing a towering ROCK
          FORMATION, dead ahead.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           No longer amazing! Toothless!
          Hiccup tries to steer himself away, to no avail.
          Toothless POURS ON THE SPEED, trying to catch Hiccup as he
          HURTLES toward collision. His locked tail makes maneuvering
          difficult. He's UNABLE TO PULL UP at a steep enough angle.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Oh, no!
          At the last second, Toothless BLASTS the jagged rocks just
          ahead of Hiccup, then WRAPS Hiccup in his wings as they fly
          through it. The obliterated peak rains down around them.
          Toothless emerges through the cloud of debris and HURTLES
          into the trees of a neighboring peak. They tumble down the
          uneven terrain, coming to rest on a small plateau.
          Hiccup emerges from the cocoon of Toothless' wings. He
          switches his prosthetic riding foot to his walking foot and
          stows his leather wings.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           That really came out of nowhere.
          The blown up sea stack collapses.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           We gotta work on your solo gliding
           there, bud. That locked-up tail
           makes for some pretty sloppy rescue
           maneuvers, eh?
          Hiccup reels in his dorsal fin and removes his helmet,
          revealing a 20 year old Hiccup framed by wild hair, complete
          with a Viking braid.
          He walks to the edge of the cliff, taking in the NEW LAND
          stretching off into the horizon, its tall cliffs and sea-
          stacks adorned with swaying gold birch trees basking in the
          dappled afternoon sunlight.
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 9.

                         

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Looks like we found another one,
           bud.
          Toothless FUSSES and SNORTS, not amused, shaking off dust and
          pebbles like a wet dog.
          Hiccup flinches as a pebble WHACKS him on the back of the
          head. He looks back to Toothless, who averts his eyes.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Oh, what? Do you want an apology?
           Is that why you're pouting, big
           baby boo? Well... try this on!
          Hiccup TACKLES Toothless and tries to put him in a headlock.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Ya feeling it yet? Huh? Picking up
           on all my heartfelt remorse?
          Toothless simply stands on his hind legs, lifting Hiccup off
          of his flailing feet and dangling him over the cliff's edge.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Oh, come on. You wouldn't hurt a

                          ONE-LEGGED--

                         
          Hiccup looks down, seeing the precipitous drop below.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           You're right! You're right! You
           win! You win!
          WHAM! Toothless flips him over, pinning him to the ground.
          Hiccup squirms, throwing mock punches. Toothless playfully
          retaliates with feline taps to Hiccup's head.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           He's down! And it's ugly! Dragons
           and Vikings, enemies again, locked
           in combat to the bitter -- URFFF!
          Toothless rests his head on Hiccup -- SQUEEZING THE AIR out
          of him. Toothless then suddenly starts grooming Hiccup,
          lapping at his face and covering him in slobber.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Gaaaaagh!

                         
          Hiccup fights to get free, finally springing to his feet and
          shaking off the viscous saliva.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           You KNOW that doesn't wash out.

                         
          Toothless LAUGHS, pleased with himself.

                         
          Shifting his attention back to the new land stretched out
          before them, Hiccup reaches beneath his chest plate and
          produces a leather-bound book.

                         
          He unfurls it to reveal an EXPLORERS MAP, modified with added
          strips in every direction to accommodate their ever-expanding
          world. Drawings indicate new lands, new tribes, and many new
          dragons.
          Hiccup peels a fresh strip of paper from a hidden fold in his
          flight suit and holds it out for Toothless to lick.
          Hiccup affixes the moistened strip to the map's outer edge,
          then whittles a pencil and consults a compass affixed to his
          forearm.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           So what should we name it?
          Toothless GURGLES as he gnaws under his wing, preoccupied.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           "Itchy Armpit" it is.
          Hiccup carefully draws the new island's outline.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Whaddya reckon, bud? Think we might
           find a few Timberjacks in those
           woods? The odd Whispering Death or
           two in the rocks? Who knows...
           maybe we'll finally track down
           another Night Fury.

                          (BEAT)
           Wouldn't that be something?

                          (BURDENED)
           So, whaddya say? Just keep going?
          Toothless' ear plates suddenly SHOOT UP. He ROARS, and his
          call is answered by a familiar SCREECH. Hiccup turns to
          see...

          ASTRID rising into view, astride Stormfly. Stormfly grabs
          talon-fulls of rock to slow her landing.

           `Afternoon m'lady. Where have you
           been?

                         
          Astrid dismounts and throws back her fur hood as Toothless
          rushes up to greet them.

                         

                          ASTRID
           Winning races. What else? The real
           question is... where have YOU been?

                         

                          HICCUP
           Avoiding my dad.

                         

                          ASTRID
           Oh, no. What happened now?

                         
          Astrid sits beside Hiccup, inspecting his latest addition to
          the map. Behind them, Toothless greets Stormfly, inciting a
          play fight.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Oh, you're gonna love this. I wake
           up. The sun's shining. Terrible
           Terrors are singing on the rooftop.
           I saunter down to breakfast,
           thinking all is right with the
           world, and I get...

                         
          He gets to his feet and puffs out his chest.

           ... Son, we need to talk.

                         
          Astrid smiles and adopts Hiccup's sloppy slouch.

                          ASTRID

                          (APING HICCUP)
           Not now, Dad. I've got a whole day
           of goofing off to get started.

                         
          Hiccup breaks character, grimacing at her impression of him.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Okay, first of all, I don't sound
           like that. What is this character?
           And second... what is that thing
           you're doing with my shoulders?

                         
          Astrid laughs, jostling her shoulders in an awkward way.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           A truly flattering impersonation.
           Anyway, he goes...
           (resuming Stoick's brogue)
           You're the pride of Berk, son, and
           I couldn't be prouder...

                         

                          ASTRID
           (continuing her impression

                          OF HICCUP)
           Aw, thanks, Dad. I'm pretty
           impressed with myself, too.

                         

                          HICCUP
           WHEN have I ever done that with my
           hands?

                         

                          ASTRID
           You just did.

                         
          She laughs, playfully.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Okay... just...
           (holding her arms, mock-

                          STERN)
           Hold still. It's very serious.

                         
          She giggles, trying to hold a straight face.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           (resuming Stoick's brogue)
           You're all grown up, and since no
           chief could ask for a better
           successor, I've decided--

                         
          Astrid straightens, her face brightening.

                          ASTRID
           --TO MAKE YOU CHIEF! Oh, my gods!

                         
          She jumps to her feet, beaming...

                         

                          ASTRID (CONT'D)
           Hiccup, that's amazing!

                         
          And socks Hiccup in congratulations, deliberately hitting the
          dorsal fin release button and triggering it to pop up. She
          laughs as Hiccup reels it back in, self-consciously.

          They're suddenly BOWLED OVER by Toothless and Stormfly.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Yeah, so... this is what I'm
           dealing with.

                         
          Astrid helps him up and dusts him off.

                         

                          ASTRID

                          (EXCITED)
           What did you tell him?

                         

                          HICCUP
           I didn't. By the time he turned
           around, I was gone.

                         
          Astrid picks up the map, folding it as she paces around him,
          processing it all.

                         

                          ASTRID
           Well, it's a lot of responsibility.
           The map will have to wait for sure,
           and I'll need to fly Toothless,
           since you'll be too busy...

                         
          She pauses, wincing in sympathy. She turns to Hiccup. He nods
          knowingly, taking the map from her.

                         

                          HICCUP
           It's not me, Astrid. All those
           speeches, and planning, and running
           the village... that's his thing.

                         

                          ASTRID
           I think you're missing the point. I
           mean, chief. What an honor. I'd be
           pretty excited.
          Hiccup shakes his head.

                         

                          HICCUP
           I'm not like you. You know exactly
           who you are. You always have.
           But...

                         
          He shuffles to the cliff's edge, gazing out at the new land.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           I'm still looking. I know that I'm
           not my father... and I never met my
           mother... so, what does that make
           me?

          He sits at the edge, looking burdened, restless. Astrid
          approaches and settles beside him, joining him in looking out
          at the distant horizon. She weaves another braid into his
          hair as she speaks.

                         

                          ASTRID
           What you're searching for... isn't
           out there, Hiccup.

                         
          She places a hand on his chest.

                         

                          ASTRID (CONT'D)
           It's in here.

                          (BEAT)
           Maybe you just don't see it yet.

                         
          She kisses his cheek, but gets a mouthful of Toothless'
          slobber. She grimaces, wiping it off.

                         
          Distracted, Hiccup eyes the horizon keenly.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Maybe. But, y'know... there is
           something out there.

                          (EXASPERATED)
           Hiccup...

                         
          He turns her face to the horizon. A distant smoke plume rises
          from a misty valley.

          (Scene 0400 - Shot Down!)
          Hiccup and Toothless fly over the fjord, winding deep through
          undulating crimson and gold forests.

                         
          Astrid and Stormfly catch up as the autumn colors suddenly
          give way to charred timbers. They fly deeper, through ash and
          wafting smoke. Ahead, in a sheltered harbor, an explosion of
          ice stands as an eerie marker of what used to be a TRAPPER'S

          FORT.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Stay close.

                         
          They fly through the suspended remains of the buildings,
          splintered, and frozen in mid-destruction.

           What happened here?

          It's at once harrowing and puzzling. Toothless spots an
          enormous DRAGON FOOTPRINT in the muddy shoreline below,
          leaving him uneasy.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Easy, bud.

                         
          As they crest the ice formations, Astrid spots a CREW OF MEN
          at the stern of a moored ship below.

                         

                          ASTRID
           Hiccup!

                         

           ERET (O.S.)
           Fire!

                         
          The men fire a stern-mounted cannon. The projectile unfurls
          into a NET. Hiccup and Toothless dart out of its way.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Astrid! Look out!

                         
          It HITS Stormfly, TANGLING her wings and causing her to spin
          uncontrolled. Astrid struggles to free her as they HURTLE
          toward a collision.

                         

                          ASTRID

           HICCUP!

                         
          Astrid falls off of Stormfly, but Toothless SNATCHES her at
          the last second.

                         
          Stormfly hits the ground, tangled in the net. Trappers rush
          out of hiding, piling onto her with ropes and weapons. She
          whips her tail, sending spikes flying.

                         

                          ERET
           Watch the tail!

                         
          A large, raven-haired trapper lunges over the spray of spikes
          and lands upon Stormfly's head, twisting it and taking her
          down like a rodeo cowboy.

                         

                          ERET (CONT'D)
           Tie those legs up!

                         
          Eret deftly ties her gnashing jaws shut, wrangling her into
          submission -- clearly a pro among pros. He looks up,
          revealing a handsome face and gleaming, intelligent eyes that
          search the sky as Toothless' tell-tale BANSHEE scream rings
          out.

                         

                          ERET (CONT'D)
           Is that what I think it is?
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 16.

                         

                         
          Toothless suddenly streaks across the sky, banking and
          landing with a FEROCIOUS ROAR.

                         

                          HICCUP

           STOP!

                         

                          ASTRID

           STORMFLY!
           (to the trappers)
           What are you doing?

                         
          Astrid and Hiccup leap off of Toothless, rushing toward
          Stormfly.

                         
          Eret's men immediately draw weapons. Hiccup extends and
          ignites his DRAGON BLADE -- a telescoping fiery sword --
          impressive enough to wow Eret's men.

                         

                          ERET
           Back again?

                         
          Eret steps forward, focused only on Toothless.

                         

                          ERET (CONT'D)
           Soil my britches... that is a Night
           Fury. Thought they were all gone
           for good.
           (to his fellow trappers)
           Looks like our luck's had a turn
           for the better, lads! Don't think
           Drago has one of those in his
           dragon army.

                         
          His men sound out in agreement. Hiccup eyes Astrid, confused.

                         

                          ASTRID
           Dragon army?

                          HICCUP
           Look, we don't want any trouble.

                         

                          ERET
           Ha! You should've thought of that
           before you stole all of our dragons
           and blasted our fort to bits!

                         

                          HICCUP
           Wait...

                         

                          ASTRID
           What are you talking about?

                         
          Astrid and Hiccup take in the icy destruction, putting it
          together.
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 17.

                         

                         

                          HICCUP
           You think we did this?

                         

                          ERET
           Dragon trapping is hard enough work
           as it is, without do-gooder dragon
           riders sneaking in to rescue them.

                         

                          HICCUP
           What do-gooder -- there are other
           dragon riders?

                         

                          ERET
           You mean, other than your thieving
           friend from last night? You tell
           me.

                         
          Eret approaches. Toothless snarls, protectively.

                         

                          ERET (CONT'D)
           You may have an ice-spitting dragon
           on your side, but we still have a
           quota to fill. How do you suppose
           we explain this mess to Drago
           Bludvist?

                         

                          HICCUP
           Drago what-fist? Does anything you
           say make sense?

                         

                          TEENY
           He's expecting a new shipment of
           dragons for his army by tomorrow.

                         

                          NO-NAME
           And Drago don't take well to
           excuses.
          Eret parts his tunic, revealing a large branding-iron scar on
          his torso, in the shape of a dragon skull, split by a sword.

                         

                          ERET
           This is what he gave me last time I
           showed up empty-handed. He promised
           to be far less understanding in the
           future.

                         

                          HICCUP

                          (EXASPERATED)
           Look, we don't know anything about
           a dragon thief, or an ice-spitting
           dragon, or your lunatic boss and
           his dragon army, okay?

           Just give us back our dragon, and
           we'll go, strange, hostile person
           whom we've never met.

                         
          Eret bows playfully.

                         

                          ERET
           Oh, where are my manners? I'm Eret.
           Son of Eret. Finest dragon trapper
           alive.

                         
          He pulls a dagger from behind his back, waving it cockily.
          His men ready their weapons and net cannons.

                         

                          ERET (CONT'D)
           After all, it's not just anyone who
           can capture a Night Fury.

                         
          Toothless ROARS a warning.

                         

                          HICCUP
           And this is Toothless. He says
           we're going. Now.

                         

                          ERET
           Heh. They all say that.

                          (BEAT)

           RUSH `EM, LADS!

                         
          Eret lunges toward them. Toothless BLASTS, bringing down a
          massive spire of ice. It shatters as it hits the ground,
          forcing Eret and his men to dive out of the way.

                         
          Making quick use of the distraction, Hiccup re-ignites his
          dragon blade and slashes through the ropes binding Stormfly.

                         

                          ASTRID
           Stormfly! C'mon, go! Go!

                         
          Eret gets to his feet in time to see Toothless and Stormfly
          take to the air, carrying Hiccup and Astrid out of reach of
          the volley of arrows.

                         

                          ERET

           YOU WILL NEVER HOLD ON TO THOSE

           DRAGONS, YOU HEAR ME?! DRAGO IS

           COMING FOR THEM ALL!

          The GANG joyrides past GOTHI'S house, scattering her
          assortment of terrible terrors. She waves a fist at them as
          they sweep past, WHOOPING AND CHORTLING, leading us down
          to...

                         
          THE UPPER PLAZA, where a GATHERED CROWD of Vikings and their
          dragons are cued up outside of Gobber's BLACKSMITH STALL,
          awaiting their turns. Stoick maneuvers through the crowd,
          spouting JOVIAL GREETINGS in passing.

                         
          He makes a bee-line for GOBBER, who is busily grinding a
          metal dragon tooth into shape. A Zippleback waits patiently,
          his head cocked open like a car hood while the other head
          watches, sympathetically.

                         

                          STOICK
           Any sign of him?

                         
          Gobber flips up his welding guard, revealing a matching area
          of unsoiled skin.

                         

                          GOBBER
           Ah, he's probably flown off the
           edge of the world by now. You sure
           you want that kid running the
           village? You can still delay your
           retirement.

                         

                          STOICK
           Oh, he's ready. You'll see.

                         
          A SUDDEN EXCITEMENT in the crowd heralds Hiccup and Astrid's
          return. They touch down on Toothless and Stormfly.

                         

                          STOICK (CONT'D)
           Haha! There he is!
           (to Gobber, proving his

                          POINT)
           Huh? The pride of Berk!

                         
          Hiccup stows his helmet and heads toward Stoick with urgency.

                         

                          GOBBER
           Who finally decided to show up for
           work. Yay.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Sorry. Got held up.
           (privately, to Stoick)
           Hey, Dad, could I have a word?

                         

                          STOICK
           Something you're itching to tell
           me?

                          HICCUP
           Not quite the itch you're thinking
           of, but yes.

                         
          Stoick hands him an apron and guides him to the front desk.

                         

                          STOICK
           Good man! Now, lesson one. A
           chief's first duty is to his
           people. So...

                         
          Stoick changes the rune on the "being served" placard.

                         

                          STOICK (CONT'D)
           Forty one? Forty --

                         

                          HICCUP
           Could we just talk in private for--

                         

                          STARKARD
           --That's me! That's me! I'm next!
           (pushing his way through)
           I was ahead of you! Excuse me, I've
           been here all day!

                         
          STARKARD reaches the counter, giddy with excitement.

                         

                          STARKARD (CONT'D)
           Okay, I want one of those high
           seaters, with lots of spikes and a
           big stowage compartment.

                         

                          STOICK
           Absolutely! You got it, sir!

                         
          Stoick spins Hiccup around, steering him back into the shop.

                          HICCUP
           Dad, this is actually a little more
           important than building saddles.

                         

                          STOICK
           Ah-ah! Lesson two. No task is too
           small when it comes to serving your
           people. Excuse us, Grump.

                         
          They step over the tail of a large, snoring oaf of a dragon,
          stirring him awake with a fussy start.

                         

                          GOBBER
           Grump! You let the forge die down
           again!
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 21.

                         

                         
          Grump coughs a slug of molten lava into the forge. It
          splatters everywhere, igniting a rash of fires. Hiccup side-
          steps them as he gathers materials in the back of the stall.
          Gobber pulls the fire extinguisher, dumping water everywhere.

                         

                          GOBBER (CONT'D)
           That's it, Grump. You're going up
           for adoption!

                         
          Stoick fills a toolbox with tools from Hiccup's workbench.

                         

                          STOICK
           One of these. And this...

                         

                          HICCUP

                          DAD --

                         

                          STOICK
           -- There you go! Go on. Have away.

                         

                          HICCUP
           But, seriously, I really need to
           tell you about this new land we
           came across.

                         

                          GOBBER
           Another one?!

                         
          Fishlegs walks in, followed by the Twins and Snotlout.

                         

                          FISHLEGS
           Any new dragons?

                         
          Stoick slaps a sheet of leather onto a dragon mold, and hands
          Hiccup pencil. Exasperated, Hiccup begins tracing an outline
          as he speaks.

                          HICCUP
           We didn't stick around to find out.
           These folks weren't particularly
           friendly.

                         

                          GOBBER
           Oh, really? Your Night Fury and
           Deadly Nadder didn't bring them
           cheering to the rooftops?

                         
          Gobber spins his prosthetic arm dispenser.

                         

                          HICCUP
           No, this was different. Not the
           standard run-for-the-hills hoo-ha
           I've come to enjoy. These guys were
           trappers. Dragon trappers.

                          ASTRID
           You should've seen their fort. All
           blown apart and stuck in giant
           spikes of ice. It was weird.

                         

                          HICCUP
           I've never seen anything like it.
           And worst of all, they thought we
           did it!

                         
          Gobber pops off his prosthetic tongs and selects a wire brush
          from his dispenser...

                         

                          GOBBER
           Y'know, you two are gonna get
           yourselves in SERIOUS trouble one
           of these days. Not everyone
           appreciates this way of life.

                         
          Which he uses to brush his mustache and eyebrows.

                         
          Stoick takes the sheet of leather to the table saw...

                         

                          STOICK
           Gobber's right, son. Best we keep
           to our own. Besides, you'll have
           more important uses for your time --

                         
          And pulls a lever, starting it up.

                         

                          STOICK (CONT'D)
           (sing-songy, under his

                          BREATH)
           Once we make the big announcement!

                         
          Hiccup pulls the lever, shutting the saw down.

                          HICCUP
           They are building a dragon army.

                         
          Silence fills the stall. Vikings exchange worried glances.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Or at least the guy they work for
           is. Dargo Bloody Fist or something.

                         
          Stoick's eyes widen. He turns to Gobber, with growing alarm.

                         

                          TUFFNUT
           I'll bloody his fist with my face
           if he tries to take my dragon!

                         

                          RUFFNUT
           Or mine.

                          TUFFNUT
           You're such a moron.

                         

                          FISHLEGS
           A beautiful moron.

                         

                          SNOTLOUT
           Yeah...

                         
          Ruffnut grumbles, revolted by their advances.

                         
          Stoick grabs Hiccup by the shoulders, wide-eyed and intense.

                         

                          STOICK
           Bludvist? Drago Bludvist?

                         

                          HICCUP
           Uh, yeah. Wait. You know him?

                         

                         

          INT. BERK - DRAGON STABLES - MOMENTS LATER


                         
          Stoick rushes down a circular stone staircase into the vast,
          bustling cave that houses the dragon stables.

                         

                          STOICK

           GROUND ALL DRAGONS!

                         

                          HICCUP
           What? Why?!

                         
          Hiccup, Astrid, Gobber, and Toothless chase after Stoick.

                         

                          STOICK

           SEAL THE GATES! LOWER THE STORM

           DOORS!

                          HICCUP
           Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait! What is
           happening?

                         

                          GOBBER
           You heard the man! Lock it down!

                         
          Behind him, the massive storm doors rattle as they're
          lowered.

                         

                          STOICK
           No DRAGON or VIKING sets foot off
           this island until I give the word!

                          HICCUP
           Because some guy you knew is
           stirring up trouble in some faraway
           land?

                         
          Stoick turns to Hiccup, gravely serious.

                         

                          STOICK
           Because Drago Bludvist is a madman.
           Without conscience or mercy. And if
           he's built a dragon army... gods
           help us all.

                         
          Stoick continues on shouting orders, leaving Hiccup stewing.

                         

                          STOICK (CONT'D)
           Get them into their pens! Quickly!

                         
          Hiccup chases around to confront Stoick.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Then let's ride back out there.
           We'll follow those trappers to
           Drago and talk some sense into him.

                         

                          STOICK
           No. We fortify the island.

                         

                          HICCUP
           It's our duty to keep the peace!

                         

                          STOICK
           Peace is over, Hiccup. I must
           prepare you for war.

                         

                          HICCUP
           War? Dad, if Drago's coming for our
           dragons, we can't wait around for
           him to get here. Let's go find him
           and change his mind.

                         

                          STOICK
           Some minds won't be changed,
           Hiccup. Berk is what you need to
           worry about.

                          (BEAT)
           A chief protects his own.

                         
          Stoick heads off, calling out more orders...

                         

                          STOICK (CONT'D)

           SECURE THE STABLES! LATCH EVERY

          ... leaving Hiccup eyeing Toothless as the storm doors close.
          Astrid approaches him, seeing the determination on his face.

                         

                          ASTRID
           Hiccup, don't.

                         

                          HICCUP
           I have to.

                         
          He gives her a quick peck on the cheek.

                         

                          STOICK

           THIS WAY! QUICKLY!

                         
          Hiccup and Toothless BLAST PAST, heading for the exit.

                         

                          STOICK (CONT'D)

           HICCUP!

                         
          They try to fly through one door, but it seals shut.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Come on!

                         
          Toothless spins around and DIVES through the gap in the
          second lowering storm door.

                         

                          STOICK
           Hiccup!

                         
          Astrid and Stormfly blow past Stoick and slip through the
          storm door before it shuts, leaving Stoick fuming.

                         

                         

          EXT. OPEN SEA - MIDDAY


                         
          (Scene 0700 - Eret's Lesson)
          Eret's ship carves a defiant path North, leaving the last
          glimpses of Lapland in its wake.

                         
          Eret stands on the bowsprit, eyeing the waves intently,
          searching the surface. He turns toward the deck, where his
          crewmen man the gunwale cannons, sights trained to the sky.

                         

                          ERET
           Keep your eyes peeled, lads! With
           this wind, we'll reach Drago by
           daybreak, so best we fill this ship
           up with dragons and quick! It's no
           time to be picky. Not if we want to
           keep our --
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 26.

                         

                         

                          UG
           Uh... Eret?

                         
          Eret turns in the direction Ug is pointing to see a pair of
          dragons flapping toward them.

                         

                          ERET

           HEADS! OFF THE PORT QUARTER!

                         
          The crewmen swing the net cannons toward the back-lit,
          silhouetted dragons, drawing ever closer.

                         

                          ERET (CONT'D)
           Net `em, lads! Take `em down!

                         
          Eret loads a cannon and takes aim. He spots Hiccup and Astrid
          riding the dragons. His eyes narrow, determined.

                         

                          ERET (CONT'D)
           You're not getting away this time.

                         
          Nets fly through the air. Hiccup and Astrid outmaneuver them
          and dive toward the ship, landing on the deck with a clatter.

                         

                          ERET (CONT'D)
           And here I was worried we might
           turn up empty-handed.

                         
          Astrid brandishes her axe in invitation. Hiccup indicates for
          her to lower it, then holds up his hands in surrender.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Nope. It's your lucky day. We give
           up.

                         
          Eret's crew exchange confused stares. As does Astrid.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           That's one Night Fury, one Deadly
           Nadder, and...

                         
          He dismounts Toothless and tosses a net over Astrid.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           ... two of the finest dragon riders
           west of Luk Tuk. That oughtta make
           the boss happy, right?

                         
          Astrid grumbles. He takes her axe, hands it to Eret, and
          escorts Astrid past the men to the open live well.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Excuse us.

          He leads Astrid down the ladder. She glares at him, plainly
          hating the plan.

                         

                          ASTRID
           What are you doing?

                         
          Toothless tries to follow them, but Hiccup holds him back.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Toothless, stay.

                         
          Hiccup flips the latch, lowering the grate as Eret watches,
          confounded.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           The dragons don't really care for
           cramped spaces, so they'll just
           hang out with you. They won't be
           any trouble.

                         
          Eret's men nervously direct their swords and spears toward
          Toothless. HE SNARLS.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Unless you do that. Wooden boat,
           big ocean. How's your swimming?

                         

                          NO-NAME
           Not good.

                         
          A burst of flame erupts from the live well, causing the
          crewmen to jump back. Hiccup thrusts his Dragon Blade through
          the grate.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Oops. Almost forgot. Can't have
           armed prisoners!

                          ASTRID
           How is this a plan?

                         
          He retracts the blade and offers it up. A crewman cautiously
          takes it, looking it over. The pommel of the hilt is
          expelling green gas.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Just what every dragon trapper
           needs. One end coats the blade in
           Monstrous Nightmare saliva. The
           other sprays Hideous Zippleback
           gas. All it takes is a spark and...

                         
          A curious crewman clicks the lighter, igniting the gas.
          Hiccup ducks as the sudden explosion sweeps over the deck.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Oh, yeah, there you go!

                         
          Toothless paws at the embers.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Once they see you as one of their
           own, even the testiest dragons can
           be trained, right, bud?

                         
          Toothless gurgles and falls over.

                         

                          ERET
           Give me that!

                         
          Eret snatches the dragon blade and HURLS it overboard.
          Stormfly bolts after it...

                         

                          ERET (CONT'D)
           What game are you playing?

                         

                          HICCUP
           No game. We just want to meet
           Drago.

                         
          And returns in a flash, dropping it at Eret's feet like a
          fetching dog, tongue wagging. Eret throws it again,
          frustrated. Stormfly returns with it just as quickly.

                         

                          ERET
           Why?

                         

                          HICCUP
           Because I'm going to change his
           mind about dragons.

                         
          Eret and his crew LAUGH. Astrid pokes out of the well.

                          ASTRID
           He can be really persuasive.

                         
          Hiccup pets Toothless, thoughtfully.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Once you've earned his loyalty,
           there is nothing a dragon won't do
           for you.

                         

                          ERET
           Puh! You won't be changing any
           minds around here.

                          HICCUP
           I can change yours. Right here.
           Right now.

                         
          Hiccup sets Toothless' tail in the locked, splayed position.
          Eret sneers, suspicious.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           May I?

                         
          Suddenly, Hiccup is snatched into the air! Dragons blur past.

          The crewmen SCRAMBLE to the NET CANNONS as a FLURRY OF WINGS
          streak past, GASHING holes in the sails and SLICING through
          rigging.

                         

                          ERET
           Dragon riders!

                         
          Toothless SHRIEKS and bounds up the mast, spotting Hiccup in
          the talons of a Monstrous Nightmare. Toothless relaxes,
          realizing that it's Hookfang.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Put me down! Snotlout! What are you
           doing?

                         
          Snotlout looks back to see if Ruffnut witnessed the save.

                         

                          SNOTLOUT
           See how well I protect and provide?
          Ruffnut GRUMBLES at the incessant courting. A FLYING NET
          whizzes past her head.

                         

                          TUFFNUT
           Aggh! What is with all the nets?!

                         

                          RUFFNUT
           Hey watch it! That was close...

                         
          Ruffnut spots Eret, FIRING nets from the deck of the ship.

          The net unravels in SLOW MOTION...

                         

                          RUFFNUT (CONT'D)
           Me likey.

                         
          ... enveloping Ruffnut as she yields to it, blissfully.

                         

                          RUFFNUT (CONT'D)

          As Hiccup FLIPS upside-down in the Hookfang's talons and
          KICKS off, pulling his wing-suit flaps.

                         
          Eret takes aim, but Astrid SHOVES him, throwing off the shot.

                         

                          ASTRID

           HOLD YOUR FIRE!

                         
          Hiccup glides unsteadily towards the ship and collides with
          its sail. He slides down the canvas and drops to the deck.
          Toothless lands behind him.

                         

                          HICCUP

           WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING HERE?!

                         
          Gobber and Grump land on the deck, scattering Eret's crew.

                         

                          GOBBER
           We're here to RESCUE you!

                         

                          HICCUP
           I DON'T NEED to be rescued!

           STOICK (O.S.)

           ENOUGH!

                         
          The bow dips heavily as Stoick touches down on SKULLCRUSHER.
          He dismounts, fuming.

                         
          Eret blocks Stoick, cocky and confident.

                         

                          ERET
           Well, didn't you just pick the
           wrong ship, eh? I am Eret, son of --

                         
          Stoick shoves his face aside, sending Eret SLAMMING into
          Grump. Before he can react, Gobber CLUBS Eret on the head,
          sending him collapsing to the deck. Grump then sits on him,
          smothering him into submission.

           Get... this... thing... off... me!

                         
          Gobber turns to the other crewmen, with a smile.

                         

                          GOBBER
           Anyone else?

                         
          Eret's men eye the Vikings, armed and flanked by their
          dragons. They set down their swords.

                         

                          GOBBER (CONT'D)
           That's what I figured.

                         

                          STOICK

                          (TO HICCUP)
           You. Saddle up. We're going home.

                         

                          HICCUP
           No.

                         

                          STOICK

                          HICCUP
           -- I'm trying to protect our
           dragons and stop a war! How is that
           irresponsible?

                         

                          STOICK

           BECAUSE WAR IS WHAT HE WANTS, SON!

                         
          Hiccup glares, frustrated.

                         
          Stoick SIGHS, realizing that he has to explain.

           Years ago, there was a great
           gathering of chieftains to discuss
           the dragon scourge we all faced.

          A hulking, cloaked figure strides confidently into fire-lit
          hall, interrupting a council meeting of Viking chieftains.
          His face is masked in silhouette.

           STOICK (V.O.)
           Into our midst came a stranger from
           a strange land, covered in scars
           and draped in a cloak of dragon
           skin. He carried no weapon and
           spoke softly, saying that he, Drago
           Bludvist, was a man of the people,
           devoted to freeing mankind from the
           tyranny of dragons.

                         
          ON STOICK, some twenty years younger, seated in a throne,
          studying the impudent stranger with suspicion.

                         

           STOICK (V.O.)
           He claimed that he alone could
           control the dragons and that he
           alone could keep us safe, if we
           chose to bow down and follow him.

                         
          The Viking council erupts in mocking laughter.

                          TUFFNUT
           Good one.

                         

                          STOICK

           well you do without me!"

                         
          Drago Bludvist pulls the dragon skin cloak over himself and
          marches toward the door. Above, dragon fire rips through the
          ceiling, bringing down flaming timbers, followed by dragons
          covered in heavy metallic armor. They BLAST FIRE as panic
          ensues.

                         

           STOICK (V.O.)
           The rooftop suddenly burst into
           flames, and from it, armored
           dragons descended, burning the hall
           to the ground.

           be reasoned with.

           Maybe.

                         
          Hiccup turns and stomps toward Toothless, determined. Eret
          watches intently.

                         

                          STOICK

           I'm still going to try.

                         
          Hiccup jumps onto Toothless and locks eyes with Stoick.

           This is what I'm good at. And if I
           could change your mind... I can
           change his, too.

                          (TO TOOTHLESS)
           Come on.

                         
          Toothless and Hiccup TAKE TO THE AIR, leaving everyone
          stirring in awkward silence.

                         
          Astrid mounts Stormfly, about to go after him.

           Let's go.

           NO! Lead the others back to Berk.
           I've had enough mutiny for one day.

                         
          Astrid stirs, conflicted, as Stoick stomps toward
          Skullcrusher, fuming. He passes Ruffnut, who's busily
          fondling Eret's biceps as he lays crushed under Grump.

                         

                          RUFFNUT

          Hiccup stares ahead, frustrated, as Toothless glides over a
          bed of clouds, glowing in the low, Arctic sun.
          Hiccup YELLS, then slumps back onto the saddle.
          Toothless recoils, sensitive to Hiccup's upset. The steam
          from their breath mixes in the frigid air.

                          HICCUP
           Don't worry, bud. I'm not gonna let
           anything happen to you. I promise.
          Toothless' ear plates perk up. He glances over his shoulder
          to see a disturbance in the blanket of clouds.
          A strange and arresting MASKED WARRIOR rises from the clouds,
          standing upon something unseen. Its armor and cape flap in
          the buffeting turbulence.
          The warrior eyes Toothless and Hiccup, pulling up alongside
          them. Hiccup senses the approaching figure in his periphery
          and sits up, flustered.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           AW, COME ON, DAD! REALLY?!
          He whirls around expectantly then FREEZES, mouth agape.
          The warrior stares blankly, tilting his head in curiosity
          while cutting a menacing silhouette.
          Then, just as gradually as he rose, the warrior dips back
          beneath the clouds, disappearing.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

                          (ALARMED)
           Okay.

                          (TO TOOTHLESS)
           No sudden moves.
          Suddenly, the warrior EXPLODES out of the clouds before them,
          standing atop a large dragon. They circle Hiccup and
          Toothless, forcing them to TREAD AIR.

                         
          The warrior points a staff toward Hiccup, unnervingly, as he
          returns to face them.

           Hold on, hold on.
          Toothless GROWLS a warning.
          Suddenly, they're ambushed from behind. Hiccup is plucked off
          of Toothless by another DRAGON and carried off.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Toothless!
          With the tail unmanned, Toothless PLUMMETS helplessly. He
          FLAPS wildly then CRASHES through the ice into the black,
          frigid water. FLAILING and CRYING OUT, he struggles to stay
          afloat as he watches...
          Hiccup disappear into the night sky, carried off in the
          talons of the strange dragon -- one of TENS that accompany
          the warrior in a cavalcade.
          Toothless BELLOWS in distress, desperately trying to take to
          the air. As he LEAPS and CRASHES, time and again...
          A group of SPINY DORSAL FINS split the ice, carving a path
          toward Toothless.
          Beneath the ice, a pod of SEASHOCKERS approach, two-headed,
          with Manta Ray like wings GLIDING silently in the gloom.
          Fixated on Hiccup, Toothless is caught by surprise as the
          Seashockers surface and DRAG HIM UNDER.
          Hiccup's helmet bobs to the surface, marking all that
          remains.

                         

                         

          EXT. ARCTIC SKY/ARCHIPELAGO - NIGHT (MIDNIGHT SUN)

          (Scene 1300 - Dragon Lady)

                         
          Hiccup shivers in the claws of the dragon, surrounded by the
          strange flock full of breeds he's never seen. He looks back
          for Toothless, now long gone.

                         

                          HICCUP

           HEY! YOU LEFT MY DRAGON BACK THERE!

           HE CAN'T FLY ON HIS OWN! HE'LL

           DROWN!

                         
          The warrior offers no response, seemingly immune to the cold
          as he leads the dragon flock across the polar night -- an
          alien landscape, harsh and foreboding.

          Out of the fog looms an EPIC ICE FORMATION -- jagged, spiked,
          and similar to the icy aftermath of Eret's fort, but many
          times its size.

                         
          The DRAGON ESCORT dives into its jagged folds.

                         

                         

          INT. DRAGON MOUNTAIN - CONTINUOUS


                         
          The WILD RIDE suddenly gives way to a MULTILEVEL, CAVERNOUS
          CHAMBER made of ice and columns of basalt rock. It's heavily
          populated with dragons of all kinds, looming in the shadows.

                         
          Hiccup is dropped in the center. He scrambles to his feet,
          calling out into the darkness.

                         

                          HICCUP
           We have to head back for my dragon!

                         
          A HISSING dragon CLOSES IN, sniffing, leering, aggressive.

                         
          Hiccup extends and lights his telescoping dragon blade,
          waving a swirl of fire around himself. The dragon pauses,
          intrigued, and then watches hypnotically as Hiccup pacifies
          him with calculated sweeps of the fiery blade.

                         
          The warrior watches keenly from the shadows.

                         
          Several aggressive dragons close in behind Hiccup. Hearing
          their hisses, he quickly stows the blade, replaces a
          cartridge in its hilt, then flips it around and sprays a
          perimeter of Zippleback gas around himself. He clicks the
          lighter, igniting a flash ring. The testy dragons recoil.

                         
          He then reaches through the smoke, offering his open hand.
          The dragons re-approach, sniffing him with calmed curiosity.

          ON THE WARRIOR

                         
          ... tilting his masked head, curious. He dismounts his dragon
          and approaches Hiccup.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Who are you? The Dragon Thief?
           Drago Bludvist?

                         
          The warrior circles Hiccup in silence, taking in his gear,
          his dragon blade, his face.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Do you even understand what I'm
           saying?
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 37.

                         

                         
          The warrior whirls and HAMMERS his staff. In response, a
          large dragon ASCENDS from the depths, carrying...

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Toothless!

                         
          Toothless is dumped on the ground next to Hiccup, sopping
          wet. Hiccup rushes to him, petting him reassuringly.
          Toothless coos in relief.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           It's okay. I'm glad to see you,
           too, bud. You really had me worried
           there.

                         
          The warrior rattles his staff at a nearby dragon. In
          response, it and the surrounding dragons produce firelight
          from their throats, spotlighting Hiccup and Toothless.

                         
          The warrior sets down his staff and shield, then approaches
          Hiccup, cautiously and animal-like.

                         
          Toothless SNARLS and circles Hiccup defensively, but then
          instantly yields to the stranger's outstretched hand. With a
          quick, disarming gesture, the warrior lays Toothless down in
          a state of bliss. Hiccup is astounded.

                         
          The warrior's hand continues toward Hiccup's face. He
          recoils, but the warrior persists, finding the faint scar on
          Hiccup's chin, glinting in the firelight.

                         
          The warrior GASPS and retreats a few steps.

                         

                          WARRIOR
           (whispered, shaken)
           Hiccup?

                          (BEAT)
           Could it be? After all these years?
           How is this possible?

                         
          The voice is surprisingly female.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Uh, should I... should I know you?

                         

                          WARRIOR
           No. You were only a babe...

                         
          The warrior slowly removes the strange mask, revealing VALKA,
          40, beneath. Her eyes meet his, equally wide-eyed and aghast.

                         

                          VALKA

          Hiccup stammers, tongue-tied, aghast.

                         

                          VALKA (CONT'D)
           Come...

          Stoick and Gobber search over the frigid waves that lap
          against the pack ice.

                         

                          STOICK
           Boar-headed! Just like his mother!
           She could never stay put either.

                         
          Gobber glances over at Stoick, who's hunched over, brow
          furrowed and solemn.

                         

                          GOBBER
           Ah, he's just twenty. And a Viking.
           I mean, could there be a worse
           combination? Ha! When I think of
           how stubborn and senseless YOU were
           back in the day... well, not much
           has changed, actually.

                         

                          STOICK
           You know what he's like. He won't
           give up, Gobber. And if Hiccup
           finds Drago, before we find him...

                         

                          GOBBER
           Bah! NOTHING can hurt Hiccup so
           long as that Night Fury's around.
           It's a Night Fury!
          Framed by a hole in the ice, a glistening object bobs on the
          surface below. Stoick squints and CIRCLES BACK, leading
          Skullcrusher in a DIVE toward it. Stoick SNAGS it out of the
          water. It's Hiccup's helmet.

                         
          Gobber pulls alongside Stoick, seeing his look of dread.
          Stoick holds the helmet out for his dragon to SMELL.

                         

                          STOICK
           Find him, Skullcrusher. Find him.

                         
          Skullcrusher SNIFFS the helmet like a bloodhound, ROARS, and
          suddenly CHANGES HEADING.

           You can't just say something like
           that and run off! You're my
           mother?! I mean, what the -- do you
           grasp how INSANE it sounds?!

          Hiccup follows her over the difficult terrain. He tries to
          clamber over a tall rock, unsuccessfully.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Where have you been all this time?

                         
          Toothless boosts him over. Hiccup lands on the other side.

          dome of sweating ice capping a geothermal micro climate,
          filled with dragons of every shape and kind.

                          HICCUP
           What? No. I don't know. It's a bit
           much to get my head around, to be
           frank. It's not every day you find
           out your mother is some kind of
           crazy, feral, vigilante dragon
           lady.

                         
          Valka chuckles, and using her dragon's wing, lowers herself
          to the ground like a skilled acrobat.

           I suppose there is that...

           ... one... specific... thing...

           Do you like it?

                         

                          HICCUP
           I don't have the words.

                         
          Toothless SNARLS in annoyance as the curious, smothering
          dragons SNIFF every part of him.

                         

                          VALKA
           Can I... ? He's beautiful!

                         
          She reaches out to stroke Toothless, who PURRS at her touch.

                          VALKA (CONT'D)
           Incredible. He might very well be
           the last of his kind.

                         
          She inspects his talons as Toothless rolls onto his back,
          nuzzling her.

                         

                          VALKA (CONT'D)
           And look, he's your age! No wonder
           you get along so well.

                         
          Hiccup smiles, astounded by Toothless' affection for Valka.
          She checks his teeth. They recede into the gums at her touch.

                         

                          VALKA (CONT'D)
           And retractable teeth? Ah!
           How did you manage to--

                         

                          HICCUP
           --I found him in the woods. He was
           shot down and wounded.

                         
          She winces and offers a sympathetic nod as she stands to
          caress a few of her own rescued dragons.

                         

                          VALKA
           This Snafflefang lost his leg to
           one of Drago Bludvist's iron traps.
           This Raincutter had her wing sliced
           by razor netting. And this poor
           Hobblegrunt was blinded by a tree
           snare... then left to die alone and
           scared.
           (re: Toothless' tail)
           And what of this? Did Drago or his
           trappers do this, too?

                          HICCUP
           Heh. Well, crazy thing is... I'm
           actually the one who shot him down.

                         
          She glares, confused.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           It's okay though. He got me back.
           (playfully, to Toothless)
           Right, bud? You couldn't save all
           of me, could you? You just had to
           make it even. So... peg leg!

                         
          Hiccup rattles his prosthetic leg with a smirk. Valka
          observes their playful rapport with curiosity.

                          VALKA
           What did your father think of your
           Night Fury friend?

                         

                          HICCUP
           He didn't take it all that well.

                         
          She mutters in agreement.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           But then... he changed. They all
           did. Pretty soon everyone back home
           had dragons of their own.

                         
          She smiles at Toothless, dismissive.

                         

                          VALKA
           If only it were possible.

                         

                          HICCUP
           No, really, I --

                         

                          VALKA
           -- Believe me, I tried, as well.
           But people are not capable of
           change, Hiccup. Some of us... were
           just born different.

                         FLASHBACK

                         
          Dragons sweep from the sky, blowing FIRE, carrying off sheep
          and dried fish. Vikings chase them down, hurling weapons.

                         

           VALKA (V.O.)
           Berk was a land of kill or be
           killed, but I believed peace was
           possible.

                         
          A Viking is about to finish off a felled dragon, but Valka
          chases up to him and tugs at his arm.

                         

                          VALKA
           Stop! You'll only make it worse!

                         
          The dragon takes wing, escaping to safety... leaving the
          Viking warrior glaring at Valka.

                         

           VALKA (V.O.)
           It was a very unpopular opinion.

          As he rushes off, Valka hears a clatter and whirls around to
          see a DRAGON (Cloudjumper) clawing its way through the roof
          of a house.

                         

                          VALKA
           Hiccup!

                         

                         

          INT. STOICK'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS


                         

                         FLASHBACK CONTINUED

                         
          Cloudjumper enters the house through the hole in the roof,
          sniffing out a baby's cradle in the corner.

                         
          Valka rushes in, panicked.

                         

           VALKA (V.O.)
           One night, a dragon broke into our
           house, finding you in the cradle.

                         
          Valka draws a sword quietly, slipping up to the dragon, only
          to find it huddled protectively over the cradle as BABY
          HICCUP innocently plays with one of its talons.

                         

           VALKA (V.O.)
           I rushed to protect you, but what I
           saw... was proof of everything I
           believed.

                         
          Valka's careful approach causes a floorboard to squeak.
          Spooked, Cloudjumper whips around to face her, accidentally
          SCRATCHING baby Hiccup's chin.

                         
          Their eyes meet. Valka lowers her sword, transfixed.

                         

           VALKA (V.O.)
           This wasn't a vicious beast, but an
           intelligent, gentle creature, whose
           soul reflected my own.

                         
          Stoick's AXE spins through the air between them, barely
          missing Cloudjumper and planting into a pillar.

                         

                          STOICK
           Valka, run!

                         
          Alarmed, Cloudjumper WHIRLS around at Stoick and BLASTS!

                         
          Stoick DIVES out of the way as the FIRE SPLATTERS against the
          wall, burning a hole and setting the room ablaze.

                         
          The dragon moves toward Stoick, but Valka grabs hold.

                          VALKA
           Don't!

                         
          It turns to face her again, locking eyes, agitated.

                         

                          STOICK
           Hold on!

                         
          Stoick dashes through the fire toward Hiccup and pulls him
          out of the cradle. He pulls his axe from the pillar...

                         

           VALKA (O.S.)
           No! Stoick!

                         
          ... but in a WHOOSH of smoke and embers, the dragon and Valka
          are GONE.

                         

                          STOICK

           VALKA!

                         

                          VALKA

                          (DISTANT)
           Stoick!

                         
          Stoick and baby Hiccup watch helplessly as the dragon spirits
          Valka away into the night sky.

                         

                          STOICK
           Valka...

          HICCUP'S FACE, with the matching scar.

                         

                          VALKA
           You and your father nearly died
           that night, all because I couldn't
           kill a dragon.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Yeah, it runs in the family.

                         

                          VALKA
           It broke my heart to stay away, but
           I believed you'd be safer if I did.

          Hiccup considers this, then raises his eyes to hers, seeing
          the sting of remorse.

                         

                          HICCUP
           How did you survive?

                         

                          VALKA
           Oh, Cloudjumper never meant to harm
           me. He must've thought I belonged
           here...

                         
          She leads him to the edge of raised natural terrace,
          overlooking the steamy oasis with its flowing hot spring
          waterfalls. Half-submerged in the warm lake below, a massive
          white dragon with pronounced, mammoth-like tusks rests
          benevolently on the banks, his stately countenance like that
          of a lion surrounded by his pride.

                         

                          VALKA (CONT'D)
           In the home of the great
           Bewilderbeast. The alpha species.
           One of very few that still exist.

          Dragons land and bow reverentially to the Bewilderbeast.
          Valka gestures to the spiked ice ceiling that acts as a
          sweating greenhouse.

                         

                          VALKA (CONT'D)
           With his icy breath, this graceful
           giant built our nest. A safe haven
           for dragons everywhere.

                         
          On HICCUP, putting it together.

                          HICCUP
           Wait, that's the ice-spitter? He's
           responsible for all that
           destruction?

                         

                          VALKA
           He protects us. We all live under
           his care. And his command.

                         
          They pass an eggshell-littered NURSERY. HATCHLINGS dart out
          of it, greeting them excitedly and inciting chaos. Toothless
          is overwhelmed by their manic picking and scratching.
          Cloudjumper balks and sends them scattering.

          The hatchlings clamber on top of the Bewilderbeast and play
          on his massive tusks, despite his authority. Valka laughs.

                         

                          VALKA (CONT'D)
           ... who listen to no one.

                         
          The Bewilderbeast lets out a frosty SNORT, sending off the
          youngsters to spread more mischief.

                         
          Now awakened, The Bewilderbeast raises his gargantuan head to
          take a closer look at Hiccup, coming eye to massive eye.
          Valka bows in his presence. As does Toothless.

                         

                          VALKA (CONT'D)
           I've lived among them for twenty
           years, Hiccup, learning their ways,
           discovering their secrets...

                         
          He acknowledges Hiccup with another icy snort, slicking back
          Hiccup's hair in a frosty veneer. Valka laughs.

                         

                          VALKA (CONT'D)
           He likes you.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Wow.

                         
          She chuckles, delighting in his awe.

                         

                          VALKA
           You must be hungry.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Uh, yeah. I could eat.

                         

                          VALKA
           Good. It's feeding time.
          Toothless tucks himself beneath Cloudjumper's wing, trying to
          befriend him, but Cloudjumper isn't having any of it. He
          grimaces and follows Valka out.

          Astrid and Stormfly circle a lone iceberg, being used as a
          rest stop for the Gang and their dragons. She lands with a

           been back with Hiccup by now.

           I don't like it either. Eret son of
           Eret was the man of my dreams. My
           everything!

           you.

                         
          Fishlegs strokes his peach fuzz beard, meek and dejected.

           What if Drago shot them down? What
           if they need our help?

                          (RESOLUTE)
           We have to find them.

                          ASTRID
           It doesn't matter what he said, if
           they've all been captured. Come on!

                         
          She flies off, determined.

                         

                         

          EXT. ICE FLOES - NIGHT


                         
          Eret's ship is beset by ice floes. The crew stirs on deck as
          he paces, grumbling, while nursing his head with a large
          chunk of ice.

                          NO-NAME
           Do we go back?

                         

                          ERET
           We've nowhere to go! Nothing to
           sell! And no heads to call our own,
           if we don't turn up with dragons
           and fast --

                         
          He's suddenly scooped up in Stormfly's talons.

           A kidnapping.

                         
          Ruffnut grabs his leg, clutching him possessively.

           Yay! Can he ride with me? Can he?
           Can he?

                         
          Both Eret and Tuffnut groan in protest.

                         

                          ASTRID
           You're gonna show us the way to
           Drago.

                          ASTRID
           That can be arranged. Stormfly,
           drop it.

                         
          In enthusiastic response, Stormfly pops open her talons,
          sending Eret plummeting. He wails and flails as he hurtles
          toward the ice far below.

                         

                          ASTRID (CONT'D)
           Good girl! Stormfly, fetch.

                         
          She dives after him, just as enthusiastically.
          ON ERET, terrified, as the ground rushes up at him.

                         

                          ERET

           ALL RIGHT! OKAY! I'LL TAKE YOU TO

          Stormfly suddenly SNATCHES him out of his free-fall just
          before hitting the ice. Astrid giggles and cracks her
          knuckles.

          EXT. SKY - EARLY MORNING


                         
          (Scene 1600 - Momma's Boy)

                         

                         BEGIN MONTAGE

                         
          Hiccup and Toothless follow Valka and Cloudjumper over a
          majestic fjord in the long rays of the low Arctic sun.

                         
          Hiccup peers over his shoulder to see that a thick flock of
          dragons -- nearly all of Valka's rescues -- are close on
          their tail. He turns back to his mother, confused.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Hey, I thought we were going to
           eat?

                         

                          VALKA
           (with a mischievous grin)
           Oh, we are.

                         
          She directs his gaze below, where in the choppy water of the
          fjord, a group of Seashocker dragons are corralling a dense
          shoal of fish near the surface.

                         
          Suddenly, the Bewilderbeast rises from deep below, scooping
          the fish up in its vast mouth as its tusks break the surface.
          It breaches just below Hiccup and Toothless, giving them a
          fright before spitting the fish into the air and crashing
          back down into the sea.

                         
          Valka laughs at Hiccup's surprise as the hungry dragons race
          for the flailing fish, scooping them out of the air. Hiccup
          gestures to Toothless to join in and he gladly scoops up a
          mouth full.

          MONTAGE CONTINUES...

                         
          Hiccup has his map spread out in the snow, explaining the
          various lands he's discovered during his explorations.

                         

                          HICCUP
           And from Dragon Island, I found
           this archipelago...

                         
          He looks up to see that Valka is no longer next to him, but
          she has sketched out the rest of the northern land masses in
          the snow, wowing Hiccup with just how far and wide she has
          explored.

          She returned to Hiccup's side with a smile. But his amazement
          is interrupted by Toothless joining in, drawing all over
          Valka's map with a giant icicle.

                         
          Hiccup simply shrugs as his mother giggles, and Cloudjumper
          sneers.

                         

                         

          EXT. WINDSWEPT CLIFF - LATER


                         
          Valka and Hiccup rise on their dragons, carried skyward by a
          strong coastal wind that thrusts vertical up shoreline cliff.

                         
          One by one, dragons leap from the cliff and catch the strong
          updraft, popping their wings open like kites. They ride the
          wind and orbit around each other in a colorful, mesmeric
          dance. It's clearly a form of dragon play.

                         
          Hiccup, lifted off of his saddle by the force of the wind,
          laughs giddily as he watches Valka walk across Cloudjumper's
          wing and onto several others, dragon-hopping from one to
          another, until she gracefully crosses Toothless from wing tip
          to wing tip. She then drops out of sight, reappearing a
          moment later standing atop Cloudjumper. Hiccup is in utter
          awe of her.

                         
          Valka breathes in the frigid air. Lets it out blissfully.

                         

                          VALKA
           When I'm up here, I don't even feel
           the cold. I just feel...

                         

                          HICCUP
           Free.

                         
          She smiles at Hiccup. He gleams back.

                          VALKA
           This is what it is to be a dragon,
           Hiccup.

                         
          Hiccup LOCKS the pedals in the flared tail position and
          unbuckles himself. Valka watches, curious.

                         

                          HICCUP
           It's all well and good to call
           yourself a dragon.

                         
          Hiccup RUNS OFF of Toothless, pulling his stowed wings.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           But can you fly?

                         
          They catch the air, SNAPPING OPEN... and sending him GLIDING.
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 51.

                         

                         
          Valka GASPS, astonished. She flies her dragon alongside him,
          marvelling, as...

                         
          ... Hiccup SOARS, riding the wild air currents like an eagle,
          the image of freedom. Toothless descends steadily with him,
          hovering protectively.

                         
          Hiccup grins, pleased at having impressed Valka... until he
          realizes that he is once again racing toward a collision with
          a fast approaching mountain top.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Oh no. Toothless!

                         
          But, with his tail locked, Toothless can't make the tight
          jackknife turn skyward to rescue Hiccup.

                         
          Realizing that they're in trouble, Valka and Cloudjumper pour
          on the speed. All four of them collide just as they reach the
          mountain top, sending them crash-landing in an explosion of
          snow.

                         
          They all TOPPLE head over tail to a messy landing on the wind-
          swept ridge and pop up LAUGHING.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Man! Almost! We just about had it
           that time!

                         
          Toothless raises his snow-packed face, glowering. He tail-
          swipes Hiccup off of his feet and back into the powder.

                         
          Valka inspects Hiccup's wing suit with utter fascination.

                         

                          VALKA
           Incredible.

                          HICCUP
           Well, not bad yourself.

                         
          She caresses his cheek, staring deep into his eyes. Hiccup
          doesn't recoil this time.

                         

                          VALKA
           All this time, you took after me.
           And where was I?

                          (REMORSEFUL)
           I'm so sorry, Hiccup. Can we start
           over? Will you give me another
           chance?

                         
          Hiccup smiles, a simple acknowledgement that all is forgiven.
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 52.

                         

                         

                          VALKA (CONT'D)
           I can teach you all I've learned,
           these past twenty years. Like...

                         
          Valka finds a spot at the top of Toothless' neck and rubs in
          a circular pattern. In response, his dorsal blades slowly
          crack, split and extend, forming a pronounced, aerodynamic
          `V' down the length of his back and tail.

                         

                          VALKA (CONT'D)
           Now you can make those tight turns.

                         
          Toothless shudders, as if experiencing a much-needed
          chiropractic adjustment. He bounds over to Hiccup, giddily
          retracting and splaying his dorsal blades like a kid with a
          new toy.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Did YOU know about this?

                         
          Valka smiles, delighting in their mutual amazement.

                         

                          VALKA
           Every dragon has its secrets.

                         
          Toothless pounces around, showing off to Cloudjumper, who
          seems thoroughly unimpressed.

                         

                          VALKA (CONT'D)
           And I'll show them all to you.
           We'll unlock every mystery, find
           every last species, together, as
           mother and son.

                          (BEAT)
           This gift we share, Hiccup... it
           bonds us. This is who you are, son.
           Who we are. We will change the
           world for all dragons! We will make
           it a better, safer place!

                         

                          HICCUP
           That sounds... amazing.

                         
          She pulls him into a hug -- forceful, bursting with emotion.
          Hiccup hugs Valka back. They share a cathartic moment, before
          Hiccup peels away from her.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           This is so great! Now you and I can
           go talk to Drago -- together!

                         
          She chuckles, incredulous.

           What? There's no talking to Drago.

                         

                          HICCUP
           But we have to --

           -- No. We must protect our own.

                         
          Hiccup stares, exasperated by the familiar line. Cloudjumper
          lumbers over, eager to be rid of Toothless' puppy-like
          energy. Valka pets him.

                         

                          VALKA (CONT'D)
           Now come on, we should be getting
           back.

                         
          Before Hiccup can say anymore, he hear heavy breathing next
          to him, and looks over to see Toothless with a gaping grin,
          clapping his dorsal blades.

                         

                         

          EXT. ICE CAVE - DAY


                         
          (Scene 1350 - Meet Drago)

                         
          Astrid and the gang stealthily approach a cluster of tabular
          icebergs, collapsed against each other at the mouth of a
          maze. Stormfly drops Eret to the snow, but before he can
          flee, she lands atop him and nests like a hen with her egg.

                         

                          ERET
           Agghh! Okay! I got you here, now
           get this thing off me!

                         

                          ASTRID
           Never take a toy from a dragon.
           Don't you know anything?

                         
          Stormfly crushes him in place under her weight.

                         

                          ERET

                          (STRAINED)
           Gah! Why does this keep happening
           to me?

                         
          Astrid crawls up the rising ridge to reveal...

                         
          A MASSIVE FLOTILLA, moored together like a floating camp in
          the deep water between collided icebergs.

                         
          Thick chains run deep into the water, where great blasts of
          bubbles erupt on the surface. The unseen creature rocks the
          ships. Its effect alone describes it as gargantuan.

                          ASTRID
           What's down there?

                         
          Fishlegs rifles through his note cards contained in his belt
          pouch.

                         

                          FISHLEGS
           Large diameter bubbles, massive
           lungs, cold water deep dweller, I'm
           thinking class five leviathan,
           maybe six.

                         
          Suddenly, Stormfly is alerted to an encroaching menace and
          takes wing. BLOW DARTS whiz through the air, hitting the
          other dragons. The effect is immediate -- they fall to the
          ground, unconscious. Drugged.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Meatlug! What's wrong, girl?

                         
          Eret spring to his feet and draws his blades. Astrid and the
          Gang find themselves surrounded by soldiers, camouflaged in
          polar bear furs, and poised to fire darts. They're
          outnumbered. Fishlegs raises his hands, dropping the cards.

                         

                         

          EXT. DRAGO'S SHIP - DECK - MOMENTS LATER


                         
          DRAGO BLUDVIST, a hulking figure draped in a dragon skin
          cloak, crouches over the prow of the fleet's grisly flagship,
          adorned in massive dragon bones and skulls. His scarred face
          is masked by thick, grizzled dreadlocks.

                         

           ERET (O.S.)

           DRAGO!

                         
          Drago turns to see Astrid, Eret, and the Gang being forcibly
          escorted onto the deck. Eret SHAKES HIMSELF FREE.

                         

                          ERET (CONT'D)
           Get off me!

                         
          In the background, a sledge, loaded with Hookfang, Meatlug,
          Belch and Barf -- all unconscious -- is dragged onto the deck
          by armored dragons.

                         

                          ERET (CONT'D)
           Always great to see you, my friend!
           Keeping warm up here?

                         
          The soldiers disarm him, pushing him forward as Drago
          approaches.

                          ERET (CONT'D)
           Well, as you can see, I'm right on
           time with a new batch of dragons,
           just like I promised.

                         
          Hookfang awakens, groggily shaking off the effect of the blow-
          dart. He rears as soldiers struggle to reign him in.

                         

                          SOLDIER #1
           Watch out! He's waking up! Keep him
           steady!

                         

                          SOLDIER #2
           Give me some backup here!

                         

                          DRAGO
           Drop the ropes.

                         
          They do so. Hookfang bucks and roars, chasing off the
          soldiers, then focusing on Drago as he closes in. The armored
          dragons avert their eyes and cower as Drago passes.

                         
          Hookfang HISSES a warning, but Drago approaches, undaunted.

                         
          Hookfang BLASTS. In a blur, Drago wraps himself in his dragon
          skin cloak. The sticky, napalm-like fire splatters against
          the fireproof scales, enveloping Drago in dripping flames as
          he persists forward without missing a step.

                         
          As the blast ends, Drago drops the cloak, closing in and
          holding a cold stare. Hookfang lets out a ferocious ROAR.

                         
          Drago YELLS back with a fierce, savage scream, interrupting
          Hookfang and causing him to recoil. Drago whirls his bull-
          hook overhead and STABS it into the deck planks.

                         
          Hookfang stirs, his aggression fading in the face of Drago's
          unflinching show of dominance.

                         
          After a moment, Hookfang averts his eyes and lowers his head
          in submission. Drago places his boot upon Hookfang's snout,
          pressing it into the deck planks.

                         

                          SNOTLOUT
           Hookfang!

                         

                          RUFFNUT
           Hey!

                         

                          ASTRID
           What are you doing?

                          DRAGO
           (quiet, to the dragon)
           You belong to me now.

                         

                          ERET
           And as an added bonus, I also
           caught you their riders. No extra
           charge.

                         
          Drago notices the saddle on Hookfang's back. His eyes wander
          to the saddle on Meatlug. Alarm flashes in Drago's eyes.

                         

                          ASTRID
           What?! Are you kidding me?!

                         

                          RUFFNUT
           But you were so perfect!

                         

                          ERET
           Turns out, there's a whole bunch of
           them out there. They --

                         
          In a flash, Drago stops toward Eret and seizes him by the
          throat.

                         

                          DRAGO
           How many?

                         
          As Eret chokes, stammering, Astrid whispers to the gang.

                         

                          ASTRID
           Drago doesn't have them after all.

                         

                          DRAGO

           HOW MANY?!

                         

                          ASTRID
           Hundreds! A whole island full!

                         
          His grip tightens around Eret's neck as he turns to Astrid.

                         

                          ERET
           I wouldn't worry about it. My men
           are hunting them down as we speak.
           They won't know where you're
           hiding. I promise you that.

                         
          Astrid nods a covert signal to the Gang -- she has a plan.

                         

                          ASTRID
           Oh, yes they will!

                         
          Drago drops Eret as Astrid advances, staring Drago down. Eret
          tries to signal her to stop, but it's no use.

           Vast...

                         
          Drago's eyes narrow upon hearing Stoick's name.

                         

                          ASTRID (CONT'D)

           Nope.

           now, he will blast through here on
           his Night Fury and blow your entire

          Eret slips away, trying to distance himself from the tension.

                         

                          RUFFNUT

          Drago grabs Eret by the face and bears down on him.

                         

                          DRAGO
           First there was one rider. And now
           all of Berk.

                          (TO ERET)
           And YOU led them to me.

                         
          He THROWS Eret across the deck.

                          DRAGO
           And get rid of him.

          The soldiers HURL throwing knives at Eret...

          all directions.

          Stormfly ROARS protectively, hiding Eret within her wings,

          Hiccup reattaches his flight suit while standing on a ledge
          overlooking the utopian nest, teeming with dragons. Several
          babies race in to hassle Toothless as he naps.

           Drago to attack this place. We've
           gotta find him first. Let's go.

                         
          Suddenly, a thick hand clamps down over Hiccup's face --
          muffling his scream!

                         
          Toothless whirls around to find STOICK, towering over Hiccup.
          He calms Toothless with a touch and releases Hiccup.

                         

                          STOICK
           Easy now.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Are you kidding me? How'd you get
           in here?

                         

                          STOICK
           The same way we're getting you out.

                         

                          HICCUP
           We?

                         
          Gobber appears in the arch of a tunnel.

                         

                          GOBBER
           All clear!

                          STOICK
           Toothless. Come.

                         
          They hurry back into the winding corridor.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Dad! There's something you need to
           know!

                         

                          STOICK
           Yeah, yeah, tell me on the way.

                         

                          HICCUP
           This isn't an on-the-way kind of
           update, actually...

                          STOICK
           I've heard ENOUGH, Hiccup.

                         

                          HICCUP
           ... more of the earth-shattering
           development variety.

                         

                          STOICK
           Yeah, just add it to the pile.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Dad, unlike most surprises I spring
           on you, this is one you'll like. I
           promise! You just have to handle it
           delicately, so...

                         
          They round a tight bend in the corridor to find Gobber
          staring blankly at something unseen in the next chamber. He
          shuffles past Stoick and Hiccup, dazed.

                         

                          GOBBER
           Uh, you might want to take this
           one. Oh, boy.

                         
          Stoick draws his SWORD, then braves into the chamber ahead.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Dad, can you put the sword away...
           please?

                         
          Stoick GASPS as if seeing a ghost... and drops his sword with
          a clatter.

                         
          Valka stands some twenty paces ahead of him, blocking the
          path. She lets out an audible SHUDDER upon seeing him.

                         
          He removes his helmet slowly as Hiccup, Gobber, and Toothless
          appear at Stoick's side.

                         

                          VALKA

                          (RATTLED)
           I know what you're going to say,
           Stoick. How could I have done this?
           Stayed away all of these years. And
           why didn't I come back to you? To
           our son.

                         
          Stoick steps towards her, wide-eyed and speechless. Dragons
          emerge from the recesses behind Valka, hissing protectively.

                         

                          VALKA (CONT'D)
           Well, what sign did I have that you
           could change, Stoick? That anyone
           on Berk could?

                          VALKA (CONT'D)
           I pleaded so many times to stop the
           fighting, to find another answer,
           but did any of you listen?

                         

                          GOBBER
           This is why I never married.

                          (BEAT)
           This and one other reason.

                         
          Stoick continues to close the gap, mesmerized. With every
          step, Valka becomes increasingly flustered. She backs into an
          ice wall, with nowhere to go, and Stoick just a few paces
          away.

                         

                          VALKA

                          (TEARFUL)
           I know that I left you to raise
           Hiccup alone... but I thought he'd
           be better off without me. And I was
           wrong, I see that now, but...

                         
          Stoick gently reaches a hand toward her face.

                         

                          VALKA (CONT'D)
           Oh stop being so stoic, Stoick. Go
           on... SHOUT, SCREAM, SAY SOMETHING!

                         

                          STOICK
           You're as beautiful as the day I
           lost you.

                         
          His words snuff her retort, rendering her speechless. She
          softens despite herself, yielding her cheek to his palm. He
          caresses her skin as a reluctant tear runs through his
          fingers. He PULLS her into a KISS. She resists briefly, then
          gives in. The surrounding dragons softly RETREAT in kind.
          Hiccup gapes, warmed by the sight of his parents reunited.

                         

                         

          EXT. ICE CHANNEL - DAY


                         
          (Scene 1750 - Eret's Turn)

                         
          Drago's massive flagship leads the flotilla, pulled along
          forcefully by whatever's at the other end of the enormous
          chain.

                         
          Drago WHACKS the chain with his bullhook, spurring it
          forward.

                         

          ON DRAGO'S SHIP

          Eret, Astrid, and the Gang are escorted to the stern,
          surrounded by several of Drago's soldiers. Wrists bound.
          Spear tips pressed into their backs.

                         

                          SNOTLOUT
           Could this day get any worse?

                         

                          TUFFNUT
           Uh, let me see. You'll jump into
           freezing cold water and then die
           from drowning.

                         
          They reach the gang plank. Eret peers overboard at the deep,
          icy water below.

                         

                          ERET
           Looks refreshing.

                         
          He turns to Astrid, meeting her glare with mock chivalry.

                         

                          ERET (CONT'D)
           Please, ladies first.

                         
          A pair of soldiers GRAB Astrid by the arms.

                         

                          ASTRID
           You are a steaming heap of dragon --

                         

                          ERET
           -- Duck.

                         
          Eret WHIRLS around, ROUND-HOUSING both soldiers. They GO
          DOWN, heavily.

                         
          He catches one of their spears with his bound hands and
          slices his ropes free. They fall away as he catches the other
          spear, twirling both in invitation.

                          SOLDIER
           Warn the others!

                         
          One soldier runs to send up the alarm... while the last two
          raise BLOW DART TUBES.

                         
          Eret SWIPES the first off of his legs, sending the dart into
          the neck of the second.

                         

                          RUFFNUT
           Get `em, you son of an Eret!

                         
          As the downed soldiers SCRAMBLE to their feet, Fishlegs FALLS
          OVER, CRUSHING them under his weight.

          Eret CATCHES the falling tube from the second soldier and
          BLOWS the dart at the fleeing third. The soldier DROPS,
          unconscious -- just shy of the Captain's Quarters.

                         

                          RUFFNUT (CONT'D)
           Okay, I love you again.

                         
          Ruffnut skips past Snotlout on her way to Eret. Snotlout
          watches, crestfallen.

                         

                          TUFFNUT
           Ugh. Pathetic. You can still jump.

                         
          Eret avoids Ruffnut and turns to Astrid.

                         

                          ERET
           So? Are we going to save your
           dragons and get out of here or not?

                         
          Astrid narrows her eyes, not knowing what to make of him. He
          reclaims his sword and dagger from the unconscious soldier
          who took them and cuts Tuffnut free.

                         

                          ERET (CONT'D)
           Check every trap. They're here
           somewhere.

                         

                         

          EXT. DRAGO'S SHIP - MOMENTS LATER


                         
          Astrid slips under a tarp and cranks open a metal trap. She
          peers between its massive iron teeth, discovering Meatlug
          within, bound and chained to its base as bait.

                         

                          ASTRID
           Meatlug?

                         ON ERET

                         
          Carefully cranking another trap, wincing at the sound. The
          iron jaws of the trap open wider with every CLICK.

                         

                          ERET
           Anyone coming?

                         
          Ruffnut "stands guard," fixated on Eret's rippling biceps.

                         

                          RUFFNUT
           I don't know. You just keep doing
           what you're doing. Keep crankin'...

                         
          Eret squeezes between the cocked teeth, finding Stormfly
          within, muzzled and chained. She looks up at Eret, calming
          immediately. He pauses, then approaches slowly.

          Eret carefully reaches out and strokes Stormfly's muzzle.

                         

                          ERET
           Thank you for saving my life.

           Now let me return the favor.

                         

                         

          INT. DRAGON MOUNTAIN - VALKA'S LIVING QUARTERS - LATE


                         AFTERNOON

                         
          (Scene 1850 - The Last Dance)

                         
          As Toothless and Cloudjumper hover for scraps, Stoick and
          Valka prepare skewers of fish. She's overwhelmed, lost in her
          thoughts, and covering it up poorly.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Mom, you'd never recognize it!
           Where we used to make weapons, we
           now build saddles, wing slings --
           we even fix dragon teeth! You
           wouldn't believe how much
           everything's changed!

                         
          Valka offers a skittish half-smile and hands him a plate.

                         

                          STOICK
           Our son's changed Berk for the
           better. I think we did well with
           this one, Val.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Thanks, Dad.

                         
          Stoick places his hands on Valka's shoulders. She flinches,
          dropping the plate.
          Cloudjumper steals the fish before Toothless can get to it.
          Toothless whimpers, and as a sign of acceptance, Cloudjumper
          regurgitates the fish so Toothless can have some.

                         

                          VALKA
           I'm... a little out of practice.

                         

                          STOICK

                          (SWEETLY)
           Well, y'know... I didn't marry you
           for your cooking.

                         

                          GOBBER
           (to Hiccup and Grump)
           I hope not. Her meatballs could
           kill more beasts than a battle axe.

           I've still got a few knocking
           around in here. Ha ha!

                         
          Gobber takes a bite, gags, and dump the entire plate of fish
          skewers into Grump's mouth like a trash can.

                         

                          HICCUP
           And once you move back in, with all
           of your dragons, Drago won't even
           stand a chance. Everything will be
           okay!

                         
          Stoick can see that Valka is overwhelmed. He lays a hand upon
          Hiccup's shoulder, calming him.

                         

                          STOICK
           Slow down, son. It's a lot to take
           in.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Oh. Gotcha.

                         
          Valka crosses the room to fill a flask with water, back
          turned to the group, as Stoick eyes her sympathetically. He
          decides on a different approach... and whistles a familiar
          tune.

                         
          ON VALKA, as her eyes widen, stirred, recognizing the melody.
          She turns away from Stoick, as the water overflows from the
          flask.

                         

                          GOBBER
           Oh, I love this one!

                         
          Stoick approaches her delicately.

                         

                          STOICK

                          (WHISPERED)
           Remember our song, Val?

                         
          Hiccup watches him, curious, as Stoick FUMBLES THROUGH THE
          FIRST VERSE of an old Viking courting song:

                         

                          STOICK (CONT'D)

                          (SINGING SOFTLY)
           I'll swim and sail on savage seas,
           with ne'er a fear of drowning. And
           gladly ride the waves of life, if
           you will marry me.

                         
          Valka avoids his gaze, wallowing in a mess of emotions.

           No scorching sun, nor freezing cold

                          WILL --

                         

                          GOBBER

                          (SINGING)
           -- will stop me on my journey!
           (catching himself,

                          EMBARRASSED)
           Sorry.

                         
          Stoick scowls at him, then returns his attention to Valka.

                         

                          STOICK

                          (SINGING)
           If you will promise me your
           heart...

                         
          Stoick pauses, setting Valka up for her part of the duet.

                         

                          STOICK (CONT'D)
           And love...

                         
          Stoick hangs eagerly, awaiting her words, but Valka closes
          her eyes, rejecting his invitation. He lets out a heavy-
          hearted sigh. But nostalgia gets the better of Valka. She
          softly SINGS HER PART:

                         

                          VALKA

                          (SINGING)
           And love me for eternity.

                         
          Stoick beams. She brushes past him, setting into the center
          of the chamber and holding her forearm aloft in invitation.
          Stoick crosses his forearm against hers, initiating a
          beautiful dance to accompany the song.

                          VALKA (CONT'D)

                          (SINGING)
           My dearest one, my darling dear,
           you mighty words astound me. But
           I've no need of mighty deeds, when
           I feel your arms around me.

                         
          The dance is full of charming missteps as Stoick and Valka
          recreate a moment from their past, before Hiccup's wonder-
          struck eyes.

                         

                          STOICK

                          (SINGING)
           But I would bring you rings of
           gold. I'd even sing you poetry.

                          STOICK (CONT'D)
           And I would keep you from all harm,
           if you'd stay here beside me.

                         

                          VALKA

                          (SINGING)
           I have no use for rings of gold. I
           care not for your poetry. I only
           want your hand to hold. I only want
           you near me.

                         
          Gobber can't help himself. He drags Hiccup onto his feet so
          that he can join in the dancing, too.

                         

                          GOBBER
           C'mon, Hiccup!

                         

           VALKA, STOICK, & GOBBER

                          (SINGING)
           To love and kiss, to sweetly hold.
           For the dancing and the dreaming.
           Through all life's sorrows and
           delights, I'll keep your love
           inside me.

                         
          Hiccup is amazed by the sight of his giddy parents, spinning
          and laughing in each others' arms, reunited.

                         

           VALKA, STOICK, & GOBBER (CONT'D)

                          (SINGING)
           I'll swim and sail through savage
           seas, with ne'er a fear of

           of life, if you will marry me!

                         
          Gobber carries the last note...

                         

                          GOBBER

                          (SINGING)
           I'm still going...

                         
          Hiccup taps him.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Gobber!

                         

                          GOBBER
           I'm done.

                         
          Valka and Stoick slow to a stop, WINDED and LAUGHING.

                         

                          STOICK
           Ah... I thought I'd have to die
           before we'd have that dance again.

           No need for drastic measures.

                         

                          STOICK
           For you, my dear... anything.

                         
          She smiles sweetly. Stoick's eyes well with tears. He goes
          down on one knee, proposing to her anew.

                         

                          STOICK (CONT'D)
           Will you come home, Val? Will you
           be my wife once again?

                         
          Toothless nudges Valka closer to Stoick. They laugh as Hiccup
          joins them. Stoick throws his arm around him.

                         

                          STOICK (CONT'D)
           We can be a family! What do you
           say?

                         
          Valka, between tears and laughter, turns to Hiccup.

                         

                          VALKA
           Yes!

                         
          Gobber pops his head in.

                         

                          GOBBER
           Great! I'll do the cooking!

                         
          They laugh.

                         

                          STOICK
           Thank Odin you didn't listen to me,
           son. We never would have found each
           other.
          Suddenly, Toothless and Cloudjumper suddenly perk up, sensing
          something unheard. Hiccup notices.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Toothless?

                         
          Dragons SWARM past Valka's chamber, racing toward some
          unknown disturbance.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           What's happening?

                         
          They're answered by subsequent HEAVY BOOMS that reverberate
          through the fortress.

          (Scene 1900 - Surprise Guests)

                         
          Valka rushes out to find...

                         
          DRAGO'S ARMADA in the lagoon below and his forces of
          thousands now landed upon the beach.

                         
          They launch catapults and ballistas into the icy spires,
          gaining entrance into the mountain's tunnels.

                         
          Hiccup, Stoick, and Gobber catch up to Valka.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Oh, no...

                         
          Valka tries to hurry off, fuming. Stoick stops her.

                         

                          STOICK
           Val! It's all right, it's all
           right. We're a team now.

                          (BEAT)
           Now what do you want to do?

                         
          She glances from Hiccup to Stoick.

                         

                          VALKA
           We have to save the dragons.

                         

                          STOICK

                          (DETERMINED)
           Aye. You got it!

                         
          He throws an arm around Hiccup.

                         

                          STOICK (CONT'D)
           Come on, son.

                         

          ON THE BATTLEFIELD

                         
          VALKA'S DRAGONS SWOOP down to engage the attackers, picking
          up soldiers and carrying them off while Drago stands in the
          line of fire, unflinching.

                         
          The catapults continue to bring down the icy defenses of
          dragon mountain. Drago's men pour into the tunnels. 

                         

                          DRAGO
           Whatever comes, keep hitting the
           mountain! We need to draw the alpha
           out.

          Drago's armored DRAGON ARMY takes wing, clashing with Valka's
          dragons in the skies.

                         

                          DRAGO (CONT'D)
           Ready the traps!

                         
          Iron jaws are opened like bear traps, revealing screeching
          `bait' dragons within. Valka's dragons swoop down to rescue
          them, only to be SNAPPED UP in the fearsome jaws.

                         
          A second set of traps are cocked open, but instead of dragon
          cries, ZIPPLEBACK GAS seeps out... followed by an EXPLOSION.
          The TWINS rocket out of the trap, riding BARF and BELCH.

                         

                          TUFFNUT
           Surprise! Yeah!

           WHAT?!

                         
          They're joined by Astrid and the rest of the GANG, bursting
          out of the traps atop Meatlug and Hookfang.

                         
          Eret comes flying out last, WAILING aboard Stormfly. He
          struggles to hold on, as she rejoins Astrid (riding Meatlug,
          along with Fishlegs). He gives them a sheepish shrug.

                         

                          ASTRID
           You really are full of surprises.

                         
          She leaps onto Stormfly, steadying them.

                         

                          ASTRID (CONT'D)
           Let's go!

                         
          Together they rocket across the sky...

                          TUFFNUT
           Dragon Riders coming through!

                         
          And DIVE-BOMB the traps, setting them aflame. The yokes and
          leather bindings restraining the bait dragons are
          incinerated, freeing them to fly away, unharmed.

                         

                          DRAGO

           CUT THEM DOWN!

                         
          Projectiles are launched, one of which KNOCKS Ruffnut off her
          dragon. She PLUMMETS past Eret toward the rocky shore below.

                         

                          RUFFNUT
           Eret, son of Eret!

                         
          She suddenly grabbed by both arms before hitting the rocks.

          RUFFNUT'S POV: of Snotlout on one side... and Fishlegs on the
          other. SOFT and ROMANTICIZED as her epiphany dawns.

                         
          Above them, more catapults fire, bringing down massive spires
          of ice, directly over Astrid and Eret.

                         

                          ASTRID
           Up, girl! To the left, Eret! That's
           it! Look out!

                         
          It's about to crush them when... it's BLOWN TO PIECES by
          Toothless' fireball. Hiccup, Stoick, and Gobber come bursting
          through the flames on their dragons.

                         
          Hiccup and Toothless arc across the sky triumphantly and set
          their sights on a downed dragon surrounded by soldiers.

                         
          Toothless BLASTS one of Drago's net launchers, knocking it
          onto its side. Stoick then CHOPS the trigger line, FIRING the
          catapult and NETTING the throng of soldiers, freeing the
          dragon.

                         
          Drago's ARCHERS target Stoick with their arrows.

                         

                          ARCHER
           Take `em down!

                         

                          GOBBER
           Heads up!

                         
          Gobber flies up from behind, KNOCKING the archers out with
          Grump's tail. Gobber chuckles.

                         
          DRAGO hears Toothless' tell-tale BANSHEE scream and turns to
          see him streaking across the sky.

                         

                          DRAGO
           Dragon Master.

                         
          Hiccup catches up to Astrid and Eret on Stormfly.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Welcome aboard, dragon rider!

                         

                          ERET
           Thanks. I think.

                         
          Astrid glares, both relieved and annoyed to see Hiccup.

                         

                          ASTRID
           Where have you been?

                         

                          HICCUP
           Oh, y'know. Catching up with Mom.

          Astrid shoots him a confused glare. He nods skyward. Astrid
          and Eret look up to see...

                         
          VALKA, in full warrior garb, rising from the towering ice
          spikes, atop Cloudjumper.

                         

                          ERET
           Whoa...

                         
          An earth-trembling roar follows as the Bewilderbeast rises
          behind Valka.

                         

                          ASTRID
           That's your mother?!

                         

                          HICCUP
           Well, now you know where I get my
           dramatic flair.

                         
          ON DRAGO, gawking in awe as the great BEWILDERBEAST BLASTS
          an epic explosion of ice upon the attackers.

                         

                          DRAGO
           The alpha! Now we have a fight!

                         
          Valka blasts overhead on Cloudjumper, commanding swarms of
          dragons to swoop down and attack Drago's army. A swarm of
          Zipplebacks set themselves aflame and roll like fiery wagon
          wheels through the battlefield, scattering soldiers and
          destroying war machines.

                         
          One of them gets CAUGHT under a Dragon Swatter, but Hiccup
          and Toothless double-back for a rescue.

                         

                          HICCUP
           There! Come on, Toothless! Show
           them what you got, bud.
          Toothless dive-bombs the swatter and DESTROYS it with a
          plasma bolt, freeing the dragon.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Thatta boy!

                         
          BACK TO VALKA, on Cloudjumper as they pry Drago's armored
          dragons off of the flailing wild ones. A net suddenly
          envelops Cloudjumper. They CRASH heavily, but Valka cuts
          herself free, sliding to a stop just paces away from Drago.

                         

                          DRAGO
           I've waited a long time for this!

                         
          Drago cocks his bull hook, ready to strike, but Valka
          deflects Drago's hit and attacks him.
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 73.

                         

                         

                          VALKA
           You cannot take our dragons! They
           are controlled by the alpha!

                         

                          DRAGO

                          (SMUG)
           Then it's a good thing I brought a
           challenger.

                         
          He turns to the flagship and YELLS savagely, whirling his
          bullhook overhead.

                         
          The heavy chains are released. The underwater creature, now
          freed, breaks the surface in an epic cascade of seawater. It
          rises toward the shoreline, revealing itself to be...

                         
          A SECOND BEWILDERBEAST -- bigger, meaner, and covered in
          scars that indicate years of training and abuse. The chains
          fall away from iron cuffs fastened to its massive tusks.

                         
          Valka GASPS.

                         

                          HICCUP

                          (HORRIFIED)
           Another one?

                         

                          FISHLEGS

           I WAS WAY OFF! THAT IS A CLASS TEN!

           CLASS TEN!

                         
          Drago's challenger lumbers onto the beach, focused on Valka's
          Bewilderbeast.

                         

                          VALKA
           No. No.

                         

                          DRAGO
           Come on! Take down the alpha!

                         
          Valka attacks Drago with her bullhook, trying to stop his
          commands, but Drago strikes back, knocking her forcefully
          onto her back. He pins her as she struggles, removing her
          mask and staff. He's about to finish her off, when WHAM! He's
          knocked to the ground. He looks up, fuming, to see Stoick
          helping Valka to her feet.

                         

                          VALKA
           Thank you.

                         

                          STOICK
           For you, my dear... anything.

          As Drago gathers his weapon and drops his heavy cloak,
          circling Stoick, Drago's Bewilderbeast confronts Valka's in a
          threat display.

                         

                          STOICK (CONT'D)
           Val, do you think you can stop
           them?

                         

                          VALKA
           I'll do my best! Come on,
           Cloudjumper!

                         
          Valka cuts the nets away and hops onto Cloudjumper, flying
          off toward the Bewilderbeasts as they charge each other,

          CLASHING TUSKS.

                         
          Drago LUNGES at Stoick, SWIPING his bullhook.

                         

                          DRAGO
           You... I watched you burn!

                         
          The two imposing warriors CLASH WEAPONS, SLASHING and LANDING

          PUNCHES.

                         

                          STOICK
           It takes more than a little fire to
           kill me!

                         
          Valka flies between the Bewilderbeasts, waving her staff
          commandingly, but to no effect.

                         

          BACK TO STOICK AND DRAGO

                         
          As Drago hooks and yanks the axe out of Stoick's hands.
          Gobber flies by and HURLS his mace attachment.

                         

                          GOBBER
           Stoick!

                         
          Stoick catches it and lands a direct hit on Drago.

                         
          But, with a devastating SWIPE, DRAGO's Bewilderbeast takes
          down Valka's, plunging in its tusks and burying its
          opponent's lifeless body under an avalanche.

                         

                          VALKA
           No!

                         
          Hiccup and the others watch in horror as dragons everywhere
          land and bow their heads in acknowledgement of the new alpha -

          - DRAGO'S ALPHA.

                         

                          DRAGO
           We've won.

          Drago points his bullhook toward Valka and Cloudjumper.

                         

                          DRAGO (CONT'D)
           Now finish her!

                         
          Stoick whirls around, spotting Valka and Cloudjumper in the
          alpha's sights.

                         

                          STOICK
           No!

                         
          Drago's Bewilderbeast INHALES... and BLASTS! Valka steers
          Cloudjumper out of the way, but ice HITS his tail, causing
          them to SPIRAL out of control toward the icy spires.

                         

                          STOICK (CONT'D)
           Hold on!

                         
          He LEAPS onto Skullcrusher, spurring him into the air.

                         

                          STOICK (CONT'D)
           Skullcrusher, go! Come on, Gobber!

                         
          Stoick tosses the mace back to Gobber in passing, who follows
          brazenly, waving it aloft.

                         

                          GOBBER
           Right behind ya, Stoick!

                         

                         

          EXT. DRAGON MOUNTAIN - CONTINUOUS


                         
          (Scene 2000 - Stoick's Sacrifice)

                         
          With his tail impaired, Cloudjumper struggles against a
          throng of oncoming dragons. Valka is knocked off, but manages
          to cling to her dragon's neck.
          As she loses her grip and FALLS...

                         
          Stoick LEAPS from Skullcrusher and CATCHES Valka. He sinks
          his axe into an icy column, and they slide to a safe landing.
          Drago's Bewilderbeast presses closer, sniffing them out.

                         
          BACK TO HICCUP, spotting Drago on the battlefield, commanding
          the Bewilderbeast to finish the job.

                         

                          HICCUP
           STOP! Stop!

                         
          Hiccup lands Toothless a few paces from Drago and brazenly
          removes his helmet. Drago eyes him, incredulous, then begins
          to CHUCKLE.
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 76.

                         

                         

                          DRAGO
           This... is the great dragon master?
           The son of Stoick the Vast? What
           shame he must feel.

                         
          Toothless snarls, ready to blast, but Hiccup calms him with a
          hand gesture.

                         

                          HICCUP
           All of this loss, and for what? To
           become unstoppable? To rule the
           world?

                         
          Drago smirks and turns away from Hiccup.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Dragons are kind, amazing creatures
           that can bring people together.

                         

                          DRAGO
           Or tear them apart.

                         
          Drago LAUGHS mockingly, then removes his FALSE ARM, revealing
          a stump at his shoulder. Hiccup is taken aback.

                         

                          DRAGO (CONT'D)
           You see, I know what it is to live
           in fear. To see my village burned,
           my family taken.

                         
          He reattaches the prosthesis, circling Hiccup menacingly.

                         

                          DRAGO (CONT'D)
           But even as a boy, left with
           nothing, I vowed to rise above the
           fear of dragons and liberate the
           people of this world.

                          HICCUP
           Then why a dragon army?

                         

                          DRAGO
           (grinning, smug)
           Well, you need dragons to conquer
           other dragons.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Or maybe you need dragons to
           conquer people.

                          (BEAT)
           To control those who follow you...
           and to get rid of those who won't.

                          DRAGO
           Clever boy.

                         
          Drago grabs his bullhook and re-approaches Hiccup. Toothless
          readies himself.

                         

                          HICCUP
           The world wants peace. And we have
           the answer, back on Berk. Just let
           me show you.

                         

                          DRAGO
           NO! Let ME show YOU.

                         
          Drago SHRIEKS madly, summoning the Bewilderbeast. Toothless
          circles Hiccup, protectively.

                         
          ON THE BEWILDERBEAST, about to blast Stoick and Valka. It
          hears Drago's distant wails, and approaches obediently.

                         

                          STOICK
           What...?

                         
          Stoick follows its stare to the distant battlefield below. He
          spots Hiccup and Toothless a few paces from Drago.

                         

                          STOICK (CONT'D)

                          (PANICKED)
           Hiccup!

                         
          He rushes off. Valka follows, racing past Gobber as he
          finally joins them, winded from having run up the mountain.

                         

                          STOICK (CONT'D)
           Come on, Gobber!

                         

                          GOBBER
           Okay, change of plans.

                         
          He hurries back down the mountain after them.

                         

          BACK TO DRAGO

                         
          jabbing his bullhook into the ground commandingly. The
          Bewilderbeast flinches and stops, submissive.

                         

                          DRAGO
           No dragon can resist the alpha's
           command. So he who controls the
           alpha, controls them all.
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 78.

                         

                         
          Drago points to Toothless. The Bewilderbeast stares and
          HISSES, forcing Toothless to cower under a hypnotic
          ultrasonic broadcast. Toothless struggles against the alpha's
          command, writhing and grinding his head against the ground.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Toothless? You okay, bud? What's
           going on?

                         
          Toothless fights the command, shaking his head in protest.
          The Bewilderbeast insists, with a mesmerizing glare and a
          low, throaty grumble... until Toothless finally succumbs to
          its control. He raises his head, his stare vacant and
          robotic, as his pupils turn to slits.

                         
          Drago then points to Hiccup. The Bewilderbeast responds,
          HISSING again at Toothless.

                         

                          DRAGO
           Witness true strength. The strength
           of will over others. In the face of
           it, you are nothing.

                         
          Toothless slowly turns to face Hiccup. Advancing.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Uh, what did he just tell you?

                         

                         ON STOICK

                         
          Bounding across the ice, pushing himself to make it to Hiccup
          in time.

                         

          BACK ON HICCUP

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Toothless, what's the matter with
           you? What're you doing?

                         
          Hiccup is backed against fallen ice, with Toothless advancing
          mindlessly, and nowhere to run.

                         
          Toothless opens his yawning mouth. Gas seeps from his throat.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Knock it off! Stop! Snap out of it!

                         
          Stoick barrels through ice formations and over war machines,
          racing against time.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Toothless! No! Toothless! Don't!
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 79.

                         

                         

                          STOICK
           Hiccup!

                         

                          HICCUP

           STOP!

                         

                          STOICK

           SON!

                         
          Hiccup sees Stoick about to run into the fray.

                         

                          HICCUP

           DAD! NO!

                         
          Toothless BLASTS.

                         
          Stoick leaps in front of it, shoving Hiccup out of the way
          and absorbing the blast in the process. He's thrown against
          the ice with great impact.

                         
          ON VALKA, hearing the blast, horrified.

                         
          Drago glances back, seeing Stoick laying lifeless in the
          aftermath, pleased by the sudden turn of events. He shuffles
          off, satisfied.

                         
          Stunned, Hiccup comes to and sees Stoick in the rubble. He
          rushes past the still-entranced Toothless, straining to
          scatter the ice boulders on top of Stoick's body.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Dad!

                         
          Valka arrives, winded and aghast.

                         

                          VALKA
           Stoick...
          She helps Hiccup to turn Stoick's body over. Valka presses
          her ear to Stoick's heart, confirming his death with a mere
          glance to Hiccup. He tears up, overwhelmed.

                         

                          HICCUP
           No... you...

                         
          Gobber, Astrid, Eret, and the Gang arrive, slack-jawed.

                         
          Satisfied, the Bewilderbeast turns away, releasing Toothless
          of the trance-like state. Toothless blinks, coming to and
          confused. He approaches the group, sniffing Stoick's hand.
          Hiccup SHOVES him.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           No! Get away from him!
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 80.

                         

                         
          Toothless recoils, innocently.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           GO ON! GET OUT OF HERE! GET AWAY!

                         
          Toothless retreats like a scolded dog, ear plates back and
          head hung low. Valka watches, broken-hearted, as Hiccup falls
          upon Stoick, inconsolable.

                         

                          VALKA
           It's not his fault. You know that.

                         
          On the battlefield, the alpha BELLOWS, calling all of the
          dragons to gather. Meatlug, Stormfly, Hookfang and the others
          all follow the command as the Gang calls after them.

                         

           VALKA (O.S.) (CONT'D)
           Good dragons under the control of
           bad people do bad things.

                         
          Drago notices Toothless tumble down a snow-bank, once again
          slit-eyed and entranced, but unable to fly to the alpha
          without a rider. Drago pins him down, eyeing the saddle,
          pedals, and prosthetic tail.

                         
          ON HICCUP and VALKA

                         
          In tears as Toothless rises into view, with Drago in the
          saddle.

                         

                          DRAGO

           GATHER THE MEN AND MEET AT BERK!

                         
          His soldiers cheer in the thousands.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Toothless!
          Hiccup tries to go after Toothless, but Valka holds him back.

                         

                          VALKA
           No, don't!

                         
          Drago JABS his bull hook and points toward the horizon. The
          alpha BELLOWS, commanding an exodus as it leads the way.

                         

                          DRAGO
           Move out!

                         
          Hiccup watches, powerless as all dragons TAKE WING and
          follow.

          EXT. DRAGON MOUNTAIN - LAGOON - DUSK


                         
          (Scene 2100 - Viking Funeral)

                         
          A KEEL grinds against the shoreline pebbles as a listing,
          battered ship is pushed into the still iceberg-filled lagoon.

                         

           GOBBER (V.O.)
           May the Valkyries welcome you, and
           lead you through Odin's great
           battlefield. May they sing your
           name with love and fury, so that we
           might hear it rise from the heights
           of Valhalla... and know that you've
           taken your rightful place at the
           table of kings.

                         
          Bows and pitch-dipped arrows are gathered from the
          battlefield. Gobber hands a set to Hiccup, meeting his eyes
          with sympathetic glance.

                         

           GOBBER (V.O.)
           For a great man has fallen. A
           warrior. A chieftain. A father. A
           friend.

                         
          Hiccup dips his arrowhead in a smoldering chunk of wreckage,
          igniting the pitch that coats the tip.

                         
          He releases his arrow, which sails through the air and lands
          on the deck of the ship, where Stoick is laid out on a pyre,
          covered by a sail, his axe upon his chest.

                         
          The others follow Hiccup's lead. They DRAW BACK in unison and
          LOOSE their arrows, filling the sky with crisscrossing,
          flaming streaks. They arc over the lagoon and set the ship
          alight.
          ON HICCUP, fighting back emotion and losing the battle.

                         

                          HICCUP
           I'm sorry, Dad.

                         
          He eyes the engulfed ship.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           I'm not the chief that you wanted
           me to be. And I'm not peacekeeper I
           thought I was. I don't know...

                         
          Valka watches him, her heart breaking. She steps forward.
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 82.

                         

                         

                          VALKA
           You came early into this world. You
           were such a wee thing. So frail, so
           fragile. I feared you wouldn't make
           it.

                         
          Hiccup lowers his eyes, but Valka lifts his chin.

                         

                          VALKA (CONT'D)
           But your father... he never
           doubted. He always said you'd
           become the strongest of them all.

                          (BEAT)
           And he was right.

                          (BEAT)
           You have the heart of a chief and
           the soul of a dragon. Only you can
           bring our worlds together. That is
           who you are, son.

                         
          Hiccup meets her bolstering stare. He turns to the ship and
          watches it in silence, silhouetted in its glow.

                         

                          HICCUP
           I was so afraid of becoming my dad.
           Mostly because I thought I never
           could. How do you become someone
           that great? That brave? That
           selfless?

                          (BEAT)
           I guess you can only try.
           (to the others)
           A chief protects his own. We're
           going back.

                         

                          TUFFNUT
           Uh, with what?

                          RUFFNUT
           He took all the dragons.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Not all of them.

          WHOOSH! WHOOSH! WHOOSH! JUVENILES BLUR past, like flying
          raptors, ZIGZAGGING wildly.

                         
          Riding bareback, Hiccup & Co. HURTLE through the narrow ICE

           Fly straight!

                         

                          FISHLEGS
           I don't want to die!

                         

                          TUFFNUT
           We can't fly these things!

                         

                          FISHLEGS
           Yeah, no kidding!

                         
          Fishlegs barrels into a snow bank, sending several chunks
          right into Eret's face as rides inverted and HOLLERING.

                         

                          ASTRID
           But won't that Bewilderbeast just
           take control of these guys, too?

                         

                          HICCUP
           They're babies. They don't listen
           to anyone!

                         

                          TUFFNUT
           Yeah, just like us!

                         
          Gobber follows up the rear clumsily, STRUGGLING for control.

                         

                          GOBBER
           This... is... very dangerous!

                         
          He PULLS ALONGSIDE Hiccup and Valka.

                         

                          GOBBER (CONT'D)
           Some might suggest this is poorly
           conceived.

                          HICCUP
           Well, it's a good thing that I
           never listen.

                         
          A SHARP RIDGE RUSHES up at them. They're going to CRASH.
          Hiccup ROUNDS one side of it, and Gobber flies down the other
          side. They shout through gaps in the iceberg.

                         

                          GOBBER
           So what IS your plan?!

                         

                          HICCUP
           Get Toothless back and kick Drago's-

                         
          He's interrupted by another closure in the gaps of ice. They
          blast out of the other side.

                          GOBBER
           Heads up!

                         
          They SPLIT to avoid another peak and then reconvene, only to
          find another icy outcropping directly in their path.

                         

                          HICCUP
           And that thing.

                         
          Gobber HITS it, with a THUD and a YELP.

          (Scene 2450 - Hiccup Vs. Toothless)

                         
          Torches burn in their braziers as Berk slumbers... until the
          Bewilderbeast approaches, STOMPING down on the monolithic
          Viking statues that guard the harbor.

                         

                         

          INT. GOTHI'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS


                         
          The sound of destruction rouses a flock of Terrible Terrors
          and Gothi, who was sleeping under the dragons. Their pupils
          turn to slits, and heeding the ultrasonic call, they fly off.

                         
          Gothi shuffles onto her deck, confused, then GASPS at
          horrifying sight.

          A Gronckle lounges peacefully by the fire, as his Viking
          owner lavishes him with scratches.

                         

                          HOARK
           Ah, that's a good boy!

                         
          The Gronckle's eyes suddenly turn to slits and it, too, takes
          wing, knocking over a chair and table as it heads for the
          door.

                         

                          HOARK (CONT'D)
           Watch the furniture! Where are you
           going?

                         
          It barrels out of the hut and into the night sky as the
          Viking rushes to the doorway, spotting the same arresting
          sight with a gasp.

          EXT. GREAT HALL - CONTINUOUS


                         
          Vikings pour out of the Great Hall as all of Berk's dragons
          fill the night sky and join the ranks of Drago's growing

          DRAGON ARMY.

                         
          The Bewilderbeast rises out of the sea, bearing down on the
          people of Berk as Drago hovers on Toothless, leading the
          charge. The Vikings stare, aghast.

                         

                          DRAGO
           Your chief is dead.

                         
          Waves of shock and whispers of "Stoick?" spread through the
          crowd.

                         

                          DRAGO (CONT'D)
           No one can protect you now.

                         
          He thrusts his bull-hook, commanding the Bewilderbeast to
          fire. The Vikings watch in horror as the Bewilderbeast opens
          its yawning jaws and BLASTS.

                         

                         

          EXT. SKIES/BERK - NIGHT


                         
          Dragon roars grow louder as Hiccup & Co. approach through
          clouds, racing against time.

                         
          They collectively GASP at the sight of Drago's Bewilderbeast
          having now covered most of the village in explosions of ice.
          Berk's now commandeered dragons circle in a huddle behind
          him, joining Valka's flock, and corralled by Drago's armored
          dragons.

                         

                          HICCUP
           No...

                          FISHLEGS
           He took all the dragons!

           Distract the alpha. Try to keep his
           focus off of Toothless.

                         

                          TUFFNUT

           Have you forgotten who you're
           riding with?

                         
          He brazenly aims his baby dragon toward the Bewilderbeast.

           There isn't a dragon alive that I
           can't wrangle!

                         
          His baby dragon dives toward the sea instead.

                         

                          ERET (CONT'D)
           Except for this one!

           Amateur.

                         
          The others shrug and follow. As they get closer, the
          Bewilderbeast looms bigger and BIGGER.

                         
          Berk's Vikings in hiding notice Hiccup and the others as they
          approach.

                         

                          VIKING #1
           Look, it's Hiccup!

                         
          The Vikings CHEER.

                         
          ON DRAGO, surprised to see Hiccup and the others approaching.

                         

                          DRAGO
           What?

                         
          With an irate HUFF, the Bewilderbeast focuses on Hiccup,
          gaining ever closer to Toothless.

                         
          Suddenly, a SHEEP appears in its sight, rising and falling
          out of view. The Bewilderbeast blinks, confused.

                         
          It looks down to see Eret catching the falling sheep and
          reloading it into the game launcher, as Tuffnut cocks the
          mechanism and Ruffnut pulls the trigger.

                          RUFFNUT
           Keep `em coming!

                         
          Snotlout tosses the black sheep to Tuffnut.

                         

                          SNOTLOUT
           Black sheep, baby!

                         
          Exasperated, the alpha inhales, about to blast, when... HONK!
          The game horn blares, breaking his concentration.

                         
          He turns, finding the horn unmanned. The Bewilderbeast then
          returns his focus to the sheep launcher, until the BLACK
          SHEEP LANDS on the his face, bouncing down his facial spines
          and becoming lodged.

           Ten points!

                         
          The Bewilderbeast shakes the black sheep off and prepares to
          blast again.

                         

                          SNOTLOUT (CONT'D)
           Uh-oh...

                         
          HONK! The alpha whips around -- still no one at the horn.

                         
          ON FISHLEGS, giggling and hiding behind the game horn.

                         
          The Bewilderbeast finally lets loose the ice blast, covering
          the entire horn in jagged spikes... as Fishlegs leaps from
          the platform.

                         

                          FISHLEGS
           I'm okay!

                         

          BACK TO HICCUP

                         
          as he reaches Drago, hovering directly in Toothless' sights.

                         

                          DRAGO
           You certainly are hard to get rid
           of. I'll say that.

                         
          Hiccup ignored him and focuses on Toothless' slitted pupils.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Toothless? It's me, bud. It's me.
           I'm right here. Come back to me.

                         
          TOOTHLESS' POV: Hiccup appears as an unfamiliar red blur,
          still firmly under the control of the Bewilderbeast.

                          DRAGO
           He is not yours anymore. He belongs
           to the alpha!

                         
          Drago smugly sits back in the saddle, his arms open in
          invitation.

                         

                          DRAGO (CONT'D)
           But, please, oh great dragon
           master, try to take him. He will
           not miss a second time.

                         
          Hiccup holds strong, maintaining eye contact with Toothless.
          He reaches out to touch him.

                          HICCUP
           It wasn't your fault, bud. They
           made you do it.

                         
          Drago's amusement fades as Toothless stirs. His pupils
          DILATE, then NARROW again.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           You'd never hurt him.

                          (BEAT)
           You'd never hurt me.

                         
          Drago watches, amazed, as Toothless fights the control.

                         

                          DRAGO
           How are you doing that?

                         
          Hiccup holds the stare, tears in his eyes.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Please. You are my best friend,
           bud.

                         
          Bewilderbeast ROARS a forceful command.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           My best friend.

                         
          Toothless' pupils jitter, then DILATE fully. He coos
          sympathetically.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Thatta boy! That's it! I'm here!

                         
          Toothless' eyes finally dilate fully and resolve on Hiccup's
          familiar face.
          Drago goes from astounded to alarmed. Drago STRIKES Toothless
          with the bull hook in a vain attempt to regain control.

                         

                          DRAGO
           No!

                         
          Toothless ROARS defiantly, snatches the bull hook in his
          jaws, and PULLS... yanking Drago off of his back and sending
          him both PLUMMETING to the sea.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Yeah!

                         
          But without a rider, Toothless drops out of the sky as well.
          Hiccup leaps from the baby dragon, diving after him.

          Drago breaks his fall, landing heavily upon the
          Bewilderbeast's tusk...

                         
          As Hiccup tucks in his arms, trying to close the gap between
          he and Toothless before they both make impact with the ocean.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Almost there, buddy. Almost there!

                         
          Hiccup reaches Toothless. They pair up, mid-air, and
          skyrocket past Drago as he hobbles to the top of the alpha's
          head.

          (Scene 2500 - One True Alpha)

                         
          Hiccup looks back at Drago, now issuing commands from the top
          of the Bewilderbeast's head.

                         

                          DRAGO
           Do something!

                         

                          HICCUP
           We need to get those two apart.

                         
          Hiccup flies Toothless past a flag pole tears a strip of the
          flag.

                         
          The Bewilderbeast BLASTS in their direction, barely missing
          them as they disappear around the back of a mountain.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           We gotta block him out, Toothless.
           Do you trust me, bud?

                         
          Toothless coos, allowing Hiccup to BLINDFOLD him with the
          flag. Hiccup calms him with a touch.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           We can do this. You and me. As one.

                         
          Hiccup SPLAYS Toothless' mechanical tail. Toothless responds,
          MATCHING the move with the natural half.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           That's it. Now let's try this one
           more time!
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 90.

                         

                         
          They PEEL around the other side of the mountain, heading
          back toward Drago and Bewilderbeast, passing Astrid and the
          cheering Vikings on the ground.

                         

                          ASTRID
           Take them down, babe!

                         
          The Viking roar in support as Hiccup and Toothless race past.

                         
          Valka watches with pride as her son hurtles towards Drago and
          the alpha.

                         

                          VALKA
           Go get `em.

                         

                          DRAGO
           Take control of it!

                         
          The Bewilderbeast's HISS becomes a furious ROAR, but to no
          avail. Hiccup clamps his hands over Toothless' ear plates,
          muffling the alpha's commands.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Shut it out, Toothless!

                         

                          DRAGO

           STOP THEM!

                         
          The Bewilderbeast BLASTS!

                         

                          HICCUP

           NOW!

                         
          Toothless suddenly PULLS UP, ARCING over Drago's head! Drago
          LAUGHS, victorious, then pauses in shock.

                         
          DRAGO'S POV: as Toothless climbs inverted through the sky,
          the blindfold falls free, revealing an EMPTY SADDLE.

                         
          Drago WHIRLS around, wide-eyed, to see...

                         
          HICCUP ZOOMING TOWARD HIM, his wing-suit deployed, and his
          Dragon Blade trailing Zippleback gas. Drago SWIPES but misses
          him. Hiccup clicks the lighter and ignites the gas, blasting
          Drago off his Bewilderbeast with a SCREAM.

                         
          Drago PLUMMETS, BREAKING HIS FALL against the massive
          dragon's spines and landing hard on the ground, his bullhook
          landing just out of reach.

                         
          The Bewilderbeast WHIPS its tail, trying to SWAT down Hiccup.
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 91.

                         

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Not again.

                          (BEAT)

           TOOTHLESS! IT'S NOW OR NEVER!

                         
          Toothless pops open his dorsal blades, arcs skyward, and
          rejoins Hiccup just before colliding with the alpha's tail.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Come on, bud!

                         
          Together again, they speed along the length of the thrashing
          tail...

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Hold on!

                         
          And shoot past the tip of the tail, narrowly making it!

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Yeah! We did it!

                         
          They arc through the sky and LAND a few paces from Drago,
          kicking up a trail of dust.

                         
          Battered and weary, Drago reaches for his bullhook. Hiccup
          extends and fires up his Dragon Blade, hurling it like a
          javelin, and sticking it in the ground between Drago and his
          weapon, singeing his outstretched hand.

                         

                          DRAGO
           Agghh!

                         

                          HICCUP
           Hold him there Toothless!

                         
          Toothless SNARLS a warning, ready to blast.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           It's all over now.

                         
          But the cloud of dust settles, revealing the Bewilderbeast,
          rising behind Hiccup, ready to blast him instead.

                         

                          DRAGO

                          (GRINNING KNOWINGLY)
           Or is it?

                         
          Hiccup spins around, alarmed, as a RUSH of water THUNDERS up
          the Bewilderbeast's throat.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Oh, no!
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 92.

                         

                         
          It BLASTS, but Toothless leaps into the way, shielding Hiccup
          beneath him. The freezing explosion envelops them both.

                         
          Drago laughs to himself as Valka lands her baby dragon and
          rushes to the icy explosion, hammering away at it
          desperately.

                         

                          VALKA
           No! No...

                         
          ON ASTRID and GOBBER, watching from a distance, horrified. As
          Valka POUNDS at the ice, a GLOWS forms from deep within. She
          realizes what is about to happen and backs away.

                         
          A BLAST thunders from inside the ice, SHATTERING it.
          Toothless emerges from the debris, revealing Hiccup curled
          safely under his wings.

                         
          Toothless is steaming, his black skin glowing blue with rage,
          his split dorsal blades searing with blue heat, a glow
          emanating from his flared nostrils.

                         
          He turns back to Hiccup, to check if he's unharmed, then
          turns his full attention back to the Bewilderbeast. He leaps
          out of the crater and lands upon an ice spire, roaring
          ferociously.

                         
          The Bewilderbeast bellows back at this affront. Toothless
          unleashes a salvo of plasma into the Bewilderbeast's face,
          not letting up.

                         

                          HICCUP
           He's challenging the alpha!

                         

                          VALKA
           To protect you.
          The Bewilderbeast ROARS at this act of insubordination.
          Toothless fires back, time and again, fully in control.

                         
          The alpha thrashes his tusks through the ice, trying to smash
          Toothless, but he deftly spring from spire to spire,
          continuing his unrelenting attack.

                         
          In the midst of the mayhem, the horde of commandeered dragons
          -- both Berk's and Valka's -- break free from the control to
          witness Toothless' retaliation.

                         
          Toothless lands protectively by Hiccup and Valka, commanding
          the dragons to shift sides. The follow, amassing behind
          Toothless.

                         
          Seeing this, Drago panics and rushes toward the
          Bewilderbeast.
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 93.

                         

                         

                          DRAGO
           No, no, no, no! Fight back! Fight!

           FIGHT!

                         
          Drago clambers up the Bewilderbeast's tusk, totally unhinged.

                         

                          DRAGO (CONT'D)
           (to the defecting dragons)
           What's the matter with you?

                         
          The Berkians swell in to show their unified support. Drago
          fumes as Hiccup and Toothless fly up together onto an ice
          spire.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Now do you get it? This is what it
           is to earn a dragon's loyalty.

                          (BEAT)
           Let this end now.

                         

                          DRAGO
           Never! Come on!

                         
          He hammers the Bewilderbeast, spurring it into a charge.

                         
          Toothless calls over his shoulder, commanding the dragons to
          ready themselves. He then BLASTS the Bewilderbeast, mid-
          charge. Suddenly, Skullcrusher fires. Followed by another,
          and another.

                         
          Hiccup looks around, amazed to see the flock of dragons
          opening fire on Drago and his Bewilderbeast. They've started
          a rebellion.

                         
          Drago is forced to hide from the fiery barrage by taking
          cover in the tall spines of the giant's crown.

                          DRAGO (CONT'D)

           FIGHT! BLAST THEM!

                         
          His prosthetic arm is blasted clean off by one of his own
          armored dragons.

                         
          The Bewilderbeast rears back to cover them all in ice, but
          Toothless lets loose a powerful shot. The Bewilderbeast's
          head is KNOCKED backward by a blue-flame fireball.

                         
          As the smoke clears, one of its massive TUSKS FALLS to the
          ground, sheared clean off. Drago glares at Toothless.

                         
          Toothless ROARS commandingly, calling an end to the fight.

                         

                          HICCUP
           The alpha protects them all.
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 94.

                         

                         
          Overwhelmed and overpowered, the Bewilderbeast yields to the
          new alpha and heeds Toothless' command, retreating into the
          sea in an explosive splash.

                         
          The Berkians CHEER in victory!

                         
          As the smoke clears, Hiccup and Toothless see nothing but
          bubbles on the waves to mark their disappearance. No sign of
          the Bewilderbeast... or Drago.

                         
          Toothless hops down from the spire, cooling off, as people
          celebrate all around them.

                         
          All of the dragons -- Berk's, Valka's, even Drago's -- land
          around Toothless. Cloudjumper bows to Toothless, starting a
          wave of bows, acknowledging their new alpha.

                         
          Toothless looks around, surprised, then lets out a majestic
          ROAR. The assembled dragons join in, roaring in tribute.

                         
          Toothless turns to Hiccup as he approaches.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           You never cease to amaze me, bud.
           Thank you.

                         
          Toothless GURGLES and licks Hiccup's face. Hiccups squeals,
          trying to get away.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Toothless! You know that doesn't
           wash out.

                         
          The crowd laughs. All around them, Berk's dragons reunite
          with their Vikings.

                         

                          ASTRID
           Stormfly!

                         
          Stormfly bounds into Astrid.

                         

                          GOBBER
           Oh, give me a cuddle, Grumpy!

                         
          Grump lands ON TOP of Gobber, flattening him.

                         
          Relieved to the point of tears, Snotlout and Fishlegs race
          towards the expectant Ruffnut...

                         

                          FISHLEGS
           Who's my little princess?

                         
          ... and then right PAST her to embrace their dragons.

                          FISHLEGS (CONT'D)
           I missed you so much!

                         

                          SNOTLOUT
           Don't you ever leave again,
           Hookfang!

                         
          Ruffnut GRUMBLES, dejected. Barf dips his head in to console
          her.

                         

                          RUFFNUT
           Oh Barf!

                         
          She hugs him. Belch looms in for some affection, but Ruffnut
          pushes him away...

                         

                          RUFFNUT (CONT'D)
           Not you.

                         
          And into Tuffnut who glowers back at her.

                         
          Hiccup smiles, taking in the happy reunions. Skullcrusher
          approaches him, without an owner to reunite with. Hiccup pets
          him, as Eret approaches.

                         

                          ERET
           That was some pretty fine dragon
           wrangling back there. You'd make a
           good trapper.

                         
          Before Hiccup can respond, Skullcrusher nuzzles Eret
          affectionately. Eret chuckles and gently strokes him.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Y'know, Skullcrusher's gonna need
           somebody to look after him now.

                          ERET
           Me?

                         
          Hiccup nods reassuringly. Eret looks at Skullcrusher, pausing
          to consider it.

                         

                          ERET (CONT'D)
           I'd be honored.

                         
          Valka walks up to her son, bursting with pride.

                         

                          VALKA
           Your father... he'd be every bit as
           proud as I am.

                          HICCUP
           Thank you. I'm really glad you're
           here, Mom.

                         

                          VALKA
           And here I'll stay.

                         
          Toothless arrives, purring at Valka's touch as Astrid strides
          toward Hiccup, beaming proudly.

                         

                          ASTRID
           See? I told you it was in here.

                         
          She places her hand upon his chest, then quickly pokes the
          dorsal fin button, popping it open. She GIGGLES.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Ha, ha. Still doing that one?
           That's hilarious.

                          (THEN)
           Come here, you.

                         
          He scoops Astrid close and pulls her into a kiss. Gobber
          covers a gawking boy's eyes.

                         

                          GOBBER
           Ooh.

                         
          Gothi, the elder, taps Hiccup's shoulder, interrupting the
          romantic moment. She gestures for Hiccup to kneel. He does
          so, respectfully.

                         
          Using ash from a heap of burnt wreckage, Gothi traces a
          Viking symbol onto Hiccup's forehead. She bows.

                         
          Hiccup stands, meeting Gobber's proud, smiling eyes. Gobber
          turns to the silent crowd and throws up his arms.

                          GOBBER (CONT'D)
           The chief has come home!

                         
          The Berkians erupt with cheers and applause as Hiccup takes
          in the moment, acknowledging the weight of responsibility now
          upon him.

                         
          Toothless throws back his head and BLASTS in celebration,
          spurring all other dragons to follow suit, lighting up the
          sky in a spectacular display.

                         

                         

          EXT. BERK VILLAGE - DAY


                         
          (Scene 2700 - A New Beginning)
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 97.

                         

                         
          A sheep grazes lazily on the grass as a Terrible Terror
          struggles in vain to carry him off. Suddenly, both are
          snatched up by a passing dragon.

                         

                         

          IN THE AIR

                         
          Ruffnut and Tuffnut wrestle over the sheep atop Barf & Belch.
          Ruffnut send the sheep flying toward Fishlegs. Snotlout nabs
          it instead, blowing a kiss mockingly.

                         

           HICCUP (V.O.)
           This... is Berk. A bit trampled and
           busted and covered in ice, but it's
           home. It's our home.

                         
          They swoop past a gathered crowd on the battered bleachers as
          Snotlout dunks the sheep in his basket. Eret joins the race
          atop Skullcrusher.

                         
          They fly past Hiccup and Toothless, who are steadily hoisting
          a palette of timber and supplies onto a rooftop where workers
          are rebuilding the damaged houses.

                         
          Hiccup then turns his attention to a massive statue of
          Stoick, presently under construction. He grins with pride.

                         

           HICCUP (V.O.)
           Those who attacked us are
           relentless and crazy. But those who
           stopped them? Oh, even more so!

                         
          He looks to the horizon, scanning it from east to west to
          ensure that no trouble is approaching.

                         
          Astrid and Stormfly buzz past him playfully, coaxing him to
          join the game. He smiles.

           HICCUP (V.O.)
           We may be small in numbers, but we
           stand for something bigger than
           anything the world can pit against
           us.

                         
          Astrid soars past the blacksmith stall, waving to Valka and
          Gobber as they remove the armor from Drago's freed battle
          dragons.

                         

           HICCUP (V.O.)
           We are the voice of peace. And bit
           by bit, we will change this world.
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 98.

                         

                         
          Realizing that he's late, Gobber hurries over to the sheep
          launcher and pulls the trigger, sending the black sheep
          hurtling into the air.

                         
          Astrid and Stormfly close in on the black sheep, about to
          snatch it out of the air, when suddenly, Hiccup and Toothless
          dart past, beating them to it. Toothless looks back with a
          gummy smile.

                         

           HICCUP (V.O.)
           You see, we have something they
           don't. Oh sure, they have armies
           and they have armadas...

                         
          Toothless and Hiccup dive toward the line of baskets. As they
          approach, Toothless bounces Hiccup into the air, allowing him
          to dunk the black sheep into Astrid's basket. They reunite on
          the other side. The crowd cheers!

                         

           HICCUP (V.O.)
           But we... we have...

                         
          Hiccup and Toothless land upon the chief's dais, joined by
          Astrid, Stormfly, and the other dragon riders.

                         

           HICCUP (V.O.)

           OUR DRAGONS!

                         
          Toothless lets out a proud roar as Hiccup look out over Berk,
          gleaming with pride.

     FADE IN:

     EXT. VINCI COUNTRYSIDE - RENAISSANCE - DAY

     Beneath a jawdroppingly storybook castle, a small
     Renaissance Fair with florid awnings, demented ACROBATS
     and roaring puppets is unfolding.

     RUSTIC FARMERS and their families rumble with enjoyment
     at the Sabbath afternoon entertainment.

     Encircled by children, A JUGGLER WITH AN UNFORGETTABLY
     ETCHED FACE elegantly plucks the red balls from a pouch
     on his mule.  As he begins to juggle, a LOUD EXPLOSION
     is heard, causing him to ungracefully drop his balls
     and collapse in a heap.

     Everyone at the fair, including the puppets, looks up.

                             UNFORGETTABLE JUGGLER
               Leonardo, che pazzo.

     The juggler shakes his fist up to a swish pan that swings
     up toward a smoking window of the awesome castle...

     INT. ROOM OF THE GOLD MACHINE

     where the charismatic LEONARDO DA VINCI laughs down at
     him.  Da Vinci wears a pair of very early, very cool sun-
     glasses with his trademark beard.

     He turns and loses his smile, something extraordinary
     reflecting off his glasses.  Removing his shades, Da
     Vinci moves to the Something, a gloriously incredible
     machine.  The opening CREDITS REVEAL its dazzling idio-
     syncrasies.

     TWO COUGHING APPRENTICES haplessly try to disperse smoke
     from the still billowing, mysteriously spectacular
     Machine.  Mirrors attached to parts of it reflect beams
     of light which cut through the smoke like a Renaissance
     laser show.

                             DA VINCI
                       (silencing authority)
               Basta vapore.

     The apprentice throws a lever.  A shunt near the furnace
     turns.  Steam escapes upwards.  The machine immediately
     slows down.  Da Vinci oh-so-gently coughs and moves for-
     ward with tongs.

     A LITTLE TROUGH - IN THE MACHINE'S INNARDS

     comes to a trembling, mystical halt.  Right behind this
     trough is a CONPLEX POLYHEDRON CRYSTAL as intricately
     modulated as any Rubik stocking stuffer, but much more
     dazzling in beauty.  It gleams like a jewel in the yellow
     glow which pours from a PLEASANTLY GRINNING DEMONHEAD into
     a trough--a glow of heat--and something more than heat.

     The tongs enter the frame.

     Da Vinci brings the object closer to his face.  A murmur
     goes up from the awestruck apprentices as the Master
     peers at the smoking yellow bar.

                             APPRENTICE TWO
               Maestro, che meraviglia!

                             APPRENTICE THREE
               Lei e' proprio fantastico!

     Da Vinci's pride goes dead as the implications hit.

                             DA VINCI
               Lasciatemi, solo.  Solo!

     The apprentices scurry out.  Mind reeling, Da Vinci turns
     his back to the viewer, before a wall of frescoes.

                             DA VINCI
               L'ho fatto.

     Spinning back around, using the edge of his cloak, Da
     Vinci pulls out the large gleaming crystal with a pop.

     INT. DA VINCI'S WORKSHOP

     With an accompanying blast of smoke, Da Vinci bursts
     through some double doors into his workshop, sadly
     reflecting upon the crystal in one hand and the tonged
     bar in the other.

     His workshop is a spendiferously enigmatic blend of
     laboratory and studio; On a table in the foreground is
     a fresh clay equestrian statue; a large VOLUME of
     sketches, the inkwell nearby; a MODEL of what looks like
     a HELICOPTER; Da Vinci flings the tonged bar on the table
     among these goodies.

     Pocketing the crystal, Da Vinci meanders through his work-
     shop casually tinkering with various experiments.  He
     snaps his fingers at a BATHING SUITED APPRENTICE, wearing
     a diving helmet prototype.  The Apprentice jumps into a
     pool of water.

     Leonardo next stops at an easel displaying a finished-
     except-for-the-mouth portrait of Mona Lisa, who happens
     to be seated in a stool before the easel.  She broadly
     smiles, revealing the worst dental work of her epoch.
     Da Vinci shakes his head and moves out onto a

     EXT. CASTLE TERRACE

     A FLYING APPRENTICE sails past Leonardo in a bat winged
     glider, enthusiastically shouting.  Da Vinci grins back
     until he touches his pocket.  He pulls out the crystal
     and, after a beat, angrily twists it apart into two
     separate, geometric pieces revealing a small intricate
     mirror.  He quickly folds the surprisingly shapable
     geometric pieces.

     Calming down, Da Vinci looks from the three components of
     the crystal to each of the three unfinished works on the
     table in his workshop.  He ponders then looks back out to
     the Vinci vista.

     The bat winged glider DISSOLVES into:

     A HAWK

     who is revealed to be flying over Sing Sing prison.

     INT. A SING SING PRISON CELL

     The shadow of the hawk passes through a cell window, over
     the face of EDDIE HUDSON HAWKINS causing him to break out
     of an eye-closed trance.

     Before the viewer can get a good look at him, Hudson
     Hawk turns to an oddball version of the "Mona Lisa" that
     has his face and tears it off the cell back-wall.

     INT. PRISON BLOCK WALKWAY

     TWO PRISON GUARDS, One WISE and BLACK, the other YOUNG
     and GREEN march down a cell block.  The Former is smoking
     a pipe which the Young Guard lights with a lighter.

                             WISE GUARD
               We're losing our biggest celebrity
               today.

                             YOUNG GUARD
               You're kidding, Petey the Paint
               Thinner Killer is getting paroled?

                             WISE GUARD
               Not that slime, you Fizzhead.
               Hudson Hawk.  The last of the
               great cat burglars.

     INT. PRISON CELL WALL

     A hand tears down a picture of a happy Hudson Hawk and
     a LITTLE MONKEY, identically dressed in black cat
     burglar gear.

     THE BLOCK

     The Wise Guard and the Young Guard rumble forward.

                             WISE GUARD
               As a thief, Hawk was a poem.
               Iambic fucking pentameter.  You
               know, Crime used to have a little
               class.  A hundred reporters were
               here when he came in, now they're
               probably out covering some tired
               crack gang war...

     The Guards approach Hawk's cell.  Hawk, with his back
     turned, hefts on a nifty blazer.

                             HAWK
               Remind me to fire my publicist.

     The Wise Guard chuckles as the Young Guard fumbles with
     his key-ring.

                             YOUNG GUARD
               Darn, these are for L-block...

     Hawk's hand reaches through the bars and grabs a pipe
     cleaner from the Wise Guard's pocket.  Then the lighter
     from the Young Guard's pocket--BURNS OFF the fabric fuzz
     with the lighter beside it--bends the now blackened
     wire--and with a quick turn of the wrist uses it to
     UNLOCK the door.

                             YOUNG GUARD
               - go back down to security and-

     He stops, dumbfounded, as the door clunks open.  The
     Guards double-take as Hawk, finally in full view, struts
     past them, down the hall.  The Guards hustle to catch
     up.  The wise guard puts his finger in the air and
     sarcastically pretends to be stung by the heat emanating
     from Hawk.

                             WISE GUARD
               Guess this means, Hawk, you'll
               be able to let yourself back in...

                             HAWK
               Never happen.  Bet.  Ten bucks.

     Hawk and the Wise Guard hit fists, half-smiling.  Hawk
     unfolds the painting.

                             HAWK
               Oh, give this back to Petey in A
               block.  Tell him it was a sweet
               gift, but I think he got some
               wrong ideas about our friendship.

                             YOUNG GUARD
               The Paint Thinner Killer did
               this?  I think you picked a good
               day to get out...

     The trio comes to the final checkpoint.  Hawk takes a
     deep breath.

                             WISE GUARD
               Hope I lose the bet.  Have that
               cappuccino on me.

                             HAWK
                       (flipping him the
                        pipe cleaner)
               You got it.  A double.

     EXT. OUTSIDE THE PRISON--DAY

     Hawk strides to the Massive Sliding Concrete Door/Wall
     between him and freedom.  As music crescendos and
     Hawk glows his first smile, the door opens to reveal two
     Mafioso brothers, CESAR and ANTONY MARIO, the latter
     sitting upon the hood of a tinted window Lincoln
     Continental.  Cesar is of cool, hair-slicked-back
     attitude, his scumbag brother is not.

                             ANTONY
               Welcome back, buddy ol' pal.
               We've got a proposition...

                              HAWK
               Answer's no, not even if you
               bathe.  Cesar Mario, Antony Mario,
               how's the "Family?"  Kill any
               monkeys lately?

                              CESAR
               How many times do I have to say
               it?  I didn't put the hit on
               Little Eddie... Never had anything
               against that kooky chimp.  I
               actually found him, "endearing."

                             HAWK
               Sure.  Face down.  Two endearing
               shots to the back of the head.
               That's your mark, man.  What did
               Little Eddie ever do to...

     Smouldering, Hawk struts off.  Cesar takes a black
     canvas bag from a SCARFACED DRIVER and hustles up to
     Hawk.  The Lincoln rumbles behind them, Antony riding
     on the hood.

                             CESAR
               You're hitting Rutherford's
               Auction House.  Easy as my
               brother's wife.  Directions are
               in the bag.  Just open the seventh
               floor safe and take out the
               thingie...

                             HAWK
               Or you cut off my thingie.
               Directions even your brother
               would understand.
         
                             ANTONY
                       (defensively)
               Yeah, directions even I could
               understand.

     The car squeals to a stop.  Antony bounds off.  Cesar
     shove-throws the canvas bag into Hawk's unwilling
     hands.

                             CESAR
               Hawk, you're a great thief.  Got
               set up, did some time, nothing to
               be ashamed of.  Don't give me a
               sonata about you always just
               really wanted to settle down,
               open a hardware Store and sell
               spatulas...

                             HAWK
               If the Mario brothers weren't
               Jersey's third largest family,
               I'd say kiss my ass.  But
               considering your status, I'll
               say slurp my butt.

     Hawk fiercely push-shoves the canvas bag back into
     Cesar's hands.

                             CESAR
               What's your favorite sport, Hawk?

                             HAWK
               Baseball, why?

     Antony opens the back door of the Lincoln and says
     "Baseball."  He is handed a baseball bat.  Hawk backs
     up as Antony moves threateningly toward him.

                             HAWK
               I meant, ping pong.  Listen, I'd
               rather go back in than whore for
               you...
                       (stopping)
               Oh, I need to borrow ten dollars.

     A PRISON GUARD from above turns as not to be a witness.
     Hawk feebly calls up to him.

                             HAWK
               Help?  Police?

     Antony swings at Hawk, who pretends not to notice until
     the last second.  Hawk ducks and slam-kicks his calf.
     Antony crumples, using the bat as a crutch.  Hawk boots
     up the bat for a two-handed catch then savagely pivots
     it across Antony's face, knocking him into the backseat
     of the car.

                             CESAR
                       (unfazed)
               You need some time to think.
               That's cool, but next time, I'm
               not going to say "Please."

     Cesar floats into the backseat.  The Lincoln takes off.
     Hawk seethes...

                             HAWK
               I don't believe this.  I've been
               out forty seconds...

     A BACKFIRE rings out.  Hawk hits the ground, thinking
     it is a gunshot.

     HAWK'S ON THE GROUND P.O.V.

     A gasping 1960 Caddy comes to a stop and a pair of a too-
     fancy-to-be-tasteful shoes comes out.  Hawk looks up to
     see ALEX MESSINA, his older, maybe-maybe-not-wiser best
     friend.

                             ALEX
               That's the first thing I did.
               Smooch the ground and taste the
               freedom.  Sorry I was late.  Miss
               anything?

                             HAWK
                       (getting up)
               Your timing, and your shoes, are
               impeccable...  Good to see you,
               Alex, been having a lousy day.

                             ALEX
               Lousy day?  The man's getting out
               of prison and he's having a
               lousy day.  What, you missing out
               on the Cell Block Water Ballet
               pageant?  Believe me, it's
               overrated.

     Hawk pauses to say something, then just hugs Alex.

                             ALEX
               Where's the kiss?  No tongue this
               time, I promise.

     A laughing Hawk gives Alex's stomach a slap before
     getting in the car....

                             HAWK
               Looks like you've been expanding
               your...

                             ALEX
               Don't say it, Hawkins.  I'm
               incredibly sensitive about my
               fucking figure.

                             HAWK
               My next word was gonna be
               "consciousness."  Swear to God...
               tubby.

     EXT. THE ROAD INTO HOBOKEN--DAY

     The Caddy thunders past a sweet Manhattan view. "Come
     Fly With Me" is playing on the radio.  Hawk casually com-
     pletes an intimidating hand puzzle.

                             HAWK
               That's your definition of "Hard?"

                             ALEX
               Show off.  Hey, boss tune.  "Come
               Fly with Me."

                             HAWK
               Three minutes, 51 seconds.

                             ALEX
               Still do the puzzles, still know
               the running times of songs, and
               I'll bet you're still the best
               damn cat burg--

                              HAWK
               Not anymore.  Now I'm the laziest
               damn cat burg--I'm going to take
               it so straight that I won't tape
               a Mets game without the expressed
               written consent of the National
               Baseball League.

                             ALEX
               Now that you're born again,what
               do you wanna do?  Statue of
               Liberty?  Entertain some ladies?
               Miss Saigon tix?  Seduce some
               women?  Play Nintendo?  Bone some
               chicks?

                             HAWK
               Come on, Alex, let's just get to
               Alex's.  Your bar's the only
               place that's going to cheer me.
               God, I'd kill for a damn
               cappuccino.  What the hell's a
               Nintendo?

                             ALEX
               Oh man, you still got a thing for
               those unmasculine European coffees?
               Who's your buddy?

     Alex pulls a styrofoam cup from a paper bag.

                             HAWK
               The man knows, the man knows!

     Hawk takes off the cap with a stimulating whiff.

                             ALEX
               So Mr. Coffee, what went down
               outside the prison?

                             HAWK
               Oh, not much.  Mario Brothers want
               me to do a job.

     Alex brakes and cappuccino flies.  Hawk half-heartedly
     tries to lick up with his fingers.

                             ALEX
               Those dago-guinea-I can say
               this shit I'm Italian-wop
               motherfu--

                             HAWK
               Ah, had the perfect amount of
               foam.  Just get me to the bar...
               It's the one good thing in my
               life that'll never change....

     EXT. OUTSIDE ALEX'S BAR--NIGHT

     The Guys move through the personably Jersey face of the
     bar.  The Empire State Building beams in the background.
     Sinatra cuts off.

     INT. ALEX'S BAR--NIGHT

     It's changed.  Hawk and Alex enter into what has become
     the ultimate pseudo-art deco-fern littered-nightmare,
     packed with noisy, INSUFFERABLY SELF-ABSORBED YUPS.
     A violently erotic and pretentious video plays upon
     elevated T.V. sets set up all around the place.

     Hawk's mouth gapes as he drifts by a sickening COUPLE
     toasting wine coolers, and two very YOUNG BROKERS high-
     fiving each other after missing a dartboard.

                             ALEX
               I didn't know how to tell you.  A
               couple brokers stopped in for
               Stoley Spritzers one night.  Next
               thing I know Fast Track Digest
               votes us "Watering Hole of the
               Month."  Now, I'm shopping for
               Aqua Salmon wallpaper.

                             HAWK
               I read about these people in
               Newsweek.  Where's all the
               regulars, Crazy Jeff Cava, the
               Todd sisters, Indian Joe?  Where's
               Ed Kranepool's autograph?  Captain
               Bob's steering wheel?

                             ALEX
               Hey, get this irritable guy a
               cappuccino.  I gotta go be a boss.

     Alex lifts a piece of the bar and moves behind it.
     Snatching up a menu, Hawk calls out...

                             HAWK
               This is Pizza?  Reindeer Goat
               cheese?  I admit, I've been known
               to go wild and order a Canadian
               Bacon in my time, but..

     Hawk lights up a cigarette.  A TORTOISE SHELL NON-SMOKER
     immediately turns to him wearing a "Yes, I mind if you
     smoke" button.

                             TORTOISE SHELL NON-SMOKER
               Can you read.... smoker?

                             HAWK
               Can you take a sunrise and
               sprinkle it with dew?

                              TORTOISE SHELL NON-SMOKER
                       (Huh?)
               No.

                              HAWK
               The Candy Man can, Felix.  You
               know, I thought this was a country
               where you could do any stupid
               thing you wanted; drive to work
               naked, make love to a V.C.R.
               Guess I'm wrong.  Maybe that's
               why I became a serial arsonist.

                             TORTOISE SHELL NON-SMOKER
               Hey, it's okay, big guy.  Smoke
               all you want.  Have mine....

     The Non-smoker fumbles out a pack of cigarettes and
     flees.  A cappuccino in cup and saucer slides down the
     bar saloon-style.  A smiling Hawk picks it up, turns away
     from the bar and closes his eyes, bringing the cup to his
     lips until a POLICE BADGE swirls into frame and splashes
     into the cup, splattering coffee over Hawk's blazer.

                             GATES (O.S.)
               You're under arrest...

     Hawk makes eye contact up to a crude, coarse, and
     cackling island of a man, OFFICER GATES, amid the sea
     of oblivious and self-obsessed yuppitude, standing by
     a table.

                             GATES
               Have a seat.  Good to see you,
               buddy ol' pal...

                             HAWK
               The pleasure's all yours, Officer
               Gates.

     BACK OF THE BAR

     With concern, Alex watches Hawk sit at Gates' table.

     GATES' TABLE

     Gates pillages a plate of spaghetti and meatballs with
     terrifying precision.  Hawk tosses the badge onto the
     food.  Gates eats around it.

                             GATES
               Why do you show your parole
               officer such disrespect?
               Especially after I got you such
               a nice job.

                             HAWK
               What job?

     Gates pulls up the black canvas bag and puts it on the
     table.

                             GATES
               The auction house, asshole.  One
               night's work and you're free like
               no ex-con's ever been.  No
               checking in with a shrink, no
               community service teaching
               retards how to play air hockey.
               It's a great deal, I can't lie.

                             HAWK
               The only thing you can't do is
               get sex for free.  I know I was
               in prison for like basically the
               80's, but, call me daffy, aren't
               you supposed to stop me from
               committing crimes.  You know,
               Book-em-Dano, Call-for-backup,
               Give-a-Hoot-Don't-Pollute.

     Gates thunders out of his chair and moves around to sneer
     down at Hawk.  Behind Gates, on the T.V. screens, are
     analogous images of DISGUSTING ANIMALS AND MONSTERS.

                             GATES
               You wouldn't be out if it wasn't
               for me!  I did dog and pony for
               you!  You think they would have
               let you out after what you did,
               you told the board members they
               looked like the Three Stooges...

                             HAWK
               How was I supposed to know they
               were women?  Besides one of them
               was bald and kept saying
               "Soitinly."

     Gates simmers into his seat with a self-control smile.

                             GATES
               Remember that guy in the cell
               next to you who hung himself?

                             HAWK
               Yes.

                             GATES
               Remember that shoe you lost...

                             HAWK
               Uh, yeah.  Cut to the chase.

     Gates pulls up a shoe and puts it on the table.

                             GATES
               One phone call and your shoe
               will become a piece of evidence
               and that suicide'll become a
               murder.

     Hawk bobs under the table and up.

                             HAWK
               What else do you got under there
               ... I don't want to be rude, but
               this is all pretty lame.

                             GATES
               That's the beauty.  It's bullshit,
               but I can make it stick because
               I'm a good guy parole officer and
               you re a bad guy who's about to
               find out that there's a thin line
               between ex-con and escape con.

     Alex suddenly approaches the table.

                             ALEX
               How is everything tonight, sir?

                             GATES
               Beat it, Alex.  You're a dinosaur.

                             HAWK
               Alex, did you know this ape was
               going to be here...

                             ALEX
               Sure.  That's why his meatballs
               are made out of marinated Chuck
               Wagon.

                             GATES
                       (mouthful)
               You're full of shit.

     As Alex speaks, an eating dog is on the screens.

                             ALEX
               No, man, actually you are.  Just
               add water and it makes its own
               gravy.  Keeps your teeth healthy
               and your coat shiny.

     Gates grabs the shoes and races off, gagging.  Hawk gets
     up to laugh next to Alex.  Their laughter dies as they
     turn to look at the black canvas bag left on the table
     between them.

     INT. BACK ROOM--DAWN

     Hawk stares mournfully at a black and white photo of a
     monkey-sized chalk-outline on a city street.  Behind him,
     Alex pulls out blueprints from the black bag.  Sinatra's
     "Witchcraft" blares on the radio....

                             ALEX
               Hmmmm.....

                             HAWK
               Yo Pandora, quit hummm-ing... look
               at this.

     Hawk is rummaging through stockpiled remnants of an old,
     "true" bar.  Round lamps, tacky mirrors, pictures of Hawk
     and the Regs at the bar.  Managing a weary smile, Hawk
     lifts a ship steering wheel, while Alex puts on a pair of
     granny classes and pulls out blueprints.

                             HAWK
               It's Captain Bob's steering wheel!
               Remember when the Captain.....

                             ALEX
               Hmmm, nasty little safe on the 7th.

     Hawk nervously picks up a Rubik's Cube and holds it
     behind his back.  He brings it back around, completed.
     Sighing, Hawk drops the cube and rubs his scalp.  Alex
     starts rubbing his stomach.  They pace in pre-job
     syncopation and speak rapid-fire.

                             HAWK
               The safe's a Simpson 71.  Last
               time I played the game, Simpson
               only had a 40.

                             ALEX
               Just means it'll take you an extra
               31 seconds to seduce.  You re
               still the best, I know it.

                             HAWK
               But you got three guards who...
               Shit, what am I doing?  Where's
               the want ads?  Gonna sell some
               spatulas.

                             ALEX
               Hey, I'm sorry, man.  I'm putting
               out a fire with kerosene.

     Alex gives Hawk a consoling two-hand-shake then jumps
     back to reveal he has put Hawk into thumbcuffs.

                             HAWK
               This isn't funny.  I'm not into
               this.  I...

                             ALEX
               There goes five seconds...My
               record's eighteen.

                             HAWK
               You're not...LISTENING!

     Out of annoyance, Hawk breaks out of the cuffs and
     violently throws them at Alex, who sits down a little
     wounded.

                             HAWK
               I'm sorr--Goddamn Mario Brothers.
               Goddamn Gates.  Goddamn Rutherford
               Auction House.  By the way, how
               many seconds?

                             ALEX
               Rutherford Auction... that name...

     Alex jumps up excitedly and then convulses in pain.

                             HAWK
               Alex!

                             ALEX
               Don't wet your diapers.  I'll have
               to change them.  "Witchcraft."
               What's the running time?

     Alex flops down behind a work table before a wallfull of
     drawings of different kinds of vaults.  He sets himself
     up for an insulin injection.

                             HAWK
               3:48.  I can't get you involved,
               man.  This is my sewage and...
                       (re drawings)
               God, you love all this, don't you,
               you bastard.  Haven't you ever
               heard of stamp collecting, or
               curling?

     Hawk leans in and administers the shot of insulin to
     Alex.

                             ALEX
               I'm in.  Have you seen the public
               service announcements for Diabetes.
               We can ride horses, play LaCrosse,
               and knock off auction houses.  I
               got a plan.  You won't have to hail
               Cesar or Gates.

     Hawk collapses next to Alex, resigned to his fate.

                             HAWK
               I'm a bum.

     EXT. NICE, BUSINESS NEIGHBORHOOD--NIGHT

     TWO GRUBBY DERELICTS, one pushing a shopping cart, the
     other inside it, situated atop the usual two Glad bags.
     They are drunkenly warbling "Witchcraft."  IMPECCABLY
     DRESSED NIGHT-LIFERS give them a wide berth.

     Our derelicts pass beneath a MASSIVE RED CANOPY of a
     distinguished eight story edifice, upon which is written
     RUTHERFORD'S AUCTION HOUSE.  A DOORMAN shoos them away...

     A NEWSPAPER TRUCK pulls up in front of the Auction House.
     The Driver pops out with a bundle of papers and moves to
     a Dispenser on the corner.  The Bums wheel around the
     truck.  The Driver loads the papers and bounds back.

     The Truck pulls away from the corner.  The shopping cart
     rolls off--the bums nowhere to be seen.

     The Truck turns the corner, revealing the derelicts
     climbing up the back of it, with Glad bags around their
     necks.  The Truck moves toward an enclosed Walkway Bridge
     that connects the Auction House with another Building.

     Launching low-tech grapples, the Vagrants latch them-
     selves onto the Walkway window as the Truck passes
     beneath.

     AT THE WINDOW

     The viewer's viewpoint moves into a tighter view of the
     dangling derelicts, revealing them to, of course, be Hawk
     and Alex.  Getting a footing, on the small window ledge,
     each man cuts a hole in the window while holding onto a
     plunger.

                             HAWK
               Whoa, you better cut a bigger hole
               than that.

                             ALEX
               Hey, you promised......Don't worry,
               I'm wearing my girdle.

     INT. INSIDE THE WALKWAY WINDOW--NIGHT

     Hawk and Alex come through their window holes.  Hawk
     immediately flattens himself against a wall, whisper-
     ing...

                             HAWK
               Cameras?

                             ALEX
               No need.  Guards' station's right
               there.

     Alex points to an open doorway just down the hall where
     laughter and shadows emerge.  Hawk tries to flee, but a
     grinning Alex pulls him toward it.

     Hawk and Alex slide across the wall to a closed room
     marked POWER, which is right next to the open Guards'
     Station.  The viewer's viewpoint moves past Hawk and
     Alex lock-picking into the Power room to...

     INT. THE GUARDS' STATION

     Two Security Guards sit before a console of seven
     security screens still chuckling over an unheard joke.
     Wires coming out of the security console run across the
     floor and through the wall into...

     INT. THE POWER ROOM

     The wires go up to a row of seven humming, RECORD button
     flashing V.C.R.s.  Hawk and Alex stand before them,
     sharing a cig.

                             ALEX
               They record everything their
               video surveillance takes in...

                             HAWK
               Yes, master-thief, I can see that.
               You said something about a plan...

     Alex presses the REWIND buttons on the V.C.R.'s.

                             ALEX
               Am I boring you, smartass?  Watch.
               A little rewind and re-wire action
               and the Guards are going to be
               watching a rerun and miss out on
               our exciting episode.

     Alex pulls from a nearby shelf six tapes marked MONDAY.

     INT. SEVENTH FLOOR AUCTION AUDITORIUM--NIGHT

     Moving beneath a video camera and a dazzling Set of
     Hanging Horse Mobiles, a Heavyset guard, BIG STAN, moseys
     through the dimly lit main auction house auditorium.  The
     auditorium chairs are strewn out in the middle beside a
     turbo Floor Washer.

     Next to a painting of Happy Children Riding Horses at the
     back of the auditorium stage, Big Stan hefts himself upon
     a comparatively TINY BLUE CHAIR and begins to tip back
     and snooze.

     INT. GUARDS' STATION

     The Security Guards look to the seventh floor screen to
     see an unfolding shot of Big Stan mid-snooze.

                             SECURITY GUARD ONE
               Check out Big Stan...
                       (walkie-talkie)
               Big Stan!

     THE AUCTION AUDITORIUM

     Startled by his walkie-talkie, Big Stan falls back on the
     little chair, crunching it to the ground.

     THE FIRST FLOOR

     The laughing security guards see the crunch.

     INT. THE POWER ROOM

     Alex puts the last of the Monday tapes into a V.C.R.

                             ALEX
               You got about five minutes and
               change.

                             HAWK
               5:32.  "Swinging on a Star."

                             ALEX
               You know they invented something
               while you were inside.  Called a
               watch.

     A freight elevator pings.  Hawk opens it up as the music
     of "Swinging on the Star" kicks in on the soundtrack.

                             HAWK
               "A mule is an animal with long
               funny ears."

                             ALEX
               "He kicks up at anything he
               hears.

     Hawk crams himself into the freight elevator with his
     Glad bag.  Strenuously upbeat Ray Conniffesque singers
     continue to sing the song, orchestrally accompanied, when
     Hawk isn't.

     INT. THE FREIGHT ELEVATOR

     Hawk takes over the song, sardined in the elevator.

                             HAWK
               "Or would you rather swing on a
               star, carry moonbeams home in a
               jar."

     POWER ROOM

     Alex goes up to a Circuit Box and pulls down two large
     Switches.  The soundtrack singers continue to warble.

     THE GUARDS' STATION

     The lights of the floor wobble and die.  The console
     screens blink off.  The Security Guards stop laughing.

                             SECURITY GUARD TWO
               Hell-o.  Check the Power room,
               bud...

     Security Guard One harrumphs into a standing position...

     POWER ROOM

     Alex speedily hooks and rehooks the backs of the V.C.R.S.
     They now all have their PLAY buttons lit up.

                             ALEX
               swing on a star, carry moonbeams...

     OUTSIDE THE POWER ROOM

     Security Guard One fishes for keys to open the power
     room.  The soundtrack singers whisper as not to give away
     Alex.

     INSIDE THE POWER ROOM

     Alex briskly slams back up the switches.

     OUTSIDE THE POWER ROOM

     The singers go louder as the lights come back on.
     Security Guard One harrumphs and heads back to the
     Guards' Station.

     THE AUCTION AUDITORIUM

     Hawk scrambles out of the freight elevator in the left
     wall of the Auditorium, glancing to the clock.

                             HAWK
               "Or would you rather be a fish?"

     He pulls out the black canvas bag from his Glad bag and
     takes out the blueprints.  Hawk follows them toward the
     painting on-stage.

     THE GUARDS' STATION

     Big Stan comes up from behind his fellow guards, dumping
     the remains of the chair on the floor.

                             BIG STAN
                       (moving back off)
               Very funny.

     The Seventh Floor Screen shows a peaceful auction
     auditorium.  And the Blue Chair.

     THE AUCTION AUDITORIUM--CAMERA P.O.V.

     From the exact angle, the viewer sees the current state
     of the room with Hawk flinging off the painting of the
     horseback children, revealing a safe.  But no Blue chair.

     HAWK

     spits on the rubber cup of an electronic sensor, plugged
     into a Walkman, and affixes it to the safe above the
     dial.

                             HAWK
                       (lyric trouble)
               "A fish is annuh nan na nan na
               brook.

     THE FREIGHT ELEVATOR

     Alex is now packed into the freight elevator.

                             ALEX
               "He can't write his name or read
               a book.  To fool people is his
               only thought."

     THE AUCTION AUDITORIUM

                             HAWK
                       (remembering)
               "And though he's slippery, he
               still gets caught."

     Wearing headphones, Hawk cranks up the Walkman and spins
     the dial.  The CLICKS from the dial are so loud he winces
     and turns down the volume.  Then there's a CLUNK.

     THE GUARDS' STATION

     With the soundtrack singers taking over, Guard Two sips
     a cup of coffee.  He doesn't swallow.

     His sights zero in on the Blue Chair on the seventh
     screen.  He looks to the chair remains, then back again.

                             SECURITY GUARD TWO
               Uh, Jerry.  I'm looking at the
               seventh floor and I don't know
               how to say this, I see the Blue
               Chair.

                             SECURITY GUARD ONE
               What the... You think that's weird,
               check out screen two.....

     Screen Two shows THE TWO SECURITY GUARDS THEMSELVES
     hatching open some on-duty beers, going down a hall.
     Guard Two looks to the empties atop the console....

                             SECURITY GUARD TWO
               Somebody rewired the recorders!

     AUCTION AUDITORIUM

     Hawk ditches his accessories and swings the safe door
     open.

     Inside the safe, along with the "holy" Da Vinci music
     cue, is the clay equestrian model from Leonardo's
     worktable.

     Hawk belts out as he put it in the black canvas bag.

                             HAWK
               "And all the monkeys aren't in
               the zoo."

                             ALEX (V.O.)
               "Every day you meet quite a few."

     Alex gives Hawk a congratulatory pat.

                             HAWK AND ALEX
               "So you see it's all up to you.
               You can be better than you are.
               You could be swinging on a star."

     THE AUCTION ROOM

     BIG STAN reconnects the wires of the seventh V.C.R.

     THE GUARDS' STATION

     Suddenly, on the seventh screen, the image and voices
     of Hawk and Alex in-process comes on.

                             SECURITY GUARD ONE
               Shit, let's roll!

     THE AUCTION AUDITORIUM

     Hawk puts the painting back up, but stops to stare at the
     playful children.

                             ALEX
               The song's over!  Come on!
               "You could be swinging on a star."

                             HAWK
               What am I doing here?  There are
               so many things I wanna do that
               aren't this.  Paint a lighthouse.
               Kiss a woman in Italy.

                             ALEX
                       (more frantically)
               "You could be swinging on a star."

                             HAWK
               Paint a woman in a lighthou--I
               don't want to steal a horse.
               Life is...

     Hawk's soliloquy is cut short as Security Guards One and
     Two crash into the auction auditorium.

                             ALEX
                       (DEADPAN)
               "You could be swinging on a star."
               You couldn't have waited to see
               a psychiatrist.  No, you had...

     Alex whips his chair at the floor washer, tipping it
     forward and causing its electrical cord to pull up and
     trip the Guards into a bellyflop.

     Hawk bolts right at the bustling up guards and locks them
     into Alex's thumbcuffs.  He then limbos under their
     connected arms and springs over the outstretched washer
     cord.  The Security Guards clumsily turn and re-trip
     themselves.

                             HAWK
               Let's go down the freight elevator.

     Big Stan suddenly unhatches from the freight elevator.

                             ALEX
               Keep those ideas coming.

     Hawk and Alex run toward an office located at the right
     wall.  They both do a Gene-Kellyesque-chair-tip-over
     before simultaneously bashing through the office door.

     INT. DARKENED AUCTION AUDITORIUM OFFICE

     Hawk and Alex stop in the office to painfully laugh and
     rub their funny bones.  Alex stops laughing.

                             ALEX
               I'm not as unpleasantly plump as
               that Guard am I.

     Big Stan fires off a warning shot.  Hawk and Alex quickly
     tear up a window.

     Moving out on to a ledge, Hawk and Alex look down to the
     huge auction house awning and trade gulps.

     Big Stan wobbles into the mouth of the office door.

                             HAWK AND ALEX
               I got a bad feeling....

                             HAWK
               I can't even swim.

                             ALEX
               Hell, the fall'll probably kill
               ya...

     Big Stan raises his gun.

     Hawk and Alex jump and AAAGH down the face of the
     building....

     Closer and closer to the awning....

     The viewer focuses upon Hawk as he free-falls......

                                                CUT TO:

     RIGHT INTO A LAZ-Y-BOY CHAIR

     Hawk continues his "fall" into a ridiculously huge
     reclining chair.  The foot stand swooshes out with a
     thump.  A HAND pulls away the canvas bag with a cackle.

     INT. GATES APARTMENT--LATE NIGHT

     Hawk's weirdly reclining viewpoint makes Gates and his
     pad more grotesque than they are (No small feat.)
     A sub-Radio Shack stereo coughs next to a scary punch
     bowl of red, margarita-like substance, beneath the
     instantly recognizable framed picture of Those Dogs
     Playing Poker, all atop a Jungle Shag.

     Gates, in shorts and a Hawaiian shirt-over-a-KEEP ON
     TRUCKIN'-T-shirt, raises a loud tumbler with one hand,
     the black canvas bag in the other.

                             GATES
               Hudson Hawkins gets the chair of
               honor.  How about a Gates-arita?
                       (toward bowl)
               I used real hot dogs.

                             HAWK
               Weren't you the bartender at
               Jonestown?

     Suddenly a light is turned on in the corner, revealing a
     seated Cesar and Antony Mario, the latter taking a painful
     Gatesirita sip.

                             CESAR
               Good job, not pretty, but good.

                             HAWK
               Ah, the mafia, the cops; do I know
               how to party or what?

     Gates pulls out the horse and looks at it.

                             GATES
               All this trouble for a horsey.
               I may not know art, but I know
               what I like.

                             HAWK
                       (to Dog picture)
               You certainly do.

                             GATES
               So when's that Sebastian-Cabot-
               Buckingham-Palace-looking-
               Butlerhead getting here?

                             ALFRED
               Any minute now, dear Mr. Gates.

     A malevolently snobbish British Butler, ALFRED, enters in
     distaste.  He makes a stressful glance to three VANITY
     FAIRS on a coffeetable that has a photo of a MAGNETIC
     HUSBAND-WIFE-DOG COMBO with the caption: MAYFLOWER POWER.
     Hawk notices this.

                             GATES
               Oh, sorry Jeeves.  Gates-arita?

                             ALFRED
               I'll pass.  May I?

     Alfred takes the equestrian model and with a jeweler's
     loupe, studies it carefully.

                             ALFRED
               Ah, such craftsmanship.  Leonardo
               Da Vinci's last commission for the
               Duke of Milan.  Irreplaceable.

                             GATES
               Hey, Mr. French, I'm delirious
               for you.  Now where's my cut?

     With dignity, Alfred SMASHES the ancient horse over
     Gates's head.  Alfred rummages through the debris
     REVEALING a perversely labyrinthine CRYSTAL PIECE.
     (recognizable from Da Vinci's workshop).

                             GATES
               You son-of-a......I don't believe
               this!  You come into my house!

     Alfred pockets the goodies, but not before Hawk can give
     them a confused peruse.

                             GATES
               I ought to take Big Ben and shove
               it up your limey blimey bunghole!

     A blade slides down Alfred's arm.  Half-yawning, he...

     ALFRED'S 180 DEGREE POV

     spins before Gates and the bystanders behind him.
     THE BLADE goes back up Alfred's arm.

     The room's only sound is the stereo's inappropriate
     music.  Gates shrugs but his voice is off.

                             GATES
               Like I said.  Where's my cu-u-...

     Suddenly a line across Gates's neck turns red and blood
     begins to gush like a tourist attraction.  Gates crashes
     down upon the table holding the punch bowl and the stereo,
     sending it to the ground, cutting off the music.  The Dog
     Poker picture falls atop the carnage like a lid.

     Blown away, Hawk tries to wiggle his way out of the
     recliner.  Alfred pats some stain remover on the blood
     on his shirt.

                             ALFRED
               So much for his "cut."
                       (post-chortle)
               Excuse my dry British humor.

                             CESAR
                       (rising)
               Lovely work, Alfred, taking the
               Concorde back?

                             ALFRED
               Indeed I am, Mr. Mario.  I'm
               really racking up those frequent
               flyer points...

                             HAWK
               I hate to interrrupt you two
               lovebirds...

                             ANTONY
               You know, I think Gates promised
               Hawk a cut, too....

     The Mario brothers cackle out.  Hawk tries to flail out
     of his chair.  Alfred turns to him and flicks up his arm.
     Hawk sees his life pass before his eyes until he realizes
     Alfred is merely pulling him up off the chair.

                             ALFRED
               Ta ta, Hudson Hawk.

                             HAWK
                       (breathless)
               Too-do-loo, babe.

     INT. ALEX'S RESTAURANT--DAWN

     Hawk bursts into the bar.  Alex sits on a stool, reading
     the paper.

                             ALEX
               Did I miss anything?

                             HAWK
               Oh, not much.  Gates just had his
               tonsils taken out.  The hard way.
         
                             ALEX
               Geez, Gates was killed.  Who do we
               send the thank you note to?
         
     Hawk does a combat jump over the bar and begins to fiddle
     with the cappuccino machine.

                             HAWK
               The Butler did it.  Guy was a cross
               between Alistair Cook and a Cuisinart.
               Dude took Mr. Ed and humptied
               dumptied it over Gates's head.  He
               said it was made by, get this,
               Leonardo..

                             ALEX
                       (professorial)
               Ah yes, a rare Renaissance piece.
               Da Vinci's "Sforza," an equestrian
               model of a never executed statue.
               I consider it to be the prize of
               tonight's auction of objets
               d'equestrian.  Horse things.

     The cappuccino machine sparks.  A perplexed Hawk takes
     a couple extra seconds to back off.

                             HAWK
               Okay, you got me, Mr. PBS.

                             ALEX
                       (holding up newspaper)
               Morning edition.  Seems two thieves
               "attempted" to steal it last night,
               but thanks to three "courageous"
               guards, it will be ready for tonight.

                             HAWK
               "Attempted."  At-tempt-ted!  I'm
               not happy about having to steal
               that horse, but I do have my
               pride.  Face it, when it comes to
               burglary, and sex, I....

     Hawk takes the newspaper.  There is a picture of the
     Three Security Guards in a cheery pose behind the
     "Sforza."  Hawk squints to see that Security Guards One
     and Two are still wearing the thumbcuffs.

                             HAWK
               Boing.  Uh, this I don t understand...

                             ALEX
               Why try?

                             HAWK
                       (hurdling the bar)
               Because I'm tired of not
               understanding things.  Cops,
               Mafia, and butlers forcing me to
               bust my ass to steal something,
               which it turns out I really didn't
               steal--it's fucked up.

                             ALEX
                       (pulling back newspaper)
               You re not thinking of going to...

                             HAWK
               Alex, my man, it's time to play a
               little offense.  Where's your tux?

     INT. RUTHERFORD'S AUCTION HOUSE--NIGHT

     Dressed in a not-quite-fitting but suave tuxedo, Hawk
     enters the now well-lit auction house auditorium (chairs
     all set out).  Bored WORKMEN in coveralls lug equestrian
     items on to a podium from the familiar freight elevator.

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
               ...fan-taas-tic example of
               Florentine marble... Who will start
               at 160,000...160,000......180,000.

     Someone raises their paddle as Hawk passes beneath the
     hanging horses and finds an aisle seat near the stage.
     Hawk scans everyone in the room before coming to the one
     seated next to him, AN ENCHANTINGLY BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.

                             HAWK
               All these years of attending auctions,
               I still get goosebumps.  The paintings,
               the sculptures....the things that
               aren't really paintings or sculptures...

                             THE WOMAN
               .... the pretentious vultures who
               don't even look up from their
               calculators to see what they're
               buying.  Now that gives me
               goosebumps.  Auctions are
               disgusting.

                             HAWK
               I couldn't agree more.  Savages.

     The Woman laughs at his gear switch then catches herself.

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
               Lot Fifteen, an equestrian sconce
               attributed to the Cellini school..

     AUCTION ENTRANCE

     Big Stan, the hefty guard from the heist, enters the area
     wearing a blue ribbon.

     AUCTION AREA

     Big Stan is walking in back of the seated bidders:  An
     oblivious Hawk in the foreground starts to scan VARIED
     BIDDER-TYPES, raising their paddles to babble out dollar
     figures; a GAUDY ROCK STAR and his GLOOMY-CHIC ENTOURAGE,
     A KING FAROUK-TYPE with a BORED TEENAGE AMERICAN HOOKER,
     and a scary NORDIC PRINCESS in a monocle and a tiara.

     THREE STANDING ASSISTANTS frantically man a table of
     phones set up down before the stage.  One raises his
     arm.

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
               Sold!  To the caller from
               Newfoundland.

     A STYLISH FEMALE ASSISTANT takes out an impressive replica
     of the "Sforza" from the safe behind the podium and brings
     it to the Auctioneer.  The crowd a-a-hs... Hawk laughs
     and shakes his head.

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUTIONEER
               And finally, Lot number 17,
               thought to be lost in the war,
               and again last night, the Da
               Vinci "Sforza," the jewel of the
               sale.  Fan-taas-tic...

                             HAWK
                       (re: Auctioneer)
               Is looking like a constipated
               warthog a prerequisite to getting
               a job in the art world?

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
               There have naturally been questions
               of its authenticity, so to verify
               we have Doctor Anna Baragli of the
               Vatican.  Doc?

                             ANNA
                       (rising, to Hawk)
               Some of us warthogs are more
               constipated than others.

     Hawk uneasily laughs as Anna makes her way up the stage
     and pulls out a large magnifying glass.  A look of
     distress passes over her face.  Hawk closes his eyes in
     anticipation.

                             HAWK
               Oh, the shit is going to hit the
               fa--

                             ANNA
                       (suddenly serene)
               Fantastic.  Perfection.  The
               Vatican extends its jealousy to
               the lucky bidder.

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
               We'll begin the bidding at 82.5
               million dollars.  To you, sir.
               Eighty-three, Ninety--your bid,
               madame--Ninety point five.....

     Hawk opens his eyes in confusion.  He scans Anna coming
     off the stage, gliding toward the phone table.  Hawk
     floats into the aisle, curling toward her as she picks
     up a phone and murmurs into it.

                             DARWIN MAYFLOWER
               lOO million clams, Francesco!

     The crowd orgasms as Vanity Fair cover boy, DARWIN
     MAYFLOWER works the aisle, playfully mussing up the
     appreciative, tiaraed Princess's hair, giddily high-
     fiving the Rock Star, and sloppily frenching the Hooker.

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
               100 million dollars to Mr. Darwin
               Mayflower.

     Hawk turns to gaze at the enigmatically familiar figure.
     Anna looks up from the phone to do the same.  She
     swerves her attention to the back-turned Hawk.

     Darwin moves to one of two reserved empty seats as his
     wife, Minerva, makes her entrance par excellahnce.  She is
     outrageously dressed with a mammoth Tiffany watch that
     extends from her wrist down to, acting as a leash,
     her obnoxious little dog, BUNNY.

                             MINERVA
               Francesco, 100 million and one.

     Darwin, to the crowd's delight, holds his struck heart.

                             DARWIN
               Outbid by my own wench, quelle
               bummere.

                             MINERVA
               Poor baby..... Here, Bunny.

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
               Fan-taas-tic, the bid is at 100
               million and one dollars.

     Commencing a slow motion sequence, Big Stan comes out
     of the nearby office, zipping up his fly.  He immedi-
     ately scopes Hawk in the space before the stage.

     The Mayflowers lower themselves into their seats with
     devoured canary smiles.

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
               Go-ing!

     Big Stan pulls out his gun, untheatrically, as not to
     cause a scene.  Anna sees this and follows Big Stan's
     eyeline to Hawk.

     Hawk turns to re-pursue but stops dead at the sight of
     the gloating Big Stan.

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
               Go-ing!

     Big Stan launches a gallop toward Hawk, who spins and
     veers back round up the aisle.

     The Mayflowers zero their sights on the activity.

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
               Gone!

     The gavel comes down in super slow-motion.

     Anna's leg pokes out of the aisle, tripping the guard.

     Hawk brakes at the end of the Mayflower's row and smiles
     in relief, casually turning to Darwin and Minerva.

     The gavel continues to come down in super slow-motion.

     Both Darwin and Minerva Mayflower suddenly DUCK DOWN.

     Smile vanishing, Hawk spins toward the stage.

     The Gavel hits.

     Breaking out of slow-motion into wide-angle, the entire
     podium explodes sending debris, equestrian pieces, and
     eccentric bald pieces searing into the screaming,
     battered crowd.

     Knocked off his feet, Hawk gropes into a standing
     position.  He sees the Mayflowers make a smooth exit.
     He starts to give chase until he sees a battered Anna
     rising from the ground.

     A hanging white Tri-Star Pegasus, cracks from the
     damaged ceiling and swooshes down towards Anna.

     Hawk bolts upon some auction chairs and makes a flying
     leap.  He slams Anna out of the Pegasus's pulverizing
     Path.  They weary up off the ground and move down the
     aisle, calm in a storm of packed art patrons.

                             ANNA
               My God, that was bold of you,
               you didn't have to do that...

                             HAWK
               Forget about it--it was nothing--
               anybody would have done the same
               thing--It's an impulse...

                             ANNA
               No, I meant you didn't have to
               tackle me and rip my dress.  A
               polite push, perhaps?  A clear
               shout of "watch out, Anna"
               would have done nicely...

                             HAWK
               Excuse me, Milady.  I would have
               flown over and carried you up to
               a pink cloud, but I left my cape
               at the cleaners.

     Anna touches Hawk's lips and laughs.

                             ANNA
                       ("Hey, I was kidding")
               Thanks tough guy, thanks a lot.
               Why was the guard chasing you?

                             HAWK
                       (Serious answer?
                        Na-a-h?)
               Because Danger, Doc, is my middle...

     Before Hawk can finish, a hanging horse out of nowhere
     hammers him into the ground and the viewer into
     darkness.

     FADE IN:

     INT. VAN-TYPE AMBULANCE--NIGHT

     Hawk stirs into consciousness strapped on an elevated
     gurney.

                             HAWK
               Saint Pete, hey I know, the whole
               cat burglar thing, it sounds bad,
               but I'll take the worst cloud you
               got...

     Hawk's eyes focus.  The Mario Brothers hover over him.

                             CESAR
               News flash.  You're not in
               heaven.  Yet.  30 seconds and
               counting, if you know what I'm
               saying.  Couldn't just play along,
               could you...

     EXT. THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE--NIGHT

     The ambulance careens onto the Brooklyn Bridge.

     INT. INSIDE THE AMBULANCE

     Antony raises up a mammoth gun.

                             HAWK
               Pretty class way of covering your
               tracks.  I think that auctioneer
               landed at La Guardia.

                             ANTONY
               Subtlety was never one of our
               strong points.

                             HAWK
               Neither's flossing.

     A confused Antony touches his teeth with his gun hand.
     Hawk escapes from one of his straps and launces a nearby
     trayful of syringes into Antony's face where they ghoul-
     ishly quiver.  Antony fires a wild shot, shattering the
     partition.

     FRONT SEAT OF THE AMBULANCE

     The Scarfaced Bodyguard/Driver, now in paramedic white,
     freaks at the starred windshield.

     THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE

     The ambulance bumper-pools off some innocent cars.

     INSIDE THE AMBULANCE

     Hawk frantically tries to undo his other strap but a
     howling Cesar, side-stepping his vibrating-on-the-floor
     brother, latches onto the back of the gurney and wrenches
     it backward.

     OUTSIDE BACK OF AMBULANCE

     The elevated gurney blasts out the back with a now
     unstrapped but terrified Hawk whoa-a-ing atop it.

     The gurney wheels hit the road, sparking.

     A sheet from the gurney, caught on the door, yanks TAUGHT
     --Hawk is "water skiing" on his stomach atop the elevated
     gurney!

     Screeching cars are weirded out by the new vehicle on the
     road.

     THE GURNEY

     Battered by wind and fear, Hawk clutches to the gurney
     and the sheet with a grit teeth stoneface.

     The sheet is torn from the gurney sending it rocketing
     off to the side on its own crazed volition.

     Hawk skis toward a TOLL BOOTH WITH A LARGE GATE-ARM.

                             HAWK
               Life don't get much better than
               this.

     He then sees he's heading toward an EXACT CHANGE lane.

     Whizzing wildly forward on the gurney, Hawk scrambles
     into his pocket and wiggles out some change.  He fran-
     tically winnows out some pennies and then maniacally
     FLINGS the change from twenty feet away.

     TOLL BOOTH

     The change ker-chunks into the basket and Hawk and the
     gurney JUST BARELY streak underneath the rising Gate-arm.

     EXT. THE AMBULANCE

     CRASHES through a gate-arm of another lane.  Hawk and the
     still-wildly whooshing gurney cut it off.

     FRONT SEAT OF THE AMBULANCE

     Cesar pops his head through the partition.

                             CESAR
               Make him into Roadkill!

     Antony, seemingly oblivious to the syringes porcupined in
     his skull, pokes his head next to Cesar's.

                             ANTONY
               Yeah, run him down!

     Cesar and the Bodyguard/Driver turn to Antony and scream,
     then all three look out the windshield and scream.

     THE AMBULANCE

     jackknifes over a stopped car and somersaults into a
     fiery ball.

     In the foreground, Hawk's gurney coasts down

     A PEACEFUL OFF-ROAD

     Hawk, with an unchanged expression of pure white knuckle
     fear, comes to a tranquil gurney-wheels-gently-squeaking
     stop.

     Lit by the flames of the ambulance crash, a sneering
     young man in wire rim glasses emerges from the darkness,
     carrying a steel suitcase.  He kneels before Hawk and
     opens the suitcase revealing a complex computer appara-
     tus.  He begins mumbling into a cellular phone.

     A malevolent, SILENT DEADPAN WRAITH passes him and
     approaches Hawk.  Both men are dressed in outfits that
     seem to be a melange of fascist uniform and haute
     couture.

     On the fingers of one Wraith hand is carved the word
     HATE.  On the other hand is the word FROG.  The Frog Hand
     hands a befuddled Hawk a card.  It reads: MY NAME IS KIT
     KAT AND THIS IS NOT A DREAM.

     Hawk looks up with a "huh" expression as Kit Kat chops
     his neck, knocking him off the gurney.

     The sneering computer guy hangs up his phone and pulls
     forward a small cattle prod from his apparatus.

                             HAWK
               This is the worst night...

                             SNICKERS
               When it rains, it pours.  Name's
               Snickers.  The plane leaves in 40.

     Snickers zaps Hawk in the leg with his device.  Hawk a-
     a-ghs into a kneeling position.  Snickers returns to his
     suitcase and is passed by a PLEASANT YOUNG BLACK WOMAN in
     the "outfit."

                             ALMOND JOY
               Almond Joy.  I know, pretty silly.
               But it's better than when we first
               started out, our code names were
               Diseases.  You don't know what
               it's like being called Clymidia
               for a year.
                       (walking off)
               Whoops, forgot....

     She deftly kicks Hawk across the face.  Hawk angrily
     bounds back up until he sees the BIGGEST MEMBER OF THE
     GROUP Fe-Fi-Fo-Fum his way toward them.  Suddenly, the
     Giant clumsily trips over Snickers' suitcase apparatus
     and ram-collapses into Hawk and the gurney.  Laying atop
     Hawk, Butterfinger goofily speaks...

                             BUTTERFINGER
               My name's Butterfinger.

                             HAWK
               No shit.

     The mysterious group parts to reveal a much more mature
     and cynically subdued man dressed in big lapels and a hat
     that screams Old Time CIA.  His name will be GEORGE
     KAPLAN.

                             KAPLAN
               Don't you just hate kids...

                             ALMOND JOY
               George, you promised.  No Old CIA/
               New CIA jokes...

                             KAPLAN
               I call them the MTV.I.A.  Punks
               think Bay of Pigs is an herbal tea.
               They think the Cold War involves
               penguins and...

                             HAWK
               Don't I know you...

                             KAPLAN
               You just might.  I'm the guy who
               tricked you into robbing a
               government installation and then
               had you sent to prison for it.  At
               the time, I was bald with a beard,
               no moustache, and I had a different
               nose, so if you don't recognize me,
               I won't be offended.

                             HAWK
               Bastard, you're going to need
               another nose!

     Hawk explodes upward.  Everyone but cool Kaplan draws a
     gun.

                             HAWK
               But I'm not the type of guy to
               hold a grudge.

                             KAPLAN
               I used you as a diversion.  while
               you were getting captured upstairs,
               I was shredding documents in the
               basement.  Deep down, I guess I
               was just jealous.  You were one
               incredible thief...

                             HAWK
               To what do I owe the dishonor of a
               reunion, you centrally intelligent
               scumsicle.

     As Kaplan converses, Snickers and Butterfinger bring out
     a mammoth empty suitcase and open it behind Hawk.

                             KAPLAN
               I Want to make things up to you.
               That's why I got you this gig,
               doll.  Hawk, my name's George
               Kaplan and to quote the late,
               great Karen Carpenter, "We've only
               just begun."

                             HAWK
               Three minutes, twenty-three
               seconds.  If you think I'm doing
               another...

                             KAPLAN
               Hush.  My employer wants a meeting.

                             HAWK
               Employer?  The president?

                             KAPLAN
               No, somebody powerful.  Oh.  Look.
               what's that up there?

                             HAWK
               I'm supposed to fall for that?

                             KAPLAN
               Shucks.  Guess not.

     Kaplan savagely point-blank punches Hawk in the face,
     knocking him out cold and into the mammoth suitcase.
     Snickers slams it shut revealing a KENNEDY INTERNATIONAL
     sticker.

     INT. MYSTERIOUS BARE ROOM--DAY

     Hawk slowly awakens on an exotic couch.  He has been put
     in an aggressively fashionable Italian outfit.  He eyes
     and touches his new duds with complete bafflement.  He
     then stumbles into a standing position to, mouth gaping,
     take in a wondrous 360 degree view of Rome, Italy as "O
     Solo Mio" blares on the soundtrack.

                             HAWK
               No.  Way.

     Hawk's spinning view and the music on the soundtrack slam
     to a halt as he zeroes in on the sight of Scary Butler
     Alfred elegantly reaching the top of the staircase.

                             ALFRED
               Welcome to Rome, sir.

                             HAWK
               Yes way.

     EXT. OUTSIDE INTERESTING BUILDING--DAY

     Alfred opens the back door of an omnipotent, Mayflower-
     logoed LIMOUSINE.  The car moves off as Hawk slides in...

     INT. THE BACK SEAT OF THE MAX-TECH LIMOUSINE

     facing Darwin Mayflower who is blustering into the
     cellular.

     While he talks, Darwin shakes Hawk's bewildered hand,
     then holding up one finger in a "be with you in a sec"
     facial move.

                             DARWIN
               For those kind of wages, I could
               have built the factory in America!
               They're Vietnamese, can't we just
               give them more Bart Simpson shirts?
               I hear depressing news like this
               and I want to commit genocide!
                       (slamming phone)
               Alfred, hold my calls.  So, Hawk!
               The Hawkster!  What do you think
               of the vehicle?

                             HAWK
               You could host American Bandstand
               in here.  Why did you duck at the
               auction, asshole?

                             DARWIN
               Because I didn't want to get hurt,
               taterhead.

     A FAX MACHINE comes to life as Darwin babbles.

                             DARWIN
               What can I tell you, I'm the
               villain.  Initially it was a
               priority to keep a lot of buffers
               between you and me, but since most
               of them are dead now, I thought
               what the heck.  Hawk, you come
               highly recommended.  I would have
               done some things differently at
               the auction house, but hey, I want
               to be in business with you.

     Darwin scans the Fax message with annoyance, and then
     shoves it into a violent paper shredder.

     OUTSIDE THE LIMO SHREDDER

     Shredded paper litters out of a vent on the outside door.

     INSIDE THE LIMOUSINE

     A simmering Hawk tries to explode but the phone rings.

                             HAWK
               My life is not some deal.  I...

                             ALFRED (O.S.)
               It's Boston, Mr. Mayflower.

                             DARWIN
               I'm sorry, I have to take this.
               Those are valid points though...

     Darwin picks up the phone and goes Mr. Hyde, while giving
     Hawk "Can you believe this guy"-type gestures.

                             DARWIN
               You better have a good excuse...
               You better have a better excuse!
               You are so weak!  I'm only
               thankful your ancestors didn't
               settle America or else my name
               would be Running Brave or Vomiting
               Antelope...Really.  Well, listen
               close, babe.

     Darwin holds the phone over a 50 cent piece-size siren in
     his armrest.  Darwin presses a button and a PIERCING
     NOISE fills the car as it comes to a stop.

                             DARWIN
               Shall we?

     Darwin bolts out.  Hawk hangs back, waiting for Rod
     Serling to explain things, then bolts out too.

     EXT. E.U.R. DISTRICT BUILDING--DAY

     Hawk and Darwin head up the steps of an overpowering
     fascistly marble superstructure.  Alfred brings up the
     rear.

                             DARWIN
               So Hawkasaurus, I won't mince
               words...

                             HAWK
               Whatever.  You own Boardwalk, you
               own Park Place, you own the four
               railroads.  You think you're God.
               For all I know, you're probably
               right.  I just wanted to have a
               damn cappuccino, maybe play some
               Nintendo after I find out what it
               is.  Man, why didn't you just buy
               the horse?  What am I saying, you
               did buy it...

                             DARWIN
               Oh... Let's see.  There are
               organizations that think we wanted
               the "Sforza" for reasons other
               than putting it in the Da Vinci
               museum we're building in Vinci.
               Hopefully, these organizations
               think our plan has been ruined
               with the explosion of our replica.
               If I seem vague, grand.  We want a
               low profile on this, that's why I
               got Kaplan and the Candy bars
               involved.  I helped George help
               the Mario Brothers and Gates help
               get you out....

                             HAWK
               If you're pausing for a "thank you,"
               give it up.  So boss, you going to
               tell me what the crystal piece
               inside the pony means?

                             DARWIN
               Way to go, Alfie!  How many people
               did you break that thing in front
               of.   Good help's hard to find.

                             HAWK
               I guess that's a no.

     INT. MASSIVE CONFERENCE ROOM--DAY

     A mind-blowingly pretentious painting of Darwin, Minerva,
     and Bunny hangs above a mammoth M-shaped conference table.

     Lying atop the table in heels, shades, and a heart-
     stopping dark outfit is Minerva.  NASTY Metal riffs semi-
     audibly spew from a headset she wears.

     Surrounding the table is a VARIED GROUP OF OLD MONEY AND
     NEW MONEY BOARD MEMBERS ranging from a nine year old
     INDIAN PRINCE to a SWEET ELDERLY AMERICAN WOMAN.  They
     converse to the person at their side in businesslike
     tones, oblivious to Minerva.

                             DARWIN
               Ladies and gentlemen of the board...

     The board members go into tableau silence.  Minerva con-
     tinues a brief sing-a-long before Darwin scolds...

                             DARWIN
               And Min-er-va.  Let's give it up
               for Hudson Hawk.

     The board applauds as Alfred pushes Hawk inside.

                             MINERVA
               Hello......Bunny, Ball-Ball!

     Minerva lobs a ball in the air.  Bunny, the annoying dog,
     scurries beside Hawk to catch it.

     Moving down toward the other end of the table, Hawk takes
     in the surreal surroundings with battle fatigue.  He sees
     ONE BOARD MEMBER take a luxurious sip of cappuccino.
     Minerva paces up upon the table.

                             DARWIN
               Hawkmeister, we got you clothes,
               great hotel, and a 250,000 lira
               per diem.

                             MINERVA
               That's two hundred dollars a day?
               So he can get a hooker and some
               tequila.  Veto, Darwin.

                             HAWK
               Guess I know who wears the penis
               in this family.

                             MINERVA
                       (jumping off table)
               For God's sake, chain this
               convict.

     With a yawn, Alfred pulls out a pair of state-of-the-art
     handcuffs.

                             HAWK
               Alfred, you're a very polite
               psychopath, but if you...

     Hawk kicks out at Alfred, who nimbly moves slightly and
     gives a pummel to Hawk's body somersaulting him over the
     edge of the table, into an empty seat.

     The Board Members politely applaud.  Alfred pulls Hawk's
     hands around his back and cuffs him.  Bunny intensely
     sniffs his crotch.

                             MINERVA
               We want Da Vinci's sketchbook,
               what do they call it, the Codex.

                             DARWIN
               Listen Hawk, this might be hard to
               believe, but I'm a regular joe.  I
               just want to be happy and happiness
               comes from the achieving of goals.
               It's just when you make your first
               billion by the age of 19, it's
               hard to keep coming up with new
               ones.  But now finally I got my
               new goal.  World domination.  With
               your help...Bunny....quit that!

                             MINERVA
               Bunny, ball-ball!  Bad bunny!

                             HAWK
               Think he's already got today's
               ball-balls.  Five more minutes
               please, it's been so long...

     Minerva yanks away the yelping dog.

                             HAWK
               Anybody have a cigarette?  But
               seriously, do me a favor and
               Concorde me back to prison.  I
               don't care anymore.  I hope you
               have the receipts for the threads.

                             MINERVA
               You go back, you won't be alone.
               You'll have a diabetic barkeep
               cellmate.  You're still young
               enough to have fun shanking child
               molesters for a pack of smokes,
               but "Alex" will go in knowing that
               the next time he gets out it'll be
               to attend his own funeral.
               Depressing.

                             HAWK
               You wouldn't risk the dime to call
               the police.  You have no proof.

                             DARWIN
               Ah, the magic word...

     Alfred plants a slide machine on the table and Darwin
     starts clicking gorgeous images of Hawk and Alex robbing
     the auction house, on a bare wall.

     The Board members gush.  The Elderly Woman gives a
     thumbs-up.

                             DARWIN
               It's veja du, Hawkhead.  Something
               you wish never happened.  We shot
               the entire operation with hidden
               cameras behind the hidden cameras.
               Hired the guy who did the last
               Sports Illustrated Swimsuit issue.
               Excellent work... whoops, damn
               Fotomat assholes...

     A slide hits the wall of himself and Minerva kneeling in
     Big Baby clothes with Alfred snarling over them, decked
     out in leather.  He clicks ahead...

     Hawk looks away and sees that the Board members have an
     annual Report-type booklet in front of them that reads--
     THE DA VINCI/ALCHEMY PROJECT.

     Minerva leans over in front of him.

                             MINERVA
               Tomorrow, you're going to hit a
               church.

                                               CUT TO:

     EXT. A MASSIVE WIDE SHOT OF ST. PETER'S--DAY

     The Vatican stands in its glory, mobbed by HUNDREDS OF
     LOCALS AND SIGHTSEERS.  The viewer's viewpoint zeroes in
     on the Mayflower limousine circling around it.

     INT. THE LIMOUSINE

     Hawk looks out from the back seat of the limousine
     in stylish Italian sunglasses.

                             HAWK
               I'm robbing the Vatican.  The nuns
               at St. Agnes predicted that I'd end
               up doing this...

     Two identical Twin Flunkies sit across from him, grinning
     stupidly.  Hawk pushes up his sunglasses with his middle
     finger.

     INT. VATICANESQUE MAP ROOM

     Mentally casing the joint, Hawk gets some distance
     between him and the flunkies as he enters into a room
     that has a glorious, ancient Map of the World Mural.

     INT. ANOTHER VATICAN ROOM

     Hawk makes a scribble in a notepad before coming to a
     Vatican guard, standing before a painting of a Pope
     performing a Coronation.

                             HAWK
                       (half-hearted)
               Excuse me, I'm being blackmailed
               into robbing the Vatican by a
               psychotic American corporation
               along with a CIA...

                             VATICAN GUARD
               "You're being".....uh, I don't,
               uh...

     A jaded Hawk laughs and pats the cop on the back.

                             HAWK
               Forget it, man.  Go tackle a
               jaywalker.

     INT./EXT. CIRCULAR OPEN AIR HALLWAY

     Hawk comes out onto a circular open-air hallway.  He
     scans up to some rooftops and makes a note...until he
     sees a line of International Phone Boothettes.  Checking
     for Flunkies, he rips one up.

                             HAWK
               Operator, I want to make a collect
               call to Alex Messina, New York....

     The Flunkies drift into view.  Hawk hangs up and seethes
     off.

     INT. HALLWAY LEADING TO CODEX ROOM

     Hawk saunters down a long resplendent hallway toward a
     room at the end bustling with excitement.  Coming to the
     mouth of the room, he looks to two gold framed mirrors on
     either side of the opening, rubs his head, and scribbles.

     INSIDE THE CODEX ROOM

     Hawk takes in the majestic beauty, and practical details,
     of the room--windows, statues, a Massive Ornate Lighting
     Fixture--as he moves down one of the twin winding stair-
     cases leading to a path of people behind velvet ropes and
     the object of their gaze...

     THE DA VINCI CODEX

     --an old book enclosed in a glass case, propped open to
     the familiar BEAUTIFUL DRAWING of a MAN inside a CIRCLE.

     The case is located between two informational tablets
     enclosed in glass columns.  Enter Holy Da Vinci theme.

                             ANNA (V.O.)
               But it is his gift as an inventor
               who drew together science and art
               that is most incredible.

     Hawk brightens to the return of Anna, carrying a portfolio
     bag, striding down the stairs with a group of INVESTORS
     AND FAMILIES.  She brightens back, giving him a quick
     verbal breath and a hand squeeze.

                             ANNA
               Tough guy.  What are you--How's
               your head.

                             HAWK
                       (vegetable)
               Yes, and my giraffe loves it, too...

     She laughs, going into her public voice.

                             ANNA
               As you know, the Da Vinci Codex,
               has lived in the Vatican for
               centuries and will continue to
               live here for centuries more.

                             HAWK
                       (under his breath)
               That's what you theenk.

                             ANNA
               Question, sir?   His untiring pen
               predicted the airplane, the
               submarine, the bicycle, the
               helicopter, and even the tank.
         
     A LITTLE BRAT trailing the group, moves next to Hawk,
     bitching away to her STUFFED ELEPHANT, POKEY.

                             LITTLE BRAT
               This is so bor-ing!  Do you hate
               Italy as much as I do, Pokey?
                       (bad ventriloquism)
               Si, senor!  Italy sucks the big
               one!  why can't we go to the Epcot
               Center!

     The Little Brat stops and lets Pokey the elephant dangle
     from her side.  Hawk eyes the elephant strangely.

                             ANNA
               These more dangerous designs
               inspired him to develop a secret
               code that ....

     The stuffed elephant suddenly goes flying over Anna's
     head.

     The ALARM goes off.  The Massive Ornate Lighting Fixture
     swoops down from the ceiling, inverting in air, and slams
     down over the Codex, transformed into a makeshift cage.

     Strange green gas comes billowing out of the vents.
     Needless to say, everyone goes crazy.

     Coughing gas, Hawk peeks to see that a line of light
     sensor alarms imbedded in the tablets are what set the
     alarm off.

     Two GAS MASKS drop airlinesquely from the mouth of the
     entranceway and TWO RACING-IN GUARDS wrangle them on.

     The Little Brat sees that Pokey the stuffed elephant has
     been beheaded by the cage/lamp.  She is pulled away and
     spanked.

                             LITTLE BRAT
               Pokey, come back!

     Anna yanks a notetaking Hawk away as the gas blusters in
     around him.  The Two Flunkies, eyes on Hawk, are hap-
     lessly making their way up the opposite staircase.

                             ANNA
               Come on, this stuff will knock you
               out.  Have you ever had the feeling
               you were being followed, Mr. Bond.

                             HAWK
               Never, why do you ask?

     Reaching the top of the stairs, just outside the door,
     Anna briskly pulls Hawk into a PIECE OF WALL THAT IS
     REALLY A DOOR.  The wall closes as the Flunkies come
     flying out, baffled.

     INT. CIRCULAR STAIRCASE

     Hawk, mucho impressed, and Anna move down a tight, dark
     circular staircase.

                             HAWK
               Whoa.  Name's Hawkins, Eddie
               Hawkins.
               My nickname's Hudson Hawk, but don't
               call me Hudson, not even as a joke.
               The Nuns at St. Agnes called me
               that and they're the ones who
               helped make me what I am today.
               Not a compliment...

                             ANNA
               Sure Hudson.  Are you going to
               tell me why you did that back there
               or are you going to blame it
               on Dumbo?

                             HAWK
               Could you believe that crazy
               elephant?

     Anna shakes her head as she opens a door into...

     INT. A LITTLE UNDERGROUND SUBWAY--DAY

     A four foot high mail train rumbles down the track of a
     mini-underground station.  Workers latch onto mail bags.
     Hawk and Anna emerge from a small door.

                             HAWK
               Whoa, part 2.  Does it go to Times
               Square?

                             ANNA
               Delivers up to ten at night.  The
               Pope has an obsession with his
               Easter Seals.  It's actually not
               that an unusual set-up.  The
               secret passageway on the other
               hand....

                             HAWK
               The Vatican is made of constant
               mysteries meant to be enjoyed,
               not explained.

                             ANNA
               Nice.  But right out of our
               brochure.

                             HAWK
               Oh, you read that.

                             ANNA
               Actually I wrote it.  It's a good
               sentence.  It can apply to people.

                             HAWK
               You're not an unmysterious thang
               yourself.

                             ANNA
               I don't steal stuffed elephants
               from little girls.
                       (smoothing his
                        jacket)
               And I buy my own clothes.  My
               life's a little boring...

                             HAWK
               God, I wish I could say the same
               thing.  What about having a nice,
               dull dinner with me tonight.
               Scrabble, Knock-knock jokes,
               Anecdotes about famous dead
               Italians....

                             ANNA
               I'll bring my entire repertoire...

     The Two Flunkies stumble into the station, looking
     around.  Anna and Hawk crouch down.

                             HAWK
               And I'll bring my entourage...

                             ANNA
               Secret passageways don't mean as
               much as they used to.  There's
               a place two blocks east of here.
               Enzo's.  Say 10:30.

                             HAWK
               Said.

     Hawk and Anna peck each other with a smile.  He crawls
     out an exit door.  As he leaves, Anna's smile disappears.
     She pulls out a rosary and gives herself a self-scolding
     bang on the head.  She then darts to a large crucifix
     and looks up.

                             ANNA
               Father, it's obvious.  He's up to
               something.

     Suddenly a speaker in Jesus's mouth gently crackles.

                             JESUS (Italian)
               Report downstairs at once.

                             ANNA
               Yes, sir.

     INT. CATACOMBLIKE AREA

     A CARDINAL paces in an enigmatic Vatican area.  Anna
     clacks up to him.

                             CARDINAL
               Did he mention the Mayflowers?

                             ANNA
               No, your Eminence.  I think he's
               going to steal the Codex, as
               early as next week.

                             CARDINAL
               Attempt, you mean.  The vanity
               of this man, Hudson Hawk.  The
               Vatican has foiled the advances
               of Pirates and Terrorists.  We
               will not lie down for some
               schmuck from New Jersey.  Must
               you flirt with him so realistically?

                             ANNA
               That's the best kind.  A wise
               woman once said "Polite
               conversation is rarely either."

                             CARDINAL
                       (chuckling)
               Let me be the one to quote
               Scripture.  ....As an agent of
               our organization, you are put in
               awkward situations.  Just
               remember, Hudson Hawk is an evil,
               evil man.

                             ANNA
                       (unconvinced)
               Yeah.  The big E.

     EXT. NAVONA PIAZZA--DAY

     The evil Hawk clumsily strides around a fountain, looking
     off in all directions, soft-shoes past some sedate
     painters and swings into...

     INT. A BIG QUIRKY PHONE BOOTH

     Hawk grabs up the phone and dials....

                             HAWK
               Hello, operator.  I'd like to
               make a collect call to New York
               number...

     The Mayflower limousine creeps to the edge of the piazza,
     behind an oblivious Hawk.

                             HAWK
               Thank you, operator, thank you.

     Hawk turns, putting a finger in his ear.  Seeing the
     limo, he FREAKS and balls himself into a corner.

                             HAWK
               Come on, Alex, pick up, you
               Reindeer goat cheese-eating
               motherfucker.

     INT. ALEX'S RESTAURANT--NIGHT

     It is late night in New York.  A phone rings atop the
     bar of Alex's restaurant with no one in sight.

     INT. PIAZZA--DAY

     Hawk pokes his head to see a Darwin and Minerva (holding
     Bunny) emerge from the limousine.  As he turns his con-
     centration back to the phone, ALEX HIMSELF flows out from
     a building to cheerfully speak with Darwin and Minerva
     and get licked by Bunny, before they all pile into the
     limo.

                             HAWK
               A-lex, A-lex, come on Alex.

     Hawk slams down the phone and turns to see the limousine
     pull off.

     Hawk angrily bursts from the door and is painfully
     CLOTHESLINED by agent Butterfinger, who is dressed as
     a mailman.

     Crumpled on the ground, Hawk kicks out with his foot,
     into Butterfinger's stomach, doubling him. Hawk then
     grabs him by the head and rams into the glass of the
     booth.

     Hawk rotates off for an escape...but the rest of the
     CIA crew cuts him off holding barely concealed guns;
     Snickers dressed as a maitre 'd, Almond Joy as a Bermuda
     tourist, and Kaplan in his usual emsemble.  Kit Kat is
     dressed exactly like Hawk, right down to a bloody lip.
     Hawk gives him a double take.

                             KAPLAN
               Hawk, Hawk, Hawk.  Enjoying
               Italy?  I always had a soft spot
               for Rome.  Did my first barehanded
               strangulation here.  Communist
               politician.

                             HAWK
               Why George, you big softie...

                             KAPLAN
               God, I miss communism.  The Red
               Threat.  People were scared, the
               Agency was respected, and I got
               laid every night.

     A humiliated Butterfinger comes waddling out, holding
     the phone.  Kaplan rolls his eyes.

                             BUTTERFINGER
               Sorry, coach...

                             KAPLAN
                       (shaking his head)
               If his father wasn't the head of
               Shit, I hate this, the
               government's got me farmed out,
               working for the Mayflower
               corporation now, money beats
               politics.  War isn't Hell anymore,
               it's Dull.  Don't slaughter their
               men and rape their women, just
               steal their microchips.

                             HAWK
               You know Kaplan, if you weren't
               the slimiest pinata of shit that
               ever lived, I'd feel sorry for
               you.

                             SNICKERS
               Good news, bud, the Mayflowers
               have moved up the time-table.
               You're hitting the Vatican to-night.

                             HAWK
               Tonight?  You're whacked.  The
               timing's off, I'm underequipped
               Damnit, I have a date!

     Almond Joy smoothly extracts Hawk's notebook and reads...

                             ALMOND JOY
               Grapple, Biker's bottle, hairspray,
               black turtleneck, Pocket
               Fisherman, acid, collapsible
               yardstick, softball, and 72 stamps.
               Gee Stud, this is going to be
               some date.  No Harvey's Bristol
               Cream?

                             KAPLAN
               Snickers, make the list happen.
               Oh and it's one thing to play
               hide and seek with the Mayflower's
               pathetic staff, but we're sore
               losers.  I've put jumper cables
               on the nipples of children and
               not always in the line of duty.

                             HAWK
               Thanks for sharing.

                             KAPLAN
               We blow up space shuttles for
               breakfast.  You and your friend
               Alex would be a late afternoon
               Triscuit.

                             HAWK
               If you do anything to my friend...

                             KAPLAN
               Yeah, right.  By the way, as long
               as I'm getting things off my
               chest, I'm the one who killed your
               little monkey.  Made it look like
               a Mafia hit.  Did it for fun.
               Ciao.

     Kaplan and the crew quickly disperse in different
     directions as Hawk howls in frustration.  Kit Kat moves
     behind Hawk and perfectly mimics him.

                             HAWK
               What did you have against Little
               Eddie, motherfucker?  He was just
               a monkey who liked to laugh.
               Come back without your yuppie
               army.  I'll triscuit you, you
               space shuttle eating...Shit.!

     Without looking, Hawk elbows the mimic Kit Kat in the
     face.  Kit Kat gives Hawk a strange smile and hands him
     a card that reads:  BEWARE THE ODD STEPS.

     Hawk looks up from the card.  Kit Kat is gone, but
     Butterfinger scampers in his place.

                             BUTTERFINGER
               Hey, Mr. Hawk, I got those 72
               stamps!

     Sighing, Hawk takes the huge sheath of stamps.

     EXT. INDOOR TRAIN TRACK

     One of the small Vatican mail trains bullets across an
     indoor track.  The viewer's viewpoint whooshes to catch
     up, focusing on a very large package, addressed to the
     Pope, that has Hawk's sheath of stamps slapped onto it.
     The train zips into a tunnel.

     INT. THE VATICAN UNDERGROUND SUBWAY

     The train rumbles into the Vatican mini-station.  TWO
     HARRIED WORKERS heave up the strange cargo onto a sorting
     table.

     A bell rings as a clock hits 10.  The workers do a sigh
     of relief.  Shucking off their uniforms, they head out.

     A hand rips out of the huge package.

     INT. OUTSIDE THE CODEX ROOM--NIGHT

     Hawk pops out of the secret passageway door and moves to
     the mouth of the doorless Codex room.  He pauses to
     hand-comb his hair in the two large, framed mirrors at
     the sides.

     THE CODEX ROOM

     Carrying the now frameless mirrors in each hand, Hawk
     hustles to the top of the steps and suddenly stops.

                             HAWK
               "Beware the Odd Steps."

     Hawk crouches down and notices the step below him has a
     clear magnetic tape running across it to a dime sized
     alarm button.

                             HAWK
               Why Kit Kat, aren't you a
               gentleman...

     Hawk bounds down every other one of the steps down to
     where the Codex is bathed in a holy light.

     He hefts up the two now frameless mirrors and puts them
     each in a groove of a collapsible yardstick running
     across the top.  The parallel mirrors now face out from
     each other.  Hawk sprays a blast of Clairol to reveal the
     light sensor beams, and then with a deep breath, he
     thrusts the mirrors into the beams.

     The light bounces harmlessly off the mirrors and Hawk
     exhales.  He balances the connected mirrors then crawls
     through his tent-like passageway.

     Hawk squirts acid from a biker's bottle on the cracks of
     the rectangular glass case that holds the Codex.  The
     acid sizzles.

     INT. VATICAN LIBRARY HALLWAY--NIGHT

     A BURLY GUARD thoughtfully stares at a painting, fingers
     propping his chin like an critic then continues ambling
     on.

     THE CODEX ROOM

     Rubbing his head, Hawk gives an excited smile as the glass
     cracks of the rectangular case loosen.  Hawk pulls out a
     pocket fisherman....

     The viewer's viewpoint moves upward to reveal, through
     the mouth of the room, the Burly Guard is coming down
     the hall.

     OUTSIDE THE CODEX ROOM

     Burly Guard approaches the outskirts of the Codex room.
     He combs his hair into the piece of wall in the now
     empty mirror-frame then REALIZES.

     Muttering Italian into his walkie-talkie, Burly Guard
     rushes into the room and looks down to the sensor
     deflecting mirrors.

     He passes a statue, behind which, Hawk is revealed to
     be standing.

     Burly Guard approaches the Codex and sees the dripping
     acid.  He also notices a fishing hook attached to the
     binding of the Codex.  The fishing wire leads out of
     the glass case.  The Guard reaches to touch it when
     suddenly the wire is pulled tightly upward by a
     moving-out-from-behind-the-statue Hawk.

     The Codex FLIES off its perch, setting off the ALARM and
     sending the bizarre cage/lamp CRASHING DOWN and AROUND
     the hapless Burly Guard.  The green gas commences its
     noxious billowing as the Codex swooshes into Hawk's
     hands.  He then hurls a softball, smashing a window
     on the other side of the room.

     The familiar Vatican Guard and a Guard Three barrel
     down into the mouth of the codex room.  Only one
     Gas Mask drops from the doorway.  The Vatican Guard
     pulls it on and gives a "That's Life" shrug of
     shoulders to the fainting Guard three.

     Hawk puts on the missing gas mask and launches a grapple
     around the ceiling cord of the dropped Ornate Lighting
     Fixture.  Hawk then Tarzans from one staircase to
     another.  He then ungrapples and heads toward the
     shattered window.

     The Vatican Guard waits a stunned moment before giving
     chase.

     EXT. THE ROOF

     Hawk flings off his gas mask and begins a classical
     skipping-across-the-rooftop jaunt.  Suddenly a brick
     on the slightly slanted roof gives way and Hawk FALLS.
     His canvas bag goes skipping down across the roof,
     landing against the antennae.

     INT. THE POPE'S BEDROOM

     A T.V. showing Mr. Ed. speaking to Wilbur in Italian
     goes fuzzy.  THE POPE, wearing his famous hat and a Notre
     Dame bathrobe angrily bangs on it.

     EXT. THE ROOF

     Hawk harvests his grapple on the level part of the roof
     and slides down toward the dangling-off-the-antennae bag.

     The Vatican Guard pops out of the window and fires a
     warning shot.

     Hawk stretches to the bag.  His fingers touch as the
     Guard continues to bound forward.

                             HAWK
               Please God, Please God.......let
               the guard shoot me.

     Hawk pulls up the bag and turns himself to see Vatican
     Guard hovering over him on the roof.

                             VATICAN GUARD
               The worm's on the other foot,
               yankee noodle candy.

     Hawk sees the Vatican Guard's foot move toward the
     grapple.  Hawk ferociously tugs, ripping the Guard
     off-balance and knocking down a side of the roof.

     EXT. TOP OF A NEARBY WALL

     Hawk dashes atop a nearby wall and hurls his grapple
     across a road around a tree branch.  Hawk ties the end of
     grapple line, tosses on a friction belt, takes a breath
     and JUMPS OFF THE WALL.  The viewer follows him on his
     breathtaking ride.

     The brused Vatican Guard flops back atop the roof.  He
     gets off a wild shot before crumpling back down.

     HAWK

     is alnost to the other side when the Guard's bullet hits
     the friction belt.  Hawk drops with a wild scream...
     and lands with a painful straddle atop a street lamppost.
     His eyes bug out with the thought of a life without
     children.  He slowly spins off the lamppost and sails
     down upon...

     EXT. A BUS

     and the comfortable luggage housed on top of it.  Hawk
     tries to maintain his balance upon the wobbling
     baggage, but the bus makes a quick turn and Hawk goes
     flying off...

     EXT. RIGHT INTO A CAFE CHAIR--NIGHT

     Panting and discombobulated, Hawk looks across the table
     to the female hands holding open a menu.  The menu comes
     down.  It is Anna.  Hawk unpretzels and laps his canvas
     bag.

                             ANNA
               Oh Hudson, I was worried you
               weren't going to drop by....

                             HAWK
               I never break a date.  Scout's
               honor.

     Hawk does the honor sign with his black gloved hand
     then quickly rips it off as a WAITER comes to the
     table.

                             HAWK
               Fettucini con Funghi Porcini.

                             WAITER
               Bellissimo, signor.

                             HAWK
               Oh, and could I have some ketchup
               with that.

     Anna hits her forehead with the palm of her hand while
     the waiter's entire body sinks in disappointment.  Other
     TABLE OCCUPANTS sadly shake their heads.

     EXT. ANOTHER TABLE--NIGHT

     At a comfortable distance curled behind a heat lamp,
     Snickers is being an Uglier American to an UNCOMPREHENDING
     WAITER, while Almond Joy chuckles and Butterfinger spreads
     butter over an entire baguette.

                             SNICKERS
               Come on, Pierre, Steak-bur-ger,
               Fren-n-ch Fries.  This is France,
               you gotta have French.....

                             ALMOND JOY
               Actually we're in Italy, Snickers,
               she said as if it made a difference.

     The Waiter sneaks off.  Butterfinger devours his bread.

                             SNICKERS
               Italy, France, Moscow.  They all
               just wanna be Nebraska.  Old Man
               Kaplan thinks since Communism is
               dead, we got nothing to do.  Man,
               Democracy isn't free elections.
               We gotta teach the world that
               Democracy is Big Tits, College
               Football on Saturdays, Eddie
               Murphy saying the word "Fuck"
               and Kids putting their hands down
               garbage disposals on "America's
               Funniest Home Videos."

                             ALMOND JOY
               Damn baby, when's the last time
               you had a vacation...Jesus, I
               gotta get out of this job.  If
               my Mom knew her daughter
               assassinated the leader of the
               anti-Apartheid movement....

                             SNICKERS
               Quit bitching, you got the
               employee of the month plaque for
               that shit...Ah to be in Pari-is
               and in love.

     They look off to....

     HAWK AND ANNA'S TABLE

     Physically sarcastic, the Waiter brings a tall wine
     basket with a bottle of ketchup in it.  Hawk nabs it.

                             HAWK
               This is bueno.  They had the worst
               ketchup in prison.....uh...

                             ANNA
               Prison?

                             HAWK
               I was the Warden?

                             ANNA
               How long were you in?

                             HAWK
               Let's just say, I never saw E.T.

                             ANNA
               Wow, you were "in the joint."
               "Doing hard time."  It's funny,
               but that excites me.  I seem to
               have a thing for sinners.

                             HAWK
               I seem to have a thing for sinning.
               sinning.  Check please....

                             WAITER
               Ah, anything for dessert?

                             ANNA
                       (she shoots)
               Yes.  Something to go.

                             HAWK
                       (she scores)
               I'll bring the ketchup.

       INT. ANNA'S HOUSE--NIGHT

       The viewer's viewpoint pulls back, past the black canvas
       bag on a table, to reveal a barefoot Anna is straddling
       a bare-backed Hawk, demurely and tentatively studying his
       bruises.

                             ANNA
               What have you been doing?

                             HAWK
               Uh....old badminton injury.

     Anna giggles and bends to kiss a bruise.  She stops
     herself and opts for tickling.

                             HAWK
               tickles, ticKleS, TICKLES.

                             ANNA
                       (not stopping)
               Oh, I'm so sorry...

     Roaring with laughter, they capsize onto the floor.
     Hawk slithers around to devour her toes.  Anna closes
     her eyes and arches her back.....

     She opens her eyes and sees a large crucifix staring
     right at her.  With a gasp, she rolls away from Hawk
     and stands up, trying to brush off her sins.

                             ANNA
               I'm sorry.  I can't.  I....

                             HAWK
                       (softly approaching)
               Hey now, outside of a very
               friendly dog this morning, it's
               been a slow decade.  I don't make
               love every ten years, I get a
               little cranky.

                             ANNA
               It's also been a long time for
               me.  I--

     Their heads fuse for a semi-classic screen kiss until
     THE CRUCIFIX LIGHTS UP AND BEGINS SHOUTING IN ITALIAN.

                             HAWK
               Catholic girls are scary...

                            ANNA
               Somebody robbed the Vatican.

                            HAWK
               Oh.  No.

     Anna slides on her shoes and makes a hasty retreat.
     She bumps into the canvas bag.  The Codex slides out.
     They both catch it in mid-air.  Anna's eyes pop.  She
     wrenches the Codex away and kicks.  Hawk pulls her into
     a compassionate back-against-his-stomach hug.  The Codex
     falls to the floor unharmed.

                             HAWK
               It's not what you think.  Okay,
               maybe it is....

                             ANNA
               You really went and did it.  With
               one day, not even a day, of
               planning, you did it.  Nobody
               does it better, Hudson.  You
               started the week stealing the
               Sforza and you ended it swiping
               the Codex.

                             HAWK
               Wha--

                             ANNA
               What are your plans for the
               weekend?  Hoisting away the
               Colosseum?  Tell me, did the
               devil make you do it or did
               Darwin and Minerva Mayflower?

     EXT. A CAR OUTSIDE OF ANNA'S PLACE--NIGHT

     Crammed together in the front seat, Snickers, Almond
     Joy, and Butterfinger are watching the shadows of
     Hawk and Anna up in the window.  Snickers snaps a
     cartridge into a gun while Butterfinger attacks a
     goo-ey pastry.

                              SNICKERS
               What's going on in there?

                              BUTTERFINGER
               Do you want me to rape them?
                       (throwing pastry down)
               Dunkin does it better.

                              SNICKERS
               Just read, Butterfinger.

     Butterfinger pulls up the book on Da Vinci that Anna
     wrote and starts reading like a schoolboy.

                             BUTTERFINGER
               "Da Vinci had fears about his
               more dangerous designs, so he
               created a shorthand code in
               reverse script..."

                             ALMOND JOY
               To yourself!.....What are they
               doing?  In twenty seconds, we go
               in.

     INT. ANNA'S PLACE

     Foam shoots out over the coffee.  Hawk smiles down at
     it as Anna works a cappuccino machine.

                             ANNA
               For two years, I've been tracking
               the Mayflowers' peculiar interest
               in three Da Vinci pieces.  Their
               Sforza replica was as fake as
               the "gas leak" that supposedly
               destroyed it.

                             HAWK
               Does everyone in the world know
               more than me?  Jesus, I'm just
               some guy who happens to be good
               at swiping stuff.....Lifted a
               piece of licorice when I was one
               and a half.  Who knew it would
               lead... They even got the CIA
               involved!

                             ANNA
               The C.I. what?  God, no...

                             HAWK
                       (raising his cup)
               Ooh, I guess I do know something
               Here's looking at you, kid...

     THE CAR OUTSIDE

     The agents burst from the car, guns raised.

                             ALMOND JOY
               Now.

     ANNA'S HOUSE

     Hawk sips the cappuccino.  His face immediately contracts.

                             HAWK
               This doesn't taste like
               cappuccino.

                             ANNA
               Oh, I must have put too much
               ethyl-chloride in it.

     Anna throws a pillow on the ground and holds out her
     hand.  Hawk collapses.  His coffee cup lands perfectly in
     Anna's outstretched hand and his head lands perfectly
     on the pillow.

     The candy bars bash the door open, guns raised.

                             ANNA
               Why didn't you tell me at the
               restaurant that he had hit the
               Vatican tonight.  My people will
               not be happy.  I want to see Kaplan.

                             ALMOND JOY
               That's not overly possible.  He...

                             BUTTERFINGER
               But guys, remember, he's in the
               castle at Vinci....

     Snickers and Almond Joy grimace into fake smiles.

     EXT. THE CASTLE--NIGHT

     A helicopter thunders up to the awesome castle from the
     opening Da Vinci sequence.

     INT. HELICOPTER

     Anna pets the head of Hawk on her lap.  She is pondering.

     INT. A MYSTERIOUS DARK ROOM--NIGHT

     A sparse circle of light houses a chair and a pacing
     Kaplan.

     Snickers and Butterfinger flop Hawk onto the lit chair.

     Kit Kat is dressed exactly like Anna.  She reacts as she
     comes into the light.  Kaplan takes the Codex from her.

                             KAPLAN
               Way to go, Anna.

                             ANNA
               When the Mayflowers find out we
               have the Codex, they're going to
               want to make a deal...

                             KAPLAN
                       (gung-ho lying)
               And then we'll arrest those
               greedy pigs... Is that it?

     Hawk stirs.  The viewer gets his woozy P.O.V.

                             ANNA
               Actually George, it's not it.
               What are we doing in this castle?
               I happen to know the Mayflowers
               bought this castle last year when
               they found out Da Vinci used to
               do...

     The lights in the room come on to the sound of holy Da
     Vinci theme, revealing an almost perfect refurbishing of
     the exact same workshop Da Vinci toiled in in the
     opening.

                             KAPLAN
                       (trying to be solemn)
               It's the site of their new museum
               and we're taking it over.  Operation
               Deflower Mayflower is going full
               speed ahead.

                             ANNA
                       (taking it in)
               Oh Lord.... the only reason I ask is
               that Hudson, uh, Mr. Hawk, Hawkins,
               had some "neat" things to say about
               Darwin, Minerva, and you.
               Basically that you're part of the
               same car pool.

                             KAPLAN
               Anna.  Anna.  Anna.  If that were
               true, Almond Joy would have
               handed you your heart right
               after you handed me the Codex.
               Now, get some sleep.  Kit Kat...

     Kit Kat in drag spookily moves inches away from Anna.

                              ANNA
               Cat got his tongue?

                              KAPLAN
               Actually he never told us what it
               was.

     Kit Kat smiles, revealing the fact he has no tongue.

                             ANNA
               How sweet.  I trust you will see
               Hudson Hawk is given to the proper
               authorities.  I recommend
               leniency...

                             SNICKERS
                       (holding in a laugh)
               Oh, I think we all do.

     Hawk gives her a look of honesty and pain that causes
     Anna to guiltily gulp as she heads out with the mimicking
     Kit Kat.

                             SNICKERS
               Do you think she has any idea that
               Operation Deflower Mayflower is as
               bogus as Kit Kat's tits?

                             KAPLAN
               I don't think so, although bringing
               her to the castle gave her a big,
               juicy hint.

                             ALMOND JOY
               With all due respect to that great
               blouse, why didn't I cut out her
               heart?

                             KAPLAN
               Close call, but she's our only way
               of keeping tabs on that damn
               mysterious Vatican organization.
               Hawk, it's time to go to the
               principal's office....

     EXT. OUTSIDE THE CASTLE--NIGHT

     Moving into the chopper, Anna glimpses, Bunny, the
     obnoxious dog, in a Mayflower logo dog tag, taking a leak
     on some bushes.  She fakes a yawn to the like dressed Kit
     Kat who fakes one back.

     INT. THE G. MACHINE ROOM--NIGHT

     Kaplan, Hawk, and the other agents march into the mammoth
     room of the opening scene.  In the place of where one
     remembers the gold machine are undulating sheets, beneath
     which are unassembled parts of the machine.

     Inside, a ball goes whizzing out of a tennis ball
     machine.  In tennis gear and goggles, Darwin Mayflower
     thwacks it against the wall of (now faded) frescos.

     Also in tennis threads, Minerva is laying on a chaise
     lounge holding a gadget in her hand.

                             DARWIN
               Seven!

     Minerva turns the gadget up to SEVEN and presses a
     button.  Another tennis ball shoots out, a little faster.
     Darwin batters it.  The ball ricochets into the forehead
     of an "amused" Alfred who is retrieving balls in sweat
     pants.

                             ALFRED
               Jolly.  Good.  Shot.  Sir.

                             MINERVA
               Ooh, it's Hudson Hawk, you cease
               to amaze me, convict.  You are a
               terrible cat burglar!

                             DARWIN
               Haven't you ever seen, like David
               Niven?  You know tiptoe in, tiptoe
               out.

                             MINERVA
               Like a "cat", one could say.

                             HAWK
               Shucks, I'll just take it back.

     Hawk reaches for the Codex.  Kaplan pulls it over to
     Darwin, who pulls up his goggles and fondles the ancient
     binding.  Taking a knife from Kaplan, he begins to slit
     it open.

                             MINERVA
                       (bouncing up)
               No, let me!

                             DARWIN
                       (pout)
               I don't care.

     Hawk looks away to the billowing sheets and the strange
     machine parts behind them.

     Minerva slits the bindings and tugs out another geometri-
     cally perverted crystal.

                             HAWK
               Another piece of the puzzle for
               the Da Vinci Alchemy project.

     Kaplan, Darwin, and Minerva look up to Hawk, then to each
     other, all start to speak, then all stop.

     This quandary is deferred by the entrance of the twin
     Flunkies.

                             DARWIN
               Oh, you.  There's nothing more I
               hate than failure.  All you had to
               do was follow the Hawk, it's not
               like I said "Teach our nation's
               children how to read."

     Hawk uses the distraction to amble toward the sheets.

                             DARWIN
               I guess we're just going to have
               to kill 'em...

     Shockingly swift, Minerva pulls a small gun from beneath
     her tennis dress and blasts a burning hole between each
     set of Flunky eyes, splattering them to the ground.

                             DARWIN
               God Minerva, I was kidding.

     A SHOCKED HAWK

     quickly turns from the blithe carnage and pulls up a
     sheet.  He reveals the familiar Gold Machine Demonhead.

     THE MAYFLOWERS

     reverberate off each other with laughter.  Bloodstained,
     Kaplan and Almond Joy exchange an eye bulge.  Minerva's
     smile disappears as she sees Hawk by the sheets.

                             MINERVA
               Get away from there, convict!

                             HAWK
               Just browsing.  Don't touch me....

     Snickers touches him.  Hawk smashes him in the jaw.
     Snickers rears back to reciprocate....

                             DARWIN
               Don't hurt him!  We need him for
               the final job!

     Snickers stops himself, snarling in frustration.  Hawk is
     suddenly the happiest man he's been in Italy.

                             HAWK
               Oh weeeeelly, don't hurt me?  Even
               if I do this....

     Hawk pulls Snickers' glasses off and stamps them.

                             HAWK
               And this....

     Hawk knees Butterfinger in the stomach.

                             HAWK
               Surely this must offend....

     Hawk body-block-dominoes Butterfinger and Snickers to the
     ground.  Kaplan and Almond Joy aim their guns.

                             KAPLAN
               That's it!

     Playfully lifting his shirt, Hawk grabs Minerva and
     manually swivels her hips to the beat of his.

                             HAWK
               Things are getting a little loose
               at the Da Vinci workshop tonight.
               "Put your left leg in, take your
               right foot out."  May I call you
               Minnie....

     Hawk mambos to Alfred who rifles his blade up to Hawk's
     crotch.  Hawk stops dancing.

                             DARWIN
               Come to think of it there is a part
               of your body that you won't need for
               your next job...

                             HAWK
               Hey, guys, I've always wanted to sing
               like Franki Valli and the other seasons,
               but come on....

     Alfred moves the blade a little upward.  Hawk a-a-ghs.

                             MINERVA
               Big girls don't cry-I-eye.

                             HAWK
               Two minutes, 35 seconds.  Damnit,
               I'm involved in this thing, so I
               just wanna know what this thing is.
               I wanna be treated as an adult.

                             DARWIN
               That's fair.  Tomorrow.  Back in
               Rome.  Now go to your room.

     Alfred strategically Vulcans Hawk on the neck.  He falls.

     INT. DARK CONFESSION BOOTH--MORNING

     The lips of Anna come into light.

                             ANNA
               Forgive me Father for I have
               sinned.  It's been 1200 hours
               since my last confession.

     INT. THE CARDINAL'S SIDE OF THE CONFESSION BOOTH

     The cardinal suppresses a yawn.

                             CARDINAL
               Hit me with your best shot.

                             ANNA (O.S.)
               I betrayed a man.  A good man.  An
               innocent man.  A thief.

                             CARDINAL
               Anna, what are you trying to say...

     ANNA'S DARKENED LIPS

                             ANNA
               He came into a world where crime
               is a legitimate business tactic
               and a legitimate government
               procedure.  But he knew Right and
               Wrong.  Oh, and we kind of messed
               around...

     THE CARDINAL

     freaks and goes into some Italian gibberish before...

                             CARDINAL
               "Messed around" messed around?  I
               know-- I don't want to know.  First
               base?  Second Base?  Stop me when
               I'm getting warm...

                             ANNA (O.S.)
               A little petting is not the issue!

                             CARDINAL
               Sorry.  Seventeen Hail Marys and
               five minutes outside.

     INT. OUTSIDE THE CONFESSION BOOTH--MORNING

     The Cardinal emerges and stands by Anna's confessional
     curtains.

                             CARDINAL
               So let me get this straight,
               sister, you're saying Hudson Hawk
               is not willingly working for the
               Mayflowers but Kaplan and the
               Candy Bars are?

     Anna moves out of the confessional curtains, wearing a
     FULL NUN HABIT for she is a Nun.  The gaspingly beautiful
     church unfolds as they walk.

                             ANNA
               You got it.  Operation Deflower
               Mayflower is a bad joke and I'm the
               punchline.  I thought we were using
               the CIA to help us to get Mayflower,
               but really the CIA was using me to
               keep us away from Mayflower.

                             CARDINAL
               Oh, why couldn't I be the Cardinal
               in charge of catering.... If the
               Mayflowers get the three sections
               of Da Vinci's crystal and his
               instructions for the gold machine--
               Aie-yi--Do we got anything?  What of
               Alex, Hawk's friend, where is his
               loyalty?

                             ANNA
               I'm going to find out.

                             CARDINAL
               I'm sorry for losing it back there,
               but you must remember, sister, you
               have vows to God as well as a mission
               to the world.

                             ANNA
               I know, I know, your Eminence, just say
               "God go with me."

                             CARDINAL
               God go with you, sister.

     Anna puts on the coolest pair of sunglasses, deliciously
     contrasting with her habit.  She moves off....

     INT. ROME CONFERENCE ROOM--DAY

     Beneath the wacky portrait, Darwin circles the board-
     member filled conference table as Minerva smooches Bunny.
     Everyone watches Alfred place a bar of Gold and of Lead
     in the hands of a blindfolded Hawk at the middle of the M.

                             DARWIN
               So, Captain Hawk, in one of your
               paws you got a gold bar worth
               about 8 thou.  In the autre, you
               got lead that won't get you
               gelato.

                             MINERVA
               Surely a master-thief like you can
               tell the difference.

                             HAWK
                       ("What's my Line")
               That's two down to Kitty
               Carlisle...

     Hawk "weighs" the two bars in his hands--digs with his
     fingernails.  He rips off the blindfold in subdued
     frustration.  As Minerva speaks, she unconsciously
     molests Alfred.

                             MINERVA
               Cool, isn't it?  Weight, feel,
               mal1eability, they're all but
               identical.  On the periodic chart
               of elements, they're but one
               proton apart.  Great minds worked
               for centuries to turn worthless
               into priceless.

                             HAWK
               Alchemy.

                             DARWIN
                       (casually goosing Alfred)
               Alchemy!  Is the business term of
               the 90's, my man!  Minerva read
               about it in an airline magazine
               about four years ago.  I dumped
               some lira into research... Shazam,
               we come across a diary by one of
               Da Vinci's apprentices detailing
               La Machine de Oro, the gold machine
               for those at home, and the rest is
               about to become history.  Money
               isn't everything, gold is.  Fuck
               blue chip stocks!  Fuck T-bills!
               Fuck Junk Bonds!  I got the real
               deal!  Money will always be paper
               but gold will always be gold!

                             MINERVA
               Market crashes.  Bomb drops.
               Greenhouse effect affects.  We'll
               still be the richest, most powerful
               people in the world.  In 1992,
               Europe is coming together to become
               one business superpower.  It's one
               party we'd love to poop.

                             DARWIN
               Well, that said, the last
               ingredient in the recipe is in, get
               this, you're gonna die, the Kremlin.

                              HAWK
               Sure.  The Kremlin.  Makes sense.
               The Kremlin.  Why not?  Listen,
               this is all too Indiana Jones and
               the Lost City of King Tut for me,
               man.  Throw me in jail and go ahead,
               just try and throw Alex...

                             MINERVA
               Jail, you asshole!  Our foot
               soldiers will blow your brains
               out!  Bunny, Ball-Ball!

     Minerva angrily throws the dog off her lap and whips a
     tennis ball into its mouth.

                             DARWIN
               I'll torture you so slowly you'll
               think it's a career!  I'll kill
               your family, your friends, and the
               bitch you took to the Prom!

                             HAWK
               You want an address on that last
               one?

     Bunny barks up at Hawk in anger.

                             HAWK
               Bunny, not you too?

                              MINERVA
               You've got a dilemma, tiger.  I
               think I know what's going to help
               you solve it.

     Alfred quickly latches on the state-of-the-art handcuffs
     and the blindfold.  The viewer's viewpoint stays on a
     writhing Hawk.

                              HAWK
               I'll kill all you.  Even the old
               lady.


     Hawk kicks back on the table, "jump ropes" the cuffs,
     then picks the lock with his teeth.  Hawk rips off the
     blindfold to see that the entire room is empty except
     for Alex, standing at the other end, in an incongruous
     Italian leather coat.

                             ALEX
               I hated cigarettes until I saw my
               first No Smoking sign.  Keep off
               the Grass?  Let's play Soccer.
               Only law I cared about was
               friendship.  Broke that one too,
               didn't I?  This Gates-Mario
               Brothers-CIA-Mayflower-Da Vinci
               thing seemed like a sweet deal.
               Visit foreign lands, take their
               treasures.  I don't know, I thought
               you'd get into it.  It's better
               than playing darts with M.B.A.'s at
               the bar.  I didn't know it was
               going to be like this.  Them using
               me to use you... I'm sorry, there's
               only one way out of this and it's
               gonna hurt me more than it's gonna
               hurt you.

     Alex pulls out a gun from his jacket and clicks it in.

     EXT. FAMILIAR PIAZZA--DAY

     The piazza from the fascist E.U.R. building are bustling
     with office workers laughing, smoking, and hustling.
     Darwin, Minerva and Kaplan are a solid troika in the
     center of the steps.  The other agents stroll in the
     periphery....

                              KAPLAN
               I just don't think it was a
               smoking hot idea to leave them up
               there alone.

                             MINERVA
               Don't worry George, this is the
               reason we put the old diabetic
               guinea on the payroll to begin
               with.  To keep Hawk in line.
               They'll talk about "being buddies"
               and "chugging brewskis."

                             DARWIN
                       (raising glass)
               You gotta love male bonding.

     As Darwin slaps Kaplan on the back, behind them, Hawk and
     Alex come crashing out of the windowed doors of the building.

                              KAPLAN
               You were saying...

     Moving to the edge of the stairs, Hawk and Alex, latter
     holding his gun, sprout up from their own debris and
     continue savagely brawling.  The wigging out passers-
     by give them space.

                             HAWK
               You bastard!  You fucked my
               freedom for a lousy job!

     Alex trembles, going into a diabetic seizure.  He shakily
     raises his gun.

                             ALEX
               Hawk... I'm so sorry...

     Hawk roars forward like a bull and helmets Alex.  They
     roll together down the massive staircase past Darwin,
     Minerva, and the CIA who react with "This can't be
     happening" catatonia.

     Two SHOTS go off as Hawk and Alex crash to the bottom of
     the staircase.  Hawk rises up in a daze to see Alex on the
     ground with two bloody bullet holes.

                             HAWK
               No.....Alex!  Wake up, you can't
               go out like this.

     Hawk falls to his knees as Snickers hustles toward him.
     Suddenly, sirens are heard as a police van pulls up.
     Snickers stops.

     Four policemen blast from the back of the van.  One holds
     back the crowd.  One strenuously pulls Hawk into the van.
     The other two drag in Alex.

     The villains look to each other for non-existent guidance
     as the van pulls away.

                             MINERVA
               Plan B, anyone...

     Using initiative, Snickers hops on a Vespa and roars off
     after them.  The van can be seen swerving off.....

     AROUND A CORNER

     where it bolts up into a much larger truck marked VATICAN
     SOUVENIRS.  TWO SEEMINGLY-INNOCENT-BYSTANDER PRIESTS break
     demeanor to flop up the wheel ramps, slam close the back
     of the truck, lock it shut, and continue on their solemn
     way.

     The TRUCK BELLOWS off as the Vespa spins around the corner.
     Snickers brakes and looks around for the police van.  He
     hits his handle with frustration.

     EXT. BEAUTIFUL ROME OVERVIEW

     Out of her habit but still in her incredible sunglasses,
     Anna looks out to a lovely view of Italy.  The Vatican Truck
     pulls up behind her.  A giddy, blood-stained Alex and a not-
     so-giddy Hawk bound out of the back.  Alex excitedly gives
     himself an insulin shot.

                             ANNA
               Oh thank God, you're dead...

                             ALEX
               It was so beautiful!  When the
               blanks went off, they...

     Hawk's fist whooshes into frame and blasts Alex's jaw.

                             HAWK
               You bastard.  You fucked my
               freedom for a lousy job.

                             ALEX
               But I said I was sorry....

                             HAWK
               No sweat, Alex, you only made the
               biggest mistake of my life.  What
               was your per-diem?

                             ALEX
               Don't act like you've never committed
               a crime before, Hawkins?  I know, I
               made call, when Anna tracked me down I...

                             ANNA
               Hudson, don't you understand...

                             HAWK
               And you, Dr. Cappucino, you're lucky
               I don't hit women, assuming you are
               a woman.  I'm not taking anything for
               granted anymore.

                             ANNA
               I-work-for-a-covert-Vatican-humanitarian-
               organization.  The-CIA-made-a-fool-of-me.
               I-care-for-you...

                             HAWK
               Oh.  Well, what's this?

     Hawk pulls out the Demon Head that was in the Mayflower
     Museum from out of his pocket.  Anna turns white.

                             ANNA
               Where did you get this?

                             HAWK
               You know, the place where you gave
               the bad guys the Codex.... the
               Mayflower Museum.

                             ANNA
               It's from the machine.  All they
               need is the crystal to run it and
               they have 2/3 of it already.  We
               can't let that happen.

                             ALEX
               You're saying you want us to beat
               them to the crystal and save the
               world from financial disarray.

                             ANNA
               Something like that.

                             ALEX
                       (pulling out plane
                        tix)
               Well, forget about it.  Hawk and I
               are going to Rio.  We're hurt,
               we're tired, and a hero ain't
               nothing but a sandwich.  Right,
               buddy?...

                             ANNA
               Hudson, God's given you a gift for
               cat burglary, you can t just...

                             HAWK
               You better believe I can.  I'm
               sick of people telling me what I
               have to do.

                             ANNA
               It's that kind of selfish attitude
               that...

                             HAWK
               Selfish attitude?  I'm just some
               guy who wants a little nap and a
               cappuccino for when he wakes up,
               not too much foam...

                             ANNA
               You re not "some guy" anymore,
               Hudson.  Right now, you're the
               only guy.  Without your help, I....

     Anna looks to Hawk with a choked-up expression.  The
     weight of the world on his shoulders, Hawk turns away
     to a lovely view, his mind painfully raging and
     swirling toward peaceful clarity.

                             HAWK
               The world is beautiful.  Every day
               in prison I made sure to remember
               that.  It's only when I actually
               got out that I forgot.  If I was
               sane, I'd be on that plane to Rio.
               But being beaten and abused to
               fulfill some corporation's
               perverted vision does something to
               your mental health.  The world is
               beautiful and I'm tired of being
               fucked.
                       (turning around)
               It's Darwin and Minerva's turn to
               bite the pillow...

     Anna involuntarily does the sign of the cross.  Alex
     goodnaturedly does a jerking off motion.

                             ANNA
               That was beautiful.

                             ALEX
               I laughed, I cried.

     Shaking his head, Hawk swipes the plane tickets from
     Alex.

                             HAWK
               Rio, Alex?  After all they've
               done to...Hey, these tickets are
               for Moscow!

                             ALEX
                       (knowing smile)
               Damn travel agency.  That Kremlin
               thing is in Moscow, isn't it?

     A proud Hawk slaps Alex on the back as some passing
     ITALIAN LOCALS stop to stare, horrified, at Alex's
     bullet holes.  Anna sweetly intervenes.

                             ANNA
               Ketchup.  Stupido Americani...

     The locals give off a slightly dazed "A-a-h" and move off.

     INT. THE CONFERENCE ROOM--DAY

     Wind blows through the shattered conference room window.
     Snickers is banging on his computer apparatus at the
     table with the Mayflowers and the other agents.

                             KAPLAN
               We're all family now.  My team
               has done a lot of rougher things
               than steal the model of a
               helicopter.

                             SNICKERS
               We're going to whack this place
               so fast we'll have time to shop
               for American imports.

     Darwin and Minerva politely smile and then turn away to
     each other with knowing looks.  The computer screen shows
     the familiar image of the Kremlin building that turns
     into a complex look at interiors the viewer will later
     see.

                             ALMOND JOY
               Lucky for us, the Da Vinci is
               located in a wing of the Kremlin
               that they used to throw the Miss
               Ukraine pageant and stuff.  It'll
               have the least number of guards....

                             KAPLAN
               As for our plan of action,
               anybody'd be insane to go in
               from the ground floor...

     INT. A VAN-BUS--NIGHT

     A head-rubbing Hawk and a stomach rubbing Alex kneel on
     the floor of a moving van, over a barely legible drawing
     of what was so neatly delineated on the CIA computer.
     Both guys are dressed as priests and are chewing gum.

                             ALEX
               We're going in from the ground
               floor.

                             HAWK
               Geez, this Art Treasures Room
               looks like a burnt diaphragm.

     Hawk laughs and pops up into the passenger seat.  Anna
     is revealed to be driving in her habit.  Hawk gives her
     a kiss.

                             HAWK
               Hey, don't take your disguise so
               seriously.

                             ANNA
               Uh, yeah.  Guess I'm a wee bit
               nervous.  I'm sorry I could only
               score clergy passports.

                             HAWK
               Fits my new image.  A thief for
               the masses.  This is one job I'm
               not going to feel guilty about
               enjoying.  Gum.

     Hawk, Alex, and Anna all spit out their gum into a bag
     Hawk holds.

                             ALEX
               The security's actually not that
               severe.

                             ANNA
               It doesn't have to be.  Everybody
               knows that if you mess with the
               Kremlin, you'll end up in a
               Siberian gulag eating your own
               fingernails.

     Hawk takes in some views of Moscow that remind one of
     Budapest.

                             HAWK
               Shwoof, that makes me feel better.
               I can't believe this is the Iron
               Curtain.  All the guy at Airport
               customs wanted to know was "Who
               Shot J.R.?"

                             ALEX
               You sound disappointed.

                             HAWK
               Yeah, I mean, come on, going
               through the Iron Curtain is
               supposed to be crawling
               underneath barbed wire, it's
               supposed to be strangling a
               guard...

     THE VAN

     passes a textbook shot of the Kremlin in the distance.

                             HAWK (V.O.)
               It's supposed to be parachuting
               in the moonlight....

     EXT. THE TOP OF THE KREMLIN--NIGHT

     Kaplan, Snickers, Almond Joy, and Butterfinger slam down
     upon the roof of the Kremlin and discard their
     parachutes.

     Snickers opens up his computer screen, upon which is the
     image-map of the Kremlin with a flashing blue light at
     the top of the building and a flashing green one inside.

                             SNICKERS
               We are the blue light.  The green
               light is where the Art Treasures
               room is.

                             KAPLAN
               Let's go make a purple light.
               Where's Kit Kat?

     EXT. THE KREMLIN GROUNDS

     Dressed in cat burglar black and all chewing gum, Hawk,
     Alex, and Anna crawl across the Kremlin grounds.  They
     scope out a shabby Delivery Entrance.

                             ALEX
               Delivery Entrance.  Low Security.

                             ANNA
               Gum.

     All three spit out their gum into Hawk's bag.

                             HAWK
               Count of three?

                             ALEX
               Why not just go now?

                             HAWK
               Okay.

     The Trio rush for the door.

     THE KREMLIN ROOF

     SOVIET GUARD ONE comes out on the roof to light a cig-
     arette.  He looks in the distance to the motivating CIA
     team.  Suddenly a card floats down into his hand.

     It reads:   WILLIAM TELL.  ADAM'S APPLE.  GET IT?

     The not-getting-it Guard looks up from the card as a
     grinning Kit Kat parachutes behind him.  The Guard
     swerves around and Kit Kat savagely skewers him with a
     crossbow shot to his Adam's apple.

     THE DELIVERY ENTRANCE

     Hawk, Anna, and Alex race to the door, the latter
     bashes it...

     INT. GRUNGY WHITE FOYER

     open and sets off an annoying hammer-against-bell alarm.
     Alex all-fours beneath the alarm.  Hawk does a Michael
     Jordan vault off Alex's back and slam dunks A MASSIVE
     BALL OF USED-GUM, pulled from his bag, between the
     hammer and the bell, cutting off the sound.  They rush
     ahead.

     EXT. THE KREMLIN ROOF

     The agents are trotting across the roof when a phone on
     Snickers' apparatus rings.  Kaplan answers it.

                             KAPLAN
               Everything's going fine, Minerva,
               thanks for asking...

     INT. NONDESCRIPT HALLWAY

     Minerva chats on a cellular moving down a hallway, with
     Darwin, who is holding in his laughter as if this was a
     great crank.

                             MINERVA
               I say who needs this Hudson Hawk
               anyway....

     INT. A GRAND BALLROOM

     The good guys scurry upon the second level of an epic
     and gorgeous ballroom.  Two lush staircases lead up from
     the floor.  From behind a pillar, the gang checks out
     the activity below.

     A tablecloth is being wrangled over a large table at
     the opposite end of the ballroom by SERVANTS.  Threaten-
     ing SOVIET SOLDIERS maneuver on the floor.

                             HAWK
                       (Wizard of Oz)
               Oh-Eee-Oh-A-Whoa-Oh.

     They then make a mad scuffle across their side of the
     second level, hunkering down by the level railing.

     As they move into another wing hallway, the viewer's
     viewpoint moves back down to the ballroom floor to see
     a gloating DARWIN AND MINERVA ENTER, the latter still
     on the phone.

                             MINERVA
               Everybody here, in Rome, wishes
               you tinsel boxes of love...

     The servants move away from the tablecloth and the
     table, revealing that it is shaped like an M.  A GROUP
     OF SERIOUS SOVIET V.I.P.'s come out to join the
     Mayflowers at the table.

     THE ROOF

     Kaplan hangs up the phone.

                             KAPLAN
               Lazy, rich, condescending bitch.

     The team moves up to the rooftop doorway where Kit Kat
     is.  He holds up an "About Time" card.  The agents laugh
     and greet them.

     INT. A VERY LONG, ENIGMATIC HALLWAY

     Hawk, Alex, and Anna pass through a set of windowed
     double doors into a very long hallway that leads into a
     pitch darkness.  A MURAL OF A HAPPY, ARM-STRETCHED LENIN
     looms above the doors.  They give it a a quick glance
     before pulling out screwdrivers and wire hangers.

                             ALEX
               Eighth room down, babe...

                             ANNA
               Guards come exactly every three
               minutes....

                             HAWK
               Three.  Oh.  Oh.  "Side by Side."

     Our trio charges down the hallway.

                             HAWK
               "Oh, we ain't got a barrel of
               money.

                             ALEX
               "Maybe we're ragged and funny."

     They reach a MASSIVE SPOOKY DOOR WITH AN ODD, ANCIENT
     LOCK.  They go to work on it.  Not losing the beat.

                             HAWK AND ALEX
               "But we'll travel along, singing
               a song.  Side by Side..."

     INT. TOP FLOOR HALLWAY

     With a gust of wind, Kaplan and the Candy Bars bluster
     through the rooftop door into another hallway, where
     SOVIET GUARDS TWO AND THREE are taking it easy.

                             KAPLAN
               Create a diversion.

     Snickers and Butterfinger calmly blow away both guards
     with silenced mini-Uzis.

     SOVIET GUARD FOUR rushes out a door before the agents,
     zipping up his fly.  Almond Joy twists his neck with an
     agonizing SNAP.

     THE LONG HALLWAY

     Hawk, Anna, and Alex retreat beneath the Lenin mural
     through the windowed double doors.

     Behind the doors, they poke up to see a BESPECTACLED
     GUARD emerge from the darkness to check out the door.

                             ALEX
               Now that's a lock.

                             HAWK
               Don't worry, we'll get it...

                             ANNA
               Can I sing this time, too?
               Please?

     Hawk and Alex are not thrilled about the idea, but Anna's
     eye flutter does it.

                             HAWK
               Uh, I guess so.

     The Bespectacled Guard moves back into the darkness.

     THE BALLROOM

     The Soviet V.I.P.'s open up presents of pink L.A. GEAR
     tennis shoes, silly T-shirts, and Nintendo joysticks
     as a standing Darwin hypnotizes them.

                             DARWIN
               I look at you Soviet people and I
               feel... pity... superiority.  Most
               of your life, your government has
               told you that Capitalism turns
               people into robots who'd rather
               eat microwave sushi, naked in the
               back of a Cadillac than hear the
               laughter of children.

                             MINERVA
                       (smiling)
               We're here to say, your government
               was right.

                             DARWIN
               So let's get busy.  Have some fun
               and make some deals.

     AT THE LOCK

     Alex holds a lit match into the lock, while Hawk
     does something incomprehensible with a screwdriver.
     They are improvising...

                             HAWK
               "Oh this lock is a pain in the bu-utt"

                             ALEX
               "How'd we ever get such in a ru-utt"

     Anna suddenly, booms out the chorus in a way that Hawk and
     Alex can barely concentrate.

                             ANNA
               "But we'll travel the road, Sharing
               the load.  Side by Side!"

     THE HALLWAY ABOVE

     The CIA team saunters through corpses up to a door
     similar in lock and design to the one Hawk and Alex
     are working on.

     Snickers's computer screen shows the blue light directly
     above the green light.

                             SNICKERS
               This is the room above the Art
               Treasures room.  The lock is a
               Natalya Z-Z, first created...

                             ALMOND JOY
               Snickers, baby, I love you like a
               brother, but really, who cares?
               Silencer bomb...

     Butterfinger pulls from around his shoulder a strange
     rifle.  He attaches to the front of it;, a glass encased,
     suctioning time-bomb from a waist satchel.  He fires
     the bomb against the door and it starts ticking.

     BEHIND THE WINDOWED DOUBLE DOORS

     come Hawk, Alex, and Anna, panting.

                             HAWK
               That was close....

                             ALEX
               Anna, I think you better stay....

                             HAWK
               You can be lookout!.....  Take
               Alex's gun.

     Alex hands Anna his gun, who glumly takes it like a Little
     Sister not allowed to play.  Hawk and Alex go back through
     the doors.

     THE HALLWAY ABOVE

     The CIA bomb blows up the door with a weird silencer
     sound.  Kaplan and the Candy Bars giddily whoop as they
     rush through the smoking door.

     THE BALLROOM--SECOND LEVEL

     Anna meanders across the second level muttering to herself
     in Italian and amusingly imitating Hawk's condescension.

                             ANNA
               "You can be the lookout."

     Anna suddenly moves past the pillar to see the Mayflowers
     and the V.I.P.S.  She gasps and hurls herself behind the
     second level railing.

     THE BALLROOM FLOOR

     A VERY DIGNIFIED SOVIET LEADER, in a SHIT HAPPENS baseball
     cap, addresses Darwin.

                             SOVIET LEADER
               Before we serve you "the main course,"
               hee, hee, we need to know specifics
               about what you can do for us.  We--

                             DARWIN
               Bluntness.  How amusingly Hungarian.
               Listen up, for reasons I don't want
               to get into, I recently had to close
               down a petroleum factory, but I'm
               going to re-build it here and
               Madonna's going to cut the ribbon!
               Frozen burritos in Leningrad.  1982
               fantasy.  1992 reality.

     THE LOCK OUTSIDE THE DOOR

     Hawk and Alex more frantically toil on the lock.

                             HAWK
               "We all had our quarrels and
               parted..."

                             ALEX
               "But we'll be the same as we started...

     The lock clunks open.  They race through the doors into...

     INT. THE ART TREASURE ROOM

     Hawk and Alex weave through the room which is crammed,
     with little nuance, to the gills with great art treasures
     including an impressive array of Faberge eggs.  A solid
     gold hammer and sickle hang on one wall...

                             HAWK AND ALEX
               "Just traveling along, singing a
               song.  Side--"

                             HAWK
               Geez, this place is a mess...

                             ALEX
               Voila...

     They rumble toward an opening in the wall of the room
     covered by a small curtain that has the Da Vinci Man in
     the Circle drawing emblazoned across it.  Hawk reaches
     for the curtain.  Alex puts his arm around him and speaks,
     not sings.

                             ALEX
               Side by side, man...

     Suddenly, the roof above them explodes.  Kaplan and the
     Candy Bars drop down behind them.

                             ALMOND JOY
               What the hell....

                             SNICKERS
               You're supposed to be dead!

                             ALEX
               I'm a ghost.  Boo.

                             HAWK
               I don't want to sound immature,
               but we were here first...

                             KAPLAN
               I wish I could think of those cute
               quips the way you can, Hawk, but
               I can't, so I'll just shoot Alex.

     Kaplan point blank shoots Alex in the chest.  Alex
     crumples backward, moaning.  Butterfinger, casually, but
     with incredible strength, holds Hawk's arms behind his
     back.

                             HAWK
               No....

                             ALMOND JOY
               That was pretty uncool, George...

                             KAPLAN
               Sorry, you know he kind of reminds
               me of Little Eddie.  But I digress.
               Ah, victory is so sweet....

     Kaplan pulls back the Da Vinci curtain.  Nothing is there.

     THE BALLROOM BANQUET

     A SOVIET CHEF lifts up a silver domed serving tray,
     revealing the Da Vinci helicopter model.

                             MINERVA
               Yum.  This is the best meal I
               ever had...

     ANNA

     bulges her eyes at the revelation.  She pulls out Alex's
     gun and bangs herself in the head.  What to do....

     THE ART TREASURES ROOM

     Kaplan is bugging out.

                             KAPLAN
               Damnit, this isn't the plan!
               Blue light, green light, shit!
               Snickers, Kit Kat, A.J., scramble,
               see if you can find out anything.

     They thunder out.  Hawk, still in Butterfinger's
     oblivious clutches, shouts..

                             HAWK
               Can't you see the Mayflowers
               double-crossed you...

                             KAPLAN
               They may be scum, but if I get the
               Da Vinci model back, then we'll be
               roasting weenies on the beach.

                             HAWK
               I don't think you'll appreciate
               their choice of weenie.

     Kaplan raises his gun.

     THE BALLROOM BANQUET

     Darwin holds the Da Vinci model in one hand and raises
     a glass of vodka in the other.

                             DARWIN
               You're helping us achieve a goal
               and in return, I'm giving you a
               key to the world's executive
               washroom.  Don't piss it away....
               Skoal, amigos...

                              ANNA (O.S.)
               Stop or I'll shoot.

     Minerva and some various Soviet VIPS spew their vodka to
     look up to Anna pointing a gun down at them from the
     second level.  She is shivering, shaking the gun.

                              ANNA
               You people are immoral and
               narcissitic and I won't let you...

     In unison, the Soviet Soldiers surrounding the table
     begin machine gunning up at her.  She dives behind the
     railing.

     THE ART TREASURES ROOM

     Kaplan lowers his gun.

                             KAPLAN
               I can't believe this.  I'm in
               fucking Russia, or do I have to
               say, the fucking Soviet Union and
               I'm shooting a non-Bolshevick.
                       (raising back up
                        his gun)
               I never thought I'd say "I'm just
               in this job for the money."  Sad.
               Any last immature quips?

                             HAWK
               No.
                       (a beat)
               But why do you let Butterfinger
               keep those blood stains on his
               shirt?

     Falling for the oldest trick in the book, Butterfinger
     looks down to his shirt.

                             BUTTERFINGER
               What blood stains....

     Hawk bounces up to savagely head-butt Butterfinger.
     Butterfinger slams back against a wall causing the Gold
     Sickle to fall down around his neck and knock him to the
     ground, pinning his head to the floor.  The Gold Hammer
     next trembles off the wall and crushes Butterfinger's
     skull.

                             HAWK
               You want immature, how 'bout an
               egg fight...

     Hawk flings a Faberge egg, smashing the gun out of Kaplan's
     hand.  Hawk pelts a batch more at him.  Kaplan sloppily
     whips some eggs back.  Hawk finally smashes one in half
     and beans the jagged piece into Kaplan's eye.  He squeals
     to the ground, geysering blood.

     Hawk swoops down to a wheezing, breath controlling Alex.

                             HAWK
               Alex, are you....

                             ALEX
               I can't believe you didn't notice.
               My weight.  I lost ten pounds in
               Rome

                              HAWK
               You're a reed, man.  I gotta get
               Anna.  Hang in there...

     THE BALLROOM

     Bullets stop splintering around Anna at the railing as
     the soldiers fling out their empty cartridges to reload.

     Snickers, Almond Joy, and Kit Kat race out of the hall-
     way area into the ballroom area.  They stop at the sight
     of Anna....

                             ALMOND JOY
               Anna-bannana-fo-fanna, I guess I
               have to cut out your heart for
               real now.  It's not personal.

     Anna feebly raises her gun.  Almond Joy laughs and
     pulls out a knife.

                             ALMOND JOY
               You won't shoot.  I read your
               dossier... Sister.

     The Soviet Soldiers snap in new cartridges as Almond Joy
     moves out from behind the pillar towards Anna.  The
     Soldiers blast away at this newly appearing figure.

     Almond Joy ruptures and vibrates in a Sonny Corleone
     ballet.

                             ALMOND JOY
               I gotta get a new job...

     Snickers and Kit Kat militarily roll on either side of
     Anna as their partner wilts to the ground.  The men,
     Snickers with his mini-Uzi, Kit Kat with his cross-
     bow rifle, briefly leap up to fire down at the soldiers
     with some graphic success.

     Anna watches Darwin and Minerva head up the stairs to
     her level.  She bolts off....

     BALLROOM FLOOR

     The last of the Soviet VIPS flee as the Soldiers tip
     over the M shaped table on its side, using it for
     cover, firing upward.

     KIT KAT

     breaks off and scurries around the second level to get
     a position behind the M.

     He fires down an arrow for a successful kill.  Another
     guard tries to fire up, but Kit Kat impales him to the
     back of the table with a quality shot.

     Kit Kat grins and reloads as Alfred, the butler, regally
     creeps behind him.

     HAWK

     comes out of the long hallway double doors up to where
     Anna is bustling.  They hug...

                             ANNA
               The Mayflowers got...

     Hawk and Anna turn to see the Mayflowers hastening in
     their direction.  Noticing them back, the model-toting
     Mayflowers halt.

     KIT KAT

     turns to Alfred and fires his crossbow.  Alfred effort-
     lessly cuts it in half with his blade and continues
     to move forward.  Still smiling, Kit Kat tries to reload.

     MINERVA

     breaks the standstill.

                             DARWIN
               What a pleasant surprise.  You're
               probably wondering...

                             HAWK
               But you're going to tell us
               anyway...

                             MINERVA
               I hate a man with a sense of
               humor.  While you corn dogs were
               comparing the lengths of your
               masculinity, we obtained the
               helicopter the new fashioned
               way: a thoroughly corrupt business
               deal.

                             HAWK
               If you think you're getting past
               me...

     Grunting behind them, Snickers gun-butts Hawk to the
     ground.

                             HAWK
               Don't be stupid...they...

                             SNICKERS
               Bastard!  If you were a true
               American.

                             HAWK
               Just shut up and hit me!

     Snickers swings a punch.  Hawk blocks it then whomps
     him in the chest.

     As they battle, Darwin grabs Anna's hair, slams her
     into a pillar, and watches her crumple.

     KIT KAT

     gets in an arrow but it's too late.  Alfred stabs
     him deep, deep, deeply, and lifts him from the ground.

     A shower of cards reading "OUCH" "PAIN" and "THIS REALLY
     HURTS" rain from out of Kit Kat's coat.

     Alfred discards him over the edge.

     Kit Kat sails down upon the M.

     The lone card of "FUCK" plops from his open eyed corpse.

     HAWK

     and Snickers trades fierce blows, stumbling down a
     staircase.

     DARWIN

     and Minerva watch the fight with amusement.  Alfred
     approaches.

                             DARWIN
               Alfred, the getaway car...

     SNICKERS

     slashes Hawk in the arm with a small but sinister blade.

                             HAWK
               Damnit, I hate this!  I'm a cat
               burglar!  Nobody said anything
               about this fight-to-the-death
               shit.

                             SNICKERS
               Too bad.

     Snickers goes for a final thrust when suddenly one of the
     silencer time bombs suctions to his head.

     Hawk turns to see Alex, barely standing, at the top of
     the stairs, holding the strange rifle.

     Darwin and Minerva turn to this dramatic entrance.  They
     start to trot off...

                             MINERVA
               I knew it!  I told you it was a
               fake.

                             DARWIN
               That New-York-Italian-Father-
               made-twenty-bucks-a-week-son-
               of-a-bitch.  What was our bet?  A
               million?

                             MINERVA
               Million five, lover...

     HAWK

     boots Snickers down the stairs.  Snickers somersaults
     up and frantically tries to pull off the bomb.

     Snickers wails to the soldiers, who have lowered their
     guns and are poking their heads out of the M to watch.

                             SNICKERS
               Help me you Democratic Reform
               lovers!  Get a screwdriver, you
               Stupid Eskimoes!  Screw-dri-ver!
               Oh God, I always wanted to know
               how to play the harp, there
               just was so little time!  Rosebud!

     The soldiers high-tail it out.  Snickers plugs his ears.
     Nothing happens.

                             SNICKERS
               Maybe it was just a....

     Snickers blows up gloriously before the M.

     THE STAIRCASE

     Hawk bounds up to Alex, who puffs down onto the steps.

                             ALEX
               Get 'em.  They went down the
               hallway.

                             HAWK
               Let's just forget it, I mean...

                             ALEX
               Get em....

     Hawk rushes up the. stairs, gives a "What can I do?" glance
     to the unconscious Anna, and then continues rushing, past
     a pillar.  Minerva emerges from behind the pillar and
     moves forward.

     THE LONG ENIGMATIC HALLWAY

     Hawk chugs beneath the Lenin mural and down the hall-
     way.  He sees Darwin breezing in front of him.  Darwin
     looks back to Hawk then runs forward into the darkness.

     THE BALLROOM

     Minera sits down next to the pained Alex.

                             MINERVA
               Alex.  How's it going?

                             ALEX
               Go, go to Hell, to Hell.

     Minerva pulls out a candy bar and rips it open.

                             MINERVA
               Where's your insulin....No?  Well,
               Bon Appetite.

     Minerva savagely slams Alex's head down and shoves the
     candy bar in his mouth.

     THE HALLWAY

     Hawk moves closer and closer to the darkness of the
     hallway when a one-eyed and bleeding George Kaplan dives
     out of the Art Treasures room and tackles him.  Hawk
     kicks him off...

                             HAWK
               Oh, come on....

     THE BALLROOM

     Alex gulps down the last of the candy bar, shivering.

                             MINERVA
               Very good, Alex, but you re
               still alive....

     She pulls out another candy bar.  Alex, with a last
     burst of strength, punches her across the face.

                             MINERVA
               That's fair.

     THE LONG HALLWAY

     Hawk and Kaplan lock onto each other's throats.

                             HAWK
               Why does this have to be so hard...

                             KAPLAN
               Tell me about it...

     Suddenly, of all things, a car is heard rumbling in the
     darkness.

     Hawk and Kaplan stop fighting and turn to see THE MAY-
     FLOWER LIMOUSINE screeching out of the darkness with
     Darwin standing out of the sunroof firing a gun.

     Bullets fly around them.  From his back pocket, Hawk
     slaps the nice picture of him and Little Eddie into
     Kaplan's hands.

                             HAWK
               Take this to Hell with you...

     Hawk jumps up and grabs a hanging lamp.

     Deranged with confusion, Kaplan turns from the picture
     to the charging limousine.

                             KAPLAN
               My pension.....

     The driving Alfred smiles through the windshield.

     Kaplan's body slams into a vivid somersaulting crash
     into the windshield.

     Hawk's hands burn and sizzle on the hanging lamp.

     Passing beneath, Darwin raises up his gun.

     Hawk lets go of the lamp and drops down on Darwin,
     locking his legs around his neck and crushing him
     down into....

     THE BACKSEAT OF THE LIMOUSINE

     Hawk and Darwin grapple on the floor of the limo.  The
     Da Vinci helicopter model bobs on the backseat.  Darwin's
     gun goes off..

     right through Alfred's throat.  He slumps over, pressing
     down on the accelerator.

     THE LIMOUSINE

     blasts down the hallway, sparking off the wall, and
     bashing off paintings and mirrors.

     THE BACKSEAT

     Darwin flicks on his paper shredder and shoves the side
     of Hawk's hand into its teeth.

     OUTSIDE THE LIMOUSINE

     A mist of blood coughs out of the shredder vent and makes
     a weird bloody line across the wall.

     INT. BACKSEAT

     Hawk yanks his hand from the shredder and grabs the meg-
     lomaniac by the hair and shoves his head down on the
     arm rest.  Hawk turns on the piercing siren and Darwin's
     eyes try to escape his head with a high pitched scream.
     Darwin's entire body bucks wildly.

     Darwin back-elbows Hawk and moves down for his gun.
     Hawk pulls him back by his hair, grabs him by the balls,
     and pushes him upward through the sunroof.

                             DARWIN
               God-damnit, I only wanted to
               destroy the world in my own image.
               I'm a regular Joe...

     Darwin pounds his fists on Hawk's head as Hawk hits the
     sunroof switch sliding it shut on Darwin, pinning
     his arms below the roof, but leaving his torso twisting
     in the wind.

     The mural of a happy Lenin with his arms outstretched
     looms ahead waiting to greet Darwin.

     Putting two and two together, Darwin loses it....

                             DARWIN
               Not Lenin, anybody but Lenin.  God,
               let's talk abut this.

     The limousine charges through the double doors and Darwin's
     body connects with the mural.

     INSIDE THE LIMO

     Hearing the crunch, Hawk flips into the front seat and
     brakes the vehicle.  Alfred's head bounces against the
     steering wheel.  Hawk reaches over with a grin and picks
     up the Da Vinci model.  He looks to Alfred, Kaplan
     crunched in the windshield, and Darwin's dangling legs.

                             HAWK
               Wow, this is really gonna hurt the
               resale value...

     THE BALLROOM

     Hawk runs up to a woozy Anna and helps her up.  She has
     a cross-shaped blood stain on her forehead.

                             HAWK
               Oh, honey....

     Hawk looks to Alex, sitting on the stairs, the same way
     he left him.  Hawk rushes to him.

                             HAWK
               We did it man, we...

     Hawk grabs Alex's shoulder.  Alex falls back.  Written
     over his face in red lipstick is REALLY DEAD.

     Engaging a slow motion sequence, Minerva saunters behind
     Anna, putting on red lipstick.  Minerva slams her back
     to the ground.

     Hawk howls then turns to see stiff-upper-lip Alfred,
     bleeding from the neck.  Hawk tries to throw a punch,
     but Alfred blocks it and crunches him across the face.

     The Da Vinci helicopter model bounces down the stairs
     in slow motion and cracks open, revealing the intricate
     mirror of the opening scene.

     INT. DARK ROOM ATOP MAYFLOWER MUSEUM--DAY

     A damaged Hawk awakens in a dungeonish room and stumbles
     to some shutters.  "O Solo Mio" returns on the sound-
     track as the shutters open to a postcard view of Vinci.

     Hawk closes the shutters and cuts off the music.  A
     slightly more composed Anna touches his shoulder causing
     him to jump slightly.  They melt into a kiss.

                             ANNA
               Oh Hudson...

                             HAWK
               I told you not to call me Hudson.
               The only people who called me that
               were the nuns at...

                             ANNA
               Oh Hudson, I'm a sister of the
               Catholic church as well as an
               agent.

                             HAWK
                       (cut-off laugh)
               This is too bad to be false.

     Alfred enters the room in his favorite outfit with a
     bandage around his neck.  His voice is strange, but still
     polite.

                             ALFRED
               Welcome back to Vinci.

                             HAWK
               Last rites, sister?

                             ANNA
               Please, no nun jokes...They're a
               bad habit to get into....get it?

     Hawk and Anna unconvincingly laugh then sadly pause.

                              HAWK
               She killed Alex.

     Alfred gives them a push.

     INT. THE DA VINCI WORKSHOP

     Alfred leads them through the Da Vinci workshop past the
     bat winged glider and incongruously crammed-in tennis ball
     machine.

     INT. THE ROOM OF THE GOLD MACHINE--DAY

     Alfred grandly opens double-doors to reveal that Da
     Vinci's gold machine has been majestically re-created
     piece by piece.  In the periphery, the 90's rears its
     head in the form of THREE TECHNICIANS wearing headsets
     and gun holsters who consult computer terminals.

                              MINERVA (O.S.)
               GOLD-FI-ING-ER!

     Hawk and Anna turn to see Minerva splashily enter in
     sexy funeral-wear.

                              MINERVA
               Sorry, I couldn't resist.  You're
               probably wondering why you're
               still alive.  Anna.....

     As Minerva speaks, TECHNICIAN ONE forcibly escorts Anna
     toward a stand near the gold machine and tightly
     handcuffs her to it.

                              MINERVA
               I want you to monitor the Da
               Vinci's directions from the
               apprentice diary.  And Hawk, I
               didn't want you to go to hell
               without knowing that Darwin and
               I's dream came true.
                       (suddenly sheepish)
               Beside that, none of us can seem
               to put that damn crystal together.
               Alfie and I were up all night with
               the thing.

     TECHNICIAN TWO commences a forcible escort of Hawk to the
     gold machine.  Hawk cold-cocks him to the ground.

                              HAWK
               You killed a friend.  Why should I
               help you go for the gold?

                              MINERVA
               It'll take a couple of years of
               steady production, but I'll flood
               the market with so much gold that
               gold itself, the foundation of all
               finance, will lose its meaning.
               Brokers, economists, and fellow
               entrepreneurs will drown in the
               saliva of their own nervous
               breakdowns.  Markets will crash-
               crash.  Financial Empires will
               crumble-crumble.

                              HAWK
               Except yours-yours.  The goal of
               world domination.  Well, if you
               put it that way, Minnie.  How can
               I resist?

                              MINERVA
               You can't, convict!  You're just
               a shmoe!  Every shmoe has the
               fantasy the planet revolves around
               them.  It rains, car crash stops
               traffic, you say "How could this
               happen to me?"  It's a natural
               inclination.  But for I, this
               isn't a fantasy, it is reality!
               You are on my planet!  You walk
               around the corner for coffee, out
               of my sight, you do not fucking
               exist!  The lives of shmoes like
               you have meaning only in relation
               to the rich, to the powerful, to ME!

     Anna looks at the oil cloth diary before her.  She pulls
     a compact from her pocket and holds the compact mirror
     over the scribblings.  Reading off the reflection, her
     eyes widen.

                              ANNA
               Do it.  There's no reason to fight
               anymore.  She's a force of nature.

     Trying to get a grip on Anna's words, Hawk lets himself
     be escorted to another stand before the gold machine that
     has the two complex crystal parts and the weird mirror.

                              MINERVA
               If you pull this off, I can't
               promise I won't kill you.  I mean,
               who we trying to kid?  But I will
               spare the Flying Nun here....

                              HAWK
               And to think I thought you were
               Evil Incarnate in pumps.

                              MINERVA
               I killed some lovable working
               class Italian-diabetic, but you
               killed the most significant male
               figure of the decade and a kind,
               gentle lover.  So don't play with
               me.

     Minerva flicks a switch on the stand Anna's handcuffed
     to.  Anna vibrates, being electrocuted.

                              HAWK
               Okay, fine!

     Minerva switches it off.  Giving himself a head rub, Hawk
     bears down on the three oddly malleable objects.  He
     TANGLES and BENDS and with a loud SNAP, puts them
     together, forming the Crystal from the opening scene.
     Minerva snatches it from him and puts on a head-set.

                              MINERVA
               Oh Hawk, don't ever change.  Go,
               team, go!

     Minerva giddily sets the crystal in the same place as Da
     Vinci had it in his machine.

     Using a long steel pole, Technician One adjusts a myriad
     of mirrors so they are in a proper angle with a series
     of lenses culminating on the top of the machine.

     Technicians Two (black-eyed) and Three pour various
     chemical powders and liquids into corresponding compart-
     ments on the machine, beautifully decorated by the
     chemical's zodiac sign.

     Alfred places a lead bar in its proper place.

     Hawk glides to Anna and undoes her handcuff.

                              HAWK
               I hope you know what....

                              ANNA
               Trust Leonardo....

                              HAWK
               Wha.....

     Anna puts her fingers on his lips.

     Minerva throws a lever.  Steam begins to percolate from
     the furnace towards the machine.

                              MINERVA
                       (into the headset)
               We're for real.

     THE MACHINE

     begins to rotate, at first clunkily, then faster.
     The Crystal rotates comfortably in its compartment.

     The machine throws out its folding arms, each with an
     element.  The arms click higher.

     The goggled technicians stand before a time-coded video
     monitor, taking notes.

     The chemical housings open and the chemicals begin to
     spill and drop through brass tubes.

     ANNA

     murmurs to Hawk.

                              ANNA
               Da Vinci made the real directions
               in a secret script that I decoded.
               The way the machine is running
               now, the gold will produce too
               quickly, clog, and the machine
               will shut itself down.  Isn't it
               wonderful?

                              HAWK
               Yeah, but what would happen if that
               little mirror came out of the
               crystal.

                              ANNA
               Wha -- you don't want to know...

     Hawk pulls out the mirror from his pocket.

                              HAWK
               I wanna know...

                              ANNA
               Holy sh-h--things are going to
               get very interesting, very fast.
               Da Vinci would be proud of you.

     IN THE MACHINE

     The chemicals snake down their individual paths to the
     Lead Bar spinning its trough.  There's a FLASH and a
     controlled but jarring explosion.

     EVERYONE

     doubletakes.  Hawk reaches down to the six foot steel
     pole and with one swing slams the faces of all three
     deep in concentration Technicians to the ground.

     Oblivious to the violence behind her, Minerva, pulling
     on goggles over her head-set, moves closer with a
     religious purr.

     THE MACHINE

     triggers a fresnel lens and laserlike beams bounce around
     the mirrors faster and faster, circling the room.

     OUTSIDE THE MACHINE

     Hawk and Anna squint, blinded.  Flinging off her goggles,
     A literally beaming Minerva giggles forward.

     THE MACHINE

     Beams of light converge on the top mirror and bounce into
     the innards of the machine with a mighty roar!

     MINERVA

     sees that the center of the machine gleams yellowish and
     molten.  She moves closer, shouting into her head-set.

                              MINERVA
               Eureka, motherfuckers!

     The machine thunders and spins at a more aggressive
     pace.

     Hawk's voice suddenly comes on Minerva's head-set.

                              HAWK'S VOICE (head-set)
               Minnie, hate to interrupt your
               orgasm, but....

     HAWK AND ANNA

     stand above the unconscious Technicians.  Hawk is on
     head-set.

                              HAWK
               Me, Anna, and Leonardo just wanna
               say you got the Midas touch, baby...

     MACHINE

     Minerva turns toward the machine in anger and confusion.

     The center of the machine blows.  The pool of molten gold
     rockets at the viewer.

     Mirrors explode and the lasers slash at the walls.

     Minerva tumbles from the machine, screaming, that is to
     say, trying to scream, because molten gold covers her
     face.  It bubbles and cascades, turning her into a
     bizarrely beautiful echo of Nefertiti.

     HAWK AND ANNA

     turn to retreat, and see, standing in the mouth of the
     open double doors, in an open shirt, wearing Indian war
     paint on his face and the words RULE BRITANNIA painted
     on his chest, ALFRED!

                              ALFRED
               How.

                              HAWK
               You're unemployed, Alfie.  Boss
               is dead.  Her plan is over.

                              ALFRED
                       (strange voiced)
               My plan is just beginning.  I'll
               forgive you for denying me the
               pleasure of slaughtering my
               boorish employers, but I'm afraid
               the birth of the new British
               Empire can have no witnesses!

                              HAWK
               Ooh-kay...

     Alfred rushes forward with a howl.  Hawk meets him
     halfway.  They trade savage punches and then lock onto
     each other's throats.

     Anna pulls a gun from a technician's holster and prays
     for forgiveness.  She aims steadily, and fires...

     right into Hawk's arm.  This allows Alfred to knock him
     back with a strong punch.

                              ANNA
               Sorry!

     She fires again.  The bullet pings off Hawk's belt buckle.

                              HAWK
               Stop helping me!  Thou shalt not
               kill!

     Hawk's turning to chastize Anna, allows Alfred to kick
     Hawk back against a wall.  Alfred lunges out with his
     blade, hitting the wall off-angle.  Hawk yanks the shaft.
     Alfred goes with the flow and presses the shaft on Hawk's
     throat.

     Gasping, Hawk looks to a rip in Alfred's shirt and sees
     a hinge and lever on the shaft.  With an all or nothing
     jerk, Hawk flicks the lever.  The shaft clicks on the
     hinge.

     Alfred's greater strength and narrower grip makes it fold
     away from Hawk and suddenly it is Alfred's throat which
     is caught in the V-shaped trap!  The momentum of the
     sudden change makes Alfred stumble towards the wall until
     the point of the "V" hits it--

                              HAWK
               Don't lose your head over this.

     Hawk takes the six foot steel pole and gives a Babe Ruth
     swing right onto the V.  The blades slam together and
     POP ALFRED'S HEAD OFF, SENDING IT SCREAMING DISEMBODIED,
     HIGH IN THE AIR.

     ALFRED'S SCREAMING HEAD P.O.V.

     Hawk and Anna are seen waving up to the viewer (Alfie's
     head).

                              HAWK
               Excuse my crass American humor.

     The machine thunders with another explosion.

     THE DA VINCI WORKSHOP

     Hawk and Anna rush into the Da Vinci workshop.  She
     guiltily touches the surface wound on his arm.  He
     delicately takes the gun from her and laughs until he
     sees...

     BUNNY THE DOG!! standing in the open mouth of the
     workshop.  Anna turns to Hawk...

                              ANNA
               Allow me.

     Anna confidently moves toward the dog until Bunny leaps
     up and savagely clamps his teeth into her throat sending
     her crashing to the ground.

     Hawk pauses in disbelief before raising the gun.

     Bunny continues to viciously gnaw away on the convulsing
     Anna, blood gently starts to emerge.

     Hawk can't get off a shot.  He throws down the gun in
     exasperation.  It lands next to The Gadget that is
     connected to the Tennis Ball Machine.  Hawk rushes
     forward, picks up the gadget, turns the dial to Ten, and
     then smiles sweetly toward the dog.

                              HAWK
               Oh Bunny, Ball-Ball.

     Bunny stops his violent behavior and perkily looks up
     blood droplets drizzling from his mouth.

     Hawk slams down on the gadget.

     A tennis ball comes rocketing out of the machine.

     Bunny leaps and catches the rocketing ball but the force
     of it sends him FLYING AND CRASHING out a window.

     Hawk pulls up Anna as the machine completely EXPLODES.

     A huge chunk of the roof THUDS before the workshop door.

     Hawk suddenly looks off-camera and smiles.  Anna shakes
     her head vigorously.  He pulls her out of the frame.

     EXT. A VINCI COUNTRYSIDE TREE

     A man awakens from a nap and pulls up his hat.  It is THE
     TRAVELING JUGGLER WITH THE UNFORGETTABLY ETCHED FACE.

     He pulls his three red balls from a pouch on his mule.
     He begins a stoic juggle when another loud BOOM sends him
     to the ground.

     EXT. OUTSIDE THE GRAND CASTLE--DAY

     An explosion of steam and gas blows out the windows!
     Debris frisbees toward the camera along with....

     Anna, hanging on Hawk's waist, and Hawk, hanging from
     the bar on DA VINCI'S BAT WINGED GLIDER.

     The glider gracefully swooshes down through the castle -
     through the glorious vista.

     EXT. THE ROAD TO THE CASTLE

     The glider floats to a perfect landing before the
     Unforgettable Juggler.

                             JUGGLER
                         Che pazzo....

     Hawk and Anna collect themselves and look up to the smoke
     billowing castle.  They smile and gush in relief.  They
     wrap arms around the confused but warming up Juggler and
     laugh again.

     A SMALL PIAZZA

     The mule trots into a small storybook piazza in the hush
     of dawn.  Hawk, Anna, and the unforgettable Juggler ride
     atop it.

     A WOMAN WITH AN UNFORGETTABLY ETCHED FACE moves to a cafe
     table with a luminous smile.  She unfolds a table cloth
     atop it and then mystically sets down two cappuccinos.

     Hawk and Anna dismount, thank the Juggler, then cozy into
     the table.

                             HAWK
               Have I ever told you the world is
               beautiful...
                       (semi-seductively)
               I'd really like to play
               Nintendo with you, or something...

                             ANNA
               Hudson, I'm afraid I'm sticking
               with God.
                       (smiling)
               But you're a close second, tough
               guy.  What is that smile?

                             HAWK
                       (broadly grinning)
               I got my planet back.

     Hawk puts on a pair of sunglasses that look exactly like
     the ones Da Vinci wore in the opening and raises his cup.

                             HAWK
               The first one's for Alex.  Cheers.

     The viewer's viewpoint moves into Hawk's lips having a
     sip of that damn unmasculine European coffee.

                                                FADE OUT.

     FADE IN:

     EXT. VINCI COUNTRYSIDE - RENAISSANCE - DAY

     Beneath a jawdroppingly storybook castle, a small
     Renaissance Fair with florid awnings, demented ACROBATS
     and roaring puppets is unfolding.

     RUSTIC FARMERS and their families rumble with enjoyment
     at the Sabbath afternoon entertainment.

     Encircled by children, A JUGGLER WITH AN UNFORGETTABLY
     ETCHED FACE elegantly plucks the red balls from a pouch
     on his mule.  As he begins to juggle, a LOUD EXPLOSION
     is heard, causing him to ungracefully drop his balls
     and collapse in a heap.

     Everyone at the fair, including the puppets, looks up.

                             UNFORGETTABLE JUGGLER
               Leonardo, che pazzo.

     The juggler shakes his fist up to a swish pan that swings
     up toward a smoking window of the awesome castle...

     INT. ROOM OF THE GOLD MACHINE

     where the charismatic LEONARDO DA VINCI laughs down at
     him.  Da Vinci wears a pair of very early, very cool sun-
     glasses with his trademark beard.

     He turns and loses his smile, something extraordinary
     reflecting off his glasses.  Removing his shades, Da
     Vinci moves to the Something, a gloriously incredible
     machine.  The opening CREDITS REVEAL its dazzling idio-
     syncrasies.

     TWO COUGHING APPRENTICES haplessly try to disperse smoke
     from the still billowing, mysteriously spectacular
     Machine.  Mirrors attached to parts of it reflect beams
     of light which cut through the smoke like a Renaissance
     laser show.

                             DA VINCI
                       (silencing authority)
               Basta vapore.

     The apprentice throws a lever.  A shunt near the furnace
     turns.  Steam escapes upwards.  The machine immediately
     slows down.  Da Vinci oh-so-gently coughs and moves for-
     ward with tongs.

     A LITTLE TROUGH - IN THE MACHINE'S INNARDS

     comes to a trembling, mystical halt.  Right behind this
     trough is a CONPLEX POLYHEDRON CRYSTAL as intricately
     modulated as any Rubik stocking stuffer, but much more
     dazzling in beauty.  It gleams like a jewel in the yellow
     glow which pours from a PLEASANTLY GRINNING DEMONHEAD into
     a trough--a glow of heat--and something more than heat.

     The tongs enter the frame.

     Da Vinci brings the object closer to his face.  A murmur
     goes up from the awestruck apprentices as the Master
     peers at the smoking yellow bar.

                             APPRENTICE TWO
               Maestro, che meraviglia!

                             APPRENTICE THREE
               Lei e' proprio fantastico!

     Da Vinci's pride goes dead as the implications hit.

                             DA VINCI
               Lasciatemi, solo.  Solo!

     The apprentices scurry out.  Mind reeling, Da Vinci turns
     his back to the viewer, before a wall of frescoes.

                             DA VINCI
               L'ho fatto.

     Spinning back around, using the edge of his cloak, Da
     Vinci pulls out the large gleaming crystal with a pop.

     INT. DA VINCI'S WORKSHOP

     With an accompanying blast of smoke, Da Vinci bursts
     through some double doors into his workshop, sadly
     reflecting upon the crystal in one hand and the tonged
     bar in the other.

     His workshop is a spendiferously enigmatic blend of
     laboratory and studio; On a table in the foreground is
     a fresh clay equestrian statue; a large VOLUME of
     sketches, the inkwell nearby; a MODEL of what looks like
     a HELICOPTER; Da Vinci flings the tonged bar on the table
     among these goodies.

     Pocketing the crystal, Da Vinci meanders through his work-
     shop casually tinkering with various experiments.  He
     snaps his fingers at a BATHING SUITED APPRENTICE, wearing
     a diving helmet prototype.  The Apprentice jumps into a
     pool of water.

     Leonardo next stops at an easel displaying a finished-
     except-for-the-mouth portrait of Mona Lisa, who happens
     to be seated in a stool before the easel.  She broadly
     smiles, revealing the worst dental work of her epoch.
     Da Vinci shakes his head and moves out onto a

     EXT. CASTLE TERRACE

     A FLYING APPRENTICE sails past Leonardo in a bat winged
     glider, enthusiastically shouting.  Da Vinci grins back
     until he touches his pocket.  He pulls out the crystal
     and, after a beat, angrily twists it apart into two
     separate, geometric pieces revealing a small intricate
     mirror.  He quickly folds the surprisingly shapable
     geometric pieces.

     Calming down, Da Vinci looks from the three components of
     the crystal to each of the three unfinished works on the
     table in his workshop.  He ponders then looks back out to
     the Vinci vista.

     The bat winged glider DISSOLVES into:

     A HAWK

     who is revealed to be flying over Sing Sing prison.

     INT. A SING SING PRISON CELL

     The shadow of the hawk passes through a cell window, over
     the face of EDDIE HUDSON HAWKINS causing him to break out
     of an eye-closed trance.

     Before the viewer can get a good look at him, Hudson
     Hawk turns to an oddball version of the "Mona Lisa" that
     has his face and tears it off the cell back-wall.

     INT. PRISON BLOCK WALKWAY

     TWO PRISON GUARDS, One WISE and BLACK, the other YOUNG
     and GREEN march down a cell block.  The Former is smoking
     a pipe which the Young Guard lights with a lighter.

                             WISE GUARD
               We're losing our biggest celebrity
               today.

                             YOUNG GUARD
               You're kidding, Petey the Paint
               Thinner Killer is getting paroled?

                             WISE GUARD
               Not that slime, you Fizzhead.
               Hudson Hawk.  The last of the
               great cat burglars.

     INT. PRISON CELL WALL

     A hand tears down a picture of a happy Hudson Hawk and
     a LITTLE MONKEY, identically dressed in black cat
     burglar gear.

     THE BLOCK

     The Wise Guard and the Young Guard rumble forward.

                             WISE GUARD
               As a thief, Hawk was a poem.
               Iambic fucking pentameter.  You
               know, Crime used to have a little
               class.  A hundred reporters were
               here when he came in, now they're
               probably out covering some tired
               crack gang war...

     The Guards approach Hawk's cell.  Hawk, with his back
     turned, hefts on a nifty blazer.

                             HAWK
               Remind me to fire my publicist.

     The Wise Guard chuckles as the Young Guard fumbles with
     his key-ring.

                             YOUNG GUARD
               Darn, these are for L-block...

     Hawk's hand reaches through the bars and grabs a pipe
     cleaner from the Wise Guard's pocket.  Then the lighter
     from the Young Guard's pocket--BURNS OFF the fabric fuzz
     with the lighter beside it--bends the now blackened
     wire--and with a quick turn of the wrist uses it to
     UNLOCK the door.

                             YOUNG GUARD
               - go back down to security and-

     He stops, dumbfounded, as the door clunks open.  The
     Guards double-take as Hawk, finally in full view, struts
     past them, down the hall.  The Guards hustle to catch
     up.  The wise guard puts his finger in the air and
     sarcastically pretends to be stung by the heat emanating
     from Hawk.

                             WISE GUARD
               Guess this means, Hawk, you'll
               be able to let yourself back in...

                             HAWK
               Never happen.  Bet.  Ten bucks.

     Hawk and the Wise Guard hit fists, half-smiling.  Hawk
     unfolds the painting.

                             HAWK
               Oh, give this back to Petey in A
               block.  Tell him it was a sweet
               gift, but I think he got some
               wrong ideas about our friendship.

                             YOUNG GUARD
               The Paint Thinner Killer did
               this?  I think you picked a good
               day to get out...

     The trio comes to the final checkpoint.  Hawk takes a
     deep breath.

                             WISE GUARD
               Hope I lose the bet.  Have that
               cappuccino on me.

                             HAWK
                       (flipping him the
                        pipe cleaner)
               You got it.  A double.

     EXT. OUTSIDE THE PRISON--DAY

     Hawk strides to the Massive Sliding Concrete Door/Wall
     between him and freedom.  As music crescendos and
     Hawk glows his first smile, the door opens to reveal two
     Mafioso brothers, CESAR and ANTONY MARIO, the latter
     sitting upon the hood of a tinted window Lincoln
     Continental.  Cesar is of cool, hair-slicked-back
     attitude, his scumbag brother is not.

                             ANTONY
               Welcome back, buddy ol' pal.
               We've got a proposition...

                              HAWK
               Answer's no, not even if you
               bathe.  Cesar Mario, Antony Mario,
               how's the "Family?"  Kill any
               monkeys lately?

                              CESAR
               How many times do I have to say
               it?  I didn't put the hit on
               Little Eddie... Never had anything
               against that kooky chimp.  I
               actually found him, "endearing."

                             HAWK
               Sure.  Face down.  Two endearing
               shots to the back of the head.
               That's your mark, man.  What did
               Little Eddie ever do to...

     Smouldering, Hawk struts off.  Cesar takes a black
     canvas bag from a SCARFACED DRIVER and hustles up to
     Hawk.  The Lincoln rumbles behind them, Antony riding
     on the hood.

                             CESAR
               You're hitting Rutherford's
               Auction House.  Easy as my
               brother's wife.  Directions are
               in the bag.  Just open the seventh
               floor safe and take out the
               thingie...

                             HAWK
               Or you cut off my thingie.
               Directions even your brother
               would understand.
         
                             ANTONY
                       (defensively)
               Yeah, directions even I could
               understand.

     The car squeals to a stop.  Antony bounds off.  Cesar
     shove-throws the canvas bag into Hawk's unwilling
     hands.

                             CESAR
               Hawk, you're a great thief.  Got
               set up, did some time, nothing to
               be ashamed of.  Don't give me a
               sonata about you always just
               really wanted to settle down,
               open a hardware Store and sell
               spatulas...

                             HAWK
               If the Mario brothers weren't
               Jersey's third largest family,
               I'd say kiss my ass.  But
               considering your status, I'll
               say slurp my butt.

     Hawk fiercely push-shoves the canvas bag back into
     Cesar's hands.

                             CESAR
               What's your favorite sport, Hawk?

                             HAWK
               Baseball, why?

     Antony opens the back door of the Lincoln and says
     "Baseball."  He is handed a baseball bat.  Hawk backs
     up as Antony moves threateningly toward him.

                             HAWK
               I meant, ping pong.  Listen, I'd
               rather go back in than whore for
               you...
                       (stopping)
               Oh, I need to borrow ten dollars.

     A PRISON GUARD from above turns as not to be a witness.
     Hawk feebly calls up to him.

                             HAWK
               Help?  Police?

     Antony swings at Hawk, who pretends not to notice until
     the last second.  Hawk ducks and slam-kicks his calf.
     Antony crumples, using the bat as a crutch.  Hawk boots
     up the bat for a two-handed catch then savagely pivots
     it across Antony's face, knocking him into the backseat
     of the car.

                             CESAR
                       (unfazed)
               You need some time to think.
               That's cool, but next time, I'm
               not going to say "Please."

     Cesar floats into the backseat.  The Lincoln takes off.
     Hawk seethes...

                             HAWK
               I don't believe this.  I've been
               out forty seconds...

     A BACKFIRE rings out.  Hawk hits the ground, thinking
     it is a gunshot.

     HAWK'S ON THE GROUND P.O.V.

     A gasping 1960 Caddy comes to a stop and a pair of a too-
     fancy-to-be-tasteful shoes comes out.  Hawk looks up to
     see ALEX MESSINA, his older, maybe-maybe-not-wiser best
     friend.

                             ALEX
               That's the first thing I did.
               Smooch the ground and taste the
               freedom.  Sorry I was late.  Miss
               anything?

                             HAWK
                       (getting up)
               Your timing, and your shoes, are
               impeccable...  Good to see you,
               Alex, been having a lousy day.

                             ALEX
               Lousy day?  The man's getting out
               of prison and he's having a
               lousy day.  What, you missing out
               on the Cell Block Water Ballet
               pageant?  Believe me, it's
               overrated.

     Hawk pauses to say something, then just hugs Alex.

                             ALEX
               Where's the kiss?  No tongue this
               time, I promise.

     A laughing Hawk gives Alex's stomach a slap before
     getting in the car....

                             HAWK
               Looks like you've been expanding
               your...

                             ALEX
               Don't say it, Hawkins.  I'm
               incredibly sensitive about my
               fucking figure.

                             HAWK
               My next word was gonna be
               "consciousness."  Swear to God...
               tubby.

     EXT. THE ROAD INTO HOBOKEN--DAY

     The Caddy thunders past a sweet Manhattan view. "Come
     Fly With Me" is playing on the radio.  Hawk casually com-
     pletes an intimidating hand puzzle.

                             HAWK
               That's your definition of "Hard?"

                             ALEX
               Show off.  Hey, boss tune.  "Come
               Fly with Me."

                             HAWK
               Three minutes, 51 seconds.

                             ALEX
               Still do the puzzles, still know
               the running times of songs, and
               I'll bet you're still the best
               damn cat burg--

                              HAWK
               Not anymore.  Now I'm the laziest
               damn cat burg--I'm going to take
               it so straight that I won't tape
               a Mets game without the expressed
               written consent of the National
               Baseball League.

                             ALEX
               Now that you're born again,what
               do you wanna do?  Statue of
               Liberty?  Entertain some ladies?
               Miss Saigon tix?  Seduce some
               women?  Play Nintendo?  Bone some
               chicks?

                             HAWK
               Come on, Alex, let's just get to
               Alex's.  Your bar's the only
               place that's going to cheer me.
               God, I'd kill for a damn
               cappuccino.  What the hell's a
               Nintendo?

                             ALEX
               Oh man, you still got a thing for
               those unmasculine European coffees?
               Who's your buddy?

     Alex pulls a styrofoam cup from a paper bag.

                             HAWK
               The man knows, the man knows!

     Hawk takes off the cap with a stimulating whiff.

                             ALEX
               So Mr. Coffee, what went down
               outside the prison?

                             HAWK
               Oh, not much.  Mario Brothers want
               me to do a job.

     Alex brakes and cappuccino flies.  Hawk half-heartedly
     tries to lick up with his fingers.

                             ALEX
               Those dago-guinea-I can say
               this shit I'm Italian-wop
               motherfu--

                             HAWK
               Ah, had the perfect amount of
               foam.  Just get me to the bar...
               It's the one good thing in my
               life that'll never change....

     EXT. OUTSIDE ALEX'S BAR--NIGHT

     The Guys move through the personably Jersey face of the
     bar.  The Empire State Building beams in the background.
     Sinatra cuts off.

     INT. ALEX'S BAR--NIGHT

     It's changed.  Hawk and Alex enter into what has become
     the ultimate pseudo-art deco-fern littered-nightmare,
     packed with noisy, INSUFFERABLY SELF-ABSORBED YUPS.
     A violently erotic and pretentious video plays upon
     elevated T.V. sets set up all around the place.

     Hawk's mouth gapes as he drifts by a sickening COUPLE
     toasting wine coolers, and two very YOUNG BROKERS high-
     fiving each other after missing a dartboard.

                             ALEX
               I didn't know how to tell you.  A
               couple brokers stopped in for
               Stoley Spritzers one night.  Next
               thing I know Fast Track Digest
               votes us "Watering Hole of the
               Month."  Now, I'm shopping for
               Aqua Salmon wallpaper.

                             HAWK
               I read about these people in
               Newsweek.  Where's all the
               regulars, Crazy Jeff Cava, the
               Todd sisters, Indian Joe?  Where's
               Ed Kranepool's autograph?  Captain
               Bob's steering wheel?

                             ALEX
               Hey, get this irritable guy a
               cappuccino.  I gotta go be a boss.

     Alex lifts a piece of the bar and moves behind it.
     Snatching up a menu, Hawk calls out...

                             HAWK
               This is Pizza?  Reindeer Goat
               cheese?  I admit, I've been known
               to go wild and order a Canadian
               Bacon in my time, but..

     Hawk lights up a cigarette.  A TORTOISE SHELL NON-SMOKER
     immediately turns to him wearing a "Yes, I mind if you
     smoke" button.

                             TORTOISE SHELL NON-SMOKER
               Can you read.... smoker?

                             HAWK
               Can you take a sunrise and
               sprinkle it with dew?

                              TORTOISE SHELL NON-SMOKER
                       (Huh?)
               No.

                              HAWK
               The Candy Man can, Felix.  You
               know, I thought this was a country
               where you could do any stupid
               thing you wanted; drive to work
               naked, make love to a V.C.R.
               Guess I'm wrong.  Maybe that's
               why I became a serial arsonist.

                             TORTOISE SHELL NON-SMOKER
               Hey, it's okay, big guy.  Smoke
               all you want.  Have mine....

     The Non-smoker fumbles out a pack of cigarettes and
     flees.  A cappuccino in cup and saucer slides down the
     bar saloon-style.  A smiling Hawk picks it up, turns away
     from the bar and closes his eyes, bringing the cup to his
     lips until a POLICE BADGE swirls into frame and splashes
     into the cup, splattering coffee over Hawk's blazer.

                             GATES (O.S.)
               You're under arrest...

     Hawk makes eye contact up to a crude, coarse, and
     cackling island of a man, OFFICER GATES, amid the sea
     of oblivious and self-obsessed yuppitude, standing by
     a table.

                             GATES
               Have a seat.  Good to see you,
               buddy ol' pal...

                             HAWK
               The pleasure's all yours, Officer
               Gates.

     BACK OF THE BAR

     With concern, Alex watches Hawk sit at Gates' table.

     GATES' TABLE

     Gates pillages a plate of spaghetti and meatballs with
     terrifying precision.  Hawk tosses the badge onto the
     food.  Gates eats around it.

                             GATES
               Why do you show your parole
               officer such disrespect?
               Especially after I got you such
               a nice job.

                             HAWK
               What job?

     Gates pulls up the black canvas bag and puts it on the
     table.

                             GATES
               The auction house, asshole.  One
               night's work and you're free like
               no ex-con's ever been.  No
               checking in with a shrink, no
               community service teaching
               retards how to play air hockey.
               It's a great deal, I can't lie.

                             HAWK
               The only thing you can't do is
               get sex for free.  I know I was
               in prison for like basically the
               80's, but, call me daffy, aren't
               you supposed to stop me from
               committing crimes.  You know,
               Book-em-Dano, Call-for-backup,
               Give-a-Hoot-Don't-Pollute.

     Gates thunders out of his chair and moves around to sneer
     down at Hawk.  Behind Gates, on the T.V. screens, are
     analogous images of DISGUSTING ANIMALS AND MONSTERS.

                             GATES
               You wouldn't be out if it wasn't
               for me!  I did dog and pony for
               you!  You think they would have
               let you out after what you did,
               you told the board members they
               looked like the Three Stooges...

                             HAWK
               How was I supposed to know they
               were women?  Besides one of them
               was bald and kept saying
               "Soitinly."

     Gates simmers into his seat with a self-control smile.

                             GATES
               Remember that guy in the cell
               next to you who hung himself?

                             HAWK
               Yes.

                             GATES
               Remember that shoe you lost...

                             HAWK
               Uh, yeah.  Cut to the chase.

     Gates pulls up a shoe and puts it on the table.

                             GATES
               One phone call and your shoe
               will become a piece of evidence
               and that suicide'll become a
               murder.

     Hawk bobs under the table and up.

                             HAWK
               What else do you got under there
               ... I don't want to be rude, but
               this is all pretty lame.

                             GATES
               That's the beauty.  It's bullshit,
               but I can make it stick because
               I'm a good guy parole officer and
               you re a bad guy who's about to
               find out that there's a thin line
               between ex-con and escape con.

     Alex suddenly approaches the table.

                             ALEX
               How is everything tonight, sir?

                             GATES
               Beat it, Alex.  You're a dinosaur.

                             HAWK
               Alex, did you know this ape was
               going to be here...

                             ALEX
               Sure.  That's why his meatballs
               are made out of marinated Chuck
               Wagon.

                             GATES
                       (mouthful)
               You're full of shit.

     As Alex speaks, an eating dog is on the screens.

                             ALEX
               No, man, actually you are.  Just
               add water and it makes its own
               gravy.  Keeps your teeth healthy
               and your coat shiny.

     Gates grabs the shoes and races off, gagging.  Hawk gets
     up to laugh next to Alex.  Their laughter dies as they
     turn to look at the black canvas bag left on the table
     between them.

     INT. BACK ROOM--DAWN

     Hawk stares mournfully at a black and white photo of a
     monkey-sized chalk-outline on a city street.  Behind him,
     Alex pulls out blueprints from the black bag.  Sinatra's
     "Witchcraft" blares on the radio....

                             ALEX
               Hmmmm.....

                             HAWK
               Yo Pandora, quit hummm-ing... look
               at this.

     Hawk is rummaging through stockpiled remnants of an old,
     "true" bar.  Round lamps, tacky mirrors, pictures of Hawk
     and the Regs at the bar.  Managing a weary smile, Hawk
     lifts a ship steering wheel, while Alex puts on a pair of
     granny classes and pulls out blueprints.

                             HAWK
               It's Captain Bob's steering wheel!
               Remember when the Captain.....

                             ALEX
               Hmmm, nasty little safe on the 7th.

     Hawk nervously picks up a Rubik's Cube and holds it
     behind his back.  He brings it back around, completed.
     Sighing, Hawk drops the cube and rubs his scalp.  Alex
     starts rubbing his stomach.  They pace in pre-job
     syncopation and speak rapid-fire.

                             HAWK
               The safe's a Simpson 71.  Last
               time I played the game, Simpson
               only had a 40.

                             ALEX
               Just means it'll take you an extra
               31 seconds to seduce.  You re
               still the best, I know it.

                             HAWK
               But you got three guards who...
               Shit, what am I doing?  Where's
               the want ads?  Gonna sell some
               spatulas.

                             ALEX
               Hey, I'm sorry, man.  I'm putting
               out a fire with kerosene.

     Alex gives Hawk a consoling two-hand-shake then jumps
     back to reveal he has put Hawk into thumbcuffs.

                             HAWK
               This isn't funny.  I'm not into
               this.  I...

                             ALEX
               There goes five seconds...My
               record's eighteen.

                             HAWK
               You're not...LISTENING!

     Out of annoyance, Hawk breaks out of the cuffs and
     violently throws them at Alex, who sits down a little
     wounded.

                             HAWK
               I'm sorr--Goddamn Mario Brothers.
               Goddamn Gates.  Goddamn Rutherford
               Auction House.  By the way, how
               many seconds?

                             ALEX
               Rutherford Auction... that name...

     Alex jumps up excitedly and then convulses in pain.

                             HAWK
               Alex!

                             ALEX
               Don't wet your diapers.  I'll have
               to change them.  "Witchcraft."
               What's the running time?

     Alex flops down behind a work table before a wallfull of
     drawings of different kinds of vaults.  He sets himself
     up for an insulin injection.

                             HAWK
               3:48.  I can't get you involved,
               man.  This is my sewage and...
                       (re drawings)
               God, you love all this, don't you,
               you bastard.  Haven't you ever
               heard of stamp collecting, or
               curling?

     Hawk leans in and administers the shot of insulin to
     Alex.

                             ALEX
               I'm in.  Have you seen the public
               service announcements for Diabetes.
               We can ride horses, play LaCrosse,
               and knock off auction houses.  I
               got a plan.  You won't have to hail
               Cesar or Gates.

     Hawk collapses next to Alex, resigned to his fate.

                             HAWK
               I'm a bum.

     EXT. NICE, BUSINESS NEIGHBORHOOD--NIGHT

     TWO GRUBBY DERELICTS, one pushing a shopping cart, the
     other inside it, situated atop the usual two Glad bags.
     They are drunkenly warbling "Witchcraft."  IMPECCABLY
     DRESSED NIGHT-LIFERS give them a wide berth.

     Our derelicts pass beneath a MASSIVE RED CANOPY of a
     distinguished eight story edifice, upon which is written
     RUTHERFORD'S AUCTION HOUSE.  A DOORMAN shoos them away...

     A NEWSPAPER TRUCK pulls up in front of the Auction House.
     The Driver pops out with a bundle of papers and moves to
     a Dispenser on the corner.  The Bums wheel around the
     truck.  The Driver loads the papers and bounds back.

     The Truck pulls away from the corner.  The shopping cart
     rolls off--the bums nowhere to be seen.

     The Truck turns the corner, revealing the derelicts
     climbing up the back of it, with Glad bags around their
     necks.  The Truck moves toward an enclosed Walkway Bridge
     that connects the Auction House with another Building.

     Launching low-tech grapples, the Vagrants latch them-
     selves onto the Walkway window as the Truck passes
     beneath.

     AT THE WINDOW

     The viewer's viewpoint moves into a tighter view of the
     dangling derelicts, revealing them to, of course, be Hawk
     and Alex.  Getting a footing, on the small window ledge,
     each man cuts a hole in the window while holding onto a
     plunger.

                             HAWK
               Whoa, you better cut a bigger hole
               than that.

                             ALEX
               Hey, you promised......Don't worry,
               I'm wearing my girdle.

     INT. INSIDE THE WALKWAY WINDOW--NIGHT

     Hawk and Alex come through their window holes.  Hawk
     immediately flattens himself against a wall, whisper-
     ing...

                             HAWK
               Cameras?

                             ALEX
               No need.  Guards' station's right
               there.

     Alex points to an open doorway just down the hall where
     laughter and shadows emerge.  Hawk tries to flee, but a
     grinning Alex pulls him toward it.

     Hawk and Alex slide across the wall to a closed room
     marked POWER, which is right next to the open Guards'
     Station.  The viewer's viewpoint moves past Hawk and
     Alex lock-picking into the Power room to...

     INT. THE GUARDS' STATION

     Two Security Guards sit before a console of seven
     security screens still chuckling over an unheard joke.
     Wires coming out of the security console run across the
     floor and through the wall into...

     INT. THE POWER ROOM

     The wires go up to a row of seven humming, RECORD button
     flashing V.C.R.s.  Hawk and Alex stand before them,
     sharing a cig.

                             ALEX
               They record everything their
               video surveillance takes in...

                             HAWK
               Yes, master-thief, I can see that.
               You said something about a plan...

     Alex presses the REWIND buttons on the V.C.R.'s.

                             ALEX
               Am I boring you, smartass?  Watch.
               A little rewind and re-wire action
               and the Guards are going to be
               watching a rerun and miss out on
               our exciting episode.

     Alex pulls from a nearby shelf six tapes marked MONDAY.

     INT. SEVENTH FLOOR AUCTION AUDITORIUM--NIGHT

     Moving beneath a video camera and a dazzling Set of
     Hanging Horse Mobiles, a Heavyset guard, BIG STAN, moseys
     through the dimly lit main auction house auditorium.  The
     auditorium chairs are strewn out in the middle beside a
     turbo Floor Washer.

     Next to a painting of Happy Children Riding Horses at the
     back of the auditorium stage, Big Stan hefts himself upon
     a comparatively TINY BLUE CHAIR and begins to tip back
     and snooze.

     INT. GUARDS' STATION

     The Security Guards look to the seventh floor screen to
     see an unfolding shot of Big Stan mid-snooze.

                             SECURITY GUARD ONE
               Check out Big Stan...
                       (walkie-talkie)
               Big Stan!

     THE AUCTION AUDITORIUM

     Startled by his walkie-talkie, Big Stan falls back on the
     little chair, crunching it to the ground.

     THE FIRST FLOOR

     The laughing security guards see the crunch.

     INT. THE POWER ROOM

     Alex puts the last of the Monday tapes into a V.C.R.

                             ALEX
               You got about five minutes and
               change.

                             HAWK
               5:32.  "Swinging on a Star."

                             ALEX
               You know they invented something
               while you were inside.  Called a
               watch.

     A freight elevator pings.  Hawk opens it up as the music
     of "Swinging on the Star" kicks in on the soundtrack.

                             HAWK
               "A mule is an animal with long
               funny ears."

                             ALEX
               "He kicks up at anything he
               hears.

     Hawk crams himself into the freight elevator with his
     Glad bag.  Strenuously upbeat Ray Conniffesque singers
     continue to sing the song, orchestrally accompanied, when
     Hawk isn't.

     INT. THE FREIGHT ELEVATOR

     Hawk takes over the song, sardined in the elevator.

                             HAWK
               "Or would you rather swing on a
               star, carry moonbeams home in a
               jar."

     POWER ROOM

     Alex goes up to a Circuit Box and pulls down two large
     Switches.  The soundtrack singers continue to warble.

     THE GUARDS' STATION

     The lights of the floor wobble and die.  The console
     screens blink off.  The Security Guards stop laughing.

                             SECURITY GUARD TWO
               Hell-o.  Check the Power room,
               bud...

     Security Guard One harrumphs into a standing position...

     POWER ROOM

     Alex speedily hooks and rehooks the backs of the V.C.R.S.
     They now all have their PLAY buttons lit up.

                             ALEX
               swing on a star, carry moonbeams...

     OUTSIDE THE POWER ROOM

     Security Guard One fishes for keys to open the power
     room.  The soundtrack singers whisper as not to give away
     Alex.

     INSIDE THE POWER ROOM

     Alex briskly slams back up the switches.

     OUTSIDE THE POWER ROOM

     The singers go louder as the lights come back on.
     Security Guard One harrumphs and heads back to the
     Guards' Station.

     THE AUCTION AUDITORIUM

     Hawk scrambles out of the freight elevator in the left
     wall of the Auditorium, glancing to the clock.

                             HAWK
               "Or would you rather be a fish?"

     He pulls out the black canvas bag from his Glad bag and
     takes out the blueprints.  Hawk follows them toward the
     painting on-stage.

     THE GUARDS' STATION

     Big Stan comes up from behind his fellow guards, dumping
     the remains of the chair on the floor.

                             BIG STAN
                       (moving back off)
               Very funny.

     The Seventh Floor Screen shows a peaceful auction
     auditorium.  And the Blue Chair.

     THE AUCTION AUDITORIUM--CAMERA P.O.V.

     From the exact angle, the viewer sees the current state
     of the room with Hawk flinging off the painting of the
     horseback children, revealing a safe.  But no Blue chair.

     HAWK

     spits on the rubber cup of an electronic sensor, plugged
     into a Walkman, and affixes it to the safe above the
     dial.

                             HAWK
                       (lyric trouble)
               "A fish is annuh nan na nan na
               brook.

     THE FREIGHT ELEVATOR

     Alex is now packed into the freight elevator.

                             ALEX
               "He can't write his name or read
               a book.  To fool people is his
               only thought."

     THE AUCTION AUDITORIUM

                             HAWK
                       (remembering)
               "And though he's slippery, he
               still gets caught."

     Wearing headphones, Hawk cranks up the Walkman and spins
     the dial.  The CLICKS from the dial are so loud he winces
     and turns down the volume.  Then there's a CLUNK.

     THE GUARDS' STATION

     With the soundtrack singers taking over, Guard Two sips
     a cup of coffee.  He doesn't swallow.

     His sights zero in on the Blue Chair on the seventh
     screen.  He looks to the chair remains, then back again.

                             SECURITY GUARD TWO
               Uh, Jerry.  I'm looking at the
               seventh floor and I don't know
               how to say this, I see the Blue
               Chair.

                             SECURITY GUARD ONE
               What the... You think that's weird,
               check out screen two.....

     Screen Two shows THE TWO SECURITY GUARDS THEMSELVES
     hatching open some on-duty beers, going down a hall.
     Guard Two looks to the empties atop the console....

                             SECURITY GUARD TWO
               Somebody rewired the recorders!

     AUCTION AUDITORIUM

     Hawk ditches his accessories and swings the safe door
     open.

     Inside the safe, along with the "holy" Da Vinci music
     cue, is the clay equestrian model from Leonardo's
     worktable.

     Hawk belts out as he put it in the black canvas bag.

                             HAWK
               "And all the monkeys aren't in
               the zoo."

                             ALEX (V.O.)
               "Every day you meet quite a few."

     Alex gives Hawk a congratulatory pat.

                             HAWK AND ALEX
               "So you see it's all up to you.
               You can be better than you are.
               You could be swinging on a star."

     THE AUCTION ROOM

     BIG STAN reconnects the wires of the seventh V.C.R.

     THE GUARDS' STATION

     Suddenly, on the seventh screen, the image and voices
     of Hawk and Alex in-process comes on.

                             SECURITY GUARD ONE
               Shit, let's roll!

     THE AUCTION AUDITORIUM

     Hawk puts the painting back up, but stops to stare at the
     playful children.

                             ALEX
               The song's over!  Come on!
               "You could be swinging on a star."

                             HAWK
               What am I doing here?  There are
               so many things I wanna do that
               aren't this.  Paint a lighthouse.
               Kiss a woman in Italy.

                             ALEX
                       (more frantically)
               "You could be swinging on a star."

                             HAWK
               Paint a woman in a lighthou--I
               don't want to steal a horse.
               Life is...

     Hawk's soliloquy is cut short as Security Guards One and
     Two crash into the auction auditorium.

                             ALEX
                       (DEADPAN)
               "You could be swinging on a star."
               You couldn't have waited to see
               a psychiatrist.  No, you had...

     Alex whips his chair at the floor washer, tipping it
     forward and causing its electrical cord to pull up and
     trip the Guards into a bellyflop.

     Hawk bolts right at the bustling up guards and locks them
     into Alex's thumbcuffs.  He then limbos under their
     connected arms and springs over the outstretched washer
     cord.  The Security Guards clumsily turn and re-trip
     themselves.

                             HAWK
               Let's go down the freight elevator.

     Big Stan suddenly unhatches from the freight elevator.

                             ALEX
               Keep those ideas coming.

     Hawk and Alex run toward an office located at the right
     wall.  They both do a Gene-Kellyesque-chair-tip-over
     before simultaneously bashing through the office door.

     INT. DARKENED AUCTION AUDITORIUM OFFICE

     Hawk and Alex stop in the office to painfully laugh and
     rub their funny bones.  Alex stops laughing.

                             ALEX
               I'm not as unpleasantly plump as
               that Guard am I.

     Big Stan fires off a warning shot.  Hawk and Alex quickly
     tear up a window.

     Moving out on to a ledge, Hawk and Alex look down to the
     huge auction house awning and trade gulps.

     Big Stan wobbles into the mouth of the office door.

                             HAWK AND ALEX
               I got a bad feeling....

                             HAWK
               I can't even swim.

                             ALEX
               Hell, the fall'll probably kill
               ya...

     Big Stan raises his gun.

     Hawk and Alex jump and AAAGH down the face of the
     building....

     Closer and closer to the awning....

     The viewer focuses upon Hawk as he free-falls......

                                                CUT TO:

     RIGHT INTO A LAZ-Y-BOY CHAIR

     Hawk continues his "fall" into a ridiculously huge
     reclining chair.  The foot stand swooshes out with a
     thump.  A HAND pulls away the canvas bag with a cackle.

     INT. GATES APARTMENT--LATE NIGHT

     Hawk's weirdly reclining viewpoint makes Gates and his
     pad more grotesque than they are (No small feat.)
     A sub-Radio Shack stereo coughs next to a scary punch
     bowl of red, margarita-like substance, beneath the
     instantly recognizable framed picture of Those Dogs
     Playing Poker, all atop a Jungle Shag.

     Gates, in shorts and a Hawaiian shirt-over-a-KEEP ON
     TRUCKIN'-T-shirt, raises a loud tumbler with one hand,
     the black canvas bag in the other.

                             GATES
               Hudson Hawkins gets the chair of
               honor.  How about a Gates-arita?
                       (toward bowl)
               I used real hot dogs.

                             HAWK
               Weren't you the bartender at
               Jonestown?

     Suddenly a light is turned on in the corner, revealing a
     seated Cesar and Antony Mario, the latter taking a painful
     Gatesirita sip.

                             CESAR
               Good job, not pretty, but good.

                             HAWK
               Ah, the mafia, the cops; do I know
               how to party or what?

     Gates pulls out the horse and looks at it.

                             GATES
               All this trouble for a horsey.
               I may not know art, but I know
               what I like.

                             HAWK
                       (to Dog picture)
               You certainly do.

                             GATES
               So when's that Sebastian-Cabot-
               Buckingham-Palace-looking-
               Butlerhead getting here?

                             ALFRED
               Any minute now, dear Mr. Gates.

     A malevolently snobbish British Butler, ALFRED, enters in
     distaste.  He makes a stressful glance to three VANITY
     FAIRS on a coffeetable that has a photo of a MAGNETIC
     HUSBAND-WIFE-DOG COMBO with the caption: MAYFLOWER POWER.
     Hawk notices this.

                             GATES
               Oh, sorry Jeeves.  Gates-arita?

                             ALFRED
               I'll pass.  May I?

     Alfred takes the equestrian model and with a jeweler's
     loupe, studies it carefully.

                             ALFRED
               Ah, such craftsmanship.  Leonardo
               Da Vinci's last commission for the
               Duke of Milan.  Irreplaceable.

                             GATES
               Hey, Mr. French, I'm delirious
               for you.  Now where's my cut?

     With dignity, Alfred SMASHES the ancient horse over
     Gates's head.  Alfred rummages through the debris
     REVEALING a perversely labyrinthine CRYSTAL PIECE.
     (recognizable from Da Vinci's workshop).

                             GATES
               You son-of-a......I don't believe
               this!  You come into my house!

     Alfred pockets the goodies, but not before Hawk can give
     them a confused peruse.

                             GATES
               I ought to take Big Ben and shove
               it up your limey blimey bunghole!

     A blade slides down Alfred's arm.  Half-yawning, he...

     ALFRED'S 180 DEGREE POV

     spins before Gates and the bystanders behind him.
     THE BLADE goes back up Alfred's arm.

     The room's only sound is the stereo's inappropriate
     music.  Gates shrugs but his voice is off.

                             GATES
               Like I said.  Where's my cu-u-...

     Suddenly a line across Gates's neck turns red and blood
     begins to gush like a tourist attraction.  Gates crashes
     down upon the table holding the punch bowl and the stereo,
     sending it to the ground, cutting off the music.  The Dog
     Poker picture falls atop the carnage like a lid.

     Blown away, Hawk tries to wiggle his way out of the
     recliner.  Alfred pats some stain remover on the blood
     on his shirt.

                             ALFRED
               So much for his "cut."
                       (post-chortle)
               Excuse my dry British humor.

                             CESAR
                       (rising)
               Lovely work, Alfred, taking the
               Concorde back?

                             ALFRED
               Indeed I am, Mr. Mario.  I'm
               really racking up those frequent
               flyer points...

                             HAWK
               I hate to interrrupt you two
               lovebirds...

                             ANTONY
               You know, I think Gates promised
               Hawk a cut, too....

     The Mario brothers cackle out.  Hawk tries to flail out
     of his chair.  Alfred turns to him and flicks up his arm.
     Hawk sees his life pass before his eyes until he realizes
     Alfred is merely pulling him up off the chair.

                             ALFRED
               Ta ta, Hudson Hawk.

                             HAWK
                       (breathless)
               Too-do-loo, babe.

     INT. ALEX'S RESTAURANT--DAWN

     Hawk bursts into the bar.  Alex sits on a stool, reading
     the paper.

                             ALEX
               Did I miss anything?

                             HAWK
               Oh, not much.  Gates just had his
               tonsils taken out.  The hard way.
         
                             ALEX
               Geez, Gates was killed.  Who do we
               send the thank you note to?
         
     Hawk does a combat jump over the bar and begins to fiddle
     with the cappuccino machine.

                             HAWK
               The Butler did it.  Guy was a cross
               between Alistair Cook and a Cuisinart.
               Dude took Mr. Ed and humptied
               dumptied it over Gates's head.  He
               said it was made by, get this,
               Leonardo..

                             ALEX
                       (professorial)
               Ah yes, a rare Renaissance piece.
               Da Vinci's "Sforza," an equestrian
               model of a never executed statue.
               I consider it to be the prize of
               tonight's auction of objets
               d'equestrian.  Horse things.

     The cappuccino machine sparks.  A perplexed Hawk takes
     a couple extra seconds to back off.

                             HAWK
               Okay, you got me, Mr. PBS.

                             ALEX
                       (holding up newspaper)
               Morning edition.  Seems two thieves
               "attempted" to steal it last night,
               but thanks to three "courageous"
               guards, it will be ready for tonight.

                             HAWK
               "Attempted."  At-tempt-ted!  I'm
               not happy about having to steal
               that horse, but I do have my
               pride.  Face it, when it comes to
               burglary, and sex, I....

     Hawk takes the newspaper.  There is a picture of the
     Three Security Guards in a cheery pose behind the
     "Sforza."  Hawk squints to see that Security Guards One
     and Two are still wearing the thumbcuffs.

                             HAWK
               Boing.  Uh, this I don t understand...

                             ALEX
               Why try?

                             HAWK
                       (hurdling the bar)
               Because I'm tired of not
               understanding things.  Cops,
               Mafia, and butlers forcing me to
               bust my ass to steal something,
               which it turns out I really didn't
               steal--it's fucked up.

                             ALEX
                       (pulling back newspaper)
               You re not thinking of going to...

                             HAWK
               Alex, my man, it's time to play a
               little offense.  Where's your tux?

     INT. RUTHERFORD'S AUCTION HOUSE--NIGHT

     Dressed in a not-quite-fitting but suave tuxedo, Hawk
     enters the now well-lit auction house auditorium (chairs
     all set out).  Bored WORKMEN in coveralls lug equestrian
     items on to a podium from the familiar freight elevator.

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
               ...fan-taas-tic example of
               Florentine marble... Who will start
               at 160,000...160,000......180,000.

     Someone raises their paddle as Hawk passes beneath the
     hanging horses and finds an aisle seat near the stage.
     Hawk scans everyone in the room before coming to the one
     seated next to him, AN ENCHANTINGLY BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.

                             HAWK
               All these years of attending auctions,
               I still get goosebumps.  The paintings,
               the sculptures....the things that
               aren't really paintings or sculptures...

                             THE WOMAN
               .... the pretentious vultures who
               don't even look up from their
               calculators to see what they're
               buying.  Now that gives me
               goosebumps.  Auctions are
               disgusting.

                             HAWK
               I couldn't agree more.  Savages.

     The Woman laughs at his gear switch then catches herself.

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
               Lot Fifteen, an equestrian sconce
               attributed to the Cellini school..

     AUCTION ENTRANCE

     Big Stan, the hefty guard from the heist, enters the area
     wearing a blue ribbon.

     AUCTION AREA

     Big Stan is walking in back of the seated bidders:  An
     oblivious Hawk in the foreground starts to scan VARIED
     BIDDER-TYPES, raising their paddles to babble out dollar
     figures; a GAUDY ROCK STAR and his GLOOMY-CHIC ENTOURAGE,
     A KING FAROUK-TYPE with a BORED TEENAGE AMERICAN HOOKER,
     and a scary NORDIC PRINCESS in a monocle and a tiara.

     THREE STANDING ASSISTANTS frantically man a table of
     phones set up down before the stage.  One raises his
     arm.

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
               Sold!  To the caller from
               Newfoundland.

     A STYLISH FEMALE ASSISTANT takes out an impressive replica
     of the "Sforza" from the safe behind the podium and brings
     it to the Auctioneer.  The crowd a-a-hs... Hawk laughs
     and shakes his head.

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUTIONEER
               And finally, Lot number 17,
               thought to be lost in the war,
               and again last night, the Da
               Vinci "Sforza," the jewel of the
               sale.  Fan-taas-tic...

                             HAWK
                       (re: Auctioneer)
               Is looking like a constipated
               warthog a prerequisite to getting
               a job in the art world?

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
               There have naturally been questions
               of its authenticity, so to verify
               we have Doctor Anna Baragli of the
               Vatican.  Doc?

                             ANNA
                       (rising, to Hawk)
               Some of us warthogs are more
               constipated than others.

     Hawk uneasily laughs as Anna makes her way up the stage
     and pulls out a large magnifying glass.  A look of
     distress passes over her face.  Hawk closes his eyes in
     anticipation.

                             HAWK
               Oh, the shit is going to hit the
               fa--

                             ANNA
                       (suddenly serene)
               Fantastic.  Perfection.  The
               Vatican extends its jealousy to
               the lucky bidder.

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
               We'll begin the bidding at 82.5
               million dollars.  To you, sir.
               Eighty-three, Ninety--your bid,
               madame--Ninety point five.....

     Hawk opens his eyes in confusion.  He scans Anna coming
     off the stage, gliding toward the phone table.  Hawk
     floats into the aisle, curling toward her as she picks
     up a phone and murmurs into it.

                             DARWIN MAYFLOWER
               lOO million clams, Francesco!

     The crowd orgasms as Vanity Fair cover boy, DARWIN
     MAYFLOWER works the aisle, playfully mussing up the
     appreciative, tiaraed Princess's hair, giddily high-
     fiving the Rock Star, and sloppily frenching the Hooker.

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
               100 million dollars to Mr. Darwin
               Mayflower.

     Hawk turns to gaze at the enigmatically familiar figure.
     Anna looks up from the phone to do the same.  She
     swerves her attention to the back-turned Hawk.

     Darwin moves to one of two reserved empty seats as his
     wife, Minerva, makes her entrance par excellahnce.  She is
     outrageously dressed with a mammoth Tiffany watch that
     extends from her wrist down to, acting as a leash,
     her obnoxious little dog, BUNNY.

                             MINERVA
               Francesco, 100 million and one.

     Darwin, to the crowd's delight, holds his struck heart.

                             DARWIN
               Outbid by my own wench, quelle
               bummere.

                             MINERVA
               Poor baby..... Here, Bunny.

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
               Fan-taas-tic, the bid is at 100
               million and one dollars.

     Commencing a slow motion sequence, Big Stan comes out
     of the nearby office, zipping up his fly.  He immedi-
     ately scopes Hawk in the space before the stage.

     The Mayflowers lower themselves into their seats with
     devoured canary smiles.

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
               Go-ing!

     Big Stan pulls out his gun, untheatrically, as not to
     cause a scene.  Anna sees this and follows Big Stan's
     eyeline to Hawk.

     Hawk turns to re-pursue but stops dead at the sight of
     the gloating Big Stan.

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
               Go-ing!

     Big Stan launches a gallop toward Hawk, who spins and
     veers back round up the aisle.

     The Mayflowers zero their sights on the activity.

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
               Gone!

     The gavel comes down in super slow-motion.

     Anna's leg pokes out of the aisle, tripping the guard.

     Hawk brakes at the end of the Mayflower's row and smiles
     in relief, casually turning to Darwin and Minerva.

     The gavel continues to come down in super slow-motion.

     Both Darwin and Minerva Mayflower suddenly DUCK DOWN.

     Smile vanishing, Hawk spins toward the stage.

     The Gavel hits.

     Breaking out of slow-motion into wide-angle, the entire
     podium explodes sending debris, equestrian pieces, and
     eccentric bald pieces searing into the screaming,
     battered crowd.

     Knocked off his feet, Hawk gropes into a standing
     position.  He sees the Mayflowers make a smooth exit.
     He starts to give chase until he sees a battered Anna
     rising from the ground.

     A hanging white Tri-Star Pegasus, cracks from the
     damaged ceiling and swooshes down towards Anna.

     Hawk bolts upon some auction chairs and makes a flying
     leap.  He slams Anna out of the Pegasus's pulverizing
     Path.  They weary up off the ground and move down the
     aisle, calm in a storm of packed art patrons.

                             ANNA
               My God, that was bold of you,
               you didn't have to do that...

                             HAWK
               Forget about it--it was nothing--
               anybody would have done the same
               thing--It's an impulse...

                             ANNA
               No, I meant you didn't have to
               tackle me and rip my dress.  A
               polite push, perhaps?  A clear
               shout of "watch out, Anna"
               would have done nicely...

                             HAWK
               Excuse me, Milady.  I would have
               flown over and carried you up to
               a pink cloud, but I left my cape
               at the cleaners.

     Anna touches Hawk's lips and laughs.

                             ANNA
                       ("Hey, I was kidding")
               Thanks tough guy, thanks a lot.
               Why was the guard chasing you?

                             HAWK
                       (Serious answer?
                        Na-a-h?)
               Because Danger, Doc, is my middle...

     Before Hawk can finish, a hanging horse out of nowhere
     hammers him into the ground and the viewer into
     darkness.

     FADE IN:

     INT. VAN-TYPE AMBULANCE--NIGHT

     Hawk stirs into consciousness strapped on an elevated
     gurney.

                             HAWK
               Saint Pete, hey I know, the whole
               cat burglar thing, it sounds bad,
               but I'll take the worst cloud you
               got...

     Hawk's eyes focus.  The Mario Brothers hover over him.

                             CESAR
               News flash.  You're not in
               heaven.  Yet.  30 seconds and
               counting, if you know what I'm
               saying.  Couldn't just play along,
               could you...

     EXT. THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE--NIGHT

     The ambulance careens onto the Brooklyn Bridge.

     INT. INSIDE THE AMBULANCE

     Antony raises up a mammoth gun.

                             HAWK
               Pretty class way of covering your
               tracks.  I think that auctioneer
               landed at La Guardia.

                             ANTONY
               Subtlety was never one of our
               strong points.

                             HAWK
               Neither's flossing.

     A confused Antony touches his teeth with his gun hand.
     Hawk escapes from one of his straps and launces a nearby
     trayful of syringes into Antony's face where they ghoul-
     ishly quiver.  Antony fires a wild shot, shattering the
     partition.

     FRONT SEAT OF THE AMBULANCE

     The Scarfaced Bodyguard/Driver, now in paramedic white,
     freaks at the starred windshield.

     THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE

     The ambulance bumper-pools off some innocent cars.

     INSIDE THE AMBULANCE

     Hawk frantically tries to undo his other strap but a
     howling Cesar, side-stepping his vibrating-on-the-floor
     brother, latches onto the back of the gurney and wrenches
     it backward.

     OUTSIDE BACK OF AMBULANCE

     The elevated gurney blasts out the back with a now
     unstrapped but terrified Hawk whoa-a-ing atop it.

     The gurney wheels hit the road, sparking.

     A sheet from the gurney, caught on the door, yanks TAUGHT
     --Hawk is "water skiing" on his stomach atop the elevated
     gurney!

     Screeching cars are weirded out by the new vehicle on the
     road.

     THE GURNEY

     Battered by wind and fear, Hawk clutches to the gurney
     and the sheet with a grit teeth stoneface.

     The sheet is torn from the gurney sending it rocketing
     off to the side on its own crazed volition.

     Hawk skis toward a TOLL BOOTH WITH A LARGE GATE-ARM.

                             HAWK
               Life don't get much better than
               this.

     He then sees he's heading toward an EXACT CHANGE lane.

     Whizzing wildly forward on the gurney, Hawk scrambles
     into his pocket and wiggles out some change.  He fran-
     tically winnows out some pennies and then maniacally
     FLINGS the change from twenty feet away.

     TOLL BOOTH

     The change ker-chunks into the basket and Hawk and the
     gurney JUST BARELY streak underneath the rising Gate-arm.

     EXT. THE AMBULANCE

     CRASHES through a gate-arm of another lane.  Hawk and the
     still-wildly whooshing gurney cut it off.

     FRONT SEAT OF THE AMBULANCE

     Cesar pops his head through the partition.

                             CESAR
               Make him into Roadkill!

     Antony, seemingly oblivious to the syringes porcupined in
     his skull, pokes his head next to Cesar's.

                             ANTONY
               Yeah, run him down!

     Cesar and the Bodyguard/Driver turn to Antony and scream,
     then all three look out the windshield and scream.

     THE AMBULANCE

     jackknifes over a stopped car and somersaults into a
     fiery ball.

     In the foreground, Hawk's gurney coasts down

     A PEACEFUL OFF-ROAD

     Hawk, with an unchanged expression of pure white knuckle
     fear, comes to a tranquil gurney-wheels-gently-squeaking
     stop.

     Lit by the flames of the ambulance crash, a sneering
     young man in wire rim glasses emerges from the darkness,
     carrying a steel suitcase.  He kneels before Hawk and
     opens the suitcase revealing a complex computer appara-
     tus.  He begins mumbling into a cellular phone.

     A malevolent, SILENT DEADPAN WRAITH passes him and
     approaches Hawk.  Both men are dressed in outfits that
     seem to be a melange of fascist uniform and haute
     couture.

     On the fingers of one Wraith hand is carved the word
     HATE.  On the other hand is the word FROG.  The Frog Hand
     hands a befuddled Hawk a card.  It reads: MY NAME IS KIT
     KAT AND THIS IS NOT A DREAM.

     Hawk looks up with a "huh" expression as Kit Kat chops
     his neck, knocking him off the gurney.

     The sneering computer guy hangs up his phone and pulls
     forward a small cattle prod from his apparatus.

                             HAWK
               This is the worst night...

                             SNICKERS
               When it rains, it pours.  Name's
               Snickers.  The plane leaves in 40.

     Snickers zaps Hawk in the leg with his device.  Hawk a-
     a-ghs into a kneeling position.  Snickers returns to his
     suitcase and is passed by a PLEASANT YOUNG BLACK WOMAN in
     the "outfit."

                             ALMOND JOY
               Almond Joy.  I know, pretty silly.
               But it's better than when we first
               started out, our code names were
               Diseases.  You don't know what
               it's like being called Clymidia
               for a year.
                       (walking off)
               Whoops, forgot....

     She deftly kicks Hawk across the face.  Hawk angrily
     bounds back up until he sees the BIGGEST MEMBER OF THE
     GROUP Fe-Fi-Fo-Fum his way toward them.  Suddenly, the
     Giant clumsily trips over Snickers' suitcase apparatus
     and ram-collapses into Hawk and the gurney.  Laying atop
     Hawk, Butterfinger goofily speaks...

                             BUTTERFINGER
               My name's Butterfinger.

                             HAWK
               No shit.

     The mysterious group parts to reveal a much more mature
     and cynically subdued man dressed in big lapels and a hat
     that screams Old Time CIA.  His name will be GEORGE
     KAPLAN.

                             KAPLAN
               Don't you just hate kids...

                             ALMOND JOY
               George, you promised.  No Old CIA/
               New CIA jokes...

                             KAPLAN
               I call them the MTV.I.A.  Punks
               think Bay of Pigs is an herbal tea.
               They think the Cold War involves
               penguins and...

                             HAWK
               Don't I know you...

                             KAPLAN
               You just might.  I'm the guy who
               tricked you into robbing a
               government installation and then
               had you sent to prison for it.  At
               the time, I was bald with a beard,
               no moustache, and I had a different
               nose, so if you don't recognize me,
               I won't be offended.

                             HAWK
               Bastard, you're going to need
               another nose!

     Hawk explodes upward.  Everyone but cool Kaplan draws a
     gun.

                             HAWK
               But I'm not the type of guy to
               hold a grudge.

                             KAPLAN
               I used you as a diversion.  while
               you were getting captured upstairs,
               I was shredding documents in the
               basement.  Deep down, I guess I
               was just jealous.  You were one
               incredible thief...

                             HAWK
               To what do I owe the dishonor of a
               reunion, you centrally intelligent
               scumsicle.

     As Kaplan converses, Snickers and Butterfinger bring out
     a mammoth empty suitcase and open it behind Hawk.

                             KAPLAN
               I Want to make things up to you.
               That's why I got you this gig,
               doll.  Hawk, my name's George
               Kaplan and to quote the late,
               great Karen Carpenter, "We've only
               just begun."

                             HAWK
               Three minutes, twenty-three
               seconds.  If you think I'm doing
               another...

                             KAPLAN
               Hush.  My employer wants a meeting.

                             HAWK
               Employer?  The president?

                             KAPLAN
               No, somebody powerful.  Oh.  Look.
               what's that up there?

                             HAWK
               I'm supposed to fall for that?

                             KAPLAN
               Shucks.  Guess not.

     Kaplan savagely point-blank punches Hawk in the face,
     knocking him out cold and into the mammoth suitcase.
     Snickers slams it shut revealing a KENNEDY INTERNATIONAL
     sticker.

     INT. MYSTERIOUS BARE ROOM--DAY

     Hawk slowly awakens on an exotic couch.  He has been put
     in an aggressively fashionable Italian outfit.  He eyes
     and touches his new duds with complete bafflement.  He
     then stumbles into a standing position to, mouth gaping,
     take in a wondrous 360 degree view of Rome, Italy as "O
     Solo Mio" blares on the soundtrack.

                             HAWK
               No.  Way.

     Hawk's spinning view and the music on the soundtrack slam
     to a halt as he zeroes in on the sight of Scary Butler
     Alfred elegantly reaching the top of the staircase.

                             ALFRED
               Welcome to Rome, sir.

                             HAWK
               Yes way.

     EXT. OUTSIDE INTERESTING BUILDING--DAY

     Alfred opens the back door of an omnipotent, Mayflower-
     logoed LIMOUSINE.  The car moves off as Hawk slides in...

     INT. THE BACK SEAT OF THE MAX-TECH LIMOUSINE

     facing Darwin Mayflower who is blustering into the
     cellular.

     While he talks, Darwin shakes Hawk's bewildered hand,
     then holding up one finger in a "be with you in a sec"
     facial move.

                             DARWIN
               For those kind of wages, I could
               have built the factory in America!
               They're Vietnamese, can't we just
               give them more Bart Simpson shirts?
               I hear depressing news like this
               and I want to commit genocide!
                       (slamming phone)
               Alfred, hold my calls.  So, Hawk!
               The Hawkster!  What do you think
               of the vehicle?

                             HAWK
               You could host American Bandstand
               in here.  Why did you duck at the
               auction, asshole?

                             DARWIN
               Because I didn't want to get hurt,
               taterhead.

     A FAX MACHINE comes to life as Darwin babbles.

                             DARWIN
               What can I tell you, I'm the
               villain.  Initially it was a
               priority to keep a lot of buffers
               between you and me, but since most
               of them are dead now, I thought
               what the heck.  Hawk, you come
               highly recommended.  I would have
               done some things differently at
               the auction house, but hey, I want
               to be in business with you.

     Darwin scans the Fax message with annoyance, and then
     shoves it into a violent paper shredder.

     OUTSIDE THE LIMO SHREDDER

     Shredded paper litters out of a vent on the outside door.

     INSIDE THE LIMOUSINE

     A simmering Hawk tries to explode but the phone rings.

                             HAWK
               My life is not some deal.  I...

                             ALFRED (O.S.)
               It's Boston, Mr. Mayflower.

                             DARWIN
               I'm sorry, I have to take this.
               Those are valid points though...

     Darwin picks up the phone and goes Mr. Hyde, while giving
     Hawk "Can you believe this guy"-type gestures.

                             DARWIN
               You better have a good excuse...
               You better have a better excuse!
               You are so weak!  I'm only
               thankful your ancestors didn't
               settle America or else my name
               would be Running Brave or Vomiting
               Antelope...Really.  Well, listen
               close, babe.

     Darwin holds the phone over a 50 cent piece-size siren in
     his armrest.  Darwin presses a button and a PIERCING
     NOISE fills the car as it comes to a stop.

                             DARWIN
               Shall we?

     Darwin bolts out.  Hawk hangs back, waiting for Rod
     Serling to explain things, then bolts out too.

     EXT. E.U.R. DISTRICT BUILDING--DAY

     Hawk and Darwin head up the steps of an overpowering
     fascistly marble superstructure.  Alfred brings up the
     rear.

                             DARWIN
               So Hawkasaurus, I won't mince
               words...

                             HAWK
               Whatever.  You own Boardwalk, you
               own Park Place, you own the four
               railroads.  You think you're God.
               For all I know, you're probably
               right.  I just wanted to have a
               damn cappuccino, maybe play some
               Nintendo after I find out what it
               is.  Man, why didn't you just buy
               the horse?  What am I saying, you
               did buy it...

                             DARWIN
               Oh... Let's see.  There are
               organizations that think we wanted
               the "Sforza" for reasons other
               than putting it in the Da Vinci
               museum we're building in Vinci.
               Hopefully, these organizations
               think our plan has been ruined
               with the explosion of our replica.
               If I seem vague, grand.  We want a
               low profile on this, that's why I
               got Kaplan and the Candy bars
               involved.  I helped George help
               the Mario Brothers and Gates help
               get you out....

                             HAWK
               If you're pausing for a "thank you,"
               give it up.  So boss, you going to
               tell me what the crystal piece
               inside the pony means?

                             DARWIN
               Way to go, Alfie!  How many people
               did you break that thing in front
               of.   Good help's hard to find.

                             HAWK
               I guess that's a no.

     INT. MASSIVE CONFERENCE ROOM--DAY

     A mind-blowingly pretentious painting of Darwin, Minerva,
     and Bunny hangs above a mammoth M-shaped conference table.

     Lying atop the table in heels, shades, and a heart-
     stopping dark outfit is Minerva.  NASTY Metal riffs semi-
     audibly spew from a headset she wears.

     Surrounding the table is a VARIED GROUP OF OLD MONEY AND
     NEW MONEY BOARD MEMBERS ranging from a nine year old
     INDIAN PRINCE to a SWEET ELDERLY AMERICAN WOMAN.  They
     converse to the person at their side in businesslike
     tones, oblivious to Minerva.

                             DARWIN
               Ladies and gentlemen of the board...

     The board members go into tableau silence.  Minerva con-
     tinues a brief sing-a-long before Darwin scolds...

                             DARWIN
               And Min-er-va.  Let's give it up
               for Hudson Hawk.

     The board applauds as Alfred pushes Hawk inside.

                             MINERVA
               Hello......Bunny, Ball-Ball!

     Minerva lobs a ball in the air.  Bunny, the annoying dog,
     scurries beside Hawk to catch it.

     Moving down toward the other end of the table, Hawk takes
     in the surreal surroundings with battle fatigue.  He sees
     ONE BOARD MEMBER take a luxurious sip of cappuccino.
     Minerva paces up upon the table.

                             DARWIN
               Hawkmeister, we got you clothes,
               great hotel, and a 250,000 lira
               per diem.

                             MINERVA
               That's two hundred dollars a day?
               So he can get a hooker and some
               tequila.  Veto, Darwin.

                             HAWK
               Guess I know who wears the penis
               in this family.

                             MINERVA
                       (jumping off table)
               For God's sake, chain this
               convict.

     With a yawn, Alfred pulls out a pair of state-of-the-art
     handcuffs.

                             HAWK
               Alfred, you're a very polite
               psychopath, but if you...

     Hawk kicks out at Alfred, who nimbly moves slightly and
     gives a pummel to Hawk's body somersaulting him over the
     edge of the table, into an empty seat.

     The Board Members politely applaud.  Alfred pulls Hawk's
     hands around his back and cuffs him.  Bunny intensely
     sniffs his crotch.

                             MINERVA
               We want Da Vinci's sketchbook,
               what do they call it, the Codex.

                             DARWIN
               Listen Hawk, this might be hard to
               believe, but I'm a regular joe.  I
               just want to be happy and happiness
               comes from the achieving of goals.
               It's just when you make your first
               billion by the age of 19, it's
               hard to keep coming up with new
               ones.  But now finally I got my
               new goal.  World domination.  With
               your help...Bunny....quit that!

                             MINERVA
               Bunny, ball-ball!  Bad bunny!

                             HAWK
               Think he's already got today's
               ball-balls.  Five more minutes
               please, it's been so long...

     Minerva yanks away the yelping dog.

                             HAWK
               Anybody have a cigarette?  But
               seriously, do me a favor and
               Concorde me back to prison.  I
               don't care anymore.  I hope you
               have the receipts for the threads.

                             MINERVA
               You go back, you won't be alone.
               You'll have a diabetic barkeep
               cellmate.  You're still young
               enough to have fun shanking child
               molesters for a pack of smokes,
               but "Alex" will go in knowing that
               the next time he gets out it'll be
               to attend his own funeral.
               Depressing.

                             HAWK
               You wouldn't risk the dime to call
               the police.  You have no proof.

                             DARWIN
               Ah, the magic word...

     Alfred plants a slide machine on the table and Darwin
     starts clicking gorgeous images of Hawk and Alex robbing
     the auction house, on a bare wall.

     The Board members gush.  The Elderly Woman gives a
     thumbs-up.

                             DARWIN
               It's veja du, Hawkhead.  Something
               you wish never happened.  We shot
               the entire operation with hidden
               cameras behind the hidden cameras.
               Hired the guy who did the last
               Sports Illustrated Swimsuit issue.
               Excellent work... whoops, damn
               Fotomat assholes...

     A slide hits the wall of himself and Minerva kneeling in
     Big Baby clothes with Alfred snarling over them, decked
     out in leather.  He clicks ahead...

     Hawk looks away and sees that the Board members have an
     annual Report-type booklet in front of them that reads--
     THE DA VINCI/ALCHEMY PROJECT.

     Minerva leans over in front of him.

                             MINERVA
               Tomorrow, you're going to hit a
               church.

                                               CUT TO:

     EXT. A MASSIVE WIDE SHOT OF ST. PETER'S--DAY

     The Vatican stands in its glory, mobbed by HUNDREDS OF
     LOCALS AND SIGHTSEERS.  The viewer's viewpoint zeroes in
     on the Mayflower limousine circling around it.

     INT. THE LIMOUSINE

     Hawk looks out from the back seat of the limousine
     in stylish Italian sunglasses.

                             HAWK
               I'm robbing the Vatican.  The nuns
               at St. Agnes predicted that I'd end
               up doing this...

     Two identical Twin Flunkies sit across from him, grinning
     stupidly.  Hawk pushes up his sunglasses with his middle
     finger.

     INT. VATICANESQUE MAP ROOM

     Mentally casing the joint, Hawk gets some distance
     between him and the flunkies as he enters into a room
     that has a glorious, ancient Map of the World Mural.

     INT. ANOTHER VATICAN ROOM

     Hawk makes a scribble in a notepad before coming to a
     Vatican guard, standing before a painting of a Pope
     performing a Coronation.

                             HAWK
                       (half-hearted)
               Excuse me, I'm being blackmailed
               into robbing the Vatican by a
               psychotic American corporation
               along with a CIA...

                             VATICAN GUARD
               "You're being".....uh, I don't,
               uh...

     A jaded Hawk laughs and pats the cop on the back.

                             HAWK
               Forget it, man.  Go tackle a
               jaywalker.

     INT./EXT. CIRCULAR OPEN AIR HALLWAY

     Hawk comes out onto a circular open-air hallway.  He
     scans up to some rooftops and makes a note...until he
     sees a line of International Phone Boothettes.  Checking
     for Flunkies, he rips one up.

                             HAWK
               Operator, I want to make a collect
               call to Alex Messina, New York....

     The Flunkies drift into view.  Hawk hangs up and seethes
     off.

     INT. HALLWAY LEADING TO CODEX ROOM

     Hawk saunters down a long resplendent hallway toward a
     room at the end bustling with excitement.  Coming to the
     mouth of the room, he looks to two gold framed mirrors on
     either side of the opening, rubs his head, and scribbles.

     INSIDE THE CODEX ROOM

     Hawk takes in the majestic beauty, and practical details,
     of the room--windows, statues, a Massive Ornate Lighting
     Fixture--as he moves down one of the twin winding stair-
     cases leading to a path of people behind velvet ropes and
     the object of their gaze...

     THE DA VINCI CODEX

     --an old book enclosed in a glass case, propped open to
     the familiar BEAUTIFUL DRAWING of a MAN inside a CIRCLE.

     The case is located between two informational tablets
     enclosed in glass columns.  Enter Holy Da Vinci theme.

                             ANNA (V.O.)
               But it is his gift as an inventor
               who drew together science and art
               that is most incredible.

     Hawk brightens to the return of Anna, carrying a portfolio
     bag, striding down the stairs with a group of INVESTORS
     AND FAMILIES.  She brightens back, giving him a quick
     verbal breath and a hand squeeze.

                             ANNA
               Tough guy.  What are you--How's
               your head.

                             HAWK
                       (vegetable)
               Yes, and my giraffe loves it, too...

     She laughs, going into her public voice.

                             ANNA
               As you know, the Da Vinci Codex,
               has lived in the Vatican for
               centuries and will continue to
               live here for centuries more.

                             HAWK
                       (under his breath)
               That's what you theenk.

                             ANNA
               Question, sir?   His untiring pen
               predicted the airplane, the
               submarine, the bicycle, the
               helicopter, and even the tank.
         
     A LITTLE BRAT trailing the group, moves next to Hawk,
     bitching away to her STUFFED ELEPHANT, POKEY.

                             LITTLE BRAT
               This is so bor-ing!  Do you hate
               Italy as much as I do, Pokey?
                       (bad ventriloquism)
               Si, senor!  Italy sucks the big
               one!  why can't we go to the Epcot
               Center!

     The Little Brat stops and lets Pokey the elephant dangle
     from her side.  Hawk eyes the elephant strangely.

                             ANNA
               These more dangerous designs
               inspired him to develop a secret
               code that ....

     The stuffed elephant suddenly goes flying over Anna's
     head.

     The ALARM goes off.  The Massive Ornate Lighting Fixture
     swoops down from the ceiling, inverting in air, and slams
     down over the Codex, transformed into a makeshift cage.

     Strange green gas comes billowing out of the vents.
     Needless to say, everyone goes crazy.

     Coughing gas, Hawk peeks to see that a line of light
     sensor alarms imbedded in the tablets are what set the
     alarm off.

     Two GAS MASKS drop airlinesquely from the mouth of the
     entranceway and TWO RACING-IN GUARDS wrangle them on.

     The Little Brat sees that Pokey the stuffed elephant has
     been beheaded by the cage/lamp.  She is pulled away and
     spanked.

                             LITTLE BRAT
               Pokey, come back!

     Anna yanks a notetaking Hawk away as the gas blusters in
     around him.  The Two Flunkies, eyes on Hawk, are hap-
     lessly making their way up the opposite staircase.

                             ANNA
               Come on, this stuff will knock you
               out.  Have you ever had the feeling
               you were being followed, Mr. Bond.

                             HAWK
               Never, why do you ask?

     Reaching the top of the stairs, just outside the door,
     Anna briskly pulls Hawk into a PIECE OF WALL THAT IS
     REALLY A DOOR.  The wall closes as the Flunkies come
     flying out, baffled.

     INT. CIRCULAR STAIRCASE

     Hawk, mucho impressed, and Anna move down a tight, dark
     circular staircase.

                             HAWK
               Whoa.  Name's Hawkins, Eddie
               Hawkins.
               My nickname's Hudson Hawk, but don't
               call me Hudson, not even as a joke.
               The Nuns at St. Agnes called me
               that and they're the ones who
               helped make me what I am today.
               Not a compliment...

                             ANNA
               Sure Hudson.  Are you going to
               tell me why you did that back there
               or are you going to blame it
               on Dumbo?

                             HAWK
               Could you believe that crazy
               elephant?

     Anna shakes her head as she opens a door into...

     INT. A LITTLE UNDERGROUND SUBWAY--DAY

     A four foot high mail train rumbles down the track of a
     mini-underground station.  Workers latch onto mail bags.
     Hawk and Anna emerge from a small door.

                             HAWK
               Whoa, part 2.  Does it go to Times
               Square?

                             ANNA
               Delivers up to ten at night.  The
               Pope has an obsession with his
               Easter Seals.  It's actually not
               that an unusual set-up.  The
               secret passageway on the other
               hand....

                             HAWK
               The Vatican is made of constant
               mysteries meant to be enjoyed,
               not explained.

                             ANNA
               Nice.  But right out of our
               brochure.

                             HAWK
               Oh, you read that.

                             ANNA
               Actually I wrote it.  It's a good
               sentence.  It can apply to people.

                             HAWK
               You're not an unmysterious thang
               yourself.

                             ANNA
               I don't steal stuffed elephants
               from little girls.
                       (smoothing his
                        jacket)
               And I buy my own clothes.  My
               life's a little boring...

                             HAWK
               God, I wish I could say the same
               thing.  What about having a nice,
               dull dinner with me tonight.
               Scrabble, Knock-knock jokes,
               Anecdotes about famous dead
               Italians....

                             ANNA
               I'll bring my entire repertoire...

     The Two Flunkies stumble into the station, looking
     around.  Anna and Hawk crouch down.

                             HAWK
               And I'll bring my entourage...

                             ANNA
               Secret passageways don't mean as
               much as they used to.  There's
               a place two blocks east of here.
               Enzo's.  Say 10:30.

                             HAWK
               Said.

     Hawk and Anna peck each other with a smile.  He crawls
     out an exit door.  As he leaves, Anna's smile disappears.
     She pulls out a rosary and gives herself a self-scolding
     bang on the head.  She then darts to a large crucifix
     and looks up.

                             ANNA
               Father, it's obvious.  He's up to
               something.

     Suddenly a speaker in Jesus's mouth gently crackles.

                             JESUS (Italian)
               Report downstairs at once.

                             ANNA
               Yes, sir.

     INT. CATACOMBLIKE AREA

     A CARDINAL paces in an enigmatic Vatican area.  Anna
     clacks up to him.

                             CARDINAL
               Did he mention the Mayflowers?

                             ANNA
               No, your Eminence.  I think he's
               going to steal the Codex, as
               early as next week.

                             CARDINAL
               Attempt, you mean.  The vanity
               of this man, Hudson Hawk.  The
               Vatican has foiled the advances
               of Pirates and Terrorists.  We
               will not lie down for some
               schmuck from New Jersey.  Must
               you flirt with him so realistically?

                             ANNA
               That's the best kind.  A wise
               woman once said "Polite
               conversation is rarely either."

                             CARDINAL
                       (chuckling)
               Let me be the one to quote
               Scripture.  ....As an agent of
               our organization, you are put in
               awkward situations.  Just
               remember, Hudson Hawk is an evil,
               evil man.

                             ANNA
                       (unconvinced)
               Yeah.  The big E.

     EXT. NAVONA PIAZZA--DAY

     The evil Hawk clumsily strides around a fountain, looking
     off in all directions, soft-shoes past some sedate
     painters and swings into...

     INT. A BIG QUIRKY PHONE BOOTH

     Hawk grabs up the phone and dials....

                             HAWK
               Hello, operator.  I'd like to
               make a collect call to New York
               number...

     The Mayflower limousine creeps to the edge of the piazza,
     behind an oblivious Hawk.

                             HAWK
               Thank you, operator, thank you.

     Hawk turns, putting a finger in his ear.  Seeing the
     limo, he FREAKS and balls himself into a corner.

                             HAWK
               Come on, Alex, pick up, you
               Reindeer goat cheese-eating
               motherfucker.

     INT. ALEX'S RESTAURANT--NIGHT

     It is late night in New York.  A phone rings atop the
     bar of Alex's restaurant with no one in sight.

     INT. PIAZZA--DAY

     Hawk pokes his head to see a Darwin and Minerva (holding
     Bunny) emerge from the limousine.  As he turns his con-
     centration back to the phone, ALEX HIMSELF flows out from
     a building to cheerfully speak with Darwin and Minerva
     and get licked by Bunny, before they all pile into the
     limo.

                             HAWK
               A-lex, A-lex, come on Alex.

     Hawk slams down the phone and turns to see the limousine
     pull off.

     Hawk angrily bursts from the door and is painfully
     CLOTHESLINED by agent Butterfinger, who is dressed as
     a mailman.

     Crumpled on the ground, Hawk kicks out with his foot,
     into Butterfinger's stomach, doubling him. Hawk then
     grabs him by the head and rams into the glass of the
     booth.

     Hawk rotates off for an escape...but the rest of the
     CIA crew cuts him off holding barely concealed guns;
     Snickers dressed as a maitre 'd, Almond Joy as a Bermuda
     tourist, and Kaplan in his usual emsemble.  Kit Kat is
     dressed exactly like Hawk, right down to a bloody lip.
     Hawk gives him a double take.

                             KAPLAN
               Hawk, Hawk, Hawk.  Enjoying
               Italy?  I always had a soft spot
               for Rome.  Did my first barehanded
               strangulation here.  Communist
               politician.

                             HAWK
               Why George, you big softie...

                             KAPLAN
               God, I miss communism.  The Red
               Threat.  People were scared, the
               Agency was respected, and I got
               laid every night.

     A humiliated Butterfinger comes waddling out, holding
     the phone.  Kaplan rolls his eyes.

                             BUTTERFINGER
               Sorry, coach...

                             KAPLAN
                       (shaking his head)
               If his father wasn't the head of
               Shit, I hate this, the
               government's got me farmed out,
               working for the Mayflower
               corporation now, money beats
               politics.  War isn't Hell anymore,
               it's Dull.  Don't slaughter their
               men and rape their women, just
               steal their microchips.

                             HAWK
               You know Kaplan, if you weren't
               the slimiest pinata of shit that
               ever lived, I'd feel sorry for
               you.

                             SNICKERS
               Good news, bud, the Mayflowers
               have moved up the time-table.
               You're hitting the Vatican to-night.

                             HAWK
               Tonight?  You're whacked.  The
               timing's off, I'm underequipped
               Damnit, I have a date!

     Almond Joy smoothly extracts Hawk's notebook and reads...

                             ALMOND JOY
               Grapple, Biker's bottle, hairspray,
               black turtleneck, Pocket
               Fisherman, acid, collapsible
               yardstick, softball, and 72 stamps.
               Gee Stud, this is going to be
               some date.  No Harvey's Bristol
               Cream?

                             KAPLAN
               Snickers, make the list happen.
               Oh and it's one thing to play
               hide and seek with the Mayflower's
               pathetic staff, but we're sore
               losers.  I've put jumper cables
               on the nipples of children and
               not always in the line of duty.

                             HAWK
               Thanks for sharing.

                             KAPLAN
               We blow up space shuttles for
               breakfast.  You and your friend
               Alex would be a late afternoon
               Triscuit.

                             HAWK
               If you do anything to my friend...

                             KAPLAN
               Yeah, right.  By the way, as long
               as I'm getting things off my
               chest, I'm the one who killed your
               little monkey.  Made it look like
               a Mafia hit.  Did it for fun.
               Ciao.

     Kaplan and the crew quickly disperse in different
     directions as Hawk howls in frustration.  Kit Kat moves
     behind Hawk and perfectly mimics him.

                             HAWK
               What did you have against Little
               Eddie, motherfucker?  He was just
               a monkey who liked to laugh.
               Come back without your yuppie
               army.  I'll triscuit you, you
               space shuttle eating...Shit.!

     Without looking, Hawk elbows the mimic Kit Kat in the
     face.  Kit Kat gives Hawk a strange smile and hands him
     a card that reads:  BEWARE THE ODD STEPS.

     Hawk looks up from the card.  Kit Kat is gone, but
     Butterfinger scampers in his place.

                             BUTTERFINGER
               Hey, Mr. Hawk, I got those 72
               stamps!

     Sighing, Hawk takes the huge sheath of stamps.

     EXT. INDOOR TRAIN TRACK

     One of the small Vatican mail trains bullets across an
     indoor track.  The viewer's viewpoint whooshes to catch
     up, focusing on a very large package, addressed to the
     Pope, that has Hawk's sheath of stamps slapped onto it.
     The train zips into a tunnel.

     INT. THE VATICAN UNDERGROUND SUBWAY

     The train rumbles into the Vatican mini-station.  TWO
     HARRIED WORKERS heave up the strange cargo onto a sorting
     table.

     A bell rings as a clock hits 10.  The workers do a sigh
     of relief.  Shucking off their uniforms, they head out.

     A hand rips out of the huge package.

     INT. OUTSIDE THE CODEX ROOM--NIGHT

     Hawk pops out of the secret passageway door and moves to
     the mouth of the doorless Codex room.  He pauses to
     hand-comb his hair in the two large, framed mirrors at
     the sides.

     THE CODEX ROOM

     Carrying the now frameless mirrors in each hand, Hawk
     hustles to the top of the steps and suddenly stops.

                             HAWK
               "Beware the Odd Steps."

     Hawk crouches down and notices the step below him has a
     clear magnetic tape running across it to a dime sized
     alarm button.

                             HAWK
               Why Kit Kat, aren't you a
               gentleman...

     Hawk bounds down every other one of the steps down to
     where the Codex is bathed in a holy light.

     He hefts up the two now frameless mirrors and puts them
     each in a groove of a collapsible yardstick running
     across the top.  The parallel mirrors now face out from
     each other.  Hawk sprays a blast of Clairol to reveal the
     light sensor beams, and then with a deep breath, he
     thrusts the mirrors into the beams.

     The light bounces harmlessly off the mirrors and Hawk
     exhales.  He balances the connected mirrors then crawls
     through his tent-like passageway.

     Hawk squirts acid from a biker's bottle on the cracks of
     the rectangular glass case that holds the Codex.  The
     acid sizzles.

     INT. VATICAN LIBRARY HALLWAY--NIGHT

     A BURLY GUARD thoughtfully stares at a painting, fingers
     propping his chin like an critic then continues ambling
     on.

     THE CODEX ROOM

     Rubbing his head, Hawk gives an excited smile as the glass
     cracks of the rectangular case loosen.  Hawk pulls out a
     pocket fisherman....

     The viewer's viewpoint moves upward to reveal, through
     the mouth of the room, the Burly Guard is coming down
     the hall.

     OUTSIDE THE CODEX ROOM

     Burly Guard approaches the outskirts of the Codex room.
     He combs his hair into the piece of wall in the now
     empty mirror-frame then REALIZES.

     Muttering Italian into his walkie-talkie, Burly Guard
     rushes into the room and looks down to the sensor
     deflecting mirrors.

     He passes a statue, behind which, Hawk is revealed to
     be standing.

     Burly Guard approaches the Codex and sees the dripping
     acid.  He also notices a fishing hook attached to the
     binding of the Codex.  The fishing wire leads out of
     the glass case.  The Guard reaches to touch it when
     suddenly the wire is pulled tightly upward by a
     moving-out-from-behind-the-statue Hawk.

     The Codex FLIES off its perch, setting off the ALARM and
     sending the bizarre cage/lamp CRASHING DOWN and AROUND
     the hapless Burly Guard.  The green gas commences its
     noxious billowing as the Codex swooshes into Hawk's
     hands.  He then hurls a softball, smashing a window
     on the other side of the room.

     The familiar Vatican Guard and a Guard Three barrel
     down into the mouth of the codex room.  Only one
     Gas Mask drops from the doorway.  The Vatican Guard
     pulls it on and gives a "That's Life" shrug of
     shoulders to the fainting Guard three.

     Hawk puts on the missing gas mask and launches a grapple
     around the ceiling cord of the dropped Ornate Lighting
     Fixture.  Hawk then Tarzans from one staircase to
     another.  He then ungrapples and heads toward the
     shattered window.

     The Vatican Guard waits a stunned moment before giving
     chase.

     EXT. THE ROOF

     Hawk flings off his gas mask and begins a classical
     skipping-across-the-rooftop jaunt.  Suddenly a brick
     on the slightly slanted roof gives way and Hawk FALLS.
     His canvas bag goes skipping down across the roof,
     landing against the antennae.

     INT. THE POPE'S BEDROOM

     A T.V. showing Mr. Ed. speaking to Wilbur in Italian
     goes fuzzy.  THE POPE, wearing his famous hat and a Notre
     Dame bathrobe angrily bangs on it.

     EXT. THE ROOF

     Hawk harvests his grapple on the level part of the roof
     and slides down toward the dangling-off-the-antennae bag.

     The Vatican Guard pops out of the window and fires a
     warning shot.

     Hawk stretches to the bag.  His fingers touch as the
     Guard continues to bound forward.

                             HAWK
               Please God, Please God.......let
               the guard shoot me.

     Hawk pulls up the bag and turns himself to see Vatican
     Guard hovering over him on the roof.

                             VATICAN GUARD
               The worm's on the other foot,
               yankee noodle candy.

     Hawk sees the Vatican Guard's foot move toward the
     grapple.  Hawk ferociously tugs, ripping the Guard
     off-balance and knocking down a side of the roof.

     EXT. TOP OF A NEARBY WALL

     Hawk dashes atop a nearby wall and hurls his grapple
     across a road around a tree branch.  Hawk ties the end of
     grapple line, tosses on a friction belt, takes a breath
     and JUMPS OFF THE WALL.  The viewer follows him on his
     breathtaking ride.

     The brused Vatican Guard flops back atop the roof.  He
     gets off a wild shot before crumpling back down.

     HAWK

     is alnost to the other side when the Guard's bullet hits
     the friction belt.  Hawk drops with a wild scream...
     and lands with a painful straddle atop a street lamppost.
     His eyes bug out with the thought of a life without
     children.  He slowly spins off the lamppost and sails
     down upon...

     EXT. A BUS

     and the comfortable luggage housed on top of it.  Hawk
     tries to maintain his balance upon the wobbling
     baggage, but the bus makes a quick turn and Hawk goes
     flying off...

     EXT. RIGHT INTO A CAFE CHAIR--NIGHT

     Panting and discombobulated, Hawk looks across the table
     to the female hands holding open a menu.  The menu comes
     down.  It is Anna.  Hawk unpretzels and laps his canvas
     bag.

                             ANNA
               Oh Hudson, I was worried you
               weren't going to drop by....

                             HAWK
               I never break a date.  Scout's
               honor.

     Hawk does the honor sign with his black gloved hand
     then quickly rips it off as a WAITER comes to the
     table.

                             HAWK
               Fettucini con Funghi Porcini.

                             WAITER
               Bellissimo, signor.

                             HAWK
               Oh, and could I have some ketchup
               with that.

     Anna hits her forehead with the palm of her hand while
     the waiter's entire body sinks in disappointment.  Other
     TABLE OCCUPANTS sadly shake their heads.

     EXT. ANOTHER TABLE--NIGHT

     At a comfortable distance curled behind a heat lamp,
     Snickers is being an Uglier American to an UNCOMPREHENDING
     WAITER, while Almond Joy chuckles and Butterfinger spreads
     butter over an entire baguette.

                             SNICKERS
               Come on, Pierre, Steak-bur-ger,
               Fren-n-ch Fries.  This is France,
               you gotta have French.....

                             ALMOND JOY
               Actually we're in Italy, Snickers,
               she said as if it made a difference.

     The Waiter sneaks off.  Butterfinger devours his bread.

                             SNICKERS
               Italy, France, Moscow.  They all
               just wanna be Nebraska.  Old Man
               Kaplan thinks since Communism is
               dead, we got nothing to do.  Man,
               Democracy isn't free elections.
               We gotta teach the world that
               Democracy is Big Tits, College
               Football on Saturdays, Eddie
               Murphy saying the word "Fuck"
               and Kids putting their hands down
               garbage disposals on "America's
               Funniest Home Videos."

                             ALMOND JOY
               Damn baby, when's the last time
               you had a vacation...Jesus, I
               gotta get out of this job.  If
               my Mom knew her daughter
               assassinated the leader of the
               anti-Apartheid movement....

                             SNICKERS
               Quit bitching, you got the
               employee of the month plaque for
               that shit...Ah to be in Pari-is
               and in love.

     They look off to....

     HAWK AND ANNA'S TABLE

     Physically sarcastic, the Waiter brings a tall wine
     basket with a bottle of ketchup in it.  Hawk nabs it.

                             HAWK
               This is bueno.  They had the worst
               ketchup in prison.....uh...

                             ANNA
               Prison?

                             HAWK
               I was the Warden?

                             ANNA
               How long were you in?

                             HAWK
               Let's just say, I never saw E.T.

                             ANNA
               Wow, you were "in the joint."
               "Doing hard time."  It's funny,
               but that excites me.  I seem to
               have a thing for sinners.

                             HAWK
               I seem to have a thing for sinning.
               sinning.  Check please....

                             WAITER
               Ah, anything for dessert?

                             ANNA
                       (she shoots)
               Yes.  Something to go.

                             HAWK
                       (she scores)
               I'll bring the ketchup.

       INT. ANNA'S HOUSE--NIGHT

       The viewer's viewpoint pulls back, past the black canvas
       bag on a table, to reveal a barefoot Anna is straddling
       a bare-backed Hawk, demurely and tentatively studying his
       bruises.

                             ANNA
               What have you been doing?

                             HAWK
               Uh....old badminton injury.

     Anna giggles and bends to kiss a bruise.  She stops
     herself and opts for tickling.

                             HAWK
               tickles, ticKleS, TICKLES.

                             ANNA
                       (not stopping)
               Oh, I'm so sorry...

     Roaring with laughter, they capsize onto the floor.
     Hawk slithers around to devour her toes.  Anna closes
     her eyes and arches her back.....

     She opens her eyes and sees a large crucifix staring
     right at her.  With a gasp, she rolls away from Hawk
     and stands up, trying to brush off her sins.

                             ANNA
               I'm sorry.  I can't.  I....

                             HAWK
                       (softly approaching)
               Hey now, outside of a very
               friendly dog this morning, it's
               been a slow decade.  I don't make
               love every ten years, I get a
               little cranky.

                             ANNA
               It's also been a long time for
               me.  I--

     Their heads fuse for a semi-classic screen kiss until
     THE CRUCIFIX LIGHTS UP AND BEGINS SHOUTING IN ITALIAN.

                             HAWK
               Catholic girls are scary...

                            ANNA
               Somebody robbed the Vatican.

                            HAWK
               Oh.  No.

     Anna slides on her shoes and makes a hasty retreat.
     She bumps into the canvas bag.  The Codex slides out.
     They both catch it in mid-air.  Anna's eyes pop.  She
     wrenches the Codex away and kicks.  Hawk pulls her into
     a compassionate back-against-his-stomach hug.  The Codex
     falls to the floor unharmed.

                             HAWK
               It's not what you think.  Okay,
               maybe it is....

                             ANNA
               You really went and did it.  With
               one day, not even a day, of
               planning, you did it.  Nobody
               does it better, Hudson.  You
               started the week stealing the
               Sforza and you ended it swiping
               the Codex.

                             HAWK
               Wha--

                             ANNA
               What are your plans for the
               weekend?  Hoisting away the
               Colosseum?  Tell me, did the
               devil make you do it or did
               Darwin and Minerva Mayflower?

     EXT. A CAR OUTSIDE OF ANNA'S PLACE--NIGHT

     Crammed together in the front seat, Snickers, Almond
     Joy, and Butterfinger are watching the shadows of
     Hawk and Anna up in the window.  Snickers snaps a
     cartridge into a gun while Butterfinger attacks a
     goo-ey pastry.

                              SNICKERS
               What's going on in there?

                              BUTTERFINGER
               Do you want me to rape them?
                       (throwing pastry down)
               Dunkin does it better.

                              SNICKERS
               Just read, Butterfinger.

     Butterfinger pulls up the book on Da Vinci that Anna
     wrote and starts reading like a schoolboy.

                             BUTTERFINGER
               "Da Vinci had fears about his
               more dangerous designs, so he
               created a shorthand code in
               reverse script..."

                             ALMOND JOY
               To yourself!.....What are they
               doing?  In twenty seconds, we go
               in.

     INT. ANNA'S PLACE

     Foam shoots out over the coffee.  Hawk smiles down at
     it as Anna works a cappuccino machine.

                             ANNA
               For two years, I've been tracking
               the Mayflowers' peculiar interest
               in three Da Vinci pieces.  Their
               Sforza replica was as fake as
               the "gas leak" that supposedly
               destroyed it.

                             HAWK
               Does everyone in the world know
               more than me?  Jesus, I'm just
               some guy who happens to be good
               at swiping stuff.....Lifted a
               piece of licorice when I was one
               and a half.  Who knew it would
               lead... They even got the CIA
               involved!

                             ANNA
               The C.I. what?  God, no...

                             HAWK
                       (raising his cup)
               Ooh, I guess I do know something
               Here's looking at you, kid...

     THE CAR OUTSIDE

     The agents burst from the car, guns raised.

                             ALMOND JOY
               Now.

     ANNA'S HOUSE

     Hawk sips the cappuccino.  His face immediately contracts.

                             HAWK
               This doesn't taste like
               cappuccino.

                             ANNA
               Oh, I must have put too much
               ethyl-chloride in it.

     Anna throws a pillow on the ground and holds out her
     hand.  Hawk collapses.  His coffee cup lands perfectly in
     Anna's outstretched hand and his head lands perfectly
     on the pillow.

     The candy bars bash the door open, guns raised.

                             ANNA
               Why didn't you tell me at the
               restaurant that he had hit the
               Vatican tonight.  My people will
               not be happy.  I want to see Kaplan.

                             ALMOND JOY
               That's not overly possible.  He...

                             BUTTERFINGER
               But guys, remember, he's in the
               castle at Vinci....

     Snickers and Almond Joy grimace into fake smiles.

     EXT. THE CASTLE--NIGHT

     A helicopter thunders up to the awesome castle from the
     opening Da Vinci sequence.

     INT. HELICOPTER

     Anna pets the head of Hawk on her lap.  She is pondering.

     INT. A MYSTERIOUS DARK ROOM--NIGHT

     A sparse circle of light houses a chair and a pacing
     Kaplan.

     Snickers and Butterfinger flop Hawk onto the lit chair.

     Kit Kat is dressed exactly like Anna.  She reacts as she
     comes into the light.  Kaplan takes the Codex from her.

                             KAPLAN
               Way to go, Anna.

                             ANNA
               When the Mayflowers find out we
               have the Codex, they're going to
               want to make a deal...

                             KAPLAN
                       (gung-ho lying)
               And then we'll arrest those
               greedy pigs... Is that it?

     Hawk stirs.  The viewer gets his woozy P.O.V.

                             ANNA
               Actually George, it's not it.
               What are we doing in this castle?
               I happen to know the Mayflowers
               bought this castle last year when
               they found out Da Vinci used to
               do...

     The lights in the room come on to the sound of holy Da
     Vinci theme, revealing an almost perfect refurbishing of
     the exact same workshop Da Vinci toiled in in the
     opening.

                             KAPLAN
                       (trying to be solemn)
               It's the site of their new museum
               and we're taking it over.  Operation
               Deflower Mayflower is going full
               speed ahead.

                             ANNA
                       (taking it in)
               Oh Lord.... the only reason I ask is
               that Hudson, uh, Mr. Hawk, Hawkins,
               had some "neat" things to say about
               Darwin, Minerva, and you.
               Basically that you're part of the
               same car pool.

                             KAPLAN
               Anna.  Anna.  Anna.  If that were
               true, Almond Joy would have
               handed you your heart right
               after you handed me the Codex.
               Now, get some sleep.  Kit Kat...

     Kit Kat in drag spookily moves inches away from Anna.

                              ANNA
               Cat got his tongue?

                              KAPLAN
               Actually he never told us what it
               was.

     Kit Kat smiles, revealing the fact he has no tongue.

                             ANNA
               How sweet.  I trust you will see
               Hudson Hawk is given to the proper
               authorities.  I recommend
               leniency...

                             SNICKERS
                       (holding in a laugh)
               Oh, I think we all do.

     Hawk gives her a look of honesty and pain that causes
     Anna to guiltily gulp as she heads out with the mimicking
     Kit Kat.

                             SNICKERS
               Do you think she has any idea that
               Operation Deflower Mayflower is as
               bogus as Kit Kat's tits?

                             KAPLAN
               I don't think so, although bringing
               her to the castle gave her a big,
               juicy hint.

                             ALMOND JOY
               With all due respect to that great
               blouse, why didn't I cut out her
               heart?

                             KAPLAN
               Close call, but she's our only way
               of keeping tabs on that damn
               mysterious Vatican organization.
               Hawk, it's time to go to the
               principal's office....

     EXT. OUTSIDE THE CASTLE--NIGHT

     Moving into the chopper, Anna glimpses, Bunny, the
     obnoxious dog, in a Mayflower logo dog tag, taking a leak
     on some bushes.  She fakes a yawn to the like dressed Kit
     Kat who fakes one back.

     INT. THE G. MACHINE ROOM--NIGHT

     Kaplan, Hawk, and the other agents march into the mammoth
     room of the opening scene.  In the place of where one
     remembers the gold machine are undulating sheets, beneath
     which are unassembled parts of the machine.

     Inside, a ball goes whizzing out of a tennis ball
     machine.  In tennis gear and goggles, Darwin Mayflower
     thwacks it against the wall of (now faded) frescos.

     Also in tennis threads, Minerva is laying on a chaise
     lounge holding a gadget in her hand.

                             DARWIN
               Seven!

     Minerva turns the gadget up to SEVEN and presses a
     button.  Another tennis ball shoots out, a little faster.
     Darwin batters it.  The ball ricochets into the forehead
     of an "amused" Alfred who is retrieving balls in sweat
     pants.

                             ALFRED
               Jolly.  Good.  Shot.  Sir.

                             MINERVA
               Ooh, it's Hudson Hawk, you cease
               to amaze me, convict.  You are a
               terrible cat burglar!

                             DARWIN
               Haven't you ever seen, like David
               Niven?  You know tiptoe in, tiptoe
               out.

                             MINERVA
               Like a "cat", one could say.

                             HAWK
               Shucks, I'll just take it back.

     Hawk reaches for the Codex.  Kaplan pulls it over to
     Darwin, who pulls up his goggles and fondles the ancient
     binding.  Taking a knife from Kaplan, he begins to slit
     it open.

                             MINERVA
                       (bouncing up)
               No, let me!

                             DARWIN
                       (pout)
               I don't care.

     Hawk looks away to the billowing sheets and the strange
     machine parts behind them.

     Minerva slits the bindings and tugs out another geometri-
     cally perverted crystal.

                             HAWK
               Another piece of the puzzle for
               the Da Vinci Alchemy project.

     Kaplan, Darwin, and Minerva look up to Hawk, then to each
     other, all start to speak, then all stop.

     This quandary is deferred by the entrance of the twin
     Flunkies.

                             DARWIN
               Oh, you.  There's nothing more I
               hate than failure.  All you had to
               do was follow the Hawk, it's not
               like I said "Teach our nation's
               children how to read."

     Hawk uses the distraction to amble toward the sheets.

                             DARWIN
               I guess we're just going to have
               to kill 'em...

     Shockingly swift, Minerva pulls a small gun from beneath
     her tennis dress and blasts a burning hole between each
     set of Flunky eyes, splattering them to the ground.

                             DARWIN
               God Minerva, I was kidding.

     A SHOCKED HAWK

     quickly turns from the blithe carnage and pulls up a
     sheet.  He reveals the familiar Gold Machine Demonhead.

     THE MAYFLOWERS

     reverberate off each other with laughter.  Bloodstained,
     Kaplan and Almond Joy exchange an eye bulge.  Minerva's
     smile disappears as she sees Hawk by the sheets.

                             MINERVA
               Get away from there, convict!

                             HAWK
               Just browsing.  Don't touch me....

     Snickers touches him.  Hawk smashes him in the jaw.
     Snickers rears back to reciprocate....

                             DARWIN
               Don't hurt him!  We need him for
               the final job!

     Snickers stops himself, snarling in frustration.  Hawk is
     suddenly the happiest man he's been in Italy.

                             HAWK
               Oh weeeeelly, don't hurt me?  Even
               if I do this....

     Hawk pulls Snickers' glasses off and stamps them.

                             HAWK
               And this....

     Hawk knees Butterfinger in the stomach.

                             HAWK
               Surely this must offend....

     Hawk body-block-dominoes Butterfinger and Snickers to the
     ground.  Kaplan and Almond Joy aim their guns.

                             KAPLAN
               That's it!

     Playfully lifting his shirt, Hawk grabs Minerva and
     manually swivels her hips to the beat of his.

                             HAWK
               Things are getting a little loose
               at the Da Vinci workshop tonight.
               "Put your left leg in, take your
               right foot out."  May I call you
               Minnie....

     Hawk mambos to Alfred who rifles his blade up to Hawk's
     crotch.  Hawk stops dancing.

                             DARWIN
               Come to think of it there is a part
               of your body that you won't need for
               your next job...

                             HAWK
               Hey, guys, I've always wanted to sing
               like Franki Valli and the other seasons,
               but come on....

     Alfred moves the blade a little upward.  Hawk a-a-ghs.

                             MINERVA
               Big girls don't cry-I-eye.

                             HAWK
               Two minutes, 35 seconds.  Damnit,
               I'm involved in this thing, so I
               just wanna know what this thing is.
               I wanna be treated as an adult.

                             DARWIN
               That's fair.  Tomorrow.  Back in
               Rome.  Now go to your room.

     Alfred strategically Vulcans Hawk on the neck.  He falls.

     INT. DARK CONFESSION BOOTH--MORNING

     The lips of Anna come into light.

                             ANNA
               Forgive me Father for I have
               sinned.  It's been 1200 hours
               since my last confession.

     INT. THE CARDINAL'S SIDE OF THE CONFESSION BOOTH

     The cardinal suppresses a yawn.

                             CARDINAL
               Hit me with your best shot.

                             ANNA (O.S.)
               I betrayed a man.  A good man.  An
               innocent man.  A thief.

                             CARDINAL
               Anna, what are you trying to say...

     ANNA'S DARKENED LIPS

                             ANNA
               He came into a world where crime
               is a legitimate business tactic
               and a legitimate government
               procedure.  But he knew Right and
               Wrong.  Oh, and we kind of messed
               around...

     THE CARDINAL

     freaks and goes into some Italian gibberish before...

                             CARDINAL
               "Messed around" messed around?  I
               know-- I don't want to know.  First
               base?  Second Base?  Stop me when
               I'm getting warm...

                             ANNA (O.S.)
               A little petting is not the issue!

                             CARDINAL
               Sorry.  Seventeen Hail Marys and
               five minutes outside.

     INT. OUTSIDE THE CONFESSION BOOTH--MORNING

     The Cardinal emerges and stands by Anna's confessional
     curtains.

                             CARDINAL
               So let me get this straight,
               sister, you're saying Hudson Hawk
               is not willingly working for the
               Mayflowers but Kaplan and the
               Candy Bars are?

     Anna moves out of the confessional curtains, wearing a
     FULL NUN HABIT for she is a Nun.  The gaspingly beautiful
     church unfolds as they walk.

                             ANNA
               You got it.  Operation Deflower
               Mayflower is a bad joke and I'm the
               punchline.  I thought we were using
               the CIA to help us to get Mayflower,
               but really the CIA was using me to
               keep us away from Mayflower.

                             CARDINAL
               Oh, why couldn't I be the Cardinal
               in charge of catering.... If the
               Mayflowers get the three sections
               of Da Vinci's crystal and his
               instructions for the gold machine--
               Aie-yi--Do we got anything?  What of
               Alex, Hawk's friend, where is his
               loyalty?

                             ANNA
               I'm going to find out.

                             CARDINAL
               I'm sorry for losing it back there,
               but you must remember, sister, you
               have vows to God as well as a mission
               to the world.

                             ANNA
               I know, I know, your Eminence, just say
               "God go with me."

                             CARDINAL
               God go with you, sister.

     Anna puts on the coolest pair of sunglasses, deliciously
     contrasting with her habit.  She moves off....

     INT. ROME CONFERENCE ROOM--DAY

     Beneath the wacky portrait, Darwin circles the board-
     member filled conference table as Minerva smooches Bunny.
     Everyone watches Alfred place a bar of Gold and of Lead
     in the hands of a blindfolded Hawk at the middle of the M.

                             DARWIN
               So, Captain Hawk, in one of your
               paws you got a gold bar worth
               about 8 thou.  In the autre, you
               got lead that won't get you
               gelato.

                             MINERVA
               Surely a master-thief like you can
               tell the difference.

                             HAWK
                       ("What's my Line")
               That's two down to Kitty
               Carlisle...

     Hawk "weighs" the two bars in his hands--digs with his
     fingernails.  He rips off the blindfold in subdued
     frustration.  As Minerva speaks, she unconsciously
     molests Alfred.

                             MINERVA
               Cool, isn't it?  Weight, feel,
               mal1eability, they're all but
               identical.  On the periodic chart
               of elements, they're but one
               proton apart.  Great minds worked
               for centuries to turn worthless
               into priceless.

                             HAWK
               Alchemy.

                             DARWIN
                       (casually goosing Alfred)
               Alchemy!  Is the business term of
               the 90's, my man!  Minerva read
               about it in an airline magazine
               about four years ago.  I dumped
               some lira into research... Shazam,
               we come across a diary by one of
               Da Vinci's apprentices detailing
               La Machine de Oro, the gold machine
               for those at home, and the rest is
               about to become history.  Money
               isn't everything, gold is.  Fuck
               blue chip stocks!  Fuck T-bills!
               Fuck Junk Bonds!  I got the real
               deal!  Money will always be paper
               but gold will always be gold!

                             MINERVA
               Market crashes.  Bomb drops.
               Greenhouse effect affects.  We'll
               still be the richest, most powerful
               people in the world.  In 1992,
               Europe is coming together to become
               one business superpower.  It's one
               party we'd love to poop.

                             DARWIN
               Well, that said, the last
               ingredient in the recipe is in, get
               this, you're gonna die, the Kremlin.

                              HAWK
               Sure.  The Kremlin.  Makes sense.
               The Kremlin.  Why not?  Listen,
               this is all too Indiana Jones and
               the Lost City of King Tut for me,
               man.  Throw me in jail and go ahead,
               just try and throw Alex...

                             MINERVA
               Jail, you asshole!  Our foot
               soldiers will blow your brains
               out!  Bunny, Ball-Ball!

     Minerva angrily throws the dog off her lap and whips a
     tennis ball into its mouth.

                             DARWIN
               I'll torture you so slowly you'll
               think it's a career!  I'll kill
               your family, your friends, and the
               bitch you took to the Prom!

                             HAWK
               You want an address on that last
               one?

     Bunny barks up at Hawk in anger.

                             HAWK
               Bunny, not you too?

                              MINERVA
               You've got a dilemma, tiger.  I
               think I know what's going to help
               you solve it.

     Alfred quickly latches on the state-of-the-art handcuffs
     and the blindfold.  The viewer's viewpoint stays on a
     writhing Hawk.

                              HAWK
               I'll kill all you.  Even the old
               lady.


     Hawk kicks back on the table, "jump ropes" the cuffs,
     then picks the lock with his teeth.  Hawk rips off the
     blindfold to see that the entire room is empty except
     for Alex, standing at the other end, in an incongruous
     Italian leather coat.

                             ALEX
               I hated cigarettes until I saw my
               first No Smoking sign.  Keep off
               the Grass?  Let's play Soccer.
               Only law I cared about was
               friendship.  Broke that one too,
               didn't I?  This Gates-Mario
               Brothers-CIA-Mayflower-Da Vinci
               thing seemed like a sweet deal.
               Visit foreign lands, take their
               treasures.  I don't know, I thought
               you'd get into it.  It's better
               than playing darts with M.B.A.'s at
               the bar.  I didn't know it was
               going to be like this.  Them using
               me to use you... I'm sorry, there's
               only one way out of this and it's
               gonna hurt me more than it's gonna
               hurt you.

     Alex pulls out a gun from his jacket and clicks it in.

     EXT. FAMILIAR PIAZZA--DAY

     The piazza from the fascist E.U.R. building are bustling
     with office workers laughing, smoking, and hustling.
     Darwin, Minerva and Kaplan are a solid troika in the
     center of the steps.  The other agents stroll in the
     periphery....

                              KAPLAN
               I just don't think it was a
               smoking hot idea to leave them up
               there alone.

                             MINERVA
               Don't worry George, this is the
               reason we put the old diabetic
               guinea on the payroll to begin
               with.  To keep Hawk in line.
               They'll talk about "being buddies"
               and "chugging brewskis."

                             DARWIN
                       (raising glass)
               You gotta love male bonding.

     As Darwin slaps Kaplan on the back, behind them, Hawk and
     Alex come crashing out of the windowed doors of the building.

                              KAPLAN
               You were saying...

     Moving to the edge of the stairs, Hawk and Alex, latter
     holding his gun, sprout up from their own debris and
     continue savagely brawling.  The wigging out passers-
     by give them space.

                             HAWK
               You bastard!  You fucked my
               freedom for a lousy job!

     Alex trembles, going into a diabetic seizure.  He shakily
     raises his gun.

                             ALEX
               Hawk... I'm so sorry...

     Hawk roars forward like a bull and helmets Alex.  They
     roll together down the massive staircase past Darwin,
     Minerva, and the CIA who react with "This can't be
     happening" catatonia.

     Two SHOTS go off as Hawk and Alex crash to the bottom of
     the staircase.  Hawk rises up in a daze to see Alex on the
     ground with two bloody bullet holes.

                             HAWK
               No.....Alex!  Wake up, you can't
               go out like this.

     Hawk falls to his knees as Snickers hustles toward him.
     Suddenly, sirens are heard as a police van pulls up.
     Snickers stops.

     Four policemen blast from the back of the van.  One holds
     back the crowd.  One strenuously pulls Hawk into the van.
     The other two drag in Alex.

     The villains look to each other for non-existent guidance
     as the van pulls away.

                             MINERVA
               Plan B, anyone...

     Using initiative, Snickers hops on a Vespa and roars off
     after them.  The van can be seen swerving off.....

     AROUND A CORNER

     where it bolts up into a much larger truck marked VATICAN
     SOUVENIRS.  TWO SEEMINGLY-INNOCENT-BYSTANDER PRIESTS break
     demeanor to flop up the wheel ramps, slam close the back
     of the truck, lock it shut, and continue on their solemn
     way.

     The TRUCK BELLOWS off as the Vespa spins around the corner.
     Snickers brakes and looks around for the police van.  He
     hits his handle with frustration.

     EXT. BEAUTIFUL ROME OVERVIEW

     Out of her habit but still in her incredible sunglasses,
     Anna looks out to a lovely view of Italy.  The Vatican Truck
     pulls up behind her.  A giddy, blood-stained Alex and a not-
     so-giddy Hawk bound out of the back.  Alex excitedly gives
     himself an insulin shot.

                             ANNA
               Oh thank God, you're dead...

                             ALEX
               It was so beautiful!  When the
               blanks went off, they...

     Hawk's fist whooshes into frame and blasts Alex's jaw.

                             HAWK
               You bastard.  You fucked my
               freedom for a lousy job.

                             ALEX
               But I said I was sorry....

                             HAWK
               No sweat, Alex, you only made the
               biggest mistake of my life.  What
               was your per-diem?

                             ALEX
               Don't act like you've never committed
               a crime before, Hawkins?  I know, I
               made call, when Anna tracked me down I...

                             ANNA
               Hudson, don't you understand...

                             HAWK
               And you, Dr. Cappucino, you're lucky
               I don't hit women, assuming you are
               a woman.  I'm not taking anything for
               granted anymore.

                             ANNA
               I-work-for-a-covert-Vatican-humanitarian-
               organization.  The-CIA-made-a-fool-of-me.
               I-care-for-you...

                             HAWK
               Oh.  Well, what's this?

     Hawk pulls out the Demon Head that was in the Mayflower
     Museum from out of his pocket.  Anna turns white.

                             ANNA
               Where did you get this?

                             HAWK
               You know, the place where you gave
               the bad guys the Codex.... the
               Mayflower Museum.

                             ANNA
               It's from the machine.  All they
               need is the crystal to run it and
               they have 2/3 of it already.  We
               can't let that happen.

                             ALEX
               You're saying you want us to beat
               them to the crystal and save the
               world from financial disarray.

                             ANNA
               Something like that.

                             ALEX
                       (pulling out plane
                        tix)
               Well, forget about it.  Hawk and I
               are going to Rio.  We're hurt,
               we're tired, and a hero ain't
               nothing but a sandwich.  Right,
               buddy?...

                             ANNA
               Hudson, God's given you a gift for
               cat burglary, you can t just...

                             HAWK
               You better believe I can.  I'm
               sick of people telling me what I
               have to do.

                             ANNA
               It's that kind of selfish attitude
               that...

                             HAWK
               Selfish attitude?  I'm just some
               guy who wants a little nap and a
               cappuccino for when he wakes up,
               not too much foam...

                             ANNA
               You re not "some guy" anymore,
               Hudson.  Right now, you're the
               only guy.  Without your help, I....

     Anna looks to Hawk with a choked-up expression.  The
     weight of the world on his shoulders, Hawk turns away
     to a lovely view, his mind painfully raging and
     swirling toward peaceful clarity.

                             HAWK
               The world is beautiful.  Every day
               in prison I made sure to remember
               that.  It's only when I actually
               got out that I forgot.  If I was
               sane, I'd be on that plane to Rio.
               But being beaten and abused to
               fulfill some corporation's
               perverted vision does something to
               your mental health.  The world is
               beautiful and I'm tired of being
               fucked.
                       (turning around)
               It's Darwin and Minerva's turn to
               bite the pillow...

     Anna involuntarily does the sign of the cross.  Alex
     goodnaturedly does a jerking off motion.

                             ANNA
               That was beautiful.

                             ALEX
               I laughed, I cried.

     Shaking his head, Hawk swipes the plane tickets from
     Alex.

                             HAWK
               Rio, Alex?  After all they've
               done to...Hey, these tickets are
               for Moscow!

                             ALEX
                       (knowing smile)
               Damn travel agency.  That Kremlin
               thing is in Moscow, isn't it?

     A proud Hawk slaps Alex on the back as some passing
     ITALIAN LOCALS stop to stare, horrified, at Alex's
     bullet holes.  Anna sweetly intervenes.

                             ANNA
               Ketchup.  Stupido Americani...

     The locals give off a slightly dazed "A-a-h" and move off.

     INT. THE CONFERENCE ROOM--DAY

     Wind blows through the shattered conference room window.
     Snickers is banging on his computer apparatus at the
     table with the Mayflowers and the other agents.

                             KAPLAN
               We're all family now.  My team
               has done a lot of rougher things
               than steal the model of a
               helicopter.

                             SNICKERS
               We're going to whack this place
               so fast we'll have time to shop
               for American imports.

     Darwin and Minerva politely smile and then turn away to
     each other with knowing looks.  The computer screen shows
     the familiar image of the Kremlin building that turns
     into a complex look at interiors the viewer will later
     see.

                             ALMOND JOY
               Lucky for us, the Da Vinci is
               located in a wing of the Kremlin
               that they used to throw the Miss
               Ukraine pageant and stuff.  It'll
               have the least number of guards....

                             KAPLAN
               As for our plan of action,
               anybody'd be insane to go in
               from the ground floor...

     INT. A VAN-BUS--NIGHT

     A head-rubbing Hawk and a stomach rubbing Alex kneel on
     the floor of a moving van, over a barely legible drawing
     of what was so neatly delineated on the CIA computer.
     Both guys are dressed as priests and are chewing gum.

                             ALEX
               We're going in from the ground
               floor.

                             HAWK
               Geez, this Art Treasures Room
               looks like a burnt diaphragm.

     Hawk laughs and pops up into the passenger seat.  Anna
     is revealed to be driving in her habit.  Hawk gives her
     a kiss.

                             HAWK
               Hey, don't take your disguise so
               seriously.

                             ANNA
               Uh, yeah.  Guess I'm a wee bit
               nervous.  I'm sorry I could only
               score clergy passports.

                             HAWK
               Fits my new image.  A thief for
               the masses.  This is one job I'm
               not going to feel guilty about
               enjoying.  Gum.

     Hawk, Alex, and Anna all spit out their gum into a bag
     Hawk holds.

                             ALEX
               The security's actually not that
               severe.

                             ANNA
               It doesn't have to be.  Everybody
               knows that if you mess with the
               Kremlin, you'll end up in a
               Siberian gulag eating your own
               fingernails.

     Hawk takes in some views of Moscow that remind one of
     Budapest.

                             HAWK
               Shwoof, that makes me feel better.
               I can't believe this is the Iron
               Curtain.  All the guy at Airport
               customs wanted to know was "Who
               Shot J.R.?"

                             ALEX
               You sound disappointed.

                             HAWK
               Yeah, I mean, come on, going
               through the Iron Curtain is
               supposed to be crawling
               underneath barbed wire, it's
               supposed to be strangling a
               guard...

     THE VAN

     passes a textbook shot of the Kremlin in the distance.

                             HAWK (V.O.)
               It's supposed to be parachuting
               in the moonlight....

     EXT. THE TOP OF THE KREMLIN--NIGHT

     Kaplan, Snickers, Almond Joy, and Butterfinger slam down
     upon the roof of the Kremlin and discard their
     parachutes.

     Snickers opens up his computer screen, upon which is the
     image-map of the Kremlin with a flashing blue light at
     the top of the building and a flashing green one inside.

                             SNICKERS
               We are the blue light.  The green
               light is where the Art Treasures
               room is.

                             KAPLAN
               Let's go make a purple light.
               Where's Kit Kat?

     EXT. THE KREMLIN GROUNDS

     Dressed in cat burglar black and all chewing gum, Hawk,
     Alex, and Anna crawl across the Kremlin grounds.  They
     scope out a shabby Delivery Entrance.

                             ALEX
               Delivery Entrance.  Low Security.

                             ANNA
               Gum.

     All three spit out their gum into Hawk's bag.

                             HAWK
               Count of three?

                             ALEX
               Why not just go now?

                             HAWK
               Okay.

     The Trio rush for the door.

     THE KREMLIN ROOF

     SOVIET GUARD ONE comes out on the roof to light a cig-
     arette.  He looks in the distance to the motivating CIA
     team.  Suddenly a card floats down into his hand.

     It reads:   WILLIAM TELL.  ADAM'S APPLE.  GET IT?

     The not-getting-it Guard looks up from the card as a
     grinning Kit Kat parachutes behind him.  The Guard
     swerves around and Kit Kat savagely skewers him with a
     crossbow shot to his Adam's apple.

     THE DELIVERY ENTRANCE

     Hawk, Anna, and Alex race to the door, the latter
     bashes it...

     INT. GRUNGY WHITE FOYER

     open and sets off an annoying hammer-against-bell alarm.
     Alex all-fours beneath the alarm.  Hawk does a Michael
     Jordan vault off Alex's back and slam dunks A MASSIVE
     BALL OF USED-GUM, pulled from his bag, between the
     hammer and the bell, cutting off the sound.  They rush
     ahead.

     EXT. THE KREMLIN ROOF

     The agents are trotting across the roof when a phone on
     Snickers' apparatus rings.  Kaplan answers it.

                             KAPLAN
               Everything's going fine, Minerva,
               thanks for asking...

     INT. NONDESCRIPT HALLWAY

     Minerva chats on a cellular moving down a hallway, with
     Darwin, who is holding in his laughter as if this was a
     great crank.

                             MINERVA
               I say who needs this Hudson Hawk
               anyway....

     INT. A GRAND BALLROOM

     The good guys scurry upon the second level of an epic
     and gorgeous ballroom.  Two lush staircases lead up from
     the floor.  From behind a pillar, the gang checks out
     the activity below.

     A tablecloth is being wrangled over a large table at
     the opposite end of the ballroom by SERVANTS.  Threaten-
     ing SOVIET SOLDIERS maneuver on the floor.

                             HAWK
                       (Wizard of Oz)
               Oh-Eee-Oh-A-Whoa-Oh.

     They then make a mad scuffle across their side of the
     second level, hunkering down by the level railing.

     As they move into another wing hallway, the viewer's
     viewpoint moves back down to the ballroom floor to see
     a gloating DARWIN AND MINERVA ENTER, the latter still
     on the phone.

                             MINERVA
               Everybody here, in Rome, wishes
               you tinsel boxes of love...

     The servants move away from the tablecloth and the
     table, revealing that it is shaped like an M.  A GROUP
     OF SERIOUS SOVIET V.I.P.'s come out to join the
     Mayflowers at the table.

     THE ROOF

     Kaplan hangs up the phone.

                             KAPLAN
               Lazy, rich, condescending bitch.

     The team moves up to the rooftop doorway where Kit Kat
     is.  He holds up an "About Time" card.  The agents laugh
     and greet them.

     INT. A VERY LONG, ENIGMATIC HALLWAY

     Hawk, Alex, and Anna pass through a set of windowed
     double doors into a very long hallway that leads into a
     pitch darkness.  A MURAL OF A HAPPY, ARM-STRETCHED LENIN
     looms above the doors.  They give it a a quick glance
     before pulling out screwdrivers and wire hangers.

                             ALEX
               Eighth room down, babe...

                             ANNA
               Guards come exactly every three
               minutes....

                             HAWK
               Three.  Oh.  Oh.  "Side by Side."

     Our trio charges down the hallway.

                             HAWK
               "Oh, we ain't got a barrel of
               money.

                             ALEX
               "Maybe we're ragged and funny."

     They reach a MASSIVE SPOOKY DOOR WITH AN ODD, ANCIENT
     LOCK.  They go to work on it.  Not losing the beat.

                             HAWK AND ALEX
               "But we'll travel along, singing
               a song.  Side by Side..."

     INT. TOP FLOOR HALLWAY

     With a gust of wind, Kaplan and the Candy Bars bluster
     through the rooftop door into another hallway, where
     SOVIET GUARDS TWO AND THREE are taking it easy.

                             KAPLAN
               Create a diversion.

     Snickers and Butterfinger calmly blow away both guards
     with silenced mini-Uzis.

     SOVIET GUARD FOUR rushes out a door before the agents,
     zipping up his fly.  Almond Joy twists his neck with an
     agonizing SNAP.

     THE LONG HALLWAY

     Hawk, Anna, and Alex retreat beneath the Lenin mural
     through the windowed double doors.

     Behind the doors, they poke up to see a BESPECTACLED
     GUARD emerge from the darkness to check out the door.

                             ALEX
               Now that's a lock.

                             HAWK
               Don't worry, we'll get it...

                             ANNA
               Can I sing this time, too?
               Please?

     Hawk and Alex are not thrilled about the idea, but Anna's
     eye flutter does it.

                             HAWK
               Uh, I guess so.

     The Bespectacled Guard moves back into the darkness.

     THE BALLROOM

     The Soviet V.I.P.'s open up presents of pink L.A. GEAR
     tennis shoes, silly T-shirts, and Nintendo joysticks
     as a standing Darwin hypnotizes them.

                             DARWIN
               I look at you Soviet people and I
               feel... pity... superiority.  Most
               of your life, your government has
               told you that Capitalism turns
               people into robots who'd rather
               eat microwave sushi, naked in the
               back of a Cadillac than hear the
               laughter of children.

                             MINERVA
                       (smiling)
               We're here to say, your government
               was right.

                             DARWIN
               So let's get busy.  Have some fun
               and make some deals.

     AT THE LOCK

     Alex holds a lit match into the lock, while Hawk
     does something incomprehensible with a screwdriver.
     They are improvising...

                             HAWK
               "Oh this lock is a pain in the bu-utt"

                             ALEX
               "How'd we ever get such in a ru-utt"

     Anna suddenly, booms out the chorus in a way that Hawk and
     Alex can barely concentrate.

                             ANNA
               "But we'll travel the road, Sharing
               the load.  Side by Side!"

     THE HALLWAY ABOVE

     The CIA team saunters through corpses up to a door
     similar in lock and design to the one Hawk and Alex
     are working on.

     Snickers's computer screen shows the blue light directly
     above the green light.

                             SNICKERS
               This is the room above the Art
               Treasures room.  The lock is a
               Natalya Z-Z, first created...

                             ALMOND JOY
               Snickers, baby, I love you like a
               brother, but really, who cares?
               Silencer bomb...

     Butterfinger pulls from around his shoulder a strange
     rifle.  He attaches to the front of it;, a glass encased,
     suctioning time-bomb from a waist satchel.  He fires
     the bomb against the door and it starts ticking.

     BEHIND THE WINDOWED DOUBLE DOORS

     come Hawk, Alex, and Anna, panting.

                             HAWK
               That was close....

                             ALEX
               Anna, I think you better stay....

                             HAWK
               You can be lookout!.....  Take
               Alex's gun.

     Alex hands Anna his gun, who glumly takes it like a Little
     Sister not allowed to play.  Hawk and Alex go back through
     the doors.

     THE HALLWAY ABOVE

     The CIA bomb blows up the door with a weird silencer
     sound.  Kaplan and the Candy Bars giddily whoop as they
     rush through the smoking door.

     THE BALLROOM--SECOND LEVEL

     Anna meanders across the second level muttering to herself
     in Italian and amusingly imitating Hawk's condescension.

                             ANNA
               "You can be the lookout."

     Anna suddenly moves past the pillar to see the Mayflowers
     and the V.I.P.S.  She gasps and hurls herself behind the
     second level railing.

     THE BALLROOM FLOOR

     A VERY DIGNIFIED SOVIET LEADER, in a SHIT HAPPENS baseball
     cap, addresses Darwin.

                             SOVIET LEADER
               Before we serve you "the main course,"
               hee, hee, we need to know specifics
               about what you can do for us.  We--

                             DARWIN
               Bluntness.  How amusingly Hungarian.
               Listen up, for reasons I don't want
               to get into, I recently had to close
               down a petroleum factory, but I'm
               going to re-build it here and
               Madonna's going to cut the ribbon!
               Frozen burritos in Leningrad.  1982
               fantasy.  1992 reality.

     THE LOCK OUTSIDE THE DOOR

     Hawk and Alex more frantically toil on the lock.

                             HAWK
               "We all had our quarrels and
               parted..."

                             ALEX
               "But we'll be the same as we started...

     The lock clunks open.  They race through the doors into...

     INT. THE ART TREASURE ROOM

     Hawk and Alex weave through the room which is crammed,
     with little nuance, to the gills with great art treasures
     including an impressive array of Faberge eggs.  A solid
     gold hammer and sickle hang on one wall...

                             HAWK AND ALEX
               "Just traveling along, singing a
               song.  Side--"

                             HAWK
               Geez, this place is a mess...

                             ALEX
               Voila...

     They rumble toward an opening in the wall of the room
     covered by a small curtain that has the Da Vinci Man in
     the Circle drawing emblazoned across it.  Hawk reaches
     for the curtain.  Alex puts his arm around him and speaks,
     not sings.

                             ALEX
               Side by side, man...

     Suddenly, the roof above them explodes.  Kaplan and the
     Candy Bars drop down behind them.

                             ALMOND JOY
               What the hell....

                             SNICKERS
               You're supposed to be dead!

                             ALEX
               I'm a ghost.  Boo.

                             HAWK
               I don't want to sound immature,
               but we were here first...

                             KAPLAN
               I wish I could think of those cute
               quips the way you can, Hawk, but
               I can't, so I'll just shoot Alex.

     Kaplan point blank shoots Alex in the chest.  Alex
     crumples backward, moaning.  Butterfinger, casually, but
     with incredible strength, holds Hawk's arms behind his
     back.

                             HAWK
               No....

                             ALMOND JOY
               That was pretty uncool, George...

                             KAPLAN
               Sorry, you know he kind of reminds
               me of Little Eddie.  But I digress.
               Ah, victory is so sweet....

     Kaplan pulls back the Da Vinci curtain.  Nothing is there.

     THE BALLROOM BANQUET

     A SOVIET CHEF lifts up a silver domed serving tray,
     revealing the Da Vinci helicopter model.

                             MINERVA
               Yum.  This is the best meal I
               ever had...

     ANNA

     bulges her eyes at the revelation.  She pulls out Alex's
     gun and bangs herself in the head.  What to do....

     THE ART TREASURES ROOM

     Kaplan is bugging out.

                             KAPLAN
               Damnit, this isn't the plan!
               Blue light, green light, shit!
               Snickers, Kit Kat, A.J., scramble,
               see if you can find out anything.

     They thunder out.  Hawk, still in Butterfinger's
     oblivious clutches, shouts..

                             HAWK
               Can't you see the Mayflowers
               double-crossed you...

                             KAPLAN
               They may be scum, but if I get the
               Da Vinci model back, then we'll be
               roasting weenies on the beach.

                             HAWK
               I don't think you'll appreciate
               their choice of weenie.

     Kaplan raises his gun.

     THE BALLROOM BANQUET

     Darwin holds the Da Vinci model in one hand and raises
     a glass of vodka in the other.

                             DARWIN
               You're helping us achieve a goal
               and in return, I'm giving you a
               key to the world's executive
               washroom.  Don't piss it away....
               Skoal, amigos...

                              ANNA (O.S.)
               Stop or I'll shoot.

     Minerva and some various Soviet VIPS spew their vodka to
     look up to Anna pointing a gun down at them from the
     second level.  She is shivering, shaking the gun.

                              ANNA
               You people are immoral and
               narcissitic and I won't let you...

     In unison, the Soviet Soldiers surrounding the table
     begin machine gunning up at her.  She dives behind the
     railing.

     THE ART TREASURES ROOM

     Kaplan lowers his gun.

                             KAPLAN
               I can't believe this.  I'm in
               fucking Russia, or do I have to
               say, the fucking Soviet Union and
               I'm shooting a non-Bolshevick.
                       (raising back up
                        his gun)
               I never thought I'd say "I'm just
               in this job for the money."  Sad.
               Any last immature quips?

                             HAWK
               No.
                       (a beat)
               But why do you let Butterfinger
               keep those blood stains on his
               shirt?

     Falling for the oldest trick in the book, Butterfinger
     looks down to his shirt.

                             BUTTERFINGER
               What blood stains....

     Hawk bounces up to savagely head-butt Butterfinger.
     Butterfinger slams back against a wall causing the Gold
     Sickle to fall down around his neck and knock him to the
     ground, pinning his head to the floor.  The Gold Hammer
     next trembles off the wall and crushes Butterfinger's
     skull.

                             HAWK
               You want immature, how 'bout an
               egg fight...

     Hawk flings a Faberge egg, smashing the gun out of Kaplan's
     hand.  Hawk pelts a batch more at him.  Kaplan sloppily
     whips some eggs back.  Hawk finally smashes one in half
     and beans the jagged piece into Kaplan's eye.  He squeals
     to the ground, geysering blood.

     Hawk swoops down to a wheezing, breath controlling Alex.

                             HAWK
               Alex, are you....

                             ALEX
               I can't believe you didn't notice.
               My weight.  I lost ten pounds in
               Rome

                              HAWK
               You're a reed, man.  I gotta get
               Anna.  Hang in there...

     THE BALLROOM

     Bullets stop splintering around Anna at the railing as
     the soldiers fling out their empty cartridges to reload.

     Snickers, Almond Joy, and Kit Kat race out of the hall-
     way area into the ballroom area.  They stop at the sight
     of Anna....

                             ALMOND JOY
               Anna-bannana-fo-fanna, I guess I
               have to cut out your heart for
               real now.  It's not personal.

     Anna feebly raises her gun.  Almond Joy laughs and
     pulls out a knife.

                             ALMOND JOY
               You won't shoot.  I read your
               dossier... Sister.

     The Soviet Soldiers snap in new cartridges as Almond Joy
     moves out from behind the pillar towards Anna.  The
     Soldiers blast away at this newly appearing figure.

     Almond Joy ruptures and vibrates in a Sonny Corleone
     ballet.

                             ALMOND JOY
               I gotta get a new job...

     Snickers and Kit Kat militarily roll on either side of
     Anna as their partner wilts to the ground.  The men,
     Snickers with his mini-Uzi, Kit Kat with his cross-
     bow rifle, briefly leap up to fire down at the soldiers
     with some graphic success.

     Anna watches Darwin and Minerva head up the stairs to
     her level.  She bolts off....

     BALLROOM FLOOR

     The last of the Soviet VIPS flee as the Soldiers tip
     over the M shaped table on its side, using it for
     cover, firing upward.

     KIT KAT

     breaks off and scurries around the second level to get
     a position behind the M.

     He fires down an arrow for a successful kill.  Another
     guard tries to fire up, but Kit Kat impales him to the
     back of the table with a quality shot.

     Kit Kat grins and reloads as Alfred, the butler, regally
     creeps behind him.

     HAWK

     comes out of the long hallway double doors up to where
     Anna is bustling.  They hug...

                             ANNA
               The Mayflowers got...

     Hawk and Anna turn to see the Mayflowers hastening in
     their direction.  Noticing them back, the model-toting
     Mayflowers halt.

     KIT KAT

     turns to Alfred and fires his crossbow.  Alfred effort-
     lessly cuts it in half with his blade and continues
     to move forward.  Still smiling, Kit Kat tries to reload.

     MINERVA

     breaks the standstill.

                             DARWIN
               What a pleasant surprise.  You're
               probably wondering...

                             HAWK
               But you're going to tell us
               anyway...

                             MINERVA
               I hate a man with a sense of
               humor.  While you corn dogs were
               comparing the lengths of your
               masculinity, we obtained the
               helicopter the new fashioned
               way: a thoroughly corrupt business
               deal.

                             HAWK
               If you think you're getting past
               me...

     Grunting behind them, Snickers gun-butts Hawk to the
     ground.

                             HAWK
               Don't be stupid...they...

                             SNICKERS
               Bastard!  If you were a true
               American.

                             HAWK
               Just shut up and hit me!

     Snickers swings a punch.  Hawk blocks it then whomps
     him in the chest.

     As they battle, Darwin grabs Anna's hair, slams her
     into a pillar, and watches her crumple.

     KIT KAT

     gets in an arrow but it's too late.  Alfred stabs
     him deep, deep, deeply, and lifts him from the ground.

     A shower of cards reading "OUCH" "PAIN" and "THIS REALLY
     HURTS" rain from out of Kit Kat's coat.

     Alfred discards him over the edge.

     Kit Kat sails down upon the M.

     The lone card of "FUCK" plops from his open eyed corpse.

     HAWK

     and Snickers trades fierce blows, stumbling down a
     staircase.

     DARWIN

     and Minerva watch the fight with amusement.  Alfred
     approaches.

                             DARWIN
               Alfred, the getaway car...

     SNICKERS

     slashes Hawk in the arm with a small but sinister blade.

                             HAWK
               Damnit, I hate this!  I'm a cat
               burglar!  Nobody said anything
               about this fight-to-the-death
               shit.

                             SNICKERS
               Too bad.

     Snickers goes for a final thrust when suddenly one of the
     silencer time bombs suctions to his head.

     Hawk turns to see Alex, barely standing, at the top of
     the stairs, holding the strange rifle.

     Darwin and Minerva turn to this dramatic entrance.  They
     start to trot off...

                             MINERVA
               I knew it!  I told you it was a
               fake.

                             DARWIN
               That New-York-Italian-Father-
               made-twenty-bucks-a-week-son-
               of-a-bitch.  What was our bet?  A
               million?

                             MINERVA
               Million five, lover...

     HAWK

     boots Snickers down the stairs.  Snickers somersaults
     up and frantically tries to pull off the bomb.

     Snickers wails to the soldiers, who have lowered their
     guns and are poking their heads out of the M to watch.

                             SNICKERS
               Help me you Democratic Reform
               lovers!  Get a screwdriver, you
               Stupid Eskimoes!  Screw-dri-ver!
               Oh God, I always wanted to know
               how to play the harp, there
               just was so little time!  Rosebud!

     The soldiers high-tail it out.  Snickers plugs his ears.
     Nothing happens.

                             SNICKERS
               Maybe it was just a....

     Snickers blows up gloriously before the M.

     THE STAIRCASE

     Hawk bounds up to Alex, who puffs down onto the steps.

                             ALEX
               Get 'em.  They went down the
               hallway.

                             HAWK
               Let's just forget it, I mean...

                             ALEX
               Get em....

     Hawk rushes up the. stairs, gives a "What can I do?" glance
     to the unconscious Anna, and then continues rushing, past
     a pillar.  Minerva emerges from behind the pillar and
     moves forward.

     THE LONG ENIGMATIC HALLWAY

     Hawk chugs beneath the Lenin mural and down the hall-
     way.  He sees Darwin breezing in front of him.  Darwin
     looks back to Hawk then runs forward into the darkness.

     THE BALLROOM

     Minera sits down next to the pained Alex.

                             MINERVA
               Alex.  How's it going?

                             ALEX
               Go, go to Hell, to Hell.

     Minerva pulls out a candy bar and rips it open.

                             MINERVA
               Where's your insulin....No?  Well,
               Bon Appetite.

     Minerva savagely slams Alex's head down and shoves the
     candy bar in his mouth.

     THE HALLWAY

     Hawk moves closer and closer to the darkness of the
     hallway when a one-eyed and bleeding George Kaplan dives
     out of the Art Treasures room and tackles him.  Hawk
     kicks him off...

                             HAWK
               Oh, come on....

     THE BALLROOM

     Alex gulps down the last of the candy bar, shivering.

                             MINERVA
               Very good, Alex, but you re
               still alive....

     She pulls out another candy bar.  Alex, with a last
     burst of strength, punches her across the face.

                             MINERVA
               That's fair.

     THE LONG HALLWAY

     Hawk and Kaplan lock onto each other's throats.

                             HAWK
               Why does this have to be so hard...

                             KAPLAN
               Tell me about it...

     Suddenly, of all things, a car is heard rumbling in the
     darkness.

     Hawk and Kaplan stop fighting and turn to see THE MAY-
     FLOWER LIMOUSINE screeching out of the darkness with
     Darwin standing out of the sunroof firing a gun.

     Bullets fly around them.  From his back pocket, Hawk
     slaps the nice picture of him and Little Eddie into
     Kaplan's hands.

                             HAWK
               Take this to Hell with you...

     Hawk jumps up and grabs a hanging lamp.

     Deranged with confusion, Kaplan turns from the picture
     to the charging limousine.

                             KAPLAN
               My pension.....

     The driving Alfred smiles through the windshield.

     Kaplan's body slams into a vivid somersaulting crash
     into the windshield.

     Hawk's hands burn and sizzle on the hanging lamp.

     Passing beneath, Darwin raises up his gun.

     Hawk lets go of the lamp and drops down on Darwin,
     locking his legs around his neck and crushing him
     down into....

     THE BACKSEAT OF THE LIMOUSINE

     Hawk and Darwin grapple on the floor of the limo.  The
     Da Vinci helicopter model bobs on the backseat.  Darwin's
     gun goes off..

     right through Alfred's throat.  He slumps over, pressing
     down on the accelerator.

     THE LIMOUSINE

     blasts down the hallway, sparking off the wall, and
     bashing off paintings and mirrors.

     THE BACKSEAT

     Darwin flicks on his paper shredder and shoves the side
     of Hawk's hand into its teeth.

     OUTSIDE THE LIMOUSINE

     A mist of blood coughs out of the shredder vent and makes
     a weird bloody line across the wall.

     INT. BACKSEAT

     Hawk yanks his hand from the shredder and grabs the meg-
     lomaniac by the hair and shoves his head down on the
     arm rest.  Hawk turns on the piercing siren and Darwin's
     eyes try to escape his head with a high pitched scream.
     Darwin's entire body bucks wildly.

     Darwin back-elbows Hawk and moves down for his gun.
     Hawk pulls him back by his hair, grabs him by the balls,
     and pushes him upward through the sunroof.

                             DARWIN
               God-damnit, I only wanted to
               destroy the world in my own image.
               I'm a regular Joe...

     Darwin pounds his fists on Hawk's head as Hawk hits the
     sunroof switch sliding it shut on Darwin, pinning
     his arms below the roof, but leaving his torso twisting
     in the wind.

     The mural of a happy Lenin with his arms outstretched
     looms ahead waiting to greet Darwin.

     Putting two and two together, Darwin loses it....

                             DARWIN
               Not Lenin, anybody but Lenin.  God,
               let's talk abut this.

     The limousine charges through the double doors and Darwin's
     body connects with the mural.

     INSIDE THE LIMO

     Hearing the crunch, Hawk flips into the front seat and
     brakes the vehicle.  Alfred's head bounces against the
     steering wheel.  Hawk reaches over with a grin and picks
     up the Da Vinci model.  He looks to Alfred, Kaplan
     crunched in the windshield, and Darwin's dangling legs.

                             HAWK
               Wow, this is really gonna hurt the
               resale value...

     THE BALLROOM

     Hawk runs up to a woozy Anna and helps her up.  She has
     a cross-shaped blood stain on her forehead.

                             HAWK
               Oh, honey....

     Hawk looks to Alex, sitting on the stairs, the same way
     he left him.  Hawk rushes to him.

                             HAWK
               We did it man, we...

     Hawk grabs Alex's shoulder.  Alex falls back.  Written
     over his face in red lipstick is REALLY DEAD.

     Engaging a slow motion sequence, Minerva saunters behind
     Anna, putting on red lipstick.  Minerva slams her back
     to the ground.

     Hawk howls then turns to see stiff-upper-lip Alfred,
     bleeding from the neck.  Hawk tries to throw a punch,
     but Alfred blocks it and crunches him across the face.

     The Da Vinci helicopter model bounces down the stairs
     in slow motion and cracks open, revealing the intricate
     mirror of the opening scene.

     INT. DARK ROOM ATOP MAYFLOWER MUSEUM--DAY

     A damaged Hawk awakens in a dungeonish room and stumbles
     to some shutters.  "O Solo Mio" returns on the sound-
     track as the shutters open to a postcard view of Vinci.

     Hawk closes the shutters and cuts off the music.  A
     slightly more composed Anna touches his shoulder causing
     him to jump slightly.  They melt into a kiss.

                             ANNA
               Oh Hudson...

                             HAWK
               I told you not to call me Hudson.
               The only people who called me that
               were the nuns at...

                             ANNA
               Oh Hudson, I'm a sister of the
               Catholic church as well as an
               agent.

                             HAWK
                       (cut-off laugh)
               This is too bad to be false.

     Alfred enters the room in his favorite outfit with a
     bandage around his neck.  His voice is strange, but still
     polite.

                             ALFRED
               Welcome back to Vinci.

                             HAWK
               Last rites, sister?

                             ANNA
               Please, no nun jokes...They're a
               bad habit to get into....get it?

     Hawk and Anna unconvincingly laugh then sadly pause.

                              HAWK
               She killed Alex.

     Alfred gives them a push.

     INT. THE DA VINCI WORKSHOP

     Alfred leads them through the Da Vinci workshop past the
     bat winged glider and incongruously crammed-in tennis ball
     machine.

     INT. THE ROOM OF THE GOLD MACHINE--DAY

     Alfred grandly opens double-doors to reveal that Da
     Vinci's gold machine has been majestically re-created
     piece by piece.  In the periphery, the 90's rears its
     head in the form of THREE TECHNICIANS wearing headsets
     and gun holsters who consult computer terminals.

                              MINERVA (O.S.)
               GOLD-FI-ING-ER!

     Hawk and Anna turn to see Minerva splashily enter in
     sexy funeral-wear.

                              MINERVA
               Sorry, I couldn't resist.  You're
               probably wondering why you're
               still alive.  Anna.....

     As Minerva speaks, TECHNICIAN ONE forcibly escorts Anna
     toward a stand near the gold machine and tightly
     handcuffs her to it.

                              MINERVA
               I want you to monitor the Da
               Vinci's directions from the
               apprentice diary.  And Hawk, I
               didn't want you to go to hell
               without knowing that Darwin and
               I's dream came true.
                       (suddenly sheepish)
               Beside that, none of us can seem
               to put that damn crystal together.
               Alfie and I were up all night with
               the thing.

     TECHNICIAN TWO commences a forcible escort of Hawk to the
     gold machine.  Hawk cold-cocks him to the ground.

                              HAWK
               You killed a friend.  Why should I
               help you go for the gold?

                              MINERVA
               It'll take a couple of years of
               steady production, but I'll flood
               the market with so much gold that
               gold itself, the foundation of all
               finance, will lose its meaning.
               Brokers, economists, and fellow
               entrepreneurs will drown in the
               saliva of their own nervous
               breakdowns.  Markets will crash-
               crash.  Financial Empires will
               crumble-crumble.

                              HAWK
               Except yours-yours.  The goal of
               world domination.  Well, if you
               put it that way, Minnie.  How can
               I resist?

                              MINERVA
               You can't, convict!  You're just
               a shmoe!  Every shmoe has the
               fantasy the planet revolves around
               them.  It rains, car crash stops
               traffic, you say "How could this
               happen to me?"  It's a natural
               inclination.  But for I, this
               isn't a fantasy, it is reality!
               You are on my planet!  You walk
               around the corner for coffee, out
               of my sight, you do not fucking
               exist!  The lives of shmoes like
               you have meaning only in relation
               to the rich, to the powerful, to ME!

     Anna looks at the oil cloth diary before her.  She pulls
     a compact from her pocket and holds the compact mirror
     over the scribblings.  Reading off the reflection, her
     eyes widen.

                              ANNA
               Do it.  There's no reason to fight
               anymore.  She's a force of nature.

     Trying to get a grip on Anna's words, Hawk lets himself
     be escorted to another stand before the gold machine that
     has the two complex crystal parts and the weird mirror.

                              MINERVA
               If you pull this off, I can't
               promise I won't kill you.  I mean,
               who we trying to kid?  But I will
               spare the Flying Nun here....

                              HAWK
               And to think I thought you were
               Evil Incarnate in pumps.

                              MINERVA
               I killed some lovable working
               class Italian-diabetic, but you
               killed the most significant male
               figure of the decade and a kind,
               gentle lover.  So don't play with
               me.

     Minerva flicks a switch on the stand Anna's handcuffed
     to.  Anna vibrates, being electrocuted.

                              HAWK
               Okay, fine!

     Minerva switches it off.  Giving himself a head rub, Hawk
     bears down on the three oddly malleable objects.  He
     TANGLES and BENDS and with a loud SNAP, puts them
     together, forming the Crystal from the opening scene.
     Minerva snatches it from him and puts on a head-set.

                              MINERVA
               Oh Hawk, don't ever change.  Go,
               team, go!

     Minerva giddily sets the crystal in the same place as Da
     Vinci had it in his machine.

     Using a long steel pole, Technician One adjusts a myriad
     of mirrors so they are in a proper angle with a series
     of lenses culminating on the top of the machine.

     Technicians Two (black-eyed) and Three pour various
     chemical powders and liquids into corresponding compart-
     ments on the machine, beautifully decorated by the
     chemical's zodiac sign.

     Alfred places a lead bar in its proper place.

     Hawk glides to Anna and undoes her handcuff.

                              HAWK
               I hope you know what....

                              ANNA
               Trust Leonardo....

                              HAWK
               Wha.....

     Anna puts her fingers on his lips.

     Minerva throws a lever.  Steam begins to percolate from
     the furnace towards the machine.

                              MINERVA
                       (into the headset)
               We're for real.

     THE MACHINE

     begins to rotate, at first clunkily, then faster.
     The Crystal rotates comfortably in its compartment.

     The machine throws out its folding arms, each with an
     element.  The arms click higher.

     The goggled technicians stand before a time-coded video
     monitor, taking notes.

     The chemical housings open and the chemicals begin to
     spill and drop through brass tubes.

     ANNA

     murmurs to Hawk.

                              ANNA
               Da Vinci made the real directions
               in a secret script that I decoded.
               The way the machine is running
               now, the gold will produce too
               quickly, clog, and the machine
               will shut itself down.  Isn't it
               wonderful?

                              HAWK
               Yeah, but what would happen if that
               little mirror came out of the
               crystal.

                              ANNA
               Wha -- you don't want to know...

     Hawk pulls out the mirror from his pocket.

                              HAWK
               I wanna know...

                              ANNA
               Holy sh-h--things are going to
               get very interesting, very fast.
               Da Vinci would be proud of you.

     IN THE MACHINE

     The chemicals snake down their individual paths to the
     Lead Bar spinning its trough.  There's a FLASH and a
     controlled but jarring explosion.

     EVERYONE

     doubletakes.  Hawk reaches down to the six foot steel
     pole and with one swing slams the faces of all three
     deep in concentration Technicians to the ground.

     Oblivious to the violence behind her, Minerva, pulling
     on goggles over her head-set, moves closer with a
     religious purr.

     THE MACHINE

     triggers a fresnel lens and laserlike beams bounce around
     the mirrors faster and faster, circling the room.

     OUTSIDE THE MACHINE

     Hawk and Anna squint, blinded.  Flinging off her goggles,
     A literally beaming Minerva giggles forward.

     THE MACHINE

     Beams of light converge on the top mirror and bounce into
     the innards of the machine with a mighty roar!

     MINERVA

     sees that the center of the machine gleams yellowish and
     molten.  She moves closer, shouting into her head-set.

                              MINERVA
               Eureka, motherfuckers!

     The machine thunders and spins at a more aggressive
     pace.

     Hawk's voice suddenly comes on Minerva's head-set.

                              HAWK'S VOICE (head-set)
               Minnie, hate to interrupt your
               orgasm, but....

     HAWK AND ANNA

     stand above the unconscious Technicians.  Hawk is on
     head-set.

                              HAWK
               Me, Anna, and Leonardo just wanna
               say you got the Midas touch, baby...

     MACHINE

     Minerva turns toward the machine in anger and confusion.

     The center of the machine blows.  The pool of molten gold
     rockets at the viewer.

     Mirrors explode and the lasers slash at the walls.

     Minerva tumbles from the machine, screaming, that is to
     say, trying to scream, because molten gold covers her
     face.  It bubbles and cascades, turning her into a
     bizarrely beautiful echo of Nefertiti.

     HAWK AND ANNA

     turn to retreat, and see, standing in the mouth of the
     open double doors, in an open shirt, wearing Indian war
     paint on his face and the words RULE BRITANNIA painted
     on his chest, ALFRED!

                              ALFRED
               How.

                              HAWK
               You're unemployed, Alfie.  Boss
               is dead.  Her plan is over.

                              ALFRED
                       (strange voiced)
               My plan is just beginning.  I'll
               forgive you for denying me the
               pleasure of slaughtering my
               boorish employers, but I'm afraid
               the birth of the new British
               Empire can have no witnesses!

                              HAWK
               Ooh-kay...

     Alfred rushes forward with a howl.  Hawk meets him
     halfway.  They trade savage punches and then lock onto
     each other's throats.

     Anna pulls a gun from a technician's holster and prays
     for forgiveness.  She aims steadily, and fires...

     right into Hawk's arm.  This allows Alfred to knock him
     back with a strong punch.

                              ANNA
               Sorry!

     She fires again.  The bullet pings off Hawk's belt buckle.

                              HAWK
               Stop helping me!  Thou shalt not
               kill!

     Hawk's turning to chastize Anna, allows Alfred to kick
     Hawk back against a wall.  Alfred lunges out with his
     blade, hitting the wall off-angle.  Hawk yanks the shaft.
     Alfred goes with the flow and presses the shaft on Hawk's
     throat.

     Gasping, Hawk looks to a rip in Alfred's shirt and sees
     a hinge and lever on the shaft.  With an all or nothing
     jerk, Hawk flicks the lever.  The shaft clicks on the
     hinge.

     Alfred's greater strength and narrower grip makes it fold
     away from Hawk and suddenly it is Alfred's throat which
     is caught in the V-shaped trap!  The momentum of the
     sudden change makes Alfred stumble towards the wall until
     the point of the "V" hits it--

                              HAWK
               Don't lose your head over this.

     Hawk takes the six foot steel pole and gives a Babe Ruth
     swing right onto the V.  The blades slam together and
     POP ALFRED'S HEAD OFF, SENDING IT SCREAMING DISEMBODIED,
     HIGH IN THE AIR.

     ALFRED'S SCREAMING HEAD P.O.V.

     Hawk and Anna are seen waving up to the viewer (Alfie's
     head).

                              HAWK
               Excuse my crass American humor.

     The machine thunders with another explosion.

     THE DA VINCI WORKSHOP

     Hawk and Anna rush into the Da Vinci workshop.  She
     guiltily touches the surface wound on his arm.  He
     delicately takes the gun from her and laughs until he
     sees...

     BUNNY THE DOG!! standing in the open mouth of the
     workshop.  Anna turns to Hawk...

                              ANNA
               Allow me.

     Anna confidently moves toward the dog until Bunny leaps
     up and savagely clamps his teeth into her throat sending
     her crashing to the ground.

     Hawk pauses in disbelief before raising the gun.

     Bunny continues to viciously gnaw away on the convulsing
     Anna, blood gently starts to emerge.

     Hawk can't get off a shot.  He throws down the gun in
     exasperation.  It lands next to The Gadget that is
     connected to the Tennis Ball Machine.  Hawk rushes
     forward, picks up the gadget, turns the dial to Ten, and
     then smiles sweetly toward the dog.

                              HAWK
               Oh Bunny, Ball-Ball.

     Bunny stops his violent behavior and perkily looks up
     blood droplets drizzling from his mouth.

     Hawk slams down on the gadget.

     A tennis ball comes rocketing out of the machine.

     Bunny leaps and catches the rocketing ball but the force
     of it sends him FLYING AND CRASHING out a window.

     Hawk pulls up Anna as the machine completely EXPLODES.

     A huge chunk of the roof THUDS before the workshop door.

     Hawk suddenly looks off-camera and smiles.  Anna shakes
     her head vigorously.  He pulls her out of the frame.

     EXT. A VINCI COUNTRYSIDE TREE

     A man awakens from a nap and pulls up his hat.  It is THE
     TRAVELING JUGGLER WITH THE UNFORGETTABLY ETCHED FACE.

     He pulls his three red balls from a pouch on his mule.
     He begins a stoic juggle when another loud BOOM sends him
     to the ground.

     EXT. OUTSIDE THE GRAND CASTLE--DAY

     An explosion of steam and gas blows out the windows!
     Debris frisbees toward the camera along with....

     Anna, hanging on Hawk's waist, and Hawk, hanging from
     the bar on DA VINCI'S BAT WINGED GLIDER.

     The glider gracefully swooshes down through the castle -
     through the glorious vista.

     EXT. THE ROAD TO THE CASTLE

     The glider floats to a perfect landing before the
     Unforgettable Juggler.

                             JUGGLER
                         Che pazzo....

     Hawk and Anna collect themselves and look up to the smoke
     billowing castle.  They smile and gush in relief.  They
     wrap arms around the confused but warming up Juggler and
     laugh again.

     A SMALL PIAZZA

     The mule trots into a small storybook piazza in the hush
     of dawn.  Hawk, Anna, and the unforgettable Juggler ride
     atop it.

     A WOMAN WITH AN UNFORGETTABLY ETCHED FACE moves to a cafe
     table with a luminous smile.  She unfolds a table cloth
     atop it and then mystically sets down two cappuccinos.

     Hawk and Anna dismount, thank the Juggler, then cozy into
     the table.

                             HAWK
               Have I ever told you the world is
               beautiful...
                       (semi-seductively)
               I'd really like to play
               Nintendo with you, or something...

                             ANNA
               Hudson, I'm afraid I'm sticking
               with God.
                       (smiling)
               But you're a close second, tough
               guy.  What is that smile?

                             HAWK
                       (broadly grinning)
               I got my planet back.

     Hawk puts on a pair of sunglasses that look exactly like
     the ones Da Vinci wore in the opening and raises his cup.

                             HAWK
               The first one's for Alex.  Cheers.

     The viewer's viewpoint moves into Hawk's lips having a
     sip of that damn unmasculine European coffee.

                                                FADE OUT.

          FOUR MONTHS LATER...   
                         

                         

                         FADE IN

          A BARREN LANDSCAPE
          beneath slate-grey sky. Frigid rock and stunted trees fall to an
          ice-choked coast. Congealed sea on a desolate beach.

          MARKO ALEXANDROVICH RAMIUS
          bare-headed in cold wind, studies the inclement coast. Bottomless
          eyes move slowly across the landscape, missing nothing.

          SUPER: POLWARNY INLET
          Soviet Submarine Base on the Barents Sea
          500 mi north of Murmansk
          Ramius wears a tar black winter uniform of Captain First Rank in
          the Soviet Navy. Behind him, out of sight, someone SPEAKS:

                         VOICE (OS)
          Cold this morning, Captain.
          Ramius shivers. When he replies, he speaks not about the weather,
          but of the land:

                         RAMIUS
          It is cold.

                         (BEAT)-
          And hard.
          Turning his back on the icy coast, Ramius smi-I fondly at the man
          who just spoke to him

          CAPTAIN SECOND., RANK VASILY BORODIN
          Ramius' executive officer, also in black uniform. Borodin's rigged
          with a mike. , Brass .buttons gambol in his Nubian cap like money.

                         RAMIUS (CONT'D)
          e your head a bit. No need to
          crowd him.

                         BORODIN

                         (INTO MIKE)
          Come left three degrees. Make your
          course three-four-zero. Sonar, let
          me know when we pass fifty, fathoms.
          A HELMSMAN responds on a SPEAKER in the SAIL. Nautical CROSS
          TALK. Orders GIVEN and AFFIRMED. Pulling back, Ramius and
          Borodin are revealed standing atop

                         

                         

                         

                         

          THE RED OCTOBER
          a huge submarine, trading a gigantic rudder a hundred yards aft
          her sail. A patrol BOAT and ICEBREAKER escort her to sea. On

                         (GLANCING AT

                         BORODIN)
          Granted.

                         BORODIN
          (under his breath)
          Think of it, Comrade.. .son of only a
          humble mM worker...

                         RAMIUS
          Quiet as grass, Vastly. Quiet as grass.
          (louder, turning)
          Good morning, Comrade political off=er

          IVAN YURIEVICH PUTIN
          block-faced, forties, pink-necked, political officer assigned to Red
          October, clambers through the hatch into the air, wheezing:

                         PUTIN
          Ah,, Captain, every time I climb that
          ladder, I realize what an over-fed
          ox rve become.
          Put in smiles. Ramius smiles back, but his eyes are cold. Suddenly,
          there's not a lot of Lave on the bridge:

                         PUTIN (CONT'D)

                         (EXPANSIVELY)
           Such a glorious day. So exciting to
          h t ally put the land behind us and

          father was only a mill. worker. Think
          of it, comrades, a mill worker.
          Borodin CHUCKLES. Putin stares at him. Borodin covers with a

                         

                         

                         

                         
          COUGH. Putin keeps starring. Flushed, Borodin looks away. Putin
          turns porcine eyes on Ramius:

                         PUTIN (CONT'D)

                         (TURNING)
          Your father was a Lithuanian, was
          he not, Captain?

                         RAMIUS
          You know he was.

                         PU TIN
          I knew a Lithuanian once...
          His words hang like rotten fru

          ...though I'm sure your father was
          nothing like him. Pefmisrdon to go
          below?
          Smirking, Putin leaves. Ramius watches him go. SPEAKERS in the

          it's time, Captain.
          St M dealing with Putin's exit, Ramius turns away from the hatch,
          contemplating the shore. After a beat, softly:.

                         RAMIUS
          We go.

          Ramius and. Borodin disappear. Red October prepares to dive. All
          that remains is icy .sea and the Sand. Then, faintly at first, from
          the frozen coast:

          A RED ARMY CHORUS
          rises into the swirling sky. It seems to come from everywhere, the
          rocks, the trees, the sea itself. Red October dives. The screen
          fades to black and a giant title appears:

                         A LITHOGRAPH
          of John Paul Jones fighting the Serapis appears. It's on the wall. in
          a cluttered study. Books crowd every bit of space. Photos, models
          and nautical memorabilia, everywhere.

          THROUGH A WINDOW
          an English suburb in drizzling rain. Red Army CHORUS SINGS
          SOFTLY. In a driveway, a late model ROVER waits, lights on,
          engine running. At a messy desk

                         JACK RYAN
          early-thirties, good-Looking, disheveled and harried, stuffs papers
          into a brief case. Slamming it shut, he reaches for his raincoat.

                         BEHIND HIM

          A LITTLE GIRL
          appears in the doorway. Her name is Sally. She's Ryan's
          daughter. Wearing a nightgown with butterflies on it, she's
          carrying a well-worn Koala bear:

                         SALLY

          Chief of the Boat, a barrel-chested bear, smiles at Beaumont:

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         COB
          He gets to raggin you too bad, kid,
          you can always ask him about Pavarattt..
          Jones sinks into his chair. Beaumont grins. Sea story coming.
          From the look on Jones' face, it promises to be a good one:

                         BEAUMONT
          Tell me, Chief.

                         COB
          (taking his time)
          Well, Jonesy here, he's a music freak,
          right? And he figures this sonar system
          is basically just a big old 300 million
          ddllar stereo unit. So he gets this
          piece of Pavarmt3i --

                         JONES
          it was Paganini.

                         COB
          Whatever. It's this piece of music he
          likes so much he wants to share it,
          right? So he re-wires the computer and
          figures how to put it in the water with
          a gigawatt of juice behind it.

                         (BEAT)
          Now, the Captain, he don't much care.
          But about twenty-one boats out of San
          Diego, including one way out at Pearl,
          starts hearing Pavarotti Doming out their
          ass. Jonesy has turned the whole fucking
          Pacific Ocean into a stereo speaker.

                         (LAUGHING)
          And all of a sudden we got an Admiral
          in the middle of it and we're writing
          reports out the yang yang.
          Beaumont's LAUGHS. Even Jones sm Ies. Then, a flashing light on
          the. sonar display catches his eye. He starts flipping switches.
          Beaumont sobers:: up:

                         BEAUMONT
          What should I --

                         JONES
          Be sti 1, I got it.
          Jones works in silence, then punches the intervom:

                         JONES
          Conn, sonar.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         VOICE

                         (ON INTERCOM)
          Captain, aye. What is it Jonesy?

                         JONES
          Distant contact, submerged bearing zero-
          nine-seven. It's a wild guess, but I'd
          say we had a Boomer headed out of the barn.

          IN THE COMMAND CENTER
          forward of sonar, sailers drive the ship beneath a maze of pipes and
          equipment. At the center of the Conn, surrounded by fire control,
          quartermaster, helm :

          CAPTAIN BARTOLOMO MANCUSO
          skipper of the DaZa, early-forties, muscular body encased in a blue
          jumpsuit, works the intercom on the periscope plat6arm:

                         MANCUSO
          Start a plot, Jonesy. IM be there
          in a second.
          Leaving the deck, Mancuso glances at his executive offker

          LIEUTENANT PHIL THOMPSON
          thirties, dark complected, standing at fire control:

                         MANCUSO (CONT'D)
          I'91 be in sonar, PhiL

                         IN SONAR
          Jones is already working on the plot. In font of him on the sonar
          display, the flashing light is starting to move. Mancuso sticks his
          head in.

                         MANCUSO
          What do you have?

                         CUT TO:

                         RAMIUS
          in Red October's Conn. Much larger than the control center on the
          Dallas. Leaving the deck, Ramius heads aft, glancing at Borodin:

                         RAMIUS
          When you see Putin, tell him that when
          it's convenient, 191 be in my stateroom.
          Leaving the Conn, Ramius enters

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         A HALLWAY
          Moving past a radio compartment on his left, Ramius stops at a door,

                         ENTERING THE

                         CAPTAIN'S STATEROOM
          C3osing the door behind him, Ramius turns into the room.
          Surprised, he sees

                         PU TIN
          seated at a desk, reading a bible. Startled, Putin looks up:

                         RAMIUS
          What are you doing?

                         PT TIN
          It's my responsibility to oversee the
          stability of the crew, Captain. You
          know that.

                         RAMIUS
          And you accomplish this by searching
          through my papers and invading my
          privacy?

                         PUTIN
          There is no such thing as privacy in
          the Soviet Union, Comrade. It's
          antithetical to the oal]ective good.
          Suppressing his anger, Ramius moves to a locker, changing into
          dungarees. He can fiee]. Putin's weasel eyes crawling up and down
          his back. Holding the bible, Put in muses:

                         PUTIN (CONT'D)
          You. surprise me, Captain. A man in your
          position reading trash about the end of
          the world.

                         (READING)
          "I am coming soon. I will give to each
          according to his deeds. I am the
          beginning and the end."

                         (GLANCING UP)
          Did you underline these passages?

                         RAMIUS
          The book belonged to my wife. I
          keep it only for sentimental value.

                         PUTIN
          Your wife was a beautiful woman. A
          tragedy her life was cut so short.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         RAMIUS

                         (TURNING)
          I assure you, Comrade. There's
          nothing wrong with my mind.

                         PUTIN
          (trying to joke)
          Given the amount of fire power on Red
          October, I'm sure the whole world will.
          breathe a cm1 eotive sigh of relief.

                         RAMIUS

                         (LKE ICE)
          How many more agents does the KGB
          have on my boat?

                         PUTIN

                         (STANDING)
          Captain, this is not your boat. It
          belongs to the Union of the Soviet
          Socialist Republics. You would be
          well advised to remember that.

                         (RAMIUS BLANCHES)
          Anyway, I am only a political odfioer.
          If the KGB has an agent on board,
          I would be the last to know.

                         RAMIUS
          I suggest we open our orders.

                         PUTIN
          As you wish.
          There's a safe on the wall. Ramius spins the combination. Inside,
          another safe with four locks. Both Ramius and Putin have keys.
          Inside the second safe, a large envelope.
          it has an ornate. scarlet seal, marked 'Top Secret'. Ramius cracks
          the seeal, removing four pages of operation orders. Glancing at
          Putin; he reads:

                         RAMIUS
          We are to proceed to grid 54-90 and
          rendezvous with the Akula submarine,
          Konovalov.

                         PUTIN
          Captain Tupalev's boat.

                         RAMIUS
          You know Tupolav?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         PU TIN
          I know that he is descended from a long
          line of aril rats and that he was a
          student of yours. it is rumored, he
          has no love in his heart for you. Why
          is that?
          Ramius pours two cups of steaming tea from a silver pot on a
          serving tray, offering it to Putin.. Putin takes the cup.

                         RAMIUS
          There is no room in Tupolev's heart
          for anyone or anything except Tupolev.

                         (READING)
          Having made contact, we are ordered
          to run a series of drfl1 . Tupolev
          w2l hunt us while we test our ship.
          Putting down his tea, Putin stands, suddenly formal, awkwardly

                         OBSEQUIOUS:

                         PUTIN
          Captain, this is an historic moment
          for all. of us. I should like to make
          a request.

                         RAMIUS
          Before you do, I want to talk to you
          about something important.

                         PUTIN

                         (NOT HEARING)
          I know that it is not aooording to
          protocxrl, but would you permit me to
          post the orders and inform the crew
          of our mission?

                         RAMIUS

                         (RESIGNED)
          As you wash, Comrade.
          Putin grins, heading for the door. He never makes it. In a sudden
          violent motion,, Ramius kicks Putin's left leg from under him.
          Surprised, the; big man tumbles sideways.
          Leaping to his feet, Ramius catches Putin, slamming him into a
          headlock, driving his thick neck downward, CRACKING his SKULL
          in the SHARP corner of the DESK.
          Putin gags. Cupping his chin, Ramius forces his entire bulk onto
          the man's chest. Putin struggles. His eyes bulge. Ramius strains,
          using all of his strength until..

                         

                         

                         

                         

          PUTIN'S NECK SHATTERS
          and his face goes slack. With surprising gentleness, Ramius lowers
          the shuddering body to the deck. Carefully, he checks the pulse in
          Putin's neck. Dying, Putin stares into Ramius' face.

                         RAMIUS (CONT'D)
          I an sorry my friend. But it is
          cyear to me now. Where I would
          walk, you cannot fallow.
          Whatever his destination, Putin's on his way. Getting up, Ramius
          goes to the desk. Returning with the teapot, he drenches the body
          with scalding tea.
          Replacing the pot on the tray, Ramius puts the orders in a
          wastebasket and sets them on are. Removing a duplicate set of
          orders from his safe, he' places them on the floor by the dead man.
          Satisfied everything is the way he wants it, he moves to an intercom
          and takes a deep breath. Pushing a button, he BELLOWS:

                         RAMIUS (CONT'D)

          I thought, I heard singing, sir.

                         MANCUSO
          Singing?
          Jones nods. Hairs stand up on the back of Mancuso's neck:

          What makes you think she hasn't?
          Tupolev glides to a quartermaster's station. Following him,
          Bonavia's stomach growls.

                         TUPOLEV
          Has it occurred to you that Red October
          may already be in position? That Ramius
          is merely hiding behind his silent drive?
          Waiting for me to break radio silence

          I will not break radio silence. We

          Left alone, Ryan spot, a lectern at the foot of the tabl. Nearby, a

                         RYAN
          Gentlemen, the last twenty four hours
          have seen some extraordinary Soviet
          naval activity. The first to sail was --

                         (SLIDE)
          this ship, the Red October. A variant
          of the typhoon class, she's some six
          hundred fifty feet long. Thirty-two
          thousand tons submerged displacement,
          roughly the size of a World War II
          aircraft Carrier.

                         (BEAT)
          Unlike the standard typhoon, equipped
          to fire long-range missiles from Russian
          waters, Red October carries fifty-six
          SS-311s, which is a short-range attack
          mis it with eight independent warheads.
          That's four hundred forty-eight warheads
          all spedfically designed to fire close in.

                         (ANOTHER SLIDE)
          We believe these doors on the bow, and
          here again on the stern, enclose a
          magneto-hydrodynamic drive, or caterpillar,
          which may allow the sub to run totally
          silent.

                         (ANOTHER SLIDE)
          it is possible this new drive system
          allowed the captain, a man named Marko

                         RAMIUS -
          Ryan points out two photos on a bulletin board. One is of Ramius
          alone. The other is a wedding photo of Ramius and a beautiful
          woman.

                         RYAN (CONT'D)
          to elude one of ' our attack boats,
          the Dallas, which trailed Red October
          f r om harbor this morning.

                         (POINTKUY)
          This drive, if it's working, could
          render Red October invvsihl8 to our
          SOSUS warning nets in the Atlantic.

                         PELT
          You would characterize this as a first
          strike weapon, Dr. Ryan?
          Ryan glances at Greer. Greer smi reassuringly.

                         RYAN

          if I may continue. Shortly after the
          Dallas lost contact, there were additional
          Soviet mailings from Pa tjarny, Leningrad

          fifty-eight nuclei submarines headed at
          high speed into the Atlantic. And this
          afternoon's satellite pass over Policjarny
          found head blooms in the engineering plants
          of the Kirov, the Minsk and more than
          twenty cruisers and destroyers,, indicating
          that the bulk of their surface fleet is
          also preparing to sail.
          Flushed, Ryan sits beside Greer. Pelt turns to Greer:

          Conclusions?

                         GREER
          Absence of activity in the Pacific suggest
          this is probably just an exercise having
          nothing to do with the Red October.
          A General starts to object. He's cut off by JUDGE MOORE, a
          white-haired civilian near the top of the table:

                         MOORE
          NSA can speak to that, Mr. Pelt.

          I must emphasize the extremi ' sensitivity

                         (PELT NODS)
          Before sailing, Captain Ramius sent a
          letter to Admiral Yuri Padorin, Chairman
          of Soviet Naval Deployment.
          Painting at Ramius' wedding picture, Ryan whispers to Greer:

                         RYAN
          That's her uncle!

          Greer has no idea what Ryan's saying. Moore's still talking:

                         MOORE
          The contents of the letter are unknown,
          but Admiral Padorin immediately demanded
          a meeting with Premier Ligachev and
          within minutes of that meeting, the
          Soviet Fleet sailed with orders to find
          Red October --

          My god. They've got a madman on
          their hands. He's gonna start a war.
          A spirited discussion ensues. Tuning it out, Ryan stares at the
          picture of Ramius and his wife. Urgently, he whispers to Greer:

                         RYAN
          This is the twenty-gird, isn't it?
          Greer nods. Order in the room has broken down. Generals and
          Admirals argue vehemently about appropriate. responses. Staring at
          the photos, a light goes off in Ryan's brain:
          SljenCel. Ryan realizes everyone in the room is staring at him.

          Uhhmm...I was just thinking there
          was perhaps another possibility we
          ought to consider.
          Ryan takes a deep breath.

          Nobody moves. Ryan glances at Greer. Greer rolls his eyes. Too
          far out. Ryan's on his own. The.General bristles:

          should've been with me six months ago
          when we hit a typhoon in the Sea of

          I know you're busy, Captain. But I

                         JONES
          I've been working on a sound I heard
          when the typhoon disappeared. I washed
          it through the tape machine several times
          and managed to isolate it. But when I
          asked the computer to identify it, the
          answer I got. was magma displacement.

                         MANCUSO
          Magma displacement?

                         JONES
          Yes sir. See, the system we are
          using was originally- designed to look
          four seismic events and although we
          adapted it. to hunt for submarines -

                         JONES
          Aye, aye, sir. Anyway,; I got curious,
          and. started tracking. the sound on our
          lateral array. I located it four
          different times. The fifth time it
          was gone and I couldn't find it. But
          I want to show you what I worked up.
          Picking up a grease pencil, Jones makes calculations on the status
          board overlaying the nautical map:

                         JONES (CONT'D)
          The first contact was at zero-nine-Been
          hours and the bearing was two-six-nine.

                         (DRAWING LINE)
          Then at zero-nine-thirty hours it was
          bearing two-six-zero. And at zero-nine-
          forty-eight is was two-ive-zero.

                         (ANOTHER LINE)
          I came back to it at about ten-hundred
          and the bearing was two-four-two. The
          last signal was real faint and I didn't
          have a very good lock on it.

                         MANCUSO
          So?

                         JONES
          Well, I figure it couldn't be very far
          away from us, right? Let's say it was
          halfway between us and Iceland. That
          would put it on a course like this.
          Jones makes more calculations on the. status board. Mancuso
          recognizes a pattern:

                         MANCUSO
          Headed directly into Red Route One.

                         JONES
          Exactly. Sir, I believe the sound I
          heard is the acoustical signature of some
          kind of super-quiet Russian submarine and
          he's taking the inshore track off the
          Iceland coast.

                         THOMPSON
          What do you think, captain?
          Mancuso stares-at the status board, then turns to Jones:

                         MANCUSO
          Let me see if I got this straight. The
          three minion dollar computer tells you
          you're chasing after an earthquake and
          you aren't convinced. So you get curious
          and came up with this theory: on your own?

          Forgive me, Ambassador, for dispensing
          with the usual formalities. But the
          President views this situation as critical.
          Our m,7 ttary counts thirty-two of your
          anti-submarine aircraft in the sky laying
          down enough sonar buoys that a man could
          walk from Greenland to Norway without
          getting his feet wet. What's going on?

          Ramins and Borodin exchange glances. At his quartermaster station,
          Stadnyuk is paralyzed with fear.

          IN THE FUSELAGE
          of the Foxtrot, Amalrioa wipes his brow, continuing to work his

          IN THE FUSELAGE
          of the Foxtrot, Ama1ric enters a program on his keyboard. Watching

          IN THE SKY
          the Foxtrot levels off. Bomb bay doors inch open, revealing a
          torpedo, sixteen inches in diameter and eight feet long. As the
          plane's nose dips, the torpedo relaasee.
          parachute opening behind, a thousand pounds of doomsday device
          dive earthward at dizzying speed, splashing into choppy sea.

          Jarred from his reverie, Ramius opens the intercom, speaking to the

          This Is the Captain. The explosion
          you Just heard was the first operational
          test of a new counter-measure. The
          torpedo was launched by our friends
          in Soviet aviation.
          Borodin stares at Ramius:

          Until now, orders required that I keep
          this aspect of our mission secret so
          that you might be evaluated under

          Someone rigged the pipe so that when

          For many months, seaman Beaumont,
          there was a Hustler magazine located

          I have a theory, seaman Beaumont.
          I believe the CO B Is like a black

          Apparently, the initial reports that
          one of our submarines was missing were
          not completely accurate.

          In my position, I'm sometimes compromised

                         BROKEN SUNSHINE
          dappling a choppy sea. Ice-cold WIND whips whitecapped waves and
          lashes the horizon. The helicopter with Ryan aboard circles into
          view.

          IN THE CHOPPER

          a ghost. NOISE Is DEAFENING. Another saï¿½ar belts a harness to
          Ryan's back.
          Ryan peers down. Wind from the rotors crushes the waves.
          Between his feet, Ryan can see the small white wake from a
          periscope.

          ON THE DALLAS
          in the Conn, Mancuso spins the scope. Thompson watches him.
          Both he and Mancuso wear life jackets:

                         MANCUSO
          Whoever this guy is, he's in far one
          hell of a ride.

                         ( NG)
          Officer of the deck. Surface the ship.
          A flurry of activity in the Conn. The Dallas prepares to surface.
          Mancuso and Thompson move to a hatch by the helm.

          IN THE CHOPPER
          the saftors i nish strapping Ryan into the sling. One of them leans
          forward, painting to a ]ever on Ryan's chest, SHOUTING:

                         SAILOR
          Pull this to release!
          Fighting. panic, Ryan glances down. A mitlion miles below, the sea
          bans- mine-grey.

          ON THE DALLAS
          sail in the Conn work like lightning in cramped quarters. A
          petty afâ¬'lcer straps Mancuso and Thompson into harnesses.

                         MANCUSO
          You got a man dangling at the end of
          a line with no paint of reference and
          helicopter rotors generating enough
          static electak ty that we have to
          ground him or it! l be like grabbing
          a hot wire and if he falls in the water
          the only way to get him out is with divers
          'cause most of the ship's underwater.

                         (PAUSE)
          Fun?

          Why I joined the Navy.
          A sager hands Mancuso a phone for the bridge.

                         THOMPSON (CONT'D)
          I put Jonesy in the forward escape
          hatch in case he goes in the drink.

                         MANCUSO
          Good. We got no idea who this guy
          is or why the Navy wants his on
          our boat so bad.

          IN THE CHOPPER
          Teeth chattering, sta:ugg g with deja vu, Ryan is transfixed by, the
          sub-zero ocean. HOWLING WIND and CRASHING ROTORS. Eyes
          wide, he watches

          THE DALLAS RISE
          First the sail, then the foredeck EXPLODE high into the air, finally
          CRASHING back to the WATER.

          ON THE DALLAS
          The COB helps Jones climb into an escape trunk aft of the sail. It's
          cramped and brightly lit. Jones checks his equipment.

          IN THE CHOPPER
          Ryan watches Mancuso and Thompson climb out of the sail onto the
          lurching bridge.The sailer leans close, HOLLERING:

                         SAILOR
          Hang on!
          He trips a laver on the winch. Cable feeds out a few feet Holding
          his breath, Ryan inches into the abyss.

          ON THE BRIDGE
          Mancuso lays binoculars on Ryan. Thompson ties both of them to
          the sail The sub pitches and rolls. Forward and aft are buried
          beneath waves.
          Fingers freezing, Thompson clamps one end of a jumper cable to a
          metal lip on the bridge to ground the sub against static generated
          by the helicopter's rut

                         

                         

                         

                         

          IN THE AIR
          savage WINDS from the chopper's ROTORS start spinning Ryan like
          a top. Desperately, he trams to control the dizzying motion.
          Above, caught in an unexpected wind sheer, the chopper plummets
          seaward. Ryan's line goes slack. Angry sea rushes up at him with
          blistering speed.

          IN THE CHOPPER
          the pilot struggles for control. Behind him, loose equipment SLAMS
          into the WINCH, JAMMING the CABLE. CURSING, the pilot regains
          control. The chopper stabilizes.

          IN THE AIR
          CRACKING like a WHIP, the CABLE goes TAUT. Ryan feels like
          he's been hit with a sledgehammer. Unable to breathe, he RIPS off
          his HELMET.
          A rock in a sling, he tries to get his bearings. Everything's grey.
          Above, the chopper's rotors CHEW the SKY. Help] s, Ryan starts
          swinging like a pendulum.

          ON THE BRIDGE
          Mancuso and Thompson watch Ryan rocket by at Mach 10. A huge
          arc carries him way out over the angry sea. Slowing down, Ryan
          starts to spin again.

                         MANCUSO

                         (SCREAMING)
          See if you can get a ground on his line.
          I'm gonna try and catch the bastard!
          Way out on the horizon, Ryan reaches the end of his arc and starts
          a comet-like ride back at the ship.

          IN THE CROPPER
          the pilot FEATHERS. CONTROLS trying to reduce Ryan's
          mind-boggling-ride. over his shoulder, he BELLOWS:

                         PILOT
          Reel him back in!

                         SAILOR

                         (TRYING)
          The cable's jammed!

                         PILOT
          If they don't pick him up this time,
          we have to cut him Ioxe!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          The sailor keeps trying to rewind the cable. No go. sweating, he
          wraps gloved fingers around the emergency release on the drum.

          IN THE AIR
          Ryan watches the Dallas' saw rush at him with unbelievable speed, a
          towering black monolith on an ubiquitous canvas of grey.

          ON THE BRIDGE
          Thompson readies the ground, holding one end in the air. A wave
          BLASTS the DALLAS.

          THE GROUNDING CABLE
          rips free of the bridge. Surprised, Thompson goes overboard.
          Caught in his harness, he dangles helplessly above the water.
          Mancuso and Ryan reach for each other as Ryan hurtles at the
          bridge. All hell breaks loose:

          A BOLT OF ELECTRICITY
          arcs between their oohed hands. BLITZED, Mancuso is
          KNOCKED hard to his KNEES.

          IN THE CHOPPER,
          the sailor pulls. the release lever, CUTTING the cable. it SLAMS
          back inside like a two ton rubber band.

          IN THE AIR
          unhooked, Ryan sling-shots fifty yards over the pitching bow of the
          Dalyas, disappearing beneath the ice-cold water.

          UNDER THE. WATER
          Bubbles trailing from his mouth, Ryan struggles to free himself from
          the harness.

          ON THE BRIDGE
          a vision of hell, hair blowing in all diYectlons, Mancuso eyeballs the
          spot where Ryan went down, SCREAMING:

                         MANCUSO

                         (INTO PHONE)
          Man overboard!
          Thompson drags himself back onto the bridge.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          IN THE ESCAPE TRUNK
          Jones hears Mancuso's voice BOOMING over SPEAKERS:

                         MANCUSO (VO)

                         (ON SPEAKERS)
          Man overboard! Twenty yards off
          the starboard bow!
          The COB SLAMS the HATCH, turning the trunk into an iron tomb.
          Jones pulls a mask over his eyes, activates his oxygen and drags
          open the exterior hatch.

          SEA WATER THUNDERS
          in, submerging him in Icy stillness. Securing a line to the
          bulkhead, Jones swims out into the swirling brine.

          IN THE AIR
          the chopper banks hard to the left, climbs Into the mist and starts
          circling the Dams.

          IN THE WATER
          free of the harness, Ryan bobs like a cork in the waves. Fifty
          yards away, the keeness sub p bahes violently.

          A ' DIVER
          surfaces next to Ryan. Removing his mouthpiece, Jones BELLOWS
          over the CRASHING SEA:

                         JONES
          Are. you injured!?

                         JONES
          I'm gonna take you in through an
          escape trunk!
          Jones hooks Ryan to the line. Salt stings Ryan's eyes. His,
          breathing's ragged.

          ON THE DALLAS
          BEDLAM in the CONN. STACCATO orders. Mancuso helps
          Thompson through the hatch. Hell on wheels, Mancuso disappears
          down a passageway.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          IN THE WATER
          Jones and Ryan ride waves by the curved hull. of the ship. Jones
          offers Ryan his mouthpiece.

                         RYAN
          Wait a minute!

                         JONES
          Listen, you son-af-a-bit h. I'm only
          gonna tell you once. Stick this fucking
          thing in your mouth and breathe!
          Ryan takes the mouthpiece, inhaling and exhaling rapidly. The
          helicopter circles above. Jones drags Ryan

          UNDER THE WATER
          into bruised silence. Pulling themselves downward along the Dalla
          rolling hull, Ryan and Jones share oxygen.

          IN THE ESCAPE TRUNK
          Ryan and Jones pull themselves inside. Blazing light ignites a fire
          storm of one-caned organisms. Eyes wide, Ryan watches Jones c3 se
          the hatch.
          Jones starts draining the trunk. Everything slows down. Echoes
          REVERBERATE. The water level in the trunk drops and the

          SHRIEK OF PRESSURIZED AIR
          ASSAULTS Ryan's EARDRUMS. Hurling the mouthpiece. away, he
          gulps air in the rapidly draining trunk like a banked trout.

          IN THE HALLWAY
          outside the trunk, Mancuso and crew open the hatch. Tumbling
          out, Ryan stands; on shaky legs, excited, babbling:

                         RYAN
          Jesus Christ! I cant believe it!

          Slow down. You're hypervent it sting.

                         (RYAN BLINKS)
          Now, who are you?

          Sorry. I'm Jack Ryan. Are you
          Captain Mancuso?
          Mancuso nods. The radioman appears with another message.
          Mancuso rips it open and starts reading it. Ryan rockets into

                         PRESENT TIME:

          JUMP CUT TO:
          at the entrance of the sonar shack, fifteen minutes later. Behind
          him, in the Conn, the crew is preparing to man battle stations.
          Jones has returned to sonar.

                         MANCUSO

                         (TO JONES)
          Any sign that he's alerted to our

          Ryan appears in dry clothes. Mancuso ignores him. The of5cer of
          the deck turns to Mancuso:

                         OOD
          Captain. Battle stations are manned.

                         MANCUSO
          Very well.

          What do you mean battle stations?

                         (URGENTLY)
          Look, I've been authorized by the
          President of the United States to
          talk to the Captain of Red October.
          Mancuso takes the last message from his pocket:

                         MANCUSO
          And I have been ordered to blow him
          out of the water if he stays on a
          course to the United States or
          demonstrates any hostile intentions.

                         (STUNNED)
          I don't understand.

                         MANCUSO

                         (RE: MESSAGE)
          According to this he's gone bughouse
          and intends to fire his missiles. So
          much f= your defection theory.
          Mancuso hands Ryan the message.. Ryan stares at. it. Mancuso
          turns back to the officer of the deck:

                         MANCUSO (CONT'D)
          Officer of the deck. Make,

                         RYAN

                         (RE: MESSAGE)
          Think about this a second. Naturally
          the Soviets would tall us he is insane.
          They want us to sink him before he has
          an opportunity to defect.

                         JONES

                         (TO MANCUSO)

          The officer of the deck repeats Mancuso's orders. Mancuso and
          Ryan are eyeball-etc-eyeball.. Ryan whispers:

                         RYAN
          Listen to me, Captain. There must
          be some way you can establish contact
          without violating your orders. I'm
          telling you, he wants to defect.

                         (MANCUSO FROWNS)
          If there's ever going to be peace in
          the world somebody has to take a risk.
          Give the man a chance. He's defecting.
          I know it.

                         (MANCUSO HESITATES)

          we'll play along.

          ON THE SURFACE
          Grey sky. Frothy sea. Red October's periscope appears. Seconds
          later, three hundred yards away, the Dalla' scope breaks the
          surface.

          ON RED OCTOBER
          Ramius is glued to the eyepiece of his periscope. He spots the
          Dallas' scope in the water. Behind him, sailors are tense, wary.
          Uncomfortable, Borodin sweats at fire control.

          in the Conn, Mancuso is glued to his scope just like Ramius. Ryan
          can hear his heart nq:

          All right, Mr. Ryan. You wanted
          to:. talk to him. There he is. What
          do you want to say?
          Ryan chooses his words carefully. As he does, Mancuso hits a
          periscope light in morse:

          He can do that, can't he?

                         MANCUSO
          He can do that. But is he gonna do
          that?

          ON RED OCTOBER
          in the Conn, Ramius is still at. the scope, watching the light in the
          Dalla' periscope. After a moment, he, glances at Borodin:

                         RAM=S
          Verify the range again.

                         (BEAT)
          Ping one time only.

          ON THE DALLAS
          in the Conn, Mancuso's at the scope. Ryan is scribbling something
          on a pad. Sailors hear a PING. Thompson grins.

                         MANCUSO
          I'D. be dammed.

                         (TO RYAN)
          Now what?

                         (THINKING)
          And ten him to ping again if he agrees.

          ON RED OCTOBER
          in the Conn, Ramius is at the scope, watching the flashing light.
          After a second, he steps back, face white. Finally, he turns to

                         BORODIN:

                         RAMIUS
          Verify the range one more time.

          Give me a sounding, ' Vasily! Ping
          once only.
          Borodin goes to work. Ramius stares at Melekhin. Melekhin frowns.
          What the hell is happening?

          ON THE DALLAS
          in the Conn, Mancuso, Ryan and the crew hear another PING.
          Ryan's ecstatic. Mancuso Isn't.

          Keep your vcadoe down, Doctor. There
          are several explanations -

                         PETROV
          Listen to me. Radioactive fuel is in
          the water. If it gets into our air,
          it could ' loll us all!

          I will not! We have a level four
          radiation leak. And if something
          isn't done, we're all going to die! -
          Ramius stands. Suddenly, Petrov remembers where he is. Ramius'
          eyes are bullet holes. Wilting,, Petrov stammers:

                         PETROV (CONT'D)
          Forgive me, Captain. But -

                         RAMIUS
          it's probably a piece of corrosion in
          the pipes. That happens. Now let's
          take' another sample. But quietly.
          We don't want to panic the crew.

          JUMP CUT TO:

                         ENGINEERING
          minutes later. Melekhin and Petrov prepare to draw another sample
          at the sink. Ramius stands behind them. Technicians to the rear.
          Melekhin struggles with the valve:

                         MELEKHIN
          I may have shut it too hard.
          Grabbing the wrench, Ramius leans his weight on it. Suddenly, the

          Secure the valve before the water
          turns to steam !
          Desperately, Ramius tries to plug the hole. The VALVE BREAKS.
          BOILING WATER pours out, turning to STEAM, SPLATTERING
          Melekhin. ALARMS GO OFF. Ramius BELLOWS:

          Evacuate the compartment-'
          Technicians scramble for the door. Searing hot steam chokes the

          get the hen out of here!

          IN THE CONN
          Crew members are panicking. ALARMS are GOING OFF. Dripping
          water, Ramius charges in. On the deck, Borodin SHOUTS:

          Sailors in the Conn stare at the Captain. Ramins BELLOWS:

          ON THE SURFACE
          Red October rises in angry sea. An emergency door on the sail
          opens. Seconds later, a hatch on the missile deck opens also. The
          sea RAGES.
          Climbing out on the deck, Tblllsi and a half a dozen sailors try to
          inflate rafts. Red October PITCHES and ROLLS. Wind HOWLS.
          Frurated, Tbilisi SCREAMS into a headset.

          IN THE CONN
          through the open emergency door, the sea CRASHES. Frightened to
          death, shivering sailors in life preservers line up to leave. Petrov
          counts them. Ramius stands by Sorodin.

          and my officers wall submerge the ship
          and take her elsewhere to scuttle. The
          Americans must never have this boat!
          All Petrov wants do to is get his ass off the boat. At the door,
          Ramius stops him:

                         RAMIUS (CONT'D)
          Doctor. When you get home. You will.

          Petrov splits. Borodin slams the hatch behind him and seals it.

          Submerge the ship.

          ON THE DECK
          the ocean RAGES. Red October sets to submerge. GEYSERS of
          WATER and air EXPLODE hundreds of feet in the sky as she dives.
          The BLOWBACK is STAGGERING.
          Wild-eyed sailors in rubber rafts hang on for their lives. On the
          horizon, Petrov spots the American frigate hurtling forward, light
          flashing.
          A puff of smoke appears, fbnowed by a muted EXPLOSION. The
          frigate's FIRING. As the round comes in, there is an

          EARSPLITTING SHRIEK.
          A hundred yards beyond Red October's bow, the SEA EXPLODES.
          The CONCUSSION and the STORM are mind-bending. Petrov thinks
          the world's coming to an end.
          In the rafts, men slash at ropes binding them to the deck. One by
          one, they drift free of the submerging ship into foaming sea. One
          sailor can't cut his rope. His raft's dragged under.
          Wind HOWLS. The frigate FIRES AGAIN. Another EARSPLITTING
          SHRIEK. Another EXPLOSION. Tons of icy saltwater cascade over
          Petxov's head. -
          Gulping air, Petrov spots the raft and sail r pop back to the
          surface. Red October's sail disappears. Sailors haul freezing men
          from raging water. Hell on earth.

          IN THE HELICOPTER
          on the fwltml of the frigate, PILOT and copilot are strapped into the
          crowded cockpit. Copilot flips a bank of toggle switches above his
          head.

          Copy that. We're on our way.

          IN. THE AIR
          the helicopter rises from the fantail of the frigate. In seconds, it
          passes over Petrov and his companions floating in rubber rafts in
          choppy sea.

          IN Â°THE HELICOPTER
          the pilot glances over his shoulder at a SENSOR OPERATOR working
          a computer behind the copilot:

          Torpedo Inputs?

                         SENSOR OPERATOR
          Set and veri ed as ordered.

          IN THE WATER
          the life rafts converge on the frigate like insects hovering round an
          oversized queen. In one of the rafts, Petrov watches as a net is
          thrown down at him.

          IN THE HELICOPTER
          the p eyeballs the sea as it races by. Speaking into a mike:

          Roger that, Bravo One. Five hundred
          yards to the drop paint. Torpedo is

          IN THE CIC
          aboard the fcigate, Curry turns to one of the shadows:

          Seahawk One reports torpedo armed

          authorization to drop.

          IN THE RAFTS
          Petrov and the others climb the nets. Halfway up, the doctor stares
          back at the helicopter hovering in the distance.

          IN THE AIR
          thirty feet above the water, the helicopter releases a torpedo in the
          area where Red October went down.

          ON THE FRIGATE
          Petrov climbs onto the fantail. U.S. sailors are waiting with coffee
          and blankets. Fuming, Petrov confronts an officer:

                         PETROV
          I protest! What authority do you
          have to fire? I protest!

          IN THE CIC
          Curry coordinates information. AIL around him, men work intensely.
          Curry turns to one of the shadows:

                         CURRY
          Seahawk One reports torpedo is launched

          Four hundred yards from drop paint.
          Eight hundred yards. Twelve hundred
          yards.
          One of the shadows leans forward and presses a button on Curry's
          console. The button is marked Command Control Detonate. The

                         SHADOW IS

                         ADMIRAL GREER
          in a white uniform and cap. Beside him, Skip Tyler, leans on his
          cane, concentrating on Curry's display.

          IN THE HELICOPTER
          Pilot studies the sea. Suddenly, it BULGES. Loud CONCUSSION.
          Shock WAVE. A giant mushroom cap rises from the depths as gas
          bubbles vent.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ON THE FANTAIL
          Petrov watches in horror as a huge concave impression vents below
          the helicopter. A huge plume of gas and water erupts skyward.

          IN THE CIC
          aboard the frigate, Curry turns to Greer:

                         CURRY
          Torpedo has detonated.

                         GREER
          And you understand, Lieutenant. I
          was never here. That torpedo did not
          self-destruct. It hit the target. Right?

                         (CURRY NODS)
          Now, Contact the Dallas and tell them
          to proceed.
          Curry nods.

                         CUT TO:

                         MANCUSO
          in the Conn aboard the Dallas with Thompson. Mancuso has a .45 in
          a holster on his belt. Thompson reads a message:

                         THOMPSON
          Frigate reports phase one completed,
          Captain. We are ordered to proceed.

                         MANCUSO
          OK. Now comes the weird part.
          Thompson fo lows Mancuso out of the Conn into

                         A PASSAGEWAY
          running aft. Mancuso and Thompson move at speed. Mancuso is far

                         FROM HAPPY:

                         MANCUSO
          I don't like leaving the boat, Phil.
          But the orders are specific.

                         THOMPSON
          We're gonna be f ne.
          Rounding a corner, they start

                         

                         

                         

                         

          DOWN A LADDER
          Thompson will never get over how fast Mancuso can move. Aren't
          guys that big supposed to be slow?

                         MANCUSO
          This has got to be the craziest stunt
          I've ever heard of. There's only about
          two ml]]k n things that can st]l. go wrong.
          At the bottom of the ladder, they enter

                         A PASSAGEWAY
          Ahead of them Jones and Ryan wait by a ladder beneath an open
          hatch. Like Mancuso, Jones is armed. Jones starts up the ladder.
          Ryan follows. Mancuso turns to Thompson:

                         MANCUSO
          Listen. If anything --

                         THOMPSON
          Captain. We'll be all right.
          Mancuso climbs up the ladder, disappearing through the hatch.
          Thompson closes it.

                         CUT TO:

          sitting before a wheel at a brightly lit panel, just as cocky as when
          we last saw him in the mini sub at Tyler's lab. Next to him, a

          Behind them, Jones, Ryan and Mancuso climb up through a hatch.
          Jones shuts it. Steiner speaks into a headset::

                         STEINER
          OX. Passengers are aboard. Check-off
          complete. Request clearance to lift-off.

          Gentlemen, we have clearance. Fasten
          your belts and grab your nuts. We're
          taking a ride.
          Ryan sits opposite Mancuso. Jones is to Mancuso's right. The
          bulkhead rocks slightly. Steiner turns a yoke.

                         STEINER (CONT'D)
          Battery sperm?

          ive. Make initial preparations to land.
          The copilot starts toggling switches. Behind him, Mancuso checks
          the .45 in his holster. Ryan watches.

                         COPILOT

          Hit the running lights.

          IN THE WATER
          -black on black. Then, in a single blinding flash of light

          THE RED OCTOBER
          is revealed. Hovering above it, floodlights blazing, the DSRV.
          Descending, it locks onto a hatch by the sail.

          IN THE DSRV
          Copilot turns to Steiner:

                         COPILOT
          We have a seal. Skirt is dry.

                         STEINER
          Roger. Open the hatch.
          Getting up, the copilot heads for the hatch.

                         MANCUSO
          Wait.
          Copilot stops. Reaching into his jacket, Mancuso offers Ryan a .45.

                         RYAN

                         (EYEING PI- )
          He's defecting.

                         MANCUSO
          And he can't change his mind?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         RYAN
          He's not going to change his mind.

                         MANCUSO
          Willing to bet your life on that.'
          Ryan stares at the pistol. Sighing, he puts it in his jacket.
          Copilot opens the hatch. In the gloom below, another hatch.
          Copilot raps on it. Somebody opens the lower hatch. Mancuso,
          Jones and Ryan climb down into

          THE RED OCTOBER
          on a ladder at the forward end of the Conn. Waiting for them,
          Ramins, Borodin and all the other of Awkward silence.
          Nervous, Borodin drags out a cigarette and lights it. Unexpectedly,

                         RYAN- SMI1 :

                         RYAN

          Could I try one?
          Mancuso frowns. Borodin offers Ryan a cigarette. Kamarov has a
          light. Ryan inhales and COUGHS:

          surrender this boat and request asylum.
          it never occurred to us there would be
          a way you could keep it. The idea to
          stage a radiation leak was inspired --

          You have a good memory, Captain. We
          meet briefly years ago. But I'm not
          a naval commander. I work for the CIA.

                         RAMIUS

          CIA?

                         RYAN
          Easy, Captain. I'm not an agent. I'm
          just an analyst.

          Suddenly, HIGH SPEED SCREWS passing over the HULL:

                         KAMAROV
          Torpedo! Americans are shooting at us.

          ON RED OCTOBER
          BEDLAM in the Conn. Tba'lisi and Jones are on their way to sonar.
          Ramius SHOUTS at Melekhin:

          Mancuso's halfway up the ladder. He spots Steiner peeking down at

                         HIM:

                         STEINER

          Where am I supposed --
          Mancuso SLAMS the HATCH. Scrambling down the ladder, Mancuso
          hears Ramius bel]Dwing at Borodin who is manning the helm:

          No, Vasily. I need you in fire control.
          We must track whoever's out there.
          Borodin heads for fre control. Ramius tosses Ryan into the chair
          behind the helm :

          No! That's wrong. Ryan, don't turn
          that goddam wheel!
          Ryan stares at Mancuso then at Ramius. Deciding, he turns the
          helm left, coming to course zero-two-zero.

          Your conclusions were wrong, Ryan.
          Halsey acted stupidly.
          CRASH. The Conn ROCKS. Sound of TORPEDO BREAKING UP.
          Metal SCRAPES along the SHIP. Realizing what's going on:

                         - MANCUSO
          I'll be dammed.

                         RYAN
          What happened?

                         MANCUSO
          Combat tack, Mr. Ryan. By turning
          into the torpedo,, Ramius closed the
          distance before it could arm itself.
          I never would have thought of it.

                         RYAN
          So we're safe?

                         RAMIUS
          Not yet. Right now, the Soviet Captain,
          a man named Tupolev is removing the
          safety features on all his weapons.
          He won't make the same mistake twice.
          Behind Ramius, Ryan spots a SHADOW at the rear of the Conn. He
          can't believe his eyes. The goddam shadow has a pistol in hand.

                         SUDDENLY:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          A FIRE STORM
          of GUNFIRE sprays the CONN. Everybody scatters. Borodin is
          HIT. SLAMMING into the bulkhead, he falls in a seated position,
          eyes wide.
          Fire control panel EXPLODES. Behind a console, Mancuso drags out
          his .45 and RETURNS FIRE. The shadow disappears.

          ON THE DALLAS
          Beaumont rips off his headgear, turning to Thompson in the sonar
          shack's door, breathing hard:

                         BEAUMONT
          Jesus Christ. Gunge.

                         THOMPSON
          Gunfire?

          ON THE KONOVALOV
          in the Conn, Tupa]av is furious. He YELLS at Bonavia:

                         TUPOLEV
          Hurry up goddammit! I want all the
          enabling devices disconnected!

                         BONAVIA
          Captain, I cannot go any faster.

          ON RED OCTOBER
          in the Conn, cars crawl from hiding. Sparks ERUPT from
          WIRES. Fire contra is history. Ramius leans over Borodin:

                         BORODIN
          I would have like to have seen Montana.
          And the Indians.
          (eyes gT'âºg)
          captain? - _.
          He dies. RAGING, Ramius POUNDS the BULKHEAD. Kamarov
          notices a light on a panel:

                         KAMAROV
          He's in the missile compartment!

                         RAMIUS

                         (TO MANCUSO)
          The ship is yours.

                         MANCUSO
          But the control is blasted to hell.
          I can't shoot.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         RAMIUS
          Then get behind him and stay there.
          Don't let him put you in his sights
          or we're all dead.
          Mancuso tosses Ramius his .45. Catching it, Ramius splits. Ryan
          follows.

                         CUT TO:

                         TUPOLEV
          a caged tiger in the Conn on the Konovalov. Bonavia turns, looking
          back at him :

                         BONAVIA
          Enabling devices are removed.

          Left full rudder. T11 shake him loose.

          ON RED OCTOBER
          in a passageway outside a door to the missile compartment, Ramius
          and Ryan hug the bulkhead:

                         RAMIUS
          He'll break into a panel and short
          -circuit the wiring on a missile. We'll
          be blown to pieces.
          Taking a deep breath, Ryan follows Ramiais into the

                         MISSILE COMPARTMENT
          coming face-too-face with a BARRAGE of GUNFIRE. Ramius is HIT.
          Ryan drags him into a space behind an electrical panel. Mercifully,
          the shooting STOPS.
          Ryan checks Ramius. His shoulder's a mess. Mind riling, Ryan
          studies his surroundings. He's never felt so alone.
          The compartment is vast, dominated by twenty tussle tubes six feet

                         

                         

                         

                         
          in diameter. Overhead, a catwalk. At the aft end, somebody's
          working with a wrench.

                         RAMIUS
          We must stop him before he gets into
          a panel..
          Ryan stares at Ramius. Ramiii isn't gonna stop anybody.
          Resigned, Ryan finds the .45 Mancuso gave him in his pocket,

                         MUMBLING:

          Be careful what you shoot at in here,
          Ryan. The compartment is very sensitive.
          In a daze, Ryan starts walking aft, still MUMBLING:

                         RYAN
          Be careful what you shoot at, Ryan.

          The ship turns. Wall becomes cuing. Grabbing the catwalk, Ryan

          IN THE WATER
          the DAIlas heads for the surface. Counter-measures head for the

          ON THE SURFACE
          The Da11a ERUPTS from the WATER at THIRTY DEGREES, her
          bottom exposed well aft of the sail. A broaching behemoth, she
          CRASHES back into the sea, DISPLACING TONS of WATER.

          ON THE FRIGATE
          neither Soviet nor American sailors on the fantail can believe their
          eyes. Peirov's jaw drops. Has the entire world gone completely
          insane?.

          ON RED OCTOBER
          in the missile compartment, blood pounding, Ryan leans flat against
          a missile tube. On the other side of the tube, METAL fans on

          CONCRETE.
          Rounding the tube, Ryan holds the .45 at arm's length. Kneeling
          before him, directly in front of an open panel on the missale bay is a
          Sovvet sail or with crazy eyes:

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         IT'S LOGINOV
          the cook's assistant who witnessed the Putin key exchange. He's
          got a hot wire in each hand. Time stands sthl. Ryan stares at
          Loginov. Loginov stares back.
          There's something in the Loginov's eyes, an uncompromising,
          irrational vi lainy that asks no forgiveness. For a moment, Ryan's
          paralyzed, a rabbit before a cobra.
          Deliberately, Loginov begins to move his hands together, bringing
          the wires closer. Ryan tri es to speak. He can't. Loginov's grin
          cracks wide like a rotten egg.

                         RYAN FIRES
          Flame LEAPS from the BARREL of the .45. The pistol KICKS like a

                         (SMOOTHLY)
          And I yours, Andrei..

                         LYSENKO

                         (PROBING)
          Perhaps in the future, the technology
          will be available for a more thorough
          I n vestigation of the wreckage...

                         (STEADY)
          Perhaps.
          A long beat as the two men stare at each other. Lysenko finally
          breaks it off:

                         LYSENKO
          There is another matter... One I am
          reluctant to -

                         PELT
          No. Please go ahead.

                         LYSENKO
          One of our submarines, an Akula, was
          last reported in the Reykjanes Ridge.
          We have not heard from her for sometime.
          Pelt stares at him blankly, time hangs suspended. Finally, Peat
          reaches far the bridge of his now as if to stave of a ]dtler

                         HEADACHE:

                         PELT
          You've lost another submarine?

                         (BEAT)
          Andre...
          Lysenko sits, hat in hand. Finally, he averts his gaze.

          JUMP CUT TO:

                         A DRIVER
          standing beside a limousine outside the Executive Office Building.
          Fuming, Lysenko approaches. The driver smiles. Not a good idea.

                         LYSENKO SNARL:

                         LYSENKO
          Shut up! Don't speak to me Boris. Don't
          ever speak to me unless I speak to you
          first. And wipe that smile off your face!
          Lysenko pBe into the limo, slamming the door as hard as he can.
          Locked inside, he starts shouting and hitting things.

                         CUT TO:

                         BRIGHT MOONLIGHT
          on the tree studded bank of a large coastal river. A gentle breeze
          touches the trees and punctuates the silence. Crickets and frogs
          sing on the shore:

                         PAMLICO SOUND

                         NORTH CAROLINA

          THE RED OCTOBER
          glides quietly up the river's surface. Ramius and Ryan stand on
          the sail. Behind them, two junior officers, one American and one
          Russian, Conn the ship:

                         RYAN
          We're two hundred miles from the nearest
          naval base.

                         RAMIUS
          Interesting notion, hiding a submarine
          in a river.

                         (EYEING SHORE)
          How do you know this place?

                         RYAN
          I grew up not far from here.

                         (PAINTING)
          My grandfather taught me to f5sh right
          over there on that rock.
          Ramius spots a large rock on the shore. So warm and inviting, this
          land, when compared to the bitter cold coast he ]eft a ]ifetl,me ago.
          Ram hl studies Ryan in the stillness:

                         RAMIUS
          There is one question you have not
          asked me.

                         RYAN
          Why?

                         (RAMIUS NODS)
          I assumed you would speak when you were
          ready.

                         RAMIUS
          We. are standing on part of the reason.
          I've spent my life preparing to fight a
          war I hoped would never happen. This
          ship was not built to fight such a war.
          it was built to start one.

                         (BEAT)
          And there were personal reasons.

                         RYAN
          Your wife?

                         RAMIUS

                         (NODDING)
          it started there, perhaps.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Ramius glances at the rock. Beside it, a muskrat drops quietly into
          the water.

                         RAMIUS (CONT'D)
          Or perhaps it was something that started
          long ago...

                         RYAN
          Fishing?

                         RAMTUS
          Fishing.
          Taking a deep breath, Ramius studies the surrounding hills. Lights
          from farms twinkle in the night air.

                         RAMIUS (CONT'D)
          "The sea will, grant each man new
          hope, as sleep doth dream of home."

          Ryan smilm.

                         RYAN

                         (QU`EDY)
          Welcome to the new world, sir.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

                         A STEWARDESS
          walking down the aisle of an airplane, checking passengers.
          Stopping near the front of the cabin, she glances down at

                         RYAN
          sound asleep in his seat, empty tea cup on a tray beside him. A
          blanket hangs on one log. In the seat next to him

          A TEDDY BEAR
          smi> out at passing clouds. The bear's got a red ribbon round his
          neck-and a seat belt fastened over his bulging tummy.

          Covering Ryan with the blanket, the stewardess leaves. Tea cup
          RATTLES. Ryan doesn't even twitch. Turbulence is a thing of the
          past.

                         FADE OUT

                         THE END

          pinprick the velvet-black sky that stretches over a vast
          sleeping jungle. A fingernail moon silvers the whispering
          canopy while gentle tendrils of steam rise.

          TITLE ON SCREEN: REPUBLIC OF CONGO, AFRICA.

          EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT

          CAMERA DRIFTS ACROSS the eternity of treetops until it FINDS

          A BUNGALOW.
          It's 20x20 square, with a wraparound porch and simple wooden
          shutters. The structure is hidden in a clearing that's been
          crudely hacked out of the sweaty wilderness.

          INT. HUT - NIGHT

          Two beds draped in mosquito nets sit on opposite sides of the
          space. A TEEN BOY sleeps in one and a MIDDLE-AGED MAN lies
          in the other. Their ebony skin glistens in the swampy heat.
          The numbing THROB OF INSECTS fills the silence until

          THE DOOR SOFTLY RATTLES.
          The Teen's eyes fly open. Fear grips his face as he looks
          over at the Man, who is now upright and awake. They hold
          their breath, listening over the DRUMMING CHORUS.

          ANOTHER RATTLE.
          It's louder this time. Unmistakable. The Teen watches as
          the Man pulls a crystal-handled dagger from under his pillow
          and stealthily creeps to the door. The Man cautiously leans
          in and peers through the bamboo slats.
          WHAT HE SEES: The empty porch. No sign of life.
          Relieved, he turns back, opens his mouth to speak when his
          face contorts. He looks down and sees the tip of

          A SERRATED METAL BLADE
          protruding from his chest. As the sword is viciously
          protracted through the door, the Man meets the Teen's haunted
          eyes and whispers his last, desperate word...

                         MIDDLE-AGED MAN
          Run!

          2.

          EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT

          The Teen's naked feet pound the hot, wet earth as he sprints
          through the maze of trees. Flecks of moonlight ricochet off
          the crystal pendant that dangles around his neck. He moves
          impossibly fast. Faster than any human could.

          A MONSTROUS HOWL
          ECHOES as something otherworldly catches his scent and begins
          thrashing in pursuit. The Teen's face tightens with dread
          and the SHOUTS of his pursuers hammer his ears.
          He doesn't look back, willing himself to survive. He races
          up a verge and fearlessly launches himself off the edge of

          A 100-FOOT-WIDE RAVINE!
          GOD SHOT LOOKING DOWN as the Teen leaps across the abyss. He
          kicks air as he arcs and finally touches down on the opposite
          lip. Chest heaving, he sees the hideous silhouette of

          A HULKING BEAST.
          It's called a Piken and skitters to a stop on the other side.
          It utters a chilling BANSHEE WAIL of frustration. Relieved,
          the Teen turns to make his escape when

                         A HAND
          wraps around his throat. He is effortlessly hoisted by a
          TOWERING MAN with skin as cold and pale as alabaster.

          THIS IS A MOGADORIAN.
          He wears the long red coat of a Commander. We catch the
          briefest glimpse of his cruel magenta eyes as they scan the
          geometric symbol engraved on the Teen's pendant. Silhouetted
          against the giant jungle moon, he triumphantly raises

          A SWORD.
          Its serrated blade ignites with silver flame as it sweeps
          towards the Teen. The boy's DEATH CRY echoes as the CAMERA
          ZEROES IN ON the pendant that glows brilliant-bright.

          FORM CUT TO:

          THE SAME SYMBOL.
          It glimmers to life on the ankle of another TEEN 10,000 miles
          away. His name's DANIEL and he's in the middle of a wild jet-
          ski race with TWO BUDDIES.

          TITLE ON SCREEN: BIG PINE KEY, FLORIDA, USA.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.
          The trio crisscrosses the turquoise sea while a party rages
          on the beach.
          Daniel makes a kamikaze move, whips his jet ski past his
          opponents and victoriously pumps his fist. But his moment of
          triumph is cut short. His face contorts in agony as he feels

                         THE SYMBOL
          searing into his skin. As he leans forward to grip his
          ankle, he cartwheels off the jet ski and viciously body-slams
          across the water.

          EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY

          LOOKING UP as Daniel crashes into view. Needles of light
          flicker from the symbol. It's cauterizing into his flesh
          like a brand.

          EXT. BEACH - DAY

          Daniel stumbles through the surf and collapses onto the sand,
          clutching his ankle. He rolls onto his side as a CROWD OF
          PARTYING TEENS gathers. A BLONDE GIRL leans down to help.

                         BLONDE GIRL
          Daniel, what's wrong? Did you
          break your ankle?
          But as she turns him over, she sees the light leaking from
          between his fingers and reels back.

                         BLONDE GIRL
          Oh my God.
          He stares up into the crowd's fearful faces, then staggers to
          his feet and takes off running.

          EXT. INTERSTATE - DAY

          The busy road runs parallel to an expanse of ancient pines.
          Through the trees, we CATCH THE SHUTTER IMAGE of a figure
          outrunning the hurtling vehicles.

          EXT. COASTAL FOREST - DAY

          Trees whip past as Daniel sprints down a sandy track. The
          pendant that knocks against his chest was carved by the same
          hand as the African Teen's, but the symbol is unique. He
          peels off to the right and bursts out onto a long drive.

          A STILT HOUSE
          sits at the end. It's cake-frosting pink and is built right
          on the edge of a coral-white beach.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          4.

          EXT. STILT HOUSE - DAY

          The door flies open and Daniel stands on the threshold.
          HENRI looks up from his bank of laptops that scroll with news
          feeds. He is decades older than his suntanned face betrays
          and you'd be way off if you guessed his accent was French.

                         DANIEL
          Number 3 is dead.
          Henri's eyes narrow with urgency. He is immediately on his
          feet, he kneels at Daniel's side and studies the symbol on
          the teen's ankle. It has stopped glowing but is painfully
          raw. Directly below this fresh wound are

          TWO OTHER GEOMETRIC BRANDS.
          They are the same size, but each symbol is subtly different.
          Time has transformed them into raised, snake-smooth scars.
          Henri's penetrating eyes look up at the shell-shocked teen.

                         HENRI
          Did anybody else see this?
          OFF Daniel's panicked nod...

                         CUT TO:

          INT. BEDROOM - STILT HOUSE - DAY


                         A GECKO
          skitters across the ceiling, its glossy black eyes watch as
          Daniel frantically stuffs his clothes into a duffel bag. The
          walls are bare. No photos, no posters, no personality.
          Henri enters, holding a crate of computer cables.

                         HENRI
          Taillights in five minutes. What
          we can't carry --

                         DANIEL
          -- we burn. I know the drill.

          EXT. STILT HOUSE - DAY

          TIGHT ON A BOX. It's exquisitely carved and inlaid with an
          intricate geometric design.
          Henri carefully hides it under the driver's seat of an old
          Jeep Wagoneer. It's the kind with wooden trim. He looks at
          Daniel who feeds homework assignments into a roaring FIRE.

                         HENRI
          Time to go.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          5.
          Daniel clicks the SIM card from his cell phone, snaps it in
          two and drops it into the fire. Bitter, he takes one last
          look at the glittering azure sea, then climbs into the Jeep.
          As the engine HUMS to life, CAMERA FOLLOWS

          THE GECKO.
          It darts up the fender, squeezes into the jamb of the trunk,
          and Houdinis into the vehicle with a flick of its tail.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. CAUSEWAY - DUSK

          The Jeep powers across the long elevated bridge. The dying
          sun tints the clouds and the sky in violent apocalyptic hues.

          DANIEL (V.O.)
          This is the part I hate the most.
          The running. But it's the only
          thing in my life that's real. The
          rest is a lie. My name. My
          birthday. Even Henri. People
          think he's my father. He's not.
          His job is to keep me alive.

          INT. JEEP - NIGHT - MOVING

          Henri's eyes scan the rear view, on constant vigil. The
          speedometer never brushes past 60. Daniel has his head
          against the window, brooding, listening to an iPod.

          DANIEL (V.O.)
          We are hiding from the Mogadorians.
          A brutal race that wiped out our
          entire planet, Lorien.

          EXT. USED-CAR LOT - DAY

          Plastic flags whip overhead. Daniel leans against a silver
          SUV and watches Henri negotiate with the DEALER.

          DANIEL (V.O.)
          Only nine children escaped the
          genocide. We were each given a
          number and sent here to hide. I
          don't know where the others are. I
          only know when one of them is
          murdered.

          INT. BATHROOM - MOTEL - NIGHT

          Daniel sits on the edge of a bathtub. He gently unwraps the
          bandage that covers his ankle and fearfully inspects the neat
          scab that has formed over the wound.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          6.

          DANIEL (V.O.)
          I got the first scar when I was
          eight. I woke up screaming. We
          lived in Vermont. The second was
          on a Tilt-a-Whirl at a fair in
          Michigan. I was 12. Yesterday was
          the third.
          His finger traces the lines of the other two scars.

          EXT. INTERSTATE - DAY

          The lush tropical landscape has browned into flat, dormant
          farmland. The silver SUV charges through the bleak monotony.

          DANIEL (V.O.)
          Because of the spell our Elders
          cast, the Mogs can only kill us in
          order. That's the reason I've
          survived this long. But our enemy
          is relentless.

          INT. SUV - NIGHT - MOVING

          Daniel is asleep with his earphones on. Henri glances over,
          his mask of certainty momentarily slips. He looks like a
          soldier heading into a battle he knows cannot be won.

          DANIEL (V.O.)
          Now their hunt has turned to me. I
          am number 4.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. REST-STOP DINER - NIGHT

          A tired neon sign illuminates the big rigs that RUMBLE past,
          headed to destinations unknown.

          INT. REST-STOP DINER - NIGHT

          Daniel sullenly stares at a stack of untouched pancakes.
          Henri slides into the booth, all business.

                         HENRI
          Florida's clear. I sent a letter
          to the school and there's nothing
          in the papers.

                         DANIEL
          I didn't even get a chance to say
          goodbye.
          Henri keeps going, passes an envelope across the table.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          7.

                         HENRI
          New IDs.
          Daniel pulls out his birth certificate, reads the name.

                         DANIEL
          Just when I think you can't get any
          less original, you lower the bar.

                         HENRI
          I'm not interested in originality.
          I'm interested in untraceable.
          There are 335,321 John Smiths in
          the United States.
          (Note: from this point on, Daniel will be called John.)
          John looks at him, then abruptly gets up and storms away.
          Henri drops $20 on the table and calmly heads after him.

          INT. ARCADE - REST STOP - NIGHT

          A row of ancient arcade games blinks. John angrily stabs the
          buttons of a Space Invaders machine as Henri approaches.
          They are alone. John's eyes never leave the video screen.

                         JOHN
          It's been so long since the last
          scar.

                         HENRI
          You got lulled into a false sense
          of security. That's my fault.
          John struggles to keep his temper in check.

                         JOHN
          I liked Florida. I liked having
          friends. I liked feeling normal.
          Henri's face softens with paternal compassion.

                         HENRI
          I wish that you could have a normal
          life -- but you can't.
          Only now does John turn and face him. His eyes blaze with
          frustration.

                         JOHN
          Then why fake it? Why not just go
          hole up in the wilderness.

                         HENRI
          That's exactly what Number 3 did.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          8.
          John looks at him, confused. Henri pulls up an article on
          his iPhone and hands it to John.

                         HENRI
          It's from an African news site. A
          man and his son went missing two
          nights ago. The locals think they
          were taken by strange beasts.
          John understands the implication.

                         JOHN
          Piken.

                         HENRI
          The Mogadorians are natural-born
          hunters. Blending in is our best
          protection.

                         JOHN
          So we just keep moving from town to
          town?

                         HENRI
          Until I say otherwise -- yes.
          John waits as a TRUCKER passes through the room. His voice
          softens but never loses its intensity.

                         JOHN
          I want to be from someplace, Henri.

                         HENRI
          You are.

                         JOHN
          Lorien's your home, I don't even
          remember it.
          John's tone rubs Henri the wrong way.

                         HENRI
          Like it or not, it's your home too.
          You have a responsibility to those
          who died.

          INT. SUV - NIGHT

          Henri and John climb in.

                         JOHN
          I want a say in where we live.
          (off Henri's face)
          You already picked it, didn't you?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          9.
          Henri REVS the ENGINE to life.

                         HENRI
          Cheer up, you're going to be living
          in Paradise.

                         CUT TO:
          A frigid sheet of RAIN POUNDS the sign that's planted on the
          side of this narrow stretch of rural blacktop:

          âWELCOME TO PARADISE, OHIO. POP. 5,243â
          The silver SUV streaks past, its wipers working overtime. It
          kicks up a spray as it speeds down Main Street. The dinky
          storefronts are garishly decorated for Halloween.

          EXT. WOODS - DAY

          The leaves are washed in a thousand shades of gold. The SUV
          barrels along the drive that twists through the woods.

          INT. SUV - DAY - DRIVING

          Henri pulls up in front of a small house. It sits by itself,
          surrounded by trees. Water sluices off the weather-worn
          garage in the yard behind it. A WOMAN steps out of a minivan
          to greet them.

                         JOHN
          She looks even perkier than the
          realtor in Florida.
          A warm smile graces her round face and she's clutching a
          fruit basket. For the record, she is called ANNIE.

                         HENRI
          What's your name?

                         JOHN
          John Smith.

                         HENRI
          Where are you from, John?

                         JOHN
          Arizona.

                         HENRI
          Why did you move to Paradise?

                         JOHN
          Because you're an asshole.
          John waits for a reaction but doesn't get one...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          10.

                         JOHN
          Because my dad needs peace and
          quiet to research his book.
          Henri nods and smiles wryly.

                         HENRI
          This was a lot easier when you were

          12.

          INT. HOUSE - DAY

          The front door swings open and Annie proudly escorts Henri
          and John inside.

                         ANNIE
          Here we are. Home sweet home.
          They scan the faded interior. The place is in desperate need
          of a makeover. A grandfather clock pensively TICKS at the
          end of the hall. Annie remains relentlessly optimistic.

                         ANNIE
          First impressions?

                         HENRI
          It's perfect.
          Annie places the fruit basket on the dining table and begins
          turning on the lights.

                         JOHN
          That's one word for it.
          Stewing, John exits into the hall with his duffel bag. Annie
          reads the strained dynamic.

                         ANNIE
          I feel your pain. I have a
          daughter his age. Apparently, I
          ruin her life on a daily basis.
          John steps back in, holding a sun-faded poster featuring NFL
          great Bernie Kosar.

                         JOHN
          This guy was covering a hole in my
          wall.
          Annie's cheeks blush with annoyance.

                         ANNIE
          I told the handyman to patch that
          before you arrived. I'm so sorry.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          11.
          Henri is all charm, gently leads her to the front door.

                         HENRI
          Don't you worry about it.
          She nods, grateful.

                         ANNIE
          We'll knock it off the rent. Keep
          the poster, Bernie Kosar brings
          good luck here in the Buckeye
          State.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

          The rain has stopped. The wind RUSTLES the trees. John
          lifts out the last box. As he closes the trunk, he doesn't
          notice the hitchhiking gecko hotfoot it out.

          INT. LIVING ROOM - HOUSE - NIGHT

          Henri is busy setting up his computer station. John dumps
          the box on the floor.

                         JOHN
          That's the last of them. I'm
          hitting the sack.

                         HENRI
          I need a new photo first.
          John crosses and stands against the wall.

                         HENRI
          Say Paradise.
          John gives him a withering look. Henri flashes off a shot.
          The camera is cabled to one of the laptops.
          TIGHT ON LAPTOP: The image of John pixelates onto a digital
          grid and a face-recognition program begins to map his facial
          structure.
          Henri turns to another laptop.

                         HENRI
          I've imputed the new search words:
          Daniel Jones. Big Pine Key.
          Sunset High School. You think of
          any others?

                         JOHN
          Yeah, this place sucks.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          12.
          Henri swivels to face him.

                         HENRI
          If there's a story or picture of
          you on the internet, this program
          will find it. Our enemy doesn't
          know who you are -- I want to keep
          it that way.
          John nods, knows he's being a jerk.

                         JOHN
          Sand Dollar Beach, that's where we
          were jet skiing.
          Henri types it in when something SCRATCHES at the door.
          Their heads instantly turn towards the sound. Tense SILENCE.
          SLOW PUSH IN ON THE DOOR as another SCRATCH echoes.
          Henri is on his feet. He flicks off the lights and silently
          signals John to retreat down the hall. With the cool air of
          an assassin, Henri unzips a duffel bag and pulls out a sleek
          crystal-handled dagger. As he steps to the door...

          INT. CLOSET - JOHN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          ... John crouches in the dark, clutching a baseball bat.
          Suddenly, the light in the bedroom buzzes back on. He holds
          his breath as the door swings open. He looks up and is
          relieved to see Henri.

                         HENRI
          I found our intruder -- he's a
          little small for a Mogadorian.
          At that moment,

                         A BEAGLE
          slips between Henri's legs. It cocks its head, studies
          John's face, then pads forward and licks his cheek.

          INT. KITCHEN - HOUSE - NIGHT

          The dog greedily laps a bowl of milk.

                         JOHN
          He's starving, doesn't have any
          collar or tags.

                         HENRI
          Must have been dumped.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          13.

                         JOHN
          You know, another pair of eyes and
          ears watching the house wouldn't be
          a bad thing.
          Henri considers the request, nods. John playfully ruffles
          the dog's head.

                         HENRI
          What are you going to call him?

                         JOHN
          Since I need all the luck I can get
          -- how about Bernie Kosar?

                         CUT TO:

          INT. LIVING ROOM - HOUSE - MORNING

          John enters, dressed in black, ready for his first day of
          school. He dumps his backpack on a chair. Henri places a
          plate with an omelette and perfectly browned hash browns in
          front of him.

                         JOHN
          Wow. You outdid yourself. What's
          up?
          Henri lifts a red backpack into view. John stares at it.

                         JOHN
          I already have a backpack.

                         HENRI
          This one has five days of rations,
          spare clothes, cash and a handheld
          GPS. Keep it with you at all
          times.

                         JOHN
          Henri, come on.

                         HENRI
          Game's changed. You're in the
          crosshairs now. You have to be
          ready to leave at a moment's
          notice. With or without me.
          John stares at the backpack, takes in this new reality. He
          pushes the plate away, snatches the backpack and heads out
          the door. Henri stares at the omelette, tastes a pinch of
          hash browns, then puts the plate on the floor on his way out.
          It takes Bernie 2.5 seconds to race over and start to eat.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          14.

          EXT. PARADISE HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

          Jack-o'-lanterns stare out from the âHALLOWEEN BLOCK PARTYâ
          banner strung across the red brick facade. Henri drives
          away. John slides the red backpack onto his shoulder when he
          hears a FAMILIAR BARK. He turns and is surprised to find

          BERNIE KOSAR.
          The little dog is sitting by the flagpole wagging his white-
          tipped tail. John crosses to him, baffled.

                         JOHN
          Bernie, what the hell... were you
          hiding in the car?
          He scoops the dog into his arms.

          FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
          Hey, I was about to take a picture
          of the little guy.
          John turns and finds

          SARAH HARTE.
          She's his age and is holding an old 35mm Nikon. There is
          something about her unforced beauty that is instantly
          enchanting. John shuffles, uncharacteristically nervous.

                         JOHN
          He's not supposed to be here.

                         (TO BERNIE)
          Go home. Now.
          Bernie hops out of his arms and obediently runs towards home.

                         SARAH
          He's really well-trained. How long
          have you had him?
          John turns away.

                         JOHN
          Sorry about your shot.

                         SARAH
          No worries.
          He begins walking towards the entrance.

                         SARAH
          You just moved into the house on
          Old Mill Road. It's John, right?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          15.
          John swings back, concerned.

                         SARAH
          Don't worry, I'm not stalking you.
          My mom said she rented it to a guy
          with a son my age. Since I know
          every other face on this quad, that
          had to be you.

                         (BEAT)
          I'm Sarah.
          He nods.

                         SARAH
          Where are you from?

                         JOHN
          Someplace warmer.

                         SARAH
          I don't think that qualifies as an
          actual answer.

                         JOHN
          I need to register.
          She raises her camera to snap a shot of him.

                         JOHN
          Whoa. What are you doing?

                         SARAH
          Capturing your first day, even
          though you're technically six weeks
          late.

                         JOHN
          Please don't point that at me.

                         SARAH
          Afraid the camera's going to steal
          your soul?
          She lifts the viewfinder to her eye, adjusts focus. Annoyed,
          he covers the lens with his hand.

                         JOHN
          What's your problem? I said no.

                         SARAH
          It's only for the yearbook.
          John regains his composure.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          16.

                         JOHN
          I'm not big into having my picture
          taken. Sorry.
          As he heads away, Sarah watches, intrigued. CAMERA TRACKS TO
          REVEAL MARK JAYNE monitoring the encounter. He's the star
          quarterback and his chiselled jaw tenses with jealousy.

          INT. HALL - PARADISE HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

          Loaded with textbooks, John instinctively bows his head as he
          passes the black eye of a hall security camera and steps to a
          locker. He reaches for the combination lock when

                         A BACKPACK
          viciously sideswipes him. The textbooks scatter across the
          checkerboard linoleum. John sees the culprit is Mark Jayne,
          who offers him a taunting grin. John fights his urge to
          react and watches as Mark struts over to his POSSE OF JOCKS.

          VOICE (O.S.)
          Welcome to Paradise, irony not
          included.
          John looks at the teen standing two lockers down. He's got a
          battered skateboard tucked into his backpack and wears an
          Army surplus jacket. This is SAM GOODE -- genius by birth,
          slacker by choice. He nods after Mark.

                         SAM
          His name's Mark Jayne.
          Quarterback, sheriff's son, he's
          three years into the best four
          years of his life.
          John begins retrieving the fallen books. Sam helps.

                         SAM
          Do yourself a favor -- stay off his
          radar.

                         JOHN
          Didn't know I was on it.

                         SAM
          You were talking to Sarah Harte.

                         JOHN
          She was talking to me.

                         SAM
          Mark and Sarah have been exclusive
          since Freshmen year.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          17.
          John looks down the hall and sees Mark wrap his arm around
          Sarah's shoulder.

                         SAM
          If there's another guy in her
          airspace, he shoots them down. You
          got a warning shot.
          John piles the books into his locker.

                         JOHN
          Maybe I'll fire back next time.

                         SAM
          Look, you're new, so let me tell
          you how things work in this
          misnamed backwater. Football
          players are gods -- the rest of us
          are mere mortals. If you want to
          survive, keep your head down and
          don't make waves.

                         JOHN
          You sound like my dad.

                         SAM
          Obviously a wise man.

                         (BEAT)
          I'm Sam by the way.
          Sam extends his hand. John doesn't take it.

                         JOHN
          Thanks for the download.
          As he SLAMS his locker shut...

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. FOOTBALL STADIUM - PARADISE HIGH - DAY

          It's an impressive structure with wraparound bleachers. The
          Junior gym class jogs around the track. John hangs in the
          middle of the pack, with his hoodie up, blending in.
          They pass the GIRLS who are stretching on the pristine field.
          Sarah's eyes drift towards John. The COACH blows a whistle.

                         COACH
          Alright, people. Let's hit the
          gym.
          The assembled teens GROAN and fan off towards the mouth of a
          tunnel that stares out from the base of the bleachers.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          18.

          INT. GYM - PARADISE HIGH - DAY

          John emerges from the tunnel via a door by the stage. Some
          of his classmates are on the court, passing and dribbling.

                         COACH
          Okay, half court, three on three.
          Girls have this basket, boys have
          that one.

                         CUT TO:
          Two simultaneous games are in progress. John sits on the
          sidelines waiting his turn. He avoids eye contact with Sarah
          who is sitting in the shadow of the basket. However, he does
          notice Mark Jayne enter and approach her.

                         COACH
          New kid, you're up. Show me what
          you've got.
          John steps onto the court and waits for the ball to come his
          way. He steals a glance and sees Sarah and Mark arguing. A
          blur of orange. John swings back and catches the ball.
          Just as he shoots, he's distracted by Sarah's upset voice.

                         THE SHOT
          goes wild, misses the basket but hits the glass backboard
          with such force that it

          SHATTERS.
          Mark and Sarah are inadvertently forced to separate as shards
          rain down. All eyes turn to John, who's annoyed at his
          momentary lapse. TEENS HOOT. The Coach BLOWS his whistle.

                         COACH
          Enough! Hit the showers.

                         (TO JOHN)
          LeBron, grab a broom.
          As the gym empties, John looks over and catches Sarah
          watching him. OFF this silent exchange...

                         CUT TO:

          INT. HOUSE - DAY


          THE INTRICATELY CARVED BOX
          is clutched in Henri's hands. He heads down the hall and
          stops in front of the grandfather clock. Its tarnished
          pendulum sways. He unlocks the glass panel and slots the Box
          out of sight behind the clock's brass face.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          19.
          Satisfied with the hiding place, he locks the front and takes
          the key. When he turns back, he finds

          BERNIE KOSAR.
          The dog is studying him with his head cocked.

                         HENRI
          Let's keep this our little secret.
          OFF Bernie's inquisitive eyes...

                         CUT TO:

          INT. CAFETERIA - PARADISE HIGH - DAY

          John joins the line. He sees Sarah sitting by herself,
          inspecting a photographic contact sheet. His view is blocked
          by Sam. John rubs his hands which are oddly sweaty.

                         SAM
          First day here and you're already
          destroying school property. So
          much for not making waves.
          John moves past him and grabs a tray. He's flushed and his
          face is now hot and red.

                         JOHN
          It was an accident.

                         SAM
          I hear the real spectator sport was
          Mark and Sarah's blowout.
          John wipes his brow, distracted.

                         SAM
          Dude, you okay?

                         JOHN
          Fine.
          At that moment, Mark Jayne and his buddy, KEVIN, cut in front
          of them. Annoyed, John taps Mark on the shoulder.

                         MARK
          You got a problem?

                         JOHN
          Line starts back there.

                         MARK
          Football players get priority.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          20.

                         JOHN
          Where's that posted?

                         MARK
          Unwritten rule.

                         (RE: SAM)
          I'm surprised your boyfriend didn't
          tell you.
          Sam puts his hands up and backs away. Mark smirks at John.

                         MARK
          If you don't know your place around
          here, things can get rough.
          John holds his ground.

                         JOHN
          In that case, I guess I better ask
          you where I should sit. I was
          thinking about grabbing that chair
          next to your girlfriend.
          In a flash of anger, Mark whips up his tray, hammers it into
          John's chest, knocking him to the floor.

                         MARK
          You want to talk trash? Let's see
          you back it up.
          John tries to stand, but is suddenly overcome with a wave of
          pain. He looks down at his hands and is alarmed to see

                         LIGHT
          blooming from his palms! He quickly balls them into fists,
          extinguishing the light from view.

                         MARK
          Get up!
          SILENCE has fallen. Still clenching his fists, John rises
          and stumbles out into the hall. OFF Sarah's concern as she
          watches him exit...

          anxious, urgent BARK.

          Henri steps inside and sees the dog is BARKING at --

          THE GRANDFATHER CLOCK.
          A shaft of white light blooms from within. The shadow of the
          swaying pendulum cuts across Henri's face. As he sprints for
          the door...

          Dude, hold up!
          John leans against the wall, keeping his hands out of sight.

                         SAM
          You look like crap. I'll get the
          nurse.
          But as Sam runs off, John heads in the other direction.

          INT. DARKROOM - PARADISE HIGH - DAY

          Strips of negatives hang on drying lines. John bursts in and
          SLAMS the door. He slips off his backpack, opens his hands.
          TIGHT ON HIS EYES -- the brilliant light from his palms
          shrinks his irises to pinpricks.
          The luminescence is crisp, mercury-glass bright and grows
          stronger every second. Suddenly, the door opens. John spins
          in shock. A figure strides through the blinding glare,
          gently takes his hands and folds them into fists.

          IT'S HENRI.
          John looks at him, confusion and fear etched on his face.

                         JOHN
          Henri, what's happening to me?

          Calm down. You're going to be
          okay.
          John angrily holds up one of his luminescent hands.

                         JOHN
          On what planet is this okay?

          John steps out of the darkroom wearing Henri's heavy coat.

          Okay, start talking. What the
          hell's going on?

          Legacy?

                         HENRI
          An extraordinary ability. Yours is
          called Lumen. They start a lot
          sooner on Lorien. I was beginning
          to fear yours would never emerge.

                         JOHN
          You knew this was going to happen?
          Why didn't you say anything?

                         HENRI
          I didn't want to worry you. You
          were already under enough pressure.

                         (SINCERE)
          I'm sorry.
          John acknowledges the apology, but looks at him, suspicious.

          first Legacy appeared. Ready?
          John nods nervously. Henri places the fingertips of his
          right hand onto five petal-shaped discs inlaid onto the lid.
          John cautiously follows suit and places his fingers on the
          âpetalsâ fanned across the opposite side.

                         THE DISCS
          momentarily glow and a SHARP CLICK echoes from within. John
          and Henri pull their hands away and watch as the Box
          miraculously comes to life. Fissures of light sweep across
          the lines of inlaid stone, dividing the lid into sections
          that begin to twist and reform like high-tech origami.

                         JOHN
          Whoa.
          PUSH IN ON Bernie as he sits up and watches the Box unfold.
          Like an intricate jigsaw, the sections finally regroup,
          creating a new pattern on the lid. It's a familiar geometric
          symbol. John touches the crystal pendant that hangs from his
          neck -- the symbols are an exact match.

                         HENRI
          Open it.
          John nods, cautiously lifts the lid, revealing a neat
          assortment of velvet pouches and an array of colored rocks.
          They range in size and color but all share a serene beauty.

                         JOHN
          What are they?

                         HENRI
          Crystals from Lorien's core.
          They'll guide us in your training.
          John tries to reach for one, but Henri slaps his hand away.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          24.

                         HENRI
          Place your hand over them.
          John follows the instruction and is amazed when a walnut-
          sized crystal floats up from the Box. It slowly begins to
          spin and project

          A SWIRLING HOLOGRAPHIC GALAXY.

                         HENRI
          Our solar system.
          Henri points to a planet. Its oceans are dark with pollution
          and its sprawling continents are barren and treeless.

                         HENRI
          That's what Lorien looked like
          thousands of years ago. We had all
          the problems that Earth has today.
          The planet was dying until our
          people made a collective decision
          to change and slowly Lorien began
          to heal itself -- that's when the
          Legacies started.
          John watches as the spinning planet transforms before his
          eyes. Its oceans turn a vibrant chroma-key blue and the land
          masses become a lush emerald green.

                         HENRI
          Only a select few developed these
          abilities. They became known as
          the Garde.

                         JOHN
          That's what I am?

                         HENRI
          Like your parents and grandparents.
          John considers this new information.

                         JOHN
          The other children in the ship...
          Henri finishes John's thought.

                         HENRI
          They're Garde as well. Once you've
          mastered your Legacies, we'll find
          them and face the Mogadorians
          together.
          John looks at Henri, curious.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          25.

                         JOHN
          What Legacy do you have?

                         HENRI
          I don't have any and never will.
          I'm your Cepan -- a teacher. My
          job is not just to protect you but
          to train you.

                         (BEAT)
          Give me your hand.
          Henri takes one of John's hands and pulls a cigarette lighter
          from his pocket. John flinches, unsure.

                         HENRI
          Trust me.
          Henri flicks a flame to life and sweeps it under John's
          outstretched palm.

                         HENRI
          You feel that?
          Amazingly, the flame harmlessly licks the skin. But when
          Henri moves the lighter further up John's arm --

                         JOHN
          Ouch.
          John jerks his hand away. Henri kills the flame, shrugs.

                         HENRI
          When we're done, your entire body
          will be shielded against fire.
          John rubs his singed wrist.

                         HENRI
          You'll get other Legacies too.

                         JOHN
          Flying would be cool.

                         HENRI
          You don't get to pick them off a
          menu.
          KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK. As John spins to the door, the
          shimmering galaxy fades and the crystal drops to the floor.

                         HENRI
          Mogs don't knock.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          26.
          Henri steps to his computer bank and examines a laptop
          featuring live feeds from a dozen surveillance cameras he's
          installed around the property.

                         HENRI
          It's a girl.
          John looks over his shoulder and reacts with surprise.

          EXT. PORCH - HOUSE - NIGHT

          John opens the door and finds Sarah amped.

                         SARAH
          How'd you do it?
          Her accusation startles him.

                         JOHN
          Do what?

                         SARAH
          Eviscerate the entire senior class?
          She pulls a strip of overexposed 35mm film from her coat.

                         SARAH
          I was in the darkroom before lunch
          and they were hanging on the line
          smiling and looking forward to the
          future. When I got back, I found
          15 rolls of negatives wiped clean.
          John shrugs innocently.

                         JOHN
          I don't know what you're talking
          about.

                         SARAH
          So you weren't in the darkroom
          today?

                         JOHN
          No.

                         SARAH
          Here's a tip. If you're going to
          lie, don't leave a big red backpack
          at the scene of the crime.
          She swings his backpack into view. John is mortified. He
          struggles to find a plausible answer and silently tries to
          quell the feeling welling in his chest.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          27.

                         JOHN
          I don't know what happened. Maybe
          it's a sign that you should invest
          in a digital camera.

                         SARAH
          Digital sucks. Film tells the
          truth. Clearly, I'm not going to
          get that from you.
          He watches as she angrily heads down the steps and climbs
          into her car. John glances at his palms and is surprised to
          find they are dimly luminescent.

          EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

          Sarah's car sweeps out of the drive and powers towards town,
          unaware of the truck parked in the shadows.

                         MARK JAYNE
          is behind the wheel and watches as her headlights fade into
          the night. OFF his simmering jealousy...

          INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

          Bernie Kosar waits expectantly as Henri pours âDoggie Chowâ
          into a bowl. John steps in.

                         HENRI
          Everything okay?

                         JOHN
          She was returning my backpack.
          He dumps it by the door.

                         HENRI
          I think you should stay home from
          school for a couple of days.

                         JOHN
          I'm fine.

                         HENRI
          Just to be safe.

          Moonlight cuts across Bernie Kosar who is SNORING peacefully
          at the end of the bed. John tosses and turns. He finally
          sits up, unable to sleep.

          INT. LIVING ROOM - HOUSE - DAWN

          Nursing a mug of black coffee, Henri diligently scans the
          laptop screens. He's clearly never gone to bed. He looks up
          as John enters wearing track gear.

                         JOHN
          I'm going for a run.
          Bernie trots out and wags his tail pleadingly.

                         JOHN
          Sorry, buddy, you couldn't keep up.

          the rich kaleidoscope of trees. It almost seems to be

          John moves at superhuman speed, leaving a blurring wake of

          ankle. His happiness dims.

          causing them to flare with sudden brilliance. Momentarily

          ON THE FIELD the ball is hiked to Mark. He looks for an
          opening and fires a perfect spiral to the RECEIVER in the end

          Sarah is alone, tacking photographs to a large board that's

          I think you have the wrong room.
          She rises, walks past him and begins searching the photos
          scattered on the layout table in the middle of the space.

          last one to anybody before.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          32.

                         JOHN
          Your secret's safe with me.
          She studies him, sensing a kindred spirit.

                         SARAH
          You ever feel you don't belong in
          your own life?

                         JOHN
          Every single day.

                         SARAH
          Wow. That almost sounded like a
          straight answer.
          They look at each other. There's a charged silence. The
          moment is broken when --

          MARK (O.S.)
          What's he doing in here?
          John and Sarah spin to find Mark. Sarah is flustered.

                         SARAH
          I thought you were on two-a-days.

                         MARK
          Coach wants me to rest my arm
          before the scouts come. You didn't
          answer my question?

                         SARAH
          John was helping me move some
          boards.
          John turns to Sarah.

                         JOHN
          I'm going to take off.
          Mark doesn't take his eyes off John and blocks his way.

                         MARK
          Seriously, Sarah, what's up with
          this guy?

                         SARAH
          I don't have time for this, Mark.

                         MARK
          But you had time to go to his house
          the other night.
          Sarah looks at him, stunned by the admission.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          33.

                         SARAH
          You were following me?

                         MARK
          Just trying to figure out what's
          going on with you.
          Sarah's shock turns to anger.

                         SARAH
          You've crossed so many lines I
          can't even speak to you right now.
          She hustles out of the room. Mark glares at John.

                         MARK
          This isn't over.
          OFF John, unmoved by the threat...

          The sky is even pinker than the house.

          INT. STILT HOUSE - FLORIDA - DUSK

          A drawer flies across THE FRAME. The place has been totally
          trashed. Floorboards have been ripped up. Sofas shredded.
          Nothing has been spared. CAMERA DRIFTS OVER the debris to...

          INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM - STILT HOUSE - DUSK

          The mattress has been dissected and its guts lie scattered.

          A TEEN GIRL.
          kneels in front of John's old desk searching the drawers.
          She wears a biker jacket, combat boots and has a striking
          âdon't-fuck-with-meâ face. Frustrated in her search, she
          flings the desk against the wall. It splinters on impact.

          INT. KITCHEN - STILT HOUSE - FLORIDA - DUSK

          TIGHT ON THE STOVE -- a hand twists on the burners. Raw gas
          HISSES. The Teen Girl makes one final scan, then heads for
          the door.

          EXT. STILT HOUSE - FLORIDA - DUSK

          The Teen Girl strides down the steps and crosses to a sleek
          Ducatti. She slips on a helmet. PUSH IN on her Arctic-blue
          eyes as they focus on the house with a strange intensity.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          34.

          KABBBOOOOOOM!
          The house detonates. The concussive force of the blast rips
          the structure right off its stilts. Tornadoes of flame BLAST
          through the windows as the house catapults into the air.
          Orange reflections flicker on the Girl's visor as she flips
          it down, REVS the motorcycle and SCREAM-PEELS down the drive
          backlit by the glittering inferno...

          INT. HALL - PARADISE HIGH - DAY

          Sam catches John at the lockers.

                         SAM
          Nice freakout the other day.

                         JOHN
          Wasn't feeling well.
          They twist their combination locks. Sam swings open his
          door, there's a HISSING POP and

          A RED INK PACK EXPLODES.
          It's the kind banks use to foil heists. In a shocking
          instant, Sam and the contents of his locker are splattered.
          It bears a gruesome resemblance to arterial spray.

                         JOHN
          has his door halfway open and ducks back a second before the
          ink pack planted in his locker ERUPTS. The spray misses his
          face but violently spits across his chest and arms. LAUGHTER
          echoes behind them. John spins and finds Mark and his posse.
          TIGHT ON John's hands as he balls them and an angry glow
          flickers through his gloves.

                         MARK
          (to John, taunting)
          Told you it wasn't over.
          Behind them, Sam's laid-back persona cracks. He frantically
          clears his locker, looking for something. He finally pulls
          out a photo which drips with ink, reels at the jocks.

                         SAM
          Assholes.
          John looks back at Sam. Mark seizes his chance and launches
          a sucker-punch at John. But John sees it out of the corner
          of his eye and in a blur of motion whips up his hand and

                         

                         

                         

                         

          35.

          CATCHES MARK'S FIST.
          John squeezes it vice-tight. Mark grimaces in agony. His
          buddies back into the CROWD OF TEENS that has gathered. John
          leans in close.

                         JOHN
          That sensation you're feeling --
          remember it.
          With a quick push, John shoves Mark back against the lockers.
          Mark DENTS a door and slides to the floor, his eyes flaring
          with lacerated pride.

                         JOHN
          Show's over.
          The crowd disperses. Mark gets to his feet and exits with
          his friends, but shoots John one final wounded glare...

                         CUT TO:

          INT. LOCKER ROOM - PARADISE HIGH - DAY

          Red, ink-stained water Hitchcocks down the drain. John
          wrings out his black T-shirt. He sees Sam's reflection in
          the mirror. Sam puts some clothes on the bench.

                         SAM
          I raided lost and found.
          He holds up a puke-green sweater decorated with red snowmen.
          John turns back to the sink.

                         SAM
          I know. Nobody loses anything
          cool.
          He sits and begins to change.

                         SAM
          Dude, the way you thrashed Mark
          back there. Awesome move.
          John acknowledges that with a nod. Whip-dries his shirt.
          Sam plucks up the photo. The ink is now dried and cracked.

                         JOHN
          Who's in the picture?
          Sam stares at it, nostalgic.

                         SAM
          My dad. My real dad. I took it
          the summer before he split.

                         SAM (CONT'D)
          He dragged me and my mom all over
          the Yucatan. He was looking for
          evidence of ancient astronauts.
          All I got was Montezuma's Revenge.

                         JOHN

          Sounds like a fun vacation.

                         SAM
          I know. Insane. He called himself
          an anthropologist even though he
          only made it through one semester
          of college.
          He rises and tosses the ruined picture into the trash.

                         SAM
          Always thought he'd come back one
          day -- who was I kidding. The
          guy's a joke.
          As the BELL RINGS...

          SARAH (O.S.)
          John.
          He turns in surprise as Sarah approaches.

                         SARAH
          I heard about the lockers. I'm
          sorry.

                         JOHN
          I'll live.
          He starts off again.

                         SARAH
          I broke up with Mark.
          He stops, slowly turns back.

                         SARAH
          I've been thinking about doing it
          for a while... today just finally
          pushed me over the edge.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          37.
          He studies her face.

                         JOHN
          Why are you telling me?
          She bows her head, suddenly embarrassed.

                         SARAH
          I don't know.

                         JOHN
          You made the right call.
          The certainty of his voice soothes her. She looks up and
          holds his gaze. Their attraction is undeniable.

                         SARAH
          Halloween Block Party's tonight.

                         JOHN
          I saw the banners.

                         SARAH
          I'll be on Main Street hiding
          behind my camera if you want to
          swing by.
          He says nothing.

                         SARAH
          I wasn't expecting an actual
          response. I could text you later.
          Do they have cell phones on Planet
          John?
          She holds out her phone. John looks at it tentatively, then
          takes it. As he inputs his number, he hears the BLARE of a
          car horn, looks up and sees Henri waiting in his SUV.

          INT. SUV - DAY

          John climbs in.

                         HENRI
          Wasn't that your friend from the
          other night?

                         JOHN
          Her name's Sarah.

                         (ANNOYED)
          I didn't ask for a ride home.

                         HENRI
          Principal called. Said there was
          an incident.

          John stares out the window, guilty.

                         JOHN
          A guy was messing with me. I took
          care of it. Problem solved.

                         HENRI
          You're stronger and faster because
          of Earth's gravity -- you shouldn't
          use that advantage to settle petty
          scores.

                         JOHN
          It was no big deal. Don't blow it
          out of proportion.

                         HENRI
          You can't risk everything over
          wounded pride.

                         JOHN
          I wasn't looking for a fight. It
          just happened. Get off my back.
          Henri pulls a printout from his coat. John unfolds it.
          ANGLE ON PRINTOUT: It's from the Florida Keynoter website
          and features a photo of the charred stilt house.
          John's gut churns as he stares at the image.

                         HENRI
          Article says it was arson.

                         JOHN
          We were clean. There's no way the
          Mogs can track us here.
          Henri shakes his head, shifts into gear and starts off.

                         HENRI
          They can track us anywhere. I
          think it's time you saw what you're
          really up against.

          Sunlight razors across workbenches cluttered with rusty

          is open on the floor between them. John lifts his hand and
          holds it over the crystals.

          ONE RISES.
          It's white and as thick as two fingers. It floats in front
          of John's face. He tentatively reaches out. When he grips
          it, a shock wave of light blasts out, totally WIPING OUT THE
          FRAME and transporting him into

          A VISCERAL MEMORY.

          EXT. LORIEN - NIGHT

          EXPLOSIONS rock and the SCREAMS of the dying echo. AN OLD
          MAN hustles A TERRIFIED BOY through the murderous
          bombardment. The air is choked with ash and smoke.
          The boy is 7-year-old John. The man is his grandfather.
          Young John glances up and sees

          AN ARMADA OF BATTLESHIPS
          eclipsing Lorien's two moons. The angular hulls of the craft
          are scarred from galactic battles new and ancient and unleash
          an endless crisscrossing FRENZY OF MISSILES.

                         GRANDFATHER

          Keep moving.

          EXT. TEMPLE - NIGHT

          It wouldn't look out of place in ancient Rome. Young John
          and his grandfather race up the steps.

          INT. SANCTUARY - TEMPLE - NIGHT

          A statue of Lorien's most famous warrior, Pittacus Lore,
          towers in the middle of the chamber. His noble face is
          illuminated in a shaft of flame-tainted moonlight.

          FOOTSTEPS ECHO!
          Young John and his grandfather scramble across the space and
          straight into the path of

          TWO MOGADORIAN SOLDIERS.
          The Soldiers' pallid faces flash with smiles. Swords drawn,
          they move in for the kill when one is skewered in the throat
          by a crystal-handled dagger.

                         MAGENTA LIGHT

                         

                         

                         

                         

          40.
          spurts from the wound. The Soldier's body fractures like
          glass and DISINTEGRATES in a shower of embers as he drops to
          the floor. The other Mogadorian spins and trades SPARKING
          sword strokes with

          A CLOAKED FIGURE.
          It's a violent battle of wills which ends when the Cloaked
          Figure kicks up the dead Soldier's sword and impales it into
          the Mogadorian's chest. The Soldier EVISCERATES in a cloud
          of HISSING cinders.
          Young John watches in awed terror as the Cloaked Figure steps
          towards him and pulls back his hood.

          IT'S HENRI.
          He looks younger, the years of hiding have aged him. John's
          grandfather lifts a familiar crystal pendant from his neck
          and places it over Young John's head.

                         GRANDFATHER
          This is your Cepan. Go with him.

                         YOUNG JOHN
          No!

                         HENRI
          Your life is my life now. I will
          always protect you.

                         (TO HENRI)
          He must survive.
          A BLAST scorches across the space. Henri spots

          A MOGADORIAN COMMANDER
          hunkered behind a column, his red coat billows behind him
          like a curse.

                         GRANDFATHER
          They are already hunting you! Go!
          Henri plucks a crystal ankle-dagger from his boot, grabs
          young John and charges up. As the Commander breaks cover,
          Henri hurls the dagger.

                         THE COMMANDER
          dives out of its path but ROARS as the blade SPARK-RIPS
          across his right cheek like a hot poker.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          41.

          EXT. TEMPLE - NIGHT

          Henri yanks Young John by the hand. They take off in one
          direction while John's grandfather heads off in the other.

          A MOGADORIAN TRANSPORT CRAFT
          suddenly swoops between them. The HOWLS of its occupants
          ricochet through the night. The heat from its engines washes
          the ground, warping the destruction like a ghastly mirage as
          two bay doors open. Young John looks back through the heat-
          haze and catches a impressionistic view as

                         TWO PIKEN
          leap out. Their reptilian bodies ripple with muscle and
          their oversize heads glint with raptor-like jaws. The Piken
          mercilessly rip into John's grandfather. Young John races to
          help, but Henri wrenches him back. CAMERA PUSHES IN TIGHT ON
          YOUNG JOHN'S FACE as he screams...

                         YOUNG JOHN
          Nooooooooooo!
          THE MEMORY ENDS and we...

          MATCH CUT TO:

          INT. GARAGE - DAY

          TIGHT ON JOHN screaming...

                         JOHN
          Nooooooooooo!
          He drops the crystal and stumbles back. The experience has
          left him traumatized. Henri steps towards him, but John is
          too overwhelmed and runs out.

          EXT. STREAM - WOODS - DAY

          A stone angrily SKIPS across the water. John is about to
          toss another when Bernie Kosar trots into view. He ruffles
          the dog's fur but doesn't turn when Henri steps out of the
          woods and crosses to his side.

                         JOHN
          I saw my grandfather. I saw what
          you did to the Mogadorians -- you
          saved my life.

                         HENRI
          A lot of Lorics sacrificed their
          lives so that you could live.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          42.
          John is still trying to process the memory.

                         JOHN
          He said I must survive.

                         HENRI
          The Elders had a plan. You weren't
          on that ship by chance. The nine
          of you were chosen for a reason.
          Even if only two of you live,
          together you'll pose a grave threat
          to our enemy.
          Consumed by bitterness, John hurls another stone.

                         JOHN
          You saw what they did to Lorien.
          How can nine or six or two of us
          take on that army? It's hopeless.
          Henri knows he has to pull him out of this mournful funk.

                         HENRI
          I never thought we'd get off Lorien
          alive -- but we did. I didn't know
          how we could survive on a strange
          planet -- but we have. I gave us
          six months before the Mogs found us
          -- it's been 10 years. Don't give
          up now.
          Henri grips John's shoulders.

                         HENRI
          You have the potential to do great
          things. Even if you don't see it --
          I do.

                         JOHN
          How can you put so much faith in
          me?

                         HENRI
          Because your life is my life. If
          you quit, then everything I've
          worked for and sacrificed is
          meaningless.

                         (BEAT)
          Remember -- nothing is inevitable.
          The fragile SILENCE is broken when John's cell phone BLEATS.
          He scans a text.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          43.

                         JOHN
          It's Sarah. The Block Party's
          tonight. I'll say I can't make it.
          Henri sees John is wracked with doubt and confusion.

                         HENRI
          No... go.
          John looks at him, surprised by this paternal gesture.

                         HENRI
          You've had enough for one day.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. MAIN STREET - PARADISE - NIGHT

          A Halloween parade drifts past the CROWDS packing the
          sidewalks. Icicle lights twinkle in the trees. EXCITED KIDS
          in costume zigzag past John. It's small-town Americana at
          its best. ET waddles by holding a JEDI's hand.

          A SLAP ON GLASS.
          John turns and is amused to find Sam standing among the
          mannequins in the display window of a sporting goods store.

          INT. ED'S SPORTING GOODS STORE - NIGHT

          An annoying CHIME plays as the door opens and John enters.
          The store is deserted. The stock needs to be updated and the
          shelves could use a dust. Sam approaches wearing an apron.

                         JOHN
          You work here?

                         SAM
          Not by choice.
          (pointing to sign)
          Ed's my stepdad. He's under the
          delusion that if people eat enough
          candy apples and kettle corn,
          they'll suddenly have the urge to
          buy sporting goods.
          John plucks a hockey mask from the basket on the counter.

                         SAM
          I put those on special tonight for
          any wannabe Jason Voorhees.
          Sam pulls off his apron, revealing a T-shirt emblazoned with
          the words âFuture Supervillainâ.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          44.

                         SAM
          Screw this. Let me lock up. I'll
          hang with you.
          He steps to the door and twists the closed sign into view.

                         JOHN
          What about your stepdad?

                         SAM
          He hit the tavern at 6:00. He's
          already hammered by now. I'll
          probably find him passed out on the
          doorstep. Every night is trick âr
          treat at my house.

          EXT. STREET - NIGHT

          John and Sam wander past the parade floats lined up along the
          road bordering the woods. Stalls sell hot dogs and cotton
          candy. John subtly scans the crowd.

                         SAM
          She's over there.
          John follows Sam's gaze and finds Sarah taking shots of some
          KIDS dunking for apples. She pulls the camera from her eye,
          sees John and smiles as he approaches.

                         SARAH
          You made it.
          (re: Sam's shirt)
          Like the T-shirt, Sam.

                         SAM
          Guidance Counsellor said I need to
          set goals for myself. Figured I'd
          aim high.
          She looks back at John.

                         SARAH
          What do you think of Halloween in
          Paradise?
          John regards a particularly over-the-top float.

                         JOHN
          They should pull out all the stops
          next year.

                         SARAH
          Well, you haven't had the full
          experience until you've been on the
          Haunted Hayride.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          45.
          She motions to the picnic area where TEENS are lining up to
          get on tractor-pulled hay wagons. The wagons lurch through
          the mouth of a giant cutout devil and into the woods.

                         SARAH
          Give me a sec.
          She steps to the face-painting booth. It's sponsored by the
          local realtor who is Sarah's mom, Annie. Sarah hands Annie
          her camera. Sam whispers to John.

                         SAM
          I'm impressed.
          Before John can respond, Sarah steps back.

                         SARAH
          You guys ready?

                         SAM
          Three on a wagon might get a little
          crowded. I'll meet you two on the
          other side.
          He gives John a not-so-subtle wink of encouragement. John
          and Sarah join the end of the line and watch Sam head away.

                         SARAH
          Sam's cool.

                         JOHN
          Definitely unique.

                         SARAH
          I haven't really talked to him
          since 8th grade. Mark had a tight
          circle. If you weren't a jock or
          cheerleader, you didn't exist.

                         JOHN
          I'm glad you broke free.

                         SARAH
          Me too.
          OFF their growing connection...

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

          The path is lined with human heads piked to wooden stakes.
          SCREAMS, WAILS and GHOULISH HOWLS boom from hidden speakers.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          46.
          OMINOUS POV: WATCHES from the trees as a wagon with John and
          Sarah RATTLES into view. It's driven by the GRIM REAPER.

          FIVE GIANT RUBBER SPIDERS
          drop from the trees. Sarah freaks as the arachnids dangle
          over their heads on wires. She rubs her hair, flustered,
          looks over at John, who is coolly amused by the cheap scares.

                         SARAH
          Not even a flinch. None of this
          scares you, does it?

                         JOHN
          I'm trembling on the inside.
          He smiles.

                         SARAH
          You can smile. I was starting to
          have my doubts.
          She takes his hand. They CLATTER past a series of grisly

                         TABLEAUX:
          A TEEN jerks and SCREAMS in mock agony as he is fried in an
          antiquated electric chair.
          A BLOOD-SPLATTERED DOCTOR CACKLES as he hacksaws the legs off
          a CHEERLEADER chained to a gurney.
          A squad of blood-hungry VAMPIRIC FOOTBALL PLAYERS attacks a
          rival team of WEREWOLVES.

          EXT. CLEARING - WOODS - NIGHT

          Ghosts float in the branches as the wagon LURCHES to a stop.

                         GRIM REAPER
          Hell's Gate, everybody off.
          The duo reluctantly clambers off the back and watches as the
          hay wagon circles back the way it came.

                         SARAH
          Once we make it through, we're home
          free.

                         A SKELETON
          pendulums in front of them. Sarah SCREAMS and clenches
          John's hand harder. A pathway of lights floods on,
          illuminating a skull-capped gate. The words

          âYOUR NUMBER'S UP!â

          are scrawled across it in fake blood.

          EXT. TUNNEL - WOODS - NIGHT

          John and Sarah step through the gate and enter a natural
          tunnel of dense, overhanging branches. A fog machine gently
          COUGHS, and spiderwebs stretch across the sides.
          They are about 20 feet into the tunnel when the lights go
          out. Somewhere a CHAINSAW sputters to life. White strobe
          lights suddenly flare on and

          TWO CHAINSAW-WIELDING ZOMBIES
          burst through the gates behind them. The teens take off.
          It's like a flickering scene from a demented silent movie.
          The Zombies have almost caught up when the strobe abruptly
          ends. The SOUND of the chainsaws FADES and John and Sarah
          stop, panting and LAUGHING with relief.

                         SARAH
          That was insane.

          IT'S PITCH BLACK.
          A werewolf HOWLS somewhere in the darkness. Something
          brushes past John's leg. He spins, suddenly unsure.

                         JOHN
          What was that?

                         SARAH
          Just part of the ride.
          He turns, sees a flash of purple light and hears the rustle
          of HEAVY FOOTSTEPS on all sides.

                         JOHN
          Are you sure?
          As he steps forward,

          A THICK BRANCH
          cuts through the dark and viciously SMACKS John on the back.
          He drops to the ground like a sack. Figures emerge from the
          shadows and he hears a DESPERATE STRUGGLE behind him.

                         SARAH
          Let go! Stop it!
          John tries to stand, but a boot CRACKS him in the ribs.
          Another strikes the side of his face. He is surrounded. His
          attackers are brutal and unrelenting. Over the LOOPING
          SOUNDTRACK OF B-MOVIE NOISES, Sarah's muffled SCREAMS DIM.

                         JOHN
          Sarah! Sa-
          His voice is cut off as a fist SMASHES into his jaw and the
          steel cap of a combat boot SLAMS his groin. John staggers up
          but is viciously kicked back to the ground.
          PUSH IN ON JOHN'S FACE as it hardens with blind rage. In a
          blur of motion he reaches up, grabs two of his attackers by
          their coats and hammers their skulls together. As they drop,
          John spins to meet his other two foes with

          BLINDING PALMS OF LIGHT.
          The assailants are illuminated in the phosphorescent glare.
          They're not Mogadorians but rather

          FOOTBALL JOCKS.
          One is Mark Jayne's buddy Kevin. They're wearing zombie
          makeup and military fatigues and have night-vision goggles
          strapped to their faces.
          John angrily strides forward, palm outstretched.
          NIGHT-VISION POV: Everything is an overexposed blur until --

          WHAAAAM!!!
          John brutally clotheslines one, then pummel-rams Kevin in the
          chest, sending him flying back 10 feet into a tree. Kevin
          slumps, out for the count. John arcs a glowing hand through
          the darkness.

          SARAH IS GONE.
          He plucks up the Jocks' fallen goggles and heads off with
          Terminator-like determination.

          EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

          Sarah is carried through the woods by TWO ZOMBIE JOCKS in
          camouflage fatigues and night-vision goggles. She SCREAMS.

                         SARAH
          Let go of me!
          She futilely tries to wrestle free.

          Sam is waiting by the exit to the hayride when he hears --

          SARAH (O.S.)

          Help! Somebody!
          Something about her terrified tone alerts Sam.

                         SAM
          Sarah?
          She doesn't answer. He hesitates a moment, then charges into
          the woods.

          INT. WOODS - NIGHT

          Freaky shadows crisscross as John uses his luminescent palms
          to navigate his way through the labyrinth of trees.

          Sam scrambles blindly through the darkness.

          JOHN (O.S.)

          SARAH!
          Sam turns in the direction of JOHN'S VOICE. He's about to
          head towards it when

          TWO ZOMBIE JOCKS
          trudge into view. Sam darts behind a tree. Suddenly, the
          area is flooded with preternatural white light. He can hear
          the sounds of a SCUFFLE and one of the Jocks flies past and
          CRASHES in a heap while the other SCREAMS.

          JOCK (O.S.)
          You're blinding me! Stop!
          Sam cautiously sneaks a peek, shields his eyes with a hand.
          WHAT HE SEES: John pins the Jock to a tree and holds a
          luminous palm up to the lenses of the teen's goggles.

                         JOHN
          Where's Sarah? Tell me!!

                         JOCK
          Shepherd Falls. Now turn off that
          damn flashlight!
          John rips off the Jock's goggles, then pile-slides him 15
          feet into a rotten stump and takes off in a blur of speed.
          CAMERA STAYS ON SAM. OFF his stunned reaction...

                         CUT TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          50.

          EXT. SHEPHERD FALLS - WOODS - NIGHT

          A rocky promontory overlooks a crescent-shaped waterfall
          which drops into a swimming hole below. The Zombie Jocks
          carry Sarah into view and dump her in front of Mark. She's
          wild-cat angry when she sees him.

                         SARAH
          Are you crazy! Where's John?
          Mark nods the Zombie Jocks away.

                         MARK
          Relax. It's a practical joke.

                         SARAH
          I swear if you hurt him --

                         MARK
          Why do you give a shit?

                         SARAH
          Get out of my face, Mark, you're
          pathetic.

                         MARK
          I'm the best thing that ever
          happened to you and I'm giving you
          one more chance.
          Appalled by his hubris, Sarah turns to leave.

                         MARK
          Don't walk away from me!
          Mark grabs her. Sarah wrenches free, but loses her balance
          and falls back on the ground. Mark's rage is transplanted by
          concern. He steps towards her to help when --

          JOHN (O.S.)
          Back off!
          Mark watches John step out. Blood trickles from a cut above
          John's right eye.

                         SARAH
          John! Are you okay?
          He nods. Mark looks past him, confused.

                         MARK
          Where the hell are Kevin and Joe?
          John holds up a clutch of night-vision goggles.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          51.

                         JOHN
          They got spooked.

                         MARK
          Hey, those are police property!
          John flings them over Mark's head into the water.

                         MARK
          I'm going to kill you!
          With lightning speed, John grabs Mark's arm, spins him,
          pinning him to a tree. Blinded by rage, John jerks Mark's
          arm up behind his back.

                         SARAH
          John! Stop!
          Mark is in real pain. Transfixed with anger, John keeps
          twisting. Sarah looks at him, pleading.

                         SARAH
          That's his throwing arm!
          But he doesn't stop until she finally steps forward and slaps
          him across the face. Startled, John lets go.

                         SARAH
          Football's all he's got.
          John stumbles back, ashamed, and heads into the woods. Sarah
          offers Mark a look of disgust and follows after John.

          EXT. TREE LINE - NIGHT

          John charges into view.

                         SARAH
          John! Wait.
          Sarah catches up.

                         SARAH
          I'm sorry, I didn't want you to
          break his arm.

                         JOHN
          I'm not mad at you. I'm mad at
          myself.
          She stops, faces him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          52.

                         SARAH
          I had no idea Mark would pull
          something like that. He has
          seriously gone off the deep end.

                         JOHN
          The guy's in love with you. Wants
          you back.

                         SARAH
          That's not love.
          Their eyes meet in the moonlight.

                         SARAH
          Walk me home?

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. STREET - NIGHT

          It's a picture-book perfect neighborhood. Most of the houses
          are festively decorated with front-yard graveyards and cobweb-
          festooned trees. John walks with Sarah. They come to the
          prettiest house on the block.

                         SARAH
          This is me.
          John stares at the dozen jack-o'-lanterns arranged on the
          porch. They glare back with flickering bucktooth grins.

                         SARAH
          I know. Wait until the Christmas
          decorations go up. My mom decks
          the halls with so many lights, you
          can see our house from space.
          Stray TRICK-OR-TREATERS race past. She motions to the cut
          above his eye, concerned.

                         SARAH
          You should see a doctor.

                         JOHN
          For this? Wouldn't waste their
          time.
          She looks at him, curious.

                         SARAH
          You're not going to tell me how you
          took out those football players,
          are you?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          53.
          He says nothing. She smiles.

                         SARAH
          I really don't get you.
          She steps closer.

                         SARAH
          But I feel like I can trust you.

                         JOHN
          You can.
          The air is charged.

                         SARAH
          Good night.
          Sarah swings open the white picket gate.

                         JOHN
          Wait.
          As she turns back, John steps forward and kisses her.
          Although taken by surprise, Sarah quickly succumbs to his
          passion. However, as their kiss intensifies,

          THE JACK-O'-LANTERNS
          rise and hover in midair. Sarah has her back to them, but
          when John's eyes momentarily flicker open, he sees the orbs
          grinning back. Startled, he pulls away from her.

                         THE PUMPKINS
          instantly drop and SMASH onto the porch, their candles
          blowing out on impact. Sarah spins and stares at the jack-o'-
          lanterns, pulp oozes through their cracked shells.
          Suspicious, she slowly turns, looks at John for an
          explanation. He does his best to cover his stunned reaction.
          Fat drops of RAIN begin to fall. John puts up his hood.

                         JOHN
          I better go.
          OFF Sarah, watching him melt into the downpour...

                         CUT TO:

          INT. LIVING ROOM - HOUSE - NIGHT

          Rain HAMMERS. Bernie is asleep on a blanket. John creeps
          into the darkness, soaked to the bone, when --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          54.

                         HENRI
          I heard on the police scanner that
          eight boys were beaten up in the
          woods tonight.
          Henri turns on a light, nursing a mug of coffee. Bernie
          wakes. John pulls off his hood. Henri looks at the cuts and
          bruises on John's face.

                         JOHN
          They won't talk.

                         HENRI
          That was a stupid thing to do.
          What were you thinking?

                         JOHN
          They attacked me. If I hadn't
          defended myself, I'd be in the ER
          right now. Would that have been
          the better choice?

                         (STEPPING FORWARD)
          You've got to start trusting me!
          Emotionally charged, John points his finger at Henri,
          accidentally causing the mug to telekinetically

          EXPLODE.
          Coffee and shards splatter across the floor. Henri looks at
          John, stunned. John shrugs sheepishly.

                         JOHN
          I was getting to that. I got a new
          Legacy.
          Henri absorbs that revelation.

                         HENRI
          Telekinesis. That's a big step.
          Must have been triggered by the
          fight.
          John doesn't correct him, averts his gaze.

                         HENRI
          I need to teach you how to control
          these abilities. We'll start
          working on that tomorrow.
          The conversation is suddenly interrupted by the repetitive
          WHINE OF AN ALARM. They cross to the bank of computers.
          Henri urgently stabs commands into a keyboard.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          55.

                         JOHN
          What is it?
          Henri pulls up a website.

                         HENRI
          We got a hit on one of the search
          words.

                         (SCANNING)
          It's a paranormal blog. âThey Walk
          Among Us!â
          ANGLE ON COMPUTER: A video buffers into motion. It's
          handheld and jerky. It WHIP-PANS over some sand and joins a
          group of Teens huddled over a figure lying in the surf. He's
          holding his ankle and light seeps between his fingers.
          John's chest pounds with fear as he realizes...

                         JOHN
          That's Sand Dollar Beach.

                         HENRI
          Looks like a cell phone camera.
          There's enough for the Mogs to ID
          your face.

                         JOHN
          Can you take it down?
          Henri remains ice calm and starts typing commands.

                         HENRI
          Working on it.

                         JOHN
          I'm sorry, Henri.

                         HENRI
          This isn't your fault. There's
          still nothing to trace us here.
          Henri glances up from his screen.

                         HENRI
          This could take all night. Get
          some sleep.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. BEDROOM - HOUSE - NIGHT

          John dumps his hoodie on the floor and slumps on his bed. He
          pulls his phone out of his jeans and sees a new text message
          from Sam. He CLICKS it open.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          56.
          PUSH IN ON JOHN'S FACE as he scans the message with alarm.
          He sits bolt-upright, gripped with dread. He checks the
          message again.

          TIGHT ON PHONE: âI SAW WHAT U DID IN THE WOODS. NEED 2 TALK.

          2NITE. MY GARAGE.â
          JOHN hits delete and clenches the phone in his palm. A bad
          night just got worse.

          INT. LIVING ROOM - HOUSE - NIGHT

          Henri is illuminated by the dirty glow on the computers.
          His fingers work the keys with expert precision. He's so
          focused on the task that he doesn't notice

                         JOHN
          blur ACROSS THE FRAME of one of the surveillance camera
          screens and disappear into the woods.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. SAM'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          John cautiously approaches. It's a â50s ranch style. The
          garage adjoins the house. The lights are out. RAIN bullets
          off the garage door which is partially concertinaed open.

          INT. GARAGE - SAM'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          John slides into view. It takes a second for his eyes to
          adjust. A pickup sits under a white tarp. There's no sign
          of Sam until he Boo Radley's out of the shadows behind him.

                         SAM
          I've narrowed it down to three
          possibilities: you're a genetic
          experiment, you're a freak of
          nature, or you're an
          extraterrestrial.

                         JOHN
          I don't know what you think
          happened tonight...
          Sam steps closer, watery reflections ripple down his face.

                         SAM
          Your hands lit up like a firefly on
          crack, you tossed those football
          players around like crash test
          dummies, and you took off faster
          than an Olympic runner.

                         SAM (CONT'D)

                         (BEAT)
          Did I leave anything out?
          John silently reels.

                         JOHN
          What do you want from me?

                         SAM
          I just want to know who you are.
          John looks at Sam, realizes he's not going to give up. He
          hesitates, then finally surrenders...

                         JOHN
          I'm a survivor from a planet called
          Lorien.
          Sam absorbs this confession with awe.

                         SAM
          Your dad... he's from there too?

                         JOHN
          Henri's not my dad. He's my
          Guardian. If he found out you knew
          about us, we'd be gone by morning.

                         (PLEADING)
          I don't want to leave Paradise.

                         SAM
          I won't tell anyone.
          John nods, grateful.

                         SAM
          There's something I want to show
          you.

                         CUT TO:
          The tarp is whipped off the pickup truck. It's an old Ford.
          Sam and John stand before it.

                         SAM
          The cops found it abandoned in the
          middle of Route 20, just south of
          White Sands, New Mexico. It was my
          dad's. He went missing six years
          ago. He was on one of his crazy
          fact-finding trips. He believed we
          weren't alone in the universe.
          Sam rubs his hand across the hood, wondering.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          58.

                         SAM
          Mom figured he was having an affair
          and took off. All these years I
          thought she was right. Now you're
          here.

                         JOHN
          That doesn't prove anything.

                         SAM
          It proves he wasn't crazy. I'm
          starting to think that he didn't
          bail on us... that maybe something
          else happened out there -- that he
          was taken.
          The moment is broken by the SLAM of the front door and the
          sound of ANGRY FOOTSTEPS. Sam instantly tenses.

                         SAM
          Guess the bar closed.

          ED (O.S.)
          Sam! Where are you?
          His speech is slurred and aggressive.

          ED (O.S.)
          You think I wouldn't hear you
          locked up early!
          John looks at Sam, shocked and concerned.

                         JOHN
          You going to be okay?

                         SAM
          If he finds you here, it'll be
          worse.

                         (BEAT)
          Go.
          Sam crosses to the door leading into the main house and heads
          inside. SHOUTS erupt almost immediately. John flinches,
          wanting to intervene, but finally turns, hustles under the
          garage door and slips into the night...

          INT. LIVING ROOM - HOUSE - DAY

          Henri is hammering at the keyboard of one of his computers.
          John enters with two mugs of coffee.

                         JOHN
          You look wiped.
          Henri turns and smiles playfully.

                         HENRI
          I wasn't the only who was up last
          night.
          John nervously hands Henri one of the cups and lies...

                         JOHN
          Sarah texted me. I went over to
          her house.
          Henri buys the explanation and swings back to his computers.

                         HENRI
          I've tried every trick I know, but
          I can't crack that blog's firewall.

                         JOHN
          There must be a way.

                         HENRI
          We need to find where the site's

          run through a labyrinth of servers,
          it could take weeks to track down.

                         JOHN
          I want to help.
          Henri takes a gulp of coffee and stands.

                         HENRI
          You can. Get changed.

          TIGHT ON A WELDING TORCH as it's sparked to life.
          Its flame HISSES as Henri sweeps it towards John, who is
          standing shirtless. Bernie watches, curious, as Henri washes
          the flame harmlessly up John's naked arm and torso.

          INT. HALL - PARADISE HIGH - DAY

          The walls are now adorned with Thanksgiving banners. John
          and Sam head past the lockers. Mark and the Jocks move out
          of their way, acknowledging the new high school dynamic.

          INT. KITCHEN - HOUSE - NIGHT

          Using his telekinesis, John strains to lift a tennis ball.
          It momentarily RATTLES, then stops. Henri is not impressed.

          EXT. WOODS - DAY

          Bernie darts ahead as John and Sarah walk through a crimson
          cascade of falling leaves. As they kiss, the leaves around
          them freeze midair and slowly begin to drift upwards.

          INT. GARAGE - SAM'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          John helps Sam with a dusty box. It's stuffed with Sam's
          dad's old papers and books. We CATCH tantalizing glimpses of
          images: Stonehenge, Machu Picchu, the Rings of Saturn...

          INT. INTERNET CAFE - NASHVILLE - DAY

          It's a Vandy student hangout. CAMERA DRIFTS over a row of
          computer terminals and FINDS the Teen Girl who torched the
          stilt house. She's studying her computer screen intently.
          REVERSE TO REVEAL: She is watching the cell phone footage of
          John on the âThey Walk Among Usâ blog.

          INT. KITCHEN - HOUSE - DAY

          Under Henri's watchful gaze, John focuses on a tennis ball.
          It RISES. John grins in triumph, causing the ball to drop
          and bounce on the floor. Strike two.

          INT. CAFETERIA - PARADISE HIGH - DAY

          Mark silently stews when he sees Sarah and John sitting
          together at a table.

          EXT. BACK YARD - HOUSE - DAY

          Bernie pogos on his back legs, trying to bite the tennis ball
          that John telekinetically hovers just out of the dog's reach.

          John is fully submerged in an old claw-foot tub.
          GO TO JOHN'S DISTORTED VIEW LOOKING UP at Henri as he drops a
          match into the tub. The liquid instantly IGNITES and we
          realize John's lying in gasoline. He sits up, rests his
          hands behind his head as the FLAMES harmlessly lick his face.

          INT. BACK YARD - HOUSE - DAY

          The trees are now bare. John stands 20 feet from Henri and
          nods. Henri flicks the switch of an automated tennis ball
          server. John's face is a mask of concentration as the yellow
          balls fly towards him. He holds up his hand and the balls

          STOP IN MIDAIR.
          It's like they've hit an invisible wall two feet from his
          hand. They hang there. John sees a smile sneak onto Henri's
          face and momentarily loses focus, causing the wall to
          collapse and the balls to drop into the mud.

          Bernie looks like a drowned rat. He's sitting in the tub
          being scrubbed by John and Sarah.

                         SARAH
          I don't see any family pictures
          around. I guess the photo aversion
          is hereditary.
          He greets the observation with a shrug. She carries on.

                         SARAH
          Your mom... grandparents. Is there
          anyone else in your life?

                         JOHN
          They died.

                         SARAH
          I'm sorry.

                         JOHN
          It was a long time ago. It's just
          me and my dad now.
          John uses a nail brush to clean the beagle's ears.

                         SARAH
          I get the feeling he doesn't like
          me very much.

                         JOHN
          It takes him a while to warm up to
          people.
          Sarah considers this.

                         SARAH
          Thanksgiving's tomorrow. Why don't
          you bring your dad and celebrate
          with us?

                         JOHN
          I don't know. Are there going to
          be a lot of people?

                         SARAH
          A tsunami of relatives. But don't
          worry, I'll shield you from the
          wave. Besides, I want everyone to
          meet you.
          She playfully splashes him. Their faces inch closer. They
          begin making out hot and heavy until Henri suddenly walks in.

                         HENRI
          I've found the --
          Caught in the act, the teens lurch away from each other.

          Just giving Bernie a quick bath.

                         HENRI
          You're clearly putting a lot of
          effort into it.

                         SARAH
          I better hit the road.

                         (TO JOHN)
          See you tomorrow. Twoish.

          INT. LIVING ROOM - HOUSE - DAY

          Henri sits in front of his computers. John enters with
          Bernie, who is wrapped in a beach towel. He begins drying
          the dog in front of the fire. Henri breaks the silence.

                         HENRI
          I finally tracked the location of
          that blog. It's a house in Warsaw,
          Indiana. About four hours from
          here. I'm heading up there
          tomorrow.

                         JOHN
          Sarah invited us to Thanksgiving.
          I told her we'd be there.

                         HENRI
          Send my regrets.

                         JOHN
          You shouldn't go alone. It could
          be dangerous.

                         HENRI
          I won't risk taking you. I'll
          leave early and be back by five.
          John looks up and sees Henri sitting in solitude.

                         JOHN
          Don't you ever get lonely?
          Surprised by the question, Henri swivels to face him.

                         HENRI
          How could I? I have you.

                         JOHN
          You know what I mean. All these
          years, there's never been anyone.

                         HENRI
          We aren't like humans. Once we
          fall in love, it's for life. The
          pain of separation is unbearable.
          Henri's face clouds with melancholy and he abruptly gets up.
          As he heads into the kitchen John studies him with new eyes.

          INT. KITCHEN - HOUSE - DAY

          Steam billows as Henri washes up. He keeps his back to John
          when he enters. John waits then softly asks...

                         JOHN
          What was her name?
          Henri slots a plate onto the draining board.

          Anastasia.

                         JOHN
          You left her to save me.

                         HENRI
          You're not responsible for what
          happened to her -- they are.
          He slowly turns and regards John with deep paternal concern.

                         HENRI
          I looked at her the way you look at
          Sarah.

                         (BEAT)
          She can't come with us when we
          leave -- and we always have to
          leave, you know that.
          John nods, not wanting to deal with that reality.

                         HENRI
          I was hoping to protect you from
          that pain.

                         JOHN
          You can't protect me from
          everything.

          The Halloween decorations have been replaced by a
          Thanksgiving display.
          Wearing khakis and a pale blue Oxford, John tentatively walks
          up the front path. The warm sound of LAUGHTER drifts from
          inside. He takes a breath and rings the doorbell.

          INT. KITCHEN - SARAH'S HOUSE - DAY

          It's like a Norman Rockwell cover come to life. Every inch
          of counter space is filled with platters of food.
          John watches Sarah, Annie, and a boisterous ASSORTMENT OF
          RELATIVES put the finishing touches to the Thanksgiving
          feast. KIDS rush in and out in a manic game of tag.
          John is captivated by the sense of family and celebration --
          things he's never known in his own life. Sarah steps over.
          She's wearing a funky-cool vintage dress.

          INT. DINING ROOM - SARAH'S HOUSE - DAY

          The table is decorated with garlands of autumn leaves and an
          elaborate pine cone centerpiece. Sarah places the last
          turkey-shaped gravy boat onto the table. She smiles at John.

                         SARAH
          You look dazed.

                         JOHN
          Just taking it all in.
          She crosses.

                         SARAH
          I'm glad you came.
          They tenderly kiss until Annie bustles in carrying a steaming
          bowl of mashed potatoes.

                         ANNIE
          Don't mind me.
          She puts the bowl on the table and grabs Sarah's camera.

                         ANNIE
          Let's get a picture of you two
          lovebirds.
          Sarah cringes as Annie lifts the camera to her eye.

                         SARAH
          Mom. No. John really doesn't like
          having his --

                         JOHN
          It's okay. Let her take it.
          The gesture means the world to Sarah. He puts his arm around
          her. Sarah nestles her face against his. As the flash WIPES

          OUT THE FRAME...

          She holds his hand under the table. It's Hallmark worthy
          until the carriage clock on the mantel CHIMES.

          IT'S SIX O'CLOCK.

          I need to check in with Henri.
          He exits.

          EXT. FRONT PORCH - SARAH'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          John speed dials as he steps out into the cold. He holds the
          phone to his ear. It rings three times and then is answered.

                         (INTO PHONE)
          Henri?
          CLICK. The call is hung up. Suddenly on edge, John redials.
          This time it's picked up immediately.

          MAN (V.O.)

                         (OVER PHONE)
          Are you one of them too?
          John reacts to the chilling menace of the Man's tone.

                         (INTO PHONE)
          Who are you? Where's Henri?
          CLICK. John jerks the phone from his ear and stares at it,
          panicked. He paces, desperate and unsure, then gets an idea
          and punches another number.

                         JOHN

                         (INTO PHONE)
          I need your help.

          INT. DINING ROOM - SARAH'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          The food is getting cold. Everybody is waiting for John.
          Sarah catches her mother's disapproving look.

                         SARAH
          I'll see what's taking him so long.

          EXT. PORCH - SARAH'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          Sarah steps out just in time to see John climb into a pickup
          truck. It's the one from Sam's garage.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          67.

                         SARAH
          John!
          He looks back.

                         JOHN
          It's Henri. I have to go. Sorry.
          OFF her confused disappointment as the truck SQUEALS away...

          INT. PICKUP - NIGHT - MOVING

          Sam is behind the wheel.

                         JOHN
          Thanks. I owe you.

                         SAM
          Anything to get out of Thanksgiving
          at my house.
          He offers John a weary smile.

                         SAM
          I checked out that blog on the way
          over. Saw the video. What was the
          deal with your ankle?
          John pulls up his khakis, shows Sam the trio of scars.

                         JOHN
          Death scars.

                         SAM
          They kind of look like the symbols
          in my dad's research.

                         (THINKING)
          You guys don't --

                         JOHN
          Abduct people? No.
          Irritated, he covers them back up.

                         SAM
          How about the ones you said were
          hunting you?

                         JOHN
          They're capable of anything.

                         (URGENT)
          We need to get to Warsaw -- now.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          68.
          Suddenly, John's cell phone RINGS. He snatches it up, but is
          disappointed to see the name âSARAHâ flashing on the LCD. He
          hits ignore and the truck hurtles into the dark.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. WARSAW HOUSE - NIGHT

          It's a dilapidated Victorian. Mist shrouds the yard which is
          littered with junked cars and trash. The pickup crawls to a
          stop in the shadows across the street.

          INT. PICKUP TRUCK - NIGHT

          The teens sit in silence.

                         JOHN
          Number 417. Henri tracked the URL
          to that house.
          Sam scans the street.

                         SAM
          I don't see his SUV anywhere.

                         JOHN
          He would have parked it across
          town.
          Sam opens the glove compartment and pulls out a revolver.

                         SAM
          Stole it from Ed.

                         (BEAT)
          Let's move.
          John yanks Sam's arm away from the door handle.

                         JOHN
          I called you because I needed a
          ride, not a sidekick. If I could
          have run here, I would have.

                         (BEAT)
          Go home. I'll call you when I get
          back.
          OFF Sam as John climbs out alone...

          EXT. WARSAW HOUSE - NIGHT

          It's graveyard quiet. John nervously sneaks down the side of
          the house. His breath fogs as he inch-CREAKS up the wooden

                         STEPS TO

          THE KITCHEN PORCH.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          69.
          He squats in front of the door. He holds up a luminescent
          palm and uses it like a flashlight to sweep the interior.
          WHAT HE SEES: Take-out boxes litter the filthy counter. The
          sink is swamped with dirty dishes. The light washes across a
          semiautomatic sitting by a packet of Lucky Strikes.

          SAM (O.S.)
          See anything?
          Annoyed, John spins and finds Sam creeping towards him.

                         JOHN
          I told you to go!

                         SAM
          They might know where my dad is!
          John realizes Sam is determined. He sweeps his hand back
          over the kitchen door. His palm illuminates a familiar

          CRYSTAL-HANDLED DAGGER.
          It's lying on the counter by the fridge.

                         JOHN
          Henri's here.
          John âturns offâ his palm and reaches for the door handle.
          Sam anxiously swats his arm away.

                         SAM
          Wait! Other than strength, speed
          and night-light, what powers have
          you got?

                         JOHN
          Telekinesis -- but that's a work in
          progress.

                         SAM
          No invisibility, X-ray vision,
          flight?

                         JOHN
          Sam, we drove here.
          Sam takes a deep breath, psyching himself up.

                         SAM
          Okay. I'm ready. Let's do it.
          But as John reaches for the door handle, the kitchen light
          suddenly turns on and a MAN enters. He's built like a
          wrestler and goes by the name of FRANK.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          70.

          INT. KITCHEN - WARSAW HOUSE - NIGHT

          With a Lucky Strike clenched between his lips, Frank picks up
          the packet on the table and is pissed to discover it's empty.
          He crushes it in his fist and crosses to the door.

          EXT. BACK PORCH - WARSAW HOUSE - NIGHT

          John and Sam are gone. Frank steps out and locks the door.
          He flicks away his cigarette as he heads down the stairs.
          CAMERA FOLLOWS the butt as it cartwheels into

          SAM'S LAP.
          He's crouched next to John at the side of the porch. He
          frantically begins trying to extinguish the stub. John
          clamps his hand over Sam's mouth and snuffs the cigarette
          between his fingers. Once Frank's safely around the corner,
          John releases his hand.
          The duo silently climbs onto the porch. John squats in front
          of the door. His hand shakes as he holds it out towards the
          lock and concentrates.

                         SAM
          Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up.
          There's a LOUD CLICK.

                         SAM
          You just dead bolted it! Way to
          go!

                         JOHN
          New plan -- follow Lucky Strike.
          Text me if he comes back.
          Sam sneaks off after Frank.

          INT. KITCHEN - WARSAW HOUSE - NIGHT

          TIGHT ON LOCK as the dead bolt turns by itself and the door
          swings open. John cautiously crosses the threshold. He
          holds up his right hand, dims his palm to a dull-blue glow.
          He retrieves Henri's dagger and tentatively heads into...

          INT. HALL - WARSAW HOUSE - NIGHT

          Everything is filmed with dust. It's freezing and John's
          BREATH FOGS in the hazy aura his palm casts. The naked
          floorboards CREAK. Fear bites as John scans the lifeless
          gloom, not sure where to start.
          TIGHT ON HIS SHOE as it brushes a mousetrap. SNAP!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          71.
          His breath catches in his throat. He âturns offâ his hand.
          His heart thumps as he waits for something to react to the
          noise. But nothing does. As his eyes adjust to the dark, he
          notices a rectangle of light faintly leaking from the door
          that leads down into...

          INT. BASEMENT - WARSAW HOUSE - NIGHT

          The ancient stairs sag as John slowly descends. The space is
          illuminated by a single naked bulb. The sound of DRIPPING
          WATER hammers the silence. John scans the rabbit warren of
          rooms and sees a figure chained to a chair in the corner.

                         JOHN
          Henri!
          He races over. But as he reaches for Henri's gag, a YOUNG
          MAN steps out of the shadows holding a baseball bat. John
          turns too late and the bat strikes his left side. He drops
          the dagger as he falls to the floor, his ribs searing. The
          man, BRET, raises the bat again. John focuses his mind.

                         THE BAT
          whips out of Bret's grip and torpedoes towards John -- who
          ducks out of the way as the bat flies past. Confused, Bret
          lurches forward. John scrambles for the bat, clenches it in
          his hand, and swings it into the young man's legs.

                         BRET
          knocks the light as he topples into a column and CRASHES onto
          the cement, out cold. It's over in a violent blur. John
          sits stunned for a moment. The swinging bulb casts surreal
          shadows as he spins back to Henri, telekinetically âunlocksâ
          the padlock securing the chains, and rips off the gag.
          Henri is groggy and his face is swollen from brutal beatings.

                         HENRI
          You shouldn't be here.

                         JOHN
          Your life is my life, remember?
          Henri tries to shake his drug-induced haze.

                         HENRI
          I talked my way in. Thought the
          big guy was buying it.
          He rubs a wound on his neck.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          72.

                         HENRI
          I was asking him about the video
          when the other one shot me from
          behind... some sort of animal
          tranq.

                         (DISPIRITED)
          I'm getting rusty.
          Suddenly, John's phone VIBRATES. It's a message from Sam --

          âGET OUT NOW!â

                         JOHN
          We have to leave!
          John helps Henri up, they race for the stairs when Bret's
          hand grabs John's ankle, tripping him to the floor.

                         JOHN
          Henri!
          Henri smashes his boot into Bret's face, knocking him out for
          good. John staggers up, they spin for the stairs just as

          SAM AND FRANK
          head down them into view. Frank holds the revolver against
          Sam's neck. Their shadows crisscross under the swaying bulb.

                         FRANK
          Stay planted or I'll blow your
          friend's head off.
          Henri looks at John in shock.

                         JOHN

                         (RE: SAM)
          He came to help.
          John and Henri put up their hands. John focuses on the gun,
          but as the light bulb sweeps past, he causes it to EXPLODE.

          THE ROOM PLUNGES INTO DARKNESS.
          Henri body-slams Frank, sending the revolver skittering. But
          as he wrenches Sam to safety,

                         THE KEYS
          to the pickup fly out of Sam's pocket and slide under the
          stairs. John flashes on his palm, casting everything in
          eerie blue light.
          On all fours, Frank scrambles for the fallen weapon. It's
          almost within reach when he is lifted right off the ground by
          an invisible force.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          73.
          Sam looks over at John, impressed.

                         FRANK

                         (FREAKING OUT)
          You're the one from the video!
          You're the one they're after.
          With tremendous telekinetic effort, John slams Frank against
          the ceiling.

                         JOHN
          Tell me what you know!
          Franks says nothing. John trains his palm light on the big
          man's face. It's like a blinding interrogation lamp.

                         JOHN
          Start talking!

                         FRANK
          I don't know what they're called.
          The one in the red coat said he'd
          kill me if I didn't do what he
          wanted.
          This revelation stuns Henri.

                         HENRI
          The Mogadorians... they've been
          here?
          Frank nods in terror.

                         FRANK
          He told me to call if anyone came
          asking about the video.
          Sweat beads John's face from the mental exertion.

                         JOHN
          Did you?

                         FRANK

                         (RE: HENRI)
          They wanted me to hold your friend
          until they got here.
          Henri urgently retrieves Sam's gun and his dagger.

                         HENRI
          We need to go! Now!
          John âreleasesâ Frank, who drops onto the floor like a whale
          and is knocked out. At that moment, a razor-thin line of
          dust drops from the floorboards above.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          74.

          SOMEONE IS UPSTAIRS.
          John immediately extinguishes his palm. The trio stands
          frozen, necks craned up, ears pricked as the floorboards
          CREAK above them. They are definitely not alone.

          INT. HALL - WARSAW HOUSE - NIGHT

          FOUR MOGADORIAN SOLDIERS stalk through the house. Their long
          black coats SILENTLY sweep. One sniffs the air like a
          bloodhound and motions towards the basement door...

          INT. BASEMENT - WARSAW HOUSE - NIGHT

          BLAAAAM! -- the door is shredded off its hinges and flies
          down the stairs. The Mogadorian patrol storms through the
          cloud of splinters. Frank and Bret lie where they fell, but
          there's no sign of John, Henri or Sam.
          Pissed, one of the Mogadorians strides towards a small
          blacked-out window. He punches out the glass with his fist
          and catches sight of Sam clambering over the back fence!

          INT. PICKUP - NIGHT

          John, Henri and Sam pile in.

                         JOHN
          Sam, get us out of here!
          Sam reaches into his jeans, then frantically checks his
          pockets.

                         SAM
          I must have dropped the keys!
          Henri keeps his cool, looks at John.

                         HENRI
          Start the engine.

                         JOHN
          I can't.
          Henri's calm eyes never leave him.

                         HENRI
          Yes, you can.
          John nods, puts his hand on the dash and closes his eyes.
          The engine TURNS OVER but doesn't start. Sam looks up the
          street, panicked, as

                         A MOGADORIAN

                         

                         

                         

                         

          75.
          climbs out of a black SUV and storms towards them.

                         SAM
          Hurry up!
          John's brow is furrowed with concentration. The Mog
          unsheathes his sword as he runs. With a superhuman leap, he
          lands on the hood -- TWAAAAACK! John and Henri spin out of
          the way as the sword SHATTERS the windshield and impales in
          the back of the seat, missing them by a mouse hair.
          As the Mogadorian withdraws the sword to strike again, Henri
          sweeps up his dagger and stakes it into the Mog's neck.

          VRRRROOMMM!
          The engine ROARS to life. The Mogadorian tumbles off the
          hood, magenta light spurting from his wound. John turns to
          Sam, who is petrified, and SCREAMS...

                         JOHN

          DRIVE!
          Sam wrenches the shaft into gear and floors the gas. The
          Mogadorian EVISCERATES in a frenzy of embers. The truck
          bursts through the blizzard of sparks and STREAK-PEELS away.

          CAMERA TRACKS the swish of a familiar red coat as its owner
          slowly descends the stairs, PANS UP PAST his right hand,
          which methodically twists two meditation balls, TO REVEAL

          THE MOGADORIAN COMMANDER.
          He's the one who slaughtered Number 3 in Africa. His men
          part as he steps into view and crosses to Frank and Bret who
          are chained to chairs. A Soldier stands behind each one.
          Frank looks at the Commander in terror.

                         FRANK
          I called you like I said. It's not
          my fault they got away!
          The Commander steps into the moonlight that seeps through the
          window. We get our first good look at his face. A gnarled
          scar runs down his right cheek, identifying him as the same
          Mogadorian Henri wounded in the escape from Lorien. His skin
          is deathly pale and his eyes have a cold purple tint.

                         MOGADORIAN COMMANDER
          Where did they go?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          76.
          His accent is thick and his voice is unnerving.

                         FRANK
          How should I know? The kid had me
          pinned to the ceiling.
          The Commander turns to Bret.

                         MOGADORIAN COMMANDER
          Where did they go?
          Bret is too freaked to even speak. The Commander nods to the
          Soldiers. They grab Frank and Bret by the heads and yank
          open their mouths. Frank watches in confused terror as the
          Commander holds one of the meditation balls.

          DOZENS OF TINY RAZOR-BLADES
          suddenly flower open across its surface and viciously spin.
          With cold-blooded calm, the Commander drops the ball into
          Frank's mouth. OFF its terrible DRILL-LIKE WHIR...

          Is he serious?

          pool which is drained for the winter and rattles with frozen
          leaves. Henri steps out of the motel office with a key.

          Henri lets John inside, chains the door and draws the sun-

          We leave at nightfall.

          Henri, this is insane. They still
          don't know where we live.
          Henri seethes.

          It's only a matter of time. They
          know our faces. They saw Sam. How
          long has he known?

                         JOHN

          Henri is floored and hurt by the admission.

                         HENRI
          I trusted you and you lied to me!
          John bows his head, can't meet Henri's gaze.

                         JOHN
          Only because I knew how you'd react
          and I didn't want to leave
          Paradise.
          Henri paces, tries to quell his emotions.

                         HENRI
          Now we don't have a choice. The
          Mogs are using humans to trap us.
          From this point on -- no more
          towns. No more schools. We're
          going off the grid until we find
          the others.

                         JOHN
          No.
          His tone is defiant.

                         HENRI
          This isn't a discussion.
          In a flash of pent-up anger, John holds up his hand and
          telekinetically sweeps Henri off his feet and pins him
          against the wall. Henri looks at him, stunned.

                         JOHN
          I'm not leaving without saying
          goodbye to Sarah.
          Henri fixes him with a steel-edged stare.

                         HENRI
          Let. Me. Down.
          Spent, John releases Henri who slides to the floor, shaken.
          The dynamics of their relationship forever changed. Henri
          finally stands.

          He doesn't look back as he walks out the door. CAMERA STAYS
          ON SARAH as she sinks onto the bed and the dogs comfort her.

          INT. DOWNSTAIRS - MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          Party-goers pack the hall and kitchen watching Kevin consume
          an impossible amount of beer through a funnel and hose.

                         TEENS
          Drink! Drink! Drink!
          Drained and numb, John heads the other way and fails to
          notice the smoke seeping from under the basement door.

          EXT. MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          John strides down the driveway, bleak-faced. He's about to
          straddle the motorcycle when he hears a muffled EXPLOSION.
          He looks back and sees

                         SMOKE
          billowing from the side of the house. He bolts towards the
          front door, SCREAMS at a JOCK as he passes.

                         JOHN
          Call 911!
          As he races inside...

          INT. MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          It's total chaos. Smoke and FLAMES plume up from the
          basement. Terrified Teens scramble. John thrashes through
          the crowd, SHOUTING --

                         JOHN
          Sarah!

          EXT. BACK YARD - MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          The panicked evacuation spills out. A window EXPLODES and
          orange flames lick the cold night air. John sees Emily
          stumble out clutching one of Mark's dogs, Abby.

                         JOHN
          Where's Sarah?

                         EMILY
          Went back for Dozer.
          Another EXPLOSION rocks. A COUPLE of drunk Jocks CHEER.
          John looks back at the house. The fire has taken hold with
          incredible speed. The living room curtains are ABLAZE.

          A DOG'S HAUNTING HOWL

                         

                         

                         

                         

          85.
          cuts over the sound of the HISSING FLAMES. It's coming from
          the second floor. John charges past Mark, towards the house.

                         MARK
          It's too late. You can't get
          through!
          John ignores him and runs into the inferno.

          INT. LIVING ROOM - MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          FLAMES sprint up the walls and clouds of black smoke spew
          from the sectional sofa. Immune to the heat, John heads into
          the front hall and finds

                         THE STAIRCASE
          is fully engulfed. Fearless, he clambers up the flaming
          steps. His jeans and shirt catch fire. He's almost reached
          the top when the staircase BREAKS AWAY behind him and
          DISINTEGRATES in a cloud of embers.

          INT. UPSTAIRS HALL - MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          It's a raging conflagration. The family portraits blister on
          the walls. John beelines towards Dozer's PLAINTIVE WAIL
          which reverberates over the UGLY ROAR of the fire.

          INT. GUEST ROOM - MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          Sarah is crouched by the heavy oak bed that dominates the
          corner of the room, COUGHING, eyes burning from the smoke and
          heat. Dozer is cowered underneath, HOWLING. Sarah
          desperately tries to move the bed but it won't budge.

          CRAAAACK!
          The door rips off its hinges. Through the smoky half-light,
          Sarah watches as John strides into the room, heroically
          backlit by flame.

                         SARAH
          John!

                         (FRANTIC)
          Dozer's under the bed. He's too
          scared to come out!
          John strides forward, grips the bed with one hand and
          effortlessly hoists it. Sarah looks at him, amazed, then
          scrambles forward and gently scoops Dozer into her arms.
          John puts the bed back down.

                         JOHN
          Don't let go of him. I promise I
          won't let go of you.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          86.
          As he lifts them...

          INT. UPSTAIRS HALL - MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          The trio heads into the hall just as an 8-foot section of the
          floor collapses in front of them. Unfazed, John sprints
          forward and bridges the hole.
          ANGLE ON SARAH as she stares at the burning chasm in terror
          and grips Dozer tighter.
          John touches down on the other side and doesn't slow as he
          powers down the hall, which is a SHRIEKING tunnel of fire.

          A BURNING BEAM
          breaks free and swings down in front of them. Sarah SCREAMS,
          but watches in stunned amazement as John sweeps it out of the
          way with a telekinetic flick of his hand.

          EXT. SIDE - MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          The second-floor window SHATTERS as John leaps out holding
          Sarah and Dozer. A ROARING tongue of fire whips his back as
          he drops to the ground and touches down with Sarah and Dozer.
          COUGHING and shell-shocked, Sarah puts the dog down.

                         JOHN
          You okay?
          She stares at him, unsure.

                         SARAH
          You walked through that fire
          without getting burned. I saw you
          stop that beam.
          SIRENS wail in the distance.

                         JOHN
          I'll explain everything... but not
          here...
          (offering his hand)
          Sarah... please?
          As they take off into the woods, the IMAGE FREEZES, then
          REWINDS. John and Sarah kneel in the shadows, then FLY
          BACKWARDS up through the window and INTO the burning house.
          REVERSE TO REVEAL the Red-Haired Teen watching playback on
          his FlipVideo camera, amazed. He runs to the back of the
          house and finds Mark.

          INT. WOODS - NIGHT

          John and Sarah walk in SILENCE, dappled in moonlight. He
          catches her staring at him.

                         JOHN
          Please don't look at me like that.

                         SARAH
          I'm sorry. I'm still trying to
          process everything I saw and I keep
          coming to the same conclusion --
          what you did isn't possible.

                         JOHN
          It is for me.

                         SARAH
          Who are you?
          (off his hesitation)
          For once please tell me the truth.
          It's the hardest thing he's ever had to do.

                         JOHN
          My name isn't John. I don't have a
          name, just a number. 4. In fact,
          my whole life can be reduced to
          numbers: like 15 million -- that's
          how many light years it takes to
          get from my planet to Earth. 38 --
          that's how many towns I've lived
          in. Or 3,671 -- that's how many
          days I've been running from an
          enemy that wants me dead. I lied
          to you, Sarah, because I lie to
          everyone. That's how I stay alive.
          Tears of relief brim as he finally reveals his soul.

                         JOHN
          I shouldn't be telling you any of
          this. It's dangerous.
          Emotionally spent, John leans against a tree. She steps
          towards him and brushes her hand down his cheek.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          88.

                         SARAH
          I don't care. I just want to be
          with you.

                         JOHN
          I want that too. But if I stay you
          could get hurt. I have to leave to
          keep you safe.
          Sarah absorbs the bitter reality, reaches for his hand.

                         SARAH
          There's something I want to give
          you first.

          A PHOTOGRAPH OF SARAH AND JOHN
          sharpens INTO FOCUS. It's the one Annie took of them at
          Thanksgiving. John and Sarah stand in the eerie red glow.
          She gently tongs the image into a bath of fixing solution.

                         SARAH
          So you'll always remember me.
          With exquisite tenderness they kiss. John's palms shimmer.
          The intensity of the luminescence builds with their rising
          passion. They sink to the floor and the light crescendos in
          an ethereal flash that BLEACHES OUT THE FRAME.

          Where are we going? Is this about
          the fire? It was an accident.

          THE MOGADORIAN COMMANDER
          sitting in the back. His face is masked in shadow.

          We're hunting for one of the guests
          at your party.
          He holds up a netbook which flashes with the FlipVideo
          footage of John's rescue of Sarah. It's posted on YouTube.

                         MOGADORIAN COMMANDER
          Do you know this boy?

                         MARK
          Yeah, John Smith. But I didn't
          invite him.

                         MOGADORIAN COMMANDER
          He's a fugitive. We've been
          tracking him for some time.
          Mark smirks, vindicated.

                         MARK
          I'll help you find him.
          He points to Sarah's image on the screen.

                         MARK
          He's not at Sarah's, I already
          checked. And one of my dad's
          deputies drove by his house --
          nada.

                         MOGADORIAN COMMANDER
          He poses a great threat to us.
          Where else could he be?
          Mark pulls out his cell phone.

                         MARK
          I've got Sarah's cell number, maybe
          you guys can trace it?
          The Commander takes the phone and passes it to one of his men
          in the front. He looks back at Mark.

                         JOHN
          On his way. Where's yours?

                         SIX
          Dead. The Mogs got her four months
          ago. We had been tracking them.
          She heads past. John and Sarah follow after her.

                         JOHN
          Tracking them?

                         SIX
          We discovered they plan to attack
          Earth. The only thing standing in
          their way is the six of us.
          The revelation hits John like a wrecking ball.

                         SIX
          You know what that means?
          John nods with new purpose.

                         JOHN
          The war starts tonight.

                         SIX
          First we have to get out of here
          alive and find the others.
          Six leads them past the impressive trophy case.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          93.

                         JOHN
          What are we up against?

                         SIX
          There's a commander, a bunch of
          soldiers and two Piken. They'll
          have all the main entrances
          covered.

                         SARAH
          The gym, there's a tunnel under the
          stage.

                         JOHN
          It'll take us out to the stadium.
          Six acknowledges that info with a curt nod. FOOTSTEPS. Six
          grabs John and Sarah by their arms and yanks them back
          against the wall.
          They hold their breath as one of the Mogadorian Soldiers
          prowls straight past. He stops for a moment, then turns the
          corner. Sarah looks across at the mirrored trophy case and
          sees there's no reflection.

                         SARAH
          We're invisible.
          John realizes, turns to Six.

                         JOHN
          You got any other Legacies?

                         SIX
          I can control the elements. You?

                         JOHN
          Lumen and telekinesis.
          More FOOTSTEPS. John turns and watches in horror as the
          Mogadorian Commander and a trio of Mogadorian Soldiers sweeps
          into view. The Commander is holding

          MARK.
          He is ashen with fear. Sarah has to catch herself from
          screaming. John makes a move, but Six holds him in place.

                         SIX
          Stay put. They want to draw you
          out.

                         JOHN
          He's not dying because of me!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          94.
          ANGLE ON THE SOLDIERS AND MARK. They're heading past the
          trophy case when JOHN'S VOICE booms out of nowhere.

          JOHN (O.S.)
          Mark! Linoleum! Now!
          Mark rips free and hits the deck a second before the trophy
          case EXPLODES. Shards of glass rip into the Mogadorians and
          trophies torpedo off the shelves and impale the aliens
          against the far wall. The Mogadorians SCREAM as they flail.
          John, Sarah and Six break cover. John wrenches Mark to his
          feet and they take off running. They dash around the next
          corner and find

          HENRI, SAM AND BERNIE
          sprinting towards them, followed by two Mogadorians! Six
          raises her hand-cannon, BLOWS one of the Mogs away, while
          John safely leads everybody into...

          INT. LIBRARY - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT


                         SIX

                         (TO JOHN)
          Barricade the doors!
          John telekinetically uproots a trio of bookcases that fly
          across the space and block the door. Sarah turns to Mark who
          is totally shell-shocked.

                         SARAH
          What are you doing with them?

                         MARK
          They said they were FBI. That John
          was a fugitive. What the hell's
          going on?

                         SIX
          You've stumbled into a war. So
          shut up and keep your head down.

                         HENRI
          I see age hasn't mellowed your
          attitude, 6.
          Mark turns to John, guilt-wracked.

                         MARK
          I didn't know they were trying to
          kill you.
          (genuine, to John)
          I'm sorry.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          95.

                         JOHN
          This isn't your fault -- it's mine.
          He offers Mark his hand. Mark shakes it. Suddenly, Bernie
          begins to GROWL.

                         SAM
          What is it, boy?
          Henri sees where Bernie is staring and realizes...

                         HENRI
          He's telling us to run!
          They take off a second before

                         A PIKEN
          PUMMEL-RAMS through the wall in a shower of bricks, books and
          paper. It utters a glass-shattering ROAR. John looks back
          and sees Bernie bravely holding his ground.

                         JOHN
          Bernie!
          He watches as the beagle sprints forward and launches himself
          at the monster. Bernie clamps onto the Piken's neck. He's
          hopelessly outmatched and holds on for dear life as the Piken
          tries to buck him off. Then something amazing happens --

          BERNIE BEGINS TO MORPH.
          He doubles, triples in size and keeps growing. His features
          become reptilian, gecko-like, his fur turns to spines and in
          a matter of moments Bernie has transformed into a hulking

          ALIEN CREATURE.
          John looks to Henri as the truth of Bernie's origin dawns.

                         HENRI
          Bernie's a Chimera. He came with
          us from Lorien.

                         JOHN
          Guess I wasn't the only one keeping
          secrets.

                         HENRI
          Somebody had to watch you when I
          wasn't around.
          They exit while Bernie and the Piken continue to battle.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          96.

          INT. HALL - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT

          John and Henri catch up to the others.

                         SARAH
          The gym's this way.
          A projectile HISSES past John's ear and DETONATES a row of
          lockers -- BOOOOOM! -- it's like an incendiary grenade. The
          paint blisters off the lockers as they are consumed by FIRE.

                         JOHN
          sees two Mogadorian Soldiers hauling heavy-duty weapons that
          use the glass cartridges that glow on their ammo belts. One
          FIRES another round. John telekinetically RIPS a door off
          its hinges. It flies forward, blocks the charge and IGNITES.
          John spins back and SCREAMS --

                         JOHN
          Go! Go! Go!
          They take off. John follows and uses his telekinesis to
          fling cabinets, doors, benches anything he can to block the
          fiery onslaught. But the rounds are coming too fast and a
          projectile SMACKS him in the back. It's like being hit by
          napalm. As FLAMES wash across him, he looks up and snaps on

          THE SPRINKLER HEADS
          that run the length of the hall. A deluge sprays, dousing
          the fire. With his clothes smoking, John tears around the
          corner. The Mogadorians charge after him, but find

          SIX IS WAITING.
          BOOOOMM! BOOOOMM! She blasts them at point-blank range.
          Magenta light gushes from their wounds. Like rain hitting
          hot coals, their bodies HISS as they crack and cinder.

                         SIX
          Keep moving!
          Henri, Mark, Sarah and Sam race out of view. Then John sees
          something emerge through the smoky, water-choked haze.

          IT'S THE SECOND PIKEN!
          It utters a low, predatory GROWL and launches itself forward.
          Oddly, Six doesn't move. She closes her eyes and lays one
          hand on the flooded floor, turning the water to

          ICE!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          97.
          In a matter of moments, the hall has been transformed into an
          icy tunnel. The sprinklers spray snow. The Piken struggles
          to find purchase in this new frozen environment and slip-
          slides after John and Six, who disappear into...

          INT. CAFETERIA - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT

          CRAAAAACK! The doors are DEMOLISHED as the Piken flails off
          the ice. It takes out a row of tables and chairs and skids
          to a stop. It ROARS in humiliated FURY, and its red eyes
          scan for John and Six who are nowhere to be seen.
          The Piken prowls behind the serving counter. Snow beads off
          its back. Its monstrous nostrils suddenly flare, sensing
          something. It hunches lower and peers at the trays and pans
          that are stored below.
          REVEAL JOHN AND SIX. They're invisible. John clutches Six's
          arm. They're lying between a stack of roasting dishes.
          Threads of foamy drool drip onto their faces as the Piken
          pokes its head further. Its ghoulish red eyes seem to stare
          right at them. With a final frustrated SNORT, it carries on.

          INT. HALL - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT

          Henri, Sarah, Sam and Mark race into view. Sarah stops,
          panicked and afraid.

                         SARAH
          Where's John?

                         HENRI
          Right behind us.
          He offers her his hand. She's about to take it when

          A MOGADORIAN SOLDIER
          steps out of the shadows. There is nowhere and no time for
          Henri and the others to run. But as the Mogadorian squeezes
          the trigger of his hand-cannon, the wall on his right

          ERUPTS!
          Bernie and the first Piken crash into the hall. They are
          still at each other's throats and don't even notice as they
          steam-roller over the Mogadorian, squashing him like a bug.
          The creatures SMASH through the opposite wall and out of
          sight. It's over in a violent blink.

          INT. KITCHEN - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT

          John and Six sneak through the shadows. She steps to the
          door, but it won't budge.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          98.

                         SIX
          They've blocked it. Use your
          telekinesis.

                         JOHN
          We're not leaving without my
          friends.

                         SIX
          Don't you mean the girl?
          John ignores the jibe and turns back. Six grabs his arm.

                         SIX
          I broke the Elders' spell to find
          you. The Mogs can kill me now. We
          have to go.

                         JOHN
          We stay and fight.
          OFF his determination...

          INT. HOME ECONOMICS ROOM - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT

          Henri and Sam crouch behind one station while Sarah and Mark
          hide in the one opposite. Henri pulls a selection of weapons
          from the backpack. He hands one to Sam, looks over at Mark.

                         HENRI
          You know how to use one of these?

                         MARK
          My dad's the sheriff.
          He slides two across the floor. The door opens. They swing
          up to fire but find -- John and Six.

                         JOHN
          Save it for the Mogs. Let's go!

          INT. LOCKER ROOM - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT

          Bernie and the Piken pummel the rows of lockers which
          COLLAPSE like dominos. Gashed and exhausted, the battling
          duo SHATTER-SMASHES into

          THE SHOWER STALLS.
          Water SPURTS from a broken pipe. The Piken slips on the
          slick tiles. As it struggles to right itself, Bernie seizes
          the moment and sinks his fangs into the monster's neck.

                         THE PIKEN

                         

                         

                         

                         

          99.
          desperately thrashes. Its talons viciously rip into Bernie's
          side. Ignoring the pain, Bernie doesn't let go until his foe
          finally jerks to stillness. As Bernie sinks to the floor, he
          MORPHS back into a beagle and lies spent and bleeding...

          INT. GYM - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT

          John leads the group past the bleachers and points to the
          side of the stage.

                         JOHN
          The door's over here. The tunnel
          leads out to the stadium.
          Sarah sweeps back the curtain, revealing a padlocked set of
          metal doors. John holds up his hand, snaps the lock and
          whips the chain free. The doors fly open,

                         TWO MOGADORIANS
          spring out of the dark. One tackles Henri while the other
          blindsides John. Henri struggles until

          BOOOOOM!
          The BLAST cinders the Mog's head clean off. Henri looks over
          and sees Mark holding a smoking shotgun and nods his thanks.
          The second has John pinned when it suddenly ROARS in agony
          and disintegrates into a shower of sparks, revealing

          SIX.
          She sheathes her dagger and helps John up.

                         SIX
          Saving your life. My new hobby.
          Sarah notices a smile of respect flicker between John and
          Six. PHHHHHHT! PHHHHHHT! PHHHHHHT! -- three Mogadorian
          knives razor the air. One impales Six in the shoulder. She
          slumps at John's feet. Henri opens FIRE on the

          THE COMMANDER AND TWO MOGADORIAN SOLDIERS
          who storm towards them. John SCREAMS to Sam and Mark.

                         JOHN

                         (RE: SIX)
          Get her down the tunnel!
          They grab Six by the arms and drag her into the tunnel.
          Sarah glances back at John and follows after them. Henri
          takes out a Soldier. John sweeps up his hand and

                         

                         

                         

                         

          100.

          THE WOODEN FLOOR OPENS LIKE A ZIPPER!
          The Commander and the other Soldier are sent flying as the
          planks rip free of their nails. John and Henri charge into
          the tunnel. The doors fly shut behind them and the bleacher
          stand rolls forward to seal the entrance.

          INT. TUNNEL - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT

          Sarah is in the lead. Sam and Mark follow, holding the
          wounded Six. They've almost reached the end when

                         A MOGADORIAN
          lurches into the mouth of the tunnel. Without a second's
          hesitation, Sam swings up his gun and BLASTS it. Mark looks
          at him in shock as they race through the embers. Sam shrugs.

                         SAM
          I play a lot of Xbox.

          EXT. FOOTBALL STADIUM - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT

          Sam, Mark, Six and Sarah hurtle across the field. When they
          reach the track, Sarah looks back and smiles with relief when
          John and Henri burst out of the tunnel.

                         JOHN
          Don't stop! Get to the woods!
          She nods and exits with the others.
          John and Henri head onto the field after them when

          THE SECOND PIKEN
          leaps out of the mouth of the tunnel behind them. It's
          seriously pissed. It bounds straight towards John. Its
          fangs glint like barbed wire as it launches itself towards
          him. At the last second,

                         HENRI
          nobly shoves John out of the way and is plucked into the
          Piken's jaws. The creature shakes him like a rag doll and
          flings him 50 feet down the field. John watches, anguished,
          as Henri lands in a heap.

                         JOHN
          Nooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
          The Piken pivots, turns its crimson eyes on John. It almost
          seems to smirk. Its fangs are stained with Henri's blood.
          John's face hardens into a mask of rage.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          101.
          He makes no attempt to flee as the Piken charges. As it
          springboards into the air...
          ANGLE ON JOHN'S HANDS -- as they suddenly clench.
          ANGLE ON THE GOALPOSTS -- as they're SNAPPED clean off their
          bases and fly skyward.
          ANGLE ON JOHN -- as the Piken's shadow washes across him.
          ANGLE ON THE PIKEN -- as it arcs towards John with its mouth
          open and teeth bared. Suddenly, the goalposts spear its
          flanks, impaling it like supersize BBQ forks.
          The three-ton killing machine drops out of the sky and smacks
          onto the 20-yard line. John watches impassively as the red
          life-fire dies in its eyes and its head lolls to one side.

          EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

          The stadium looms in the distance. Sam wrenches the dagger
          from Six's shoulder while Sarah and Mark anxiously watch.

          EXT. FOOTBALL STADIUM - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT

          John sinks by Henri's side.

                         JOHN
          Henri.
          Henri GROANS as John cradles his head. His coat is soaked
          with blood and his torso is horribly mauled. John tries to
          drag him to his feet.

                         JOHN
          Come on, taillights in five.

                         HENRI
          I won't be coming with you this
          time. Save yourself.

                         JOHN
          We go together!
          Henri smiles, grateful, but at that moment

          THE COMMANDER'S SWORD
          flies past John and impales Henri in the chest. Henri utters
          a GROAN and his dying eyes meet John's.

                         HENRI
          Find the others.
          His voice is a GRAVELLED WHISPER.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          102.

                         HENRI
          Your life is my life... always.
          His eyes flutter closed and he slips from John's grip.
          Anguished, John doesn't notice his pendant momentarily
          flicker with a radiant blue light. He angrily spins to face

          THE MOGADORIAN COMMANDER.
          But in a blur of speed, the Commander steps forward, wraps
          his hand around John's throat and plucks him into the air.
          He's flanked by the remaining Soldiers. John's feet kick
          uselessly as he's lifted face to face.

                         MOGADORIAN COMMANDER
          Number 4.
          Three Loric pendants dangle from the Commander's belt like
          mocking trophies.

                         MOGADORIAN COMMANDER
          Your Cepan saved you on Lorien.
          The Commander's voice hisses with cruel certainty. He
          wrenches his sword from Henri's corpse.

                         MOGADORIAN COMMANDER
          But this moment was inevitable.
          The blade shimmers with silver flame as he raises it.
          John's eyes narrow as the sword sweeps towards him. This is
          the moment his adolescence officially ends. This is the
          moment when a warrior is born.
          ANGLE ON BLADE as it SHATTERS into a million pieces, which
          flutter to the ground like glittering confetti.
          John stares at the alien with calm confidence.

                         JOHN
          Nothing is inevitable.

          ANGLE ON JOHN'S HAND AS IT IGNITES.
          The flame is hotter and brighter than 10,000 acetylene
          torches. He grips one of the Commander's bandoliers.
          TIGHT ON THE MOGADORIAN'S FACE as he realizes it's over.
          The glass cartridges detonate in a deadly chain reaction.

          IT'S LIKE A NUCLEAR IMPLOSION!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          103.
          John, the Commander, the Mogadorian Soldiers, in fact every
          goddamn thing in the stadium is obliterated in the

          SUPERNOVA OF FIRE
          that radiates across the field like a blinding ring of hell.

          EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

          Sarah looks back as the blistering vortex of flame lights the
          night sky. Her breath catches in her throat.

                         SARAH
          Oh my God... John.
          Before anyone can stop her, she takes off running, sprinting
          for the stadium.

          EXT. FOOTBALL STADIUM - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT

          It's a smoking ruin. The seats have melted into puddles.
          Sarah bursts into view. She looks across the devastated
          field. The grass has been reduced to a charred black carpet
          of stubble. Nothing remains of Henri or the Mogadorians.

                         SARAH
          John!
          She charges across the broiled expanse, hoping against hope.
          Then she sees John, lying motionless and naked, his clothes
          completely burned away. She stops, puts her hand to her
          mouth to stifle a sob, when he COUGHS and stirs.

                         SARAH
          John!
          Ash swirls like snow as she races to his side. They wrap
          each other in their arms. Neither wanting to ever let go.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. PICNIC AREA - WOODS - DAWN

          The sky is cracked with the first light of day. Sarah is
          dressing Six's wound at a table. Six winces.

                         SARAH
          Sorry, Girl Scout first aid didn't
          cover extraterrestrial dagger
          wounds.
          Six smiles, grateful.

                         SIX
          Thanks.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          104.
          As the two teens size each other up, CAMERA FINDS Mark. He
          hangs up his cell and crosses to John and Sam, who are
          talking intently by the motorcycles. John is now wearing a
          pair of old jeans and a faded denim jacket.

                         MARK
          The Sheriff's Department is
          starting to put up roadblocks. You
          guys better get moving.
          Six and Sarah join them.

                         JOHN
          You good to go?

                         SIX
          Don't worry about me.
          John nods to Sam.

                         JOHN
          Sam, ride with Six.

                         SIX
          We don't need baggage.
          Sam steps in front of her, determined.

                         SAM
          I have to find out if the Mogs took
          my dad.
          Six turns to John, who is not bending, then glares at Sam.

                         SIX
          You slow us down, I'll shoot you
          myself.
          Sarah looks at John, tries to rein in her emotions.

                         SARAH
          I want to come too.

                         JOHN
          You need to stay here.

                         SARAH
          Why?

                         JOHN
          You could have died last night.
          I'm not putting you in danger
          again. Mark's promised to look
          after you.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          105.
          Tears tumble down her cheeks.

                         SARAH
          I don't want to say goodbye.

                         JOHN
          I'll come back for you.

                         SARAH
          When?

                         JOHN
          When it's safe.
          She bows her head, anguished. He gently lifts her chin.

                         JOHN
          Where I'm from, we only give our
          heart to one person. I've given
          mine to you.

                         (BEAT)
          I love you, Sarah.
          Their lips meet and they kiss. It only ends when John hears
          an URGENT RUSTLE in the woods. They turn and watch as

                         BERNIE KOSAR
          limps into view. Blood mats his fur and his face is
          scratched but he's alive. OFF John's relief...

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. PICNIC AREA - DAY

          Sam sits behind Six on her motorcycle. John holds Bernie as
          he straddles his Harley. Bernie morphs into a gecko and
          darts into his pocket. Sarah studies John and Six, unsure.
          John THROTTLES the bike to life, then looks back at Sarah.
          He fights a pang of jealousy when he sees her standing at
          Mark's side. RAIN spits as the motorcycles start off.

          JOHN (V.O.)
          This is the first town I've left
          without Henri. The first one I
          have a reason to come back to.
          John and Sarah hold each other's gaze, desperately trying to
          brand the image of their faces onto their memories.

          EXT. ROAD - DAY

          The bikes blur past the âWelcome to Paradiseâ sign.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          106.

          JOHN (V.O.)
          He warned me the pain would be
          unbearable if I left her. He was
          right.

          EXT. TEXAS PLAINS - DAY

          A straight stretch of blacktop bisects the sunbaked flatness.

          JOHN (V.O.)
          But I don't regret it. The pain
          reminds me what's at stake.
          A dust trail plumes as the bikes power into view.

          JOHN (V.O.)
          We must find the others and face
          our enemy together. I'm not sure
          how we can stop them. But nothing
          is inevitable. I know that now.
          Thunderheads darken the horizon.

          JOHN (V.O.)
          I am Number 4.
          His eyes are fearless and his face is undaunted by the
          battles yet to be fought. He's ready to face a future
          unmapped and uncharted. Ready.

          FADE OUT.

                         THE END
I, ROBOT

    FADE IN:

1   On a DEEP...DEEP...DARKNESS.                                       1

    A FLICKER. Of LIGHT. Off to the side. Just barely.
    Noticeable. ORANGE...YELLOW...as we realise...It's FIRE...

    A SOUND.   Something SHATTERING...

    Then. A DISEMBODIED VOICE. Muted. We can't quite make out
    What it's saying. As it gets LOUDER. And LOUDER. When we
    finally. Understand...

                         DISEMBODIED VOICE
               You are in danger...

                                               CUT TO:

2   INT. SPOONER'S APARTMENT - CLOSE ON                                2

    DEL SPOONER'S FACE.    His eyes, snapping open.   His face,
    covered in sweat.

    PULL BACK to REVEAL him lying in bed. Sheets, tangled around
    his legs. Alarm clock, playing something relentlessly
    cheerful.

    Spooner slaps it off. Sits up. Wincing. Bends his RIGHT
    ARM. Stiff. He reaches for a BOTTLE OF PILLS. Shakes out a
    couple and swallows them. Trying to forget. That dream.

    You are in danger...

    He rubs his hands over his face. Gets out of bed. His
    apartment, basic. Unremarkable. Bearing the signs of
    someone who lives alone. Shades drawn. A little messy.

3   INT. SHOWER - MORNING                                              3

    Spooner turns his face into the jet of water.

4   INT. BATHROOM - MORNING                                            4

    Shaves with a razor.    Using his left hand.   Knicks the cleft
    of his chin. Shit.

5   INT. KITCHEN - MORNING                                             5

    Stares down at the single egg in a saucepan.      Waiting for it
    to boil.

                                                             2.


6   INT. HALLWAY - MORNING                                          6

    Heads down the hallway. Looping a knotted tie around his
    neck. Kicks some neglected mail from the door and reaches
    for the handle. Takes a deep breath and...

7   EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MORNING                                  7

    ...steps outside. Into the flow of COMMUTERS heading for the
    elevated trains. Elbow to elbow. A river of humanity.

    Spooner moves along, like everyone else. Suddenly. His
    shoulders tense. That feeling at the back of his neck. He
    turns and sees...

    A ROBOT. Just behind him. Humanoid in design, but still
    obviously a machine. Metal and synthetic casings covering
    hydraulic muscles. The thing senses his stare. Looks up
    with a muted WHIR...

                         ROBOT
                   (metallic voice)
               Good day, sir...

    Spooner. Speeds up his pace.     Weaving through the crowd to
    lose the robot.

    We now realise this is THE FUTURE. Towering apartment
    buildings block the sun. The street packed with traffic.
    PEDESTRIANS wearing their computers like form-fitting
    portable offices. Spooner throws a look at his surroundings:

    Up high an INDUSTRIAL ROBOT rolls down the side of a building
    cleaning windows.

    A WORK CREW of oddly-shaped RUBE GOLDBERG ROBOTS efficiently
    repairs the street. No human supervision.

    A ROBOTIC CLEAN-UP CREW. Lumbering along the sidewalk.
    Scrubbing, sweeping. Emptying trash...

    Humanoid ROBOTS dotting the crowd. Following their owners.
    Walking slowly, deliberately. Carrying boxes. Groceries.
    Briefcases.

    Stamped on all the ROBOTS' SIDES, a LOGO:   III LAWS SAFE.

    Spooner stops to wait at a light with other PEDESTRIANS.
    Directly in front of him, a LITTLE GIRL clutches her father's
    neck. She smiles big at Spooner. Front teeth missing.

                         LITTLE GIRL
               Hi.

                                                              3.


                          SPOONER
               Hi.

    But it's not her father. It's her ROBOT CARETAKER.    The
    robot turns. Looks at the girl.

                         ROBOT
               You are not allowed to talk to
               strangers.

    Spooner, disgusted.   Has had enough.   He steps off the curb
    Just as...

    THE TRAFFIC SIGNAL swivels around.   Training its large
    digital EYE on him:

                         TRAFFIC LIGHT
               Please return to the sidewalk.

    Spooner dodges several cars on his way across the street.

                         TRAFFIC LIGHT
               Please return to the sidewalk...

    The traffic signal, tracking him.

                         TRAFFIC LIGHT
               You are in violation of city
               ordinance 14-B726...

    Spooner throws up his hand. Flipping it the bird just as
    SNAP! It takes his picture.

                                                CUT TO:

8   EXT./INT. MONORAIL - MORNING                                    8

    Spooner stepping onto a sleek, densely packed TRAIN. Looks
    down at his feet. A trampled flyer on the ground. From the
    Anti-Robot League: METAL MONSTERS SECRET FACTORY REVEALED!
    A Robot gets up. To offer him his seat. Spooner. Turns his
    back on him as we PULL BACK from the window to REVEAL...

9   EXT. CITY SCAPE/MONORAIL - CONTINUOUS                           9

    The TRAIN hurtling toward DOWNTOWN. Soaring, gravity-defying
    OFFICE BUILDINGS dominate the skyline. Older buildings
    wedged among the new. All protected by huge glass and steel
    shields.

    As we get closer congested roads and freeways begin to
    disappear below ground into a series of subterranean tunnels.
    The "old" streets have become huge, spacious plazas.

                                                             4.


10   EXT. POLICE H.Q. - PLAZA - MORNING                            10

     Spooner moves with the CROWD towards the doors of the aging
     Police Headquarters. Modern additions have been made to the
     original facade -- creating an ungainly architectural mess.

11   INT. POLICE H.Q. - HOMICIDE UNIT - MORNING                    11

     A vast open plan situation room lined on one side by a series
     of glass-enclosed rooms. On the other side a GIANT SCREEN
     with real time video of various streets and buildings.

     Spooner arrives at his desk. Unlike the others, it's a mess.
     A slender computer screen curving along the front of it.
     Several electronic messages say the same thing:

                             SEE ME!

                          LT. BERGIN (O.S.)
                Ever heard the phrase "lead by
                example?"

     Spooner looks up. LIEUTENANT JOHN BERGIN stands in front of
     his desk, holding up a CITATION with a photo of Spooner
     giving that traffic signal the finger.

                          SPOONER
                Doesn't ring a bell.

                          LT. BERGIN
                    (pointing to Spooner's
                     badge)
                It's on your badge.

     Spooner takes the citation.   Drops it into a drawer filled
     with about fifty others.

                          LT. BERGIN
                The traffic division filed an
                official complaint this morning.

                          SPOONER
                The traffic division is a machine.

                          LT. BERGIN
                Look, I know there's going to be an
                adjustment period, Del...

                          SPOONER
                    (interrupting)
                I'll send them a letter of apology.
                Maybe some flowers. A box of
                chocolates...

                                                               5.


     JUST THEN Spooner's phone RINGS.   He throws Bergin a look.
     Then snatches up the receiver.

                          SPOONER
                Spooner, homicide.

                                                 CUT TO:

12   EXT. U.S. ROBOTICS - ESTABLISHING - DAY                        12

     A sprawling glass and metal complex covering many city
     blocks. The entrance is a large plaza filled with PEOPLE and
     ROBOTS.

13   INT. U.S. ROBOTICS - METAL CORRIDOR - DAY                      13

     An elevator opens with a whoosh. Spooner steps out into a
     featureless corridor. His footsteps, echoing. He stops at a
     set of OPPOSING DOORS. Looks over at one, when the other
     suddenly OPENS.

14   INT. U.S. ROBOTICS - PLUSH CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS        14

     A warm, mahogany-paneled room. In sharp contrast to the cold
     metal space outside. Spooner steps inside. At the end of a
     long conference table sits an OLD MAN. Sparkling blue eyes.
     Old-fashioned suit.

                          OLD MAN
                Hello, there. Please come in.

     Spooner hesitates.

                          OLD MAN
                It's alright. You can sit.     Sit.

     Spooner doesn't.   Looks around the room. The Old Man lifts
     up a coffee pot.   Pours some coffee into a single cup.

                          OLD MAN
                Coffee?

                          SPOONER
                    (interested)
                You're offering me a cup of coffee?

                          OLD MAN
                Yes. But you are to say, "No,
                thank you."

     Spooner nods a little. The Old Man raises the coffee to his
     lips, but doesn't take a sip.

                                                       6.


                       OLD MAN
           Coffee?

                       SPOONER
           No.    Thank you.

                     OLD MAN
           As you wish.

The Old Man takes a sip. He doesn't move. There is no
movement except for a whisper of steam rising from the coffee
pot.

                     SPOONER
           You want to tell me something about
           Dr. Hogenmiller? About his death?

The Old Man smiles.

                     OLD MAN
           I want to tell you that his death
           was not a suicide.

                     SPOONER
           And why do you say that?

                      OLD MAN
           Why?   Because I want you to know
           it.

                     SPOONER
           I understand that. But what
           specifically leads you to believe
           that he didn't commit suicide?

                     OLD MAN
               (considers)
           Nothing specifically.

Spooner shifts his weight.   Agitated.

                     SPOONER
           Under normal circumstances that
           wouldn't be enough to get you a
           homicide investigation.

                     OLD MAN
           But this is not "normal
           circumstances," is it, Detective
           Spooner?

                       SPOONER
           No.    It isn't.

                                                               7.


                          OLD MAN
                Then you will find out who killed
                Dr. Hogenmiller, yes? And then you
                will tell me.

     Spooner's losing his patience.

                          SPOONER
                If you were murdered, Doctor, I'll
                find out. And you'll be the first
                to know.....

     JUST THEN the HOLOGRAM of DR. HOGENMILLER vanishes in a burst
     of LIGHT, as does the table, the coffee pot, and the
     conference room. Spooner, suddenly finds himself standing in
     front of a LARGE VIEW SCREEN inside a SMALL METAL CHAMBER.

15   INT. HALLWAY - DAY                                              15

     Spooner steps out into the hallway and into...AN ESCORT
     ROBOT.

                          ESCORT ROBOT
                Please follow me.

     Spooner. Reluctantly starts to follow it.     Passes another
     doorway. POLICE TAPE stretched across it.     Catches a brief
     glimpse of...

     DR. HEINRICH HOGENMILLER'S BODY.

     Splayed out across the floor. Surrounded by CRIME SCENE
     TECHNICIANS. He pauses. Taking in the scene. Then
     continues on.

16   INT. U.S. ROBOTICS - CORPORATE BOARDROOM - DAY                  16

     Two large doors emblazoned with the U.S. ROBOTICS LOGO open
     automatically. Inside, an enormous glass-enclosed boardroom
     looking out over the entire complex.

     Spooner walks through the doorway. His escort robot trailing
     behind him. An army of corporate types sit around a
     conference table. Young. Energetic. You can practically
     feel the brains and ambition.

                          SPOONER
                Usually I ask who's in charge...

     Spooner's eyes lock with a MAN sitting at the head of the
     table. 60s, handsome, charismatic. Dr. LANCE ROBERTSON,
     founder and CEO of U.S. Robotics.

                                                         8.


                      SPOONER
            But everyone knows you, Dr.
            Robertson.

Robertson smiles.   Pretends to instruct his people.

                      ROBERTSON
            Remind me to cut back on my talk
            show appearances.

LAUGHTER.

                      ROBERTSON
            Welcome to U.S. Robotics,
            Detective. I regret you're not
            visiting us under more pleasant
            circumstances. Allow me to
            introduce Mr. Aronson, our head of
            Legal Affairs.

A prematurely graying MAN leaning against the wall.    Nods
hello.

                      ROBERTSON
            And the gentleman to my right is
            Dr. Alfred Lanning, Director of
            Research.

Alfred Lanning, only one there in a tie.   Nods.

                      ROBERTSON
            They'll be available to answer any
            questions you might have during
            your investigation. You'll
            understand how anxious we are to
            resolve this matter -- especially
            before the press gets wind of it.
            There are some anti-robot
            sentiments out there as you know,
            Detective, and we're not eager to
            stir them up. So. Where would you
            like to begin?

                      SPOONER
            We can begin with whether or not
            the old man put a gun to his head
            and pulled the trigger.

A palpable wave of tension shoots through the group.

                      ARONSON
            You don't have to answer that, Dr.
            Robertson...

                                                          9.


Robertson waves him off.

                      ROBERTSON
           Susan?   Perhaps you can assist us
           here?

Everyone looks down at the other end of the table. A BEAT.
Then an attractive young WOMAN gets to her feet. SUSAN
CALVIN. Hair tucked behind her ears. Looking at everyone
but Spooner.

                     CALVIN
           Dr. Hogenmiller was a schizoid
           personality who generally eschewed
           social relationships. Rejecting
           people in favor of solitary
           activities involving machines. He
           spent almost all his time at the
           lab here or at his lab at home. As
           a result he was highly susceptible
           to depression.

                     ROBERTSON
           Dr. Calvin is our Chief
           Psychologist.

                     SPOONER
           If that was your diagnosis, why
           didn't you see this coming?

Calvin turns. Finally meeting Spooner's eye.      As if the
answer's obvious.

                     CALVIN
           This is U.S. Robotics, Detective.
           Seventy-five percent of our
           employees fit that description.

                     LANNING
               (interceding)
           You'll have to excuse the doctor.
           We're all a little on edge. This
           has been a difficult and emotional
           morning.

Spooner throws a look around the room.   Then back at Calvin.

                       SPOONER
           Yeah.    I can see you're all broken
           up.

Robertson responds to Spooner's skepticism.

                                                           10.


                          ROBERTSON
                Dr. Hogenmiller was at my side from
                the very beginnings of this
                company. We developed the "Three
                Laws of Robotics" together. But
                these days science is a young man's
                game. By the time you hit thirty
                your best years are behind you.
                Some of us are kicked upstairs.
                Others I'm afraid aren't so lucky.

     Robertson stands.   Meeting over.

                          ROBERTSON
                Dr. Hogenmiller took his own life.
                I trust you will come to the same
                swift conclusion, Detective. Dr.
                Lanning will make himself available
                if you have any further questions.

     Spooner looks over at Calvin.

                          SPOONER
                I want her to help me.

     Calvin, unhappy with this arrangement.

                          CALVIN
                That's not really my department...

                          ROBERTSON
                    (pointed)
                Susan would be happy to assist you.

     And with a gesture, Robertson dismisses everyone. People
     start getting up, gathering up, filing out. Susan Calvin.
     The last one to get up.

17   INT. METAL HALLWAY - DAY                                      17

     Spooner and Calvin, heading down the same hallway he was in
     before. Catch sight of a couple ROBOT TECHNICIANS...

                          SPOONER
                    (under his breath)
                Ah, Christ...Toasters...

     As they duck under the police tape and...

                                                              11.


18   INT. HOGENMILLER'S LAB - DAY                                   18

     ...enter Hogenmiller's lab. Alive with activity. CRIME
     SCENE TECHNICIANS, MOBILE ANALYSIS UNITS. LIGHT SCANS,
     running across...

     HOGENMILLER'S LIFELESS FACE.   Black gun powder.   Fanning out
     around his contorted lips.

     Spooner. Throws a look around the lab: ROBOTS. Everywhere.
     Mostly incomplete. TORSOS. ARMS. LEGS. Dangling from the
     ceiling. A SERGEANT. Passes them by...

                          SERGEANT
                They say the price's gonna come
                down a lot next year. Kinda cool,
                huh?

                          SPOONER
                How cool will it be when one takes
                your job?

     Spooner.   Pushing past him.   His eyes.   Darting around.

                          CALVIN
                Is everything alright, Detective?

                          SPOONER
                Yeah. This is just how I like my
                robots -- in pieces.

     As they approach Hogenmiller's body, the lead CRIME SCENE
     INVESTIGATOR, BALDEZ, gets up to meet them.

                          BALDEZ
                    (to Spooner)
                Can you believe it, man? U.S.
                Robotics. I didn't think I'd ever
                see the inside of this building.

     Hands Spooner, a plasma clipboard.   Spooner signs it,
     awkwardly. With his LEFT HAND...

                          SPOONER
                What's the run-down?

                          BALDEZ
                Heinrich Hogenmiller, sixty-four
                years old. Weapon a small caliber
                .22, registered in his name. Looks
                like he walked in, locked the door,
                and snuffed himself.

                                                       12.


Spooner.   Cocking his head to look at Hogenmiller's face.

                      SPOONER
            I know someone who disagrees with
            you.

                       BALDEZ
            Who?

Spooner.   Stands.   Pointing down at Hogenmiller.

                       SPOONER
            Him.

And steps over the body, leaving a confused Baldez.
Stepping deeper, into the lab. Calvin. Following.

                      SPOONER
            I spoke to a dead man today.   Want
            to tell me about that?

                      CALVIN
            Dr. Hogenmiller's hologram took his
            appointments. Attended staff
            meetings. He hated corporate life.
            The hologram enabled him to focus
            on his work. It's just a device,
            Detective.

                      SPOONER
            A device that called the police.

                      CALVIN
            The sound of the gunshot would've
            triggered a 911.

                      SPOONER
            But the call came directly to me.

                      CALVIN
            We're talking about a mechanism
            designed by Hogenmiller to say
            provocative things. To irritate
            and confound his colleagues.

                      SPOONER
            And that's what you think it is?

                      CALVIN
            I'm sorry, but this whole
            investigation is the result of a
            dead man's toy messing with your
            head.

                                                       13.


They pass half a robot, hanging from a hook. Spooner curls
his lip. Swivels the robot's head so it's not looking at
him.

                      SPOONER
            When's the last time any of you
            actually spoke to Hogenmiller? I
            mean human to human?

                      CALVIN
            I couldn't say.

                      SPOONER
            Take a guess.

                      CALVIN
            I don't guess, Detective. But if
            pressed, I would reason it had been
            a considerable length of time.

                      SPOONER
            How well did you know him?

Calvin.   Gently swivels the robot's head back to where it had
been.

                      CALVIN
            Not well. But I admired his work
            tremendously.

Spooner. Studies her for a beat. Then turns back to the
body. Two CORONERS entering with a high-tech body box.

                      SPOONER
            I get the whole "mad scientist"
            thing. Hogenmiller was past his
            prime. Isolated. Eccentric. He
            enters a room. Locks the door and
            is found minutes later with a
            bullet fired through his mouth into
            his brain. Everything about this
            case says suicide.

                      CALVIN
            You don't sound convinced.

The coroners.   Start loading the body into the box.

                      SPOONER
            Even people who live a life of
            logic and precision rarely arrange
            their deaths so perfectly.
                (turning to her)
                      (MORE)

                                                             14.


                          SPOONER (cont'd)
                What all this is missing -- is
                personality...

     As he starts for the door...

                          SPOONER
                You have 24 hour surveillance?...

19   INT. METAL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS                                 19

     ...They head out into the hallway.    A MECHANICAL DOOR GUARD
     rolling into place behind them.

                          CALVIN
                It's company policy.

                          SPOONER
                I want to see the tapes.

     Calvin. Hurrying to keep up with him. This is hardly how
     she wanted to spend her morning. Calls out into the air...

                          CALVIN
                Victor!

     At the end of the corridor, near the elevator, a BRIGHT
     CIRCLE appears. Hovering just in front of the wall. Two
     small slits grow into ROUND BLACK EYES...and a thin mouth
     expands into an ENORMOUS SMILE.

                          CALVIN
                Detective, meet Victor. Our
                building's supercomputer. He's the
                checks and balances of U.S.R.
                    (to Victor)
                Victor, Detective Spooner's heading
                up the investigation into the death
                of Dr. Hogenmiller.

     Victor smiles big.   Spooner, furrows his brow.

                          SPOONER
                You look like a very...happy
                computer.

     Victor responds in a GENTLE MALE VOICE:

                          VICTOR
                Thank you. That's very kind.

                          CALVIN
                The Detective needs to see our
                security tapes.

                                                                15.


     The elevator doors immediately OPEN.   They step inside.

20   INT. ELEVATOR - DAY                                              20

     Spooner and Calvin descend. Victor floats on the wall and
     smiles wide. Spooner looks back at it. With a frown.

     The elevator stops, the doors open.    A ROBOT steps on.

                          ROBOT
                Good day, Dr. Calvin.   Good day,
                sir.

     Spooner's jaw. Clenches. Staring at the Robot.       It senses
     the stare. Turns back to him.

                          ROBOT
                May I be of service to you, sir?

     Spooner. Breaks the stare.     Ignoring the Robot.   Calvin.
     Looks over at him.

                          CALVIN
                Aren't you going to answer him?

                          SPOONER
                I don't talk to my refrigerator,
                either.

     Calvin folds her arms.

                          CALVIN
                I get the distinct feeling you're
                one of those people, Detective.

                          SPOONER
                What people?

                          CALVIN
                Those who don't appreciate the work
                we do here at U.S.R.

                          SPOONER
                You people do what you do. Then
                it's up to the rest of us to make
                sense out of the world we wake up
                in.

     As the elevator doors open on to...

                                                           16.


21   INT. ATRIUM LOBBY - CONTINUOUS                              21

     A soaring lobby. The centerpiece is a five-story STATUE of a
     ROBOT, arms outstretched in approximation of Da Vinci's Study
     of Man. Robot workers more numerous than humans. They are
     sleeker. Finer. More advanced than those in the outside
     world.

     Calvin and Spooner head across.

                          CALVIN
                When this company started we were
                manufacturing three robots a week.
                Now look at us. Today's children
                will never know a world without
                robots.

                          SPOONER
                The streets are filled with
                unemployed humans who aren't
                exactly thrilled with that idea.

                          CALVIN
                Our robotic systems maintain
                factory inventories, regulate
                street traffic -- even run the
                family home.

                          SPOONER
                Leaving people to do what, Doctor?

                          CALVIN
                Leaving people to engage in higher
                pursuits that make life worth
                living.

                          SPOONER
                And what happens when something
                goes wrong?

                          CALVIN
                Our system's never wrong.

     As they walk through the crowd, we hear the quiet WHIR of
     robot heads as they turn in succession to watch Spooner pass.

22   INT. MAINFRAME - DAY                                        22

     Spooner and Calvin enter the MAINFRAME of U.S. Robotics.
     This is the nerve center of the whole operation. Walls lined
     with COMPUTERS, SCREENS, and thousands of CONTROLS.

                                                       17.


                     CALVIN
           This is Victor's home.

VICTOR appears on a wall-sized SCREEN broken up into beehive-
like components.

                     VICTOR
           I will now play you the last thirty-
           two seconds of Dr. Hogenmiller's
           life.

AS WE WATCH THE SCREENS. The elevator opens and DOCTOR
HOGENMILLER steps into the metal corridor. In countless
ANGLES. High, low, close-up, wide. Hogenmiller's face
composed but tight.

Spooner watches the lab doors open to admit him.   Hogenmiller
steps in. The doors slide closed behind him.

Nothing for a few moments. Then a muffled GUNSHOT. Calvin
jumps, startled. That's it. The cameras, still trained on
the corridor.

                     SPOONER
           Where's the tape from inside?

                     VICTOR
           Dr. Hogenmiller did not permit
           cameras to observe him while
           working.

                     CALVIN
           That was only within the last year.

                     SPOONER
           So we can throw paranoia into the
           mix.
               (to Victor)
           Fast-forward.

A hundred-plus screens all FAST-FORWARD. POLICE OFFICERS
appear and force open the doors. Now TECHNICIANS appear
and rush through in a blur...

                      CALVIN
           Um.   I hate to be a stickler...

On screen, we see Spooner and Calvin enter the lab.

                     CALVIN
           But don't killers usually have to
           enter and exit the scene of a
           crime?

                                                            18.


                          SPOONER
                Stop the recording.

     Spooner turns away from the footage.   Stares at Calvin.

                          SPOONER
                They do, Doctor. Unless they've
                always been there -- and never
                left.

     Calvin looks at him.   Trying to understand.

                          CALVIN
                You think the murderer was in the
                lab the entire time?

                          SPOONER
                If I'm right, it's still there...

     Spooner turns back to the screens. The IMAGE paused at the
     exact moment the MECHANICAL GUARD rolled in front of the lab
     door.

                          SPOONER
                We just locked it in.

23   INT. METAL CORRIDOR - DAY                                    23

     The STEEL ARMS of the ROBOTIC GUARD retract with a CLANG.    The
     laboratory doors slide open.

24   INT. HOGENMILLER'S LAB - DAY                                 24

     Spooner and Calvin step inside. It's dark. Quiet. Police
     and technicians long gone. Silhouettes of hanging limbs.
     Eyeless heads. Clumps of wire and metal.

     The LIGHTS, flicker on. Calvin sees Spooner reaching into
     his coat with his left hand. Pulling out a GUN. Reacts.

                          CALVIN
                A robot cannot harm a human being,
                Detective. The First Law of
                Robotics forbids it. And we hard-
                wire the Three Laws into every
                model. Without exception.

                          SPOONER
                Yeah, I saw the commercial.

     Spooner steps deeper into the lab. Eyes scanning. Twisting.
     To avoid touching any robot parts. Passes a MAZE holding a
     METAL INSECT. SUDDENLY. The bug WHIRS to life.

                                                         19.


Spooner startles. As the metal bug scurries through the
corridors. Clamps his hand down on it.

                     SPOONER
           And if a robot was given a direct
           order to kill?

                     CALVIN
           The Second Law of Robotics would
           prevent it. A robot must obey an
           order only if it does not conflict
           with the first law.

Spooner approaches a MOUND of ROBOT PARTS. Arms and legs.
Half torsos. All tossed haphazardly onto the pile.

                     SPOONER
           But a robot can defend itself.

                     CALVIN
           Only when that action doesn't
           conflict with the First or Second
           Laws. This is the Third Law of
           Robotics.

                     SPOONER
           Yeah, well, you know what they say
           -- Laws are made to be broken.

                     CALVIN
           Not these laws.

Spooner. Starts nudging the pile with his shoe.   Calvin,
growing impatient...

                     CALVIN
           You're not hearing me, Detective.
           There's nothing here...

WHEN SUDDENLY

The PILE ERUPTS in front of Spooner...Parts flying...AS A
ROBOT LEAPS UP FROM BENEATH IT!...

Spooner...knocked back...his GUN...skittering across the
floor...right to...

CALVIN'S FEET.

                     SPOONER
           Dr. Calvin!

Calvin. Stunned.    Speechless. The Robot. Fixing his
ILLUMINATED EYES.   Right on her. She steps forward...

                                                           20.


                     SPOONER
           Goddammit! Stay back!

Spooner. Scrambling towards his gun.     Calvin.    Reaching out
towards the Robot...

                     CALVIN
           Calm down, Detective.     There is no
           danger here...

Spooner.   Grabbing up his gun and wheeling round just as...

                     CALVIN
               (to Robot)
           De-Activate.

And the Robot.   Suddenly FREEZES.

Spooner. Heart POUNDING. Gets to his feet.         Training the
gun on the Robot. Calvin turns to him.

                     CALVIN
           How did you know it was under
           there?

                     SPOONER
           If I was metal and didn't want
           anyone to find me, I'd hide under a
           pile of junk.

                     CALVIN
           This Robot wasn't hiding. What
           you're looking at is the result of
           clever programming. The illusion
           of self-interest and free will.
           Nothing more.

Spooner. Steeping closer to the Robot. Cautiously.
Holstering his gun. As Calvin turns for the door.

                     CALVIN
           I'm going to go get Dr. Lanning...

...THE ROBOT'S HAND SUDDENLY SHOOTS OUT...grabbing Spooner's
gun...from his holster...LIGHTENING FAST...pointing it...
right back at him...

CLOSE ON Calvin.   Cannot believe this is happening...

                     CALVIN
           I said De-Activate!

                                                         21.


                     SPOONER
           Move away from the door, Doctor.

Calvin's voice.   Cracking from desperation.    Confusion.

                     CALVIN
           Commence emergency shut-down!

                      SPOONER
           Now!

Spooner. Staring into the Robot's eyes. A thin bead of
SWEAT. Trickling down his temple. Calvin. Moving away from
the door...

                     CALVIN
           I...I gave you an order...

The Robot. Starts backing towards the door. The gun.
Shaking in its hand. As if he's desperate. Conflicted. He
touches the WALL PANEL. The doors slide open. The Robot
steps out into the metal corridor. Turning to RUN as the
doors begin to shut...

Spooner. Reaching down to whip out a BACK-UP GUN.     From an
ankle holster. Slapping in a LARGE CARTRIDGE.

                     CALVIN
           This is impossible.   A robot...

                     SPOONER
           ...can't do that.    Yeah, yeah, I
           know.

                     CALVIN
           My God -- did you see how it moved?
           I've never seen an NS-2 move that
           way...

Starts running for the door.

                    CALVIN
           Wait! Please, you can't destroy
           it. We have to study it...

                     SPOONER
           That thing took my gun. You'll be
           lucky if you get a handful of bolts
           back!

SLAMS the wall panel and...

                                                               22.


25   INT. METAL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS                                  25

     ...sprints out into the hallway.     The Robot Suspect.   About
     to turn to corner...

     VICTOR.   Suddenly appearing.

                           VICTOR
                 The suspect is nearing the end of
                 the hallway, Detective.

                           SPOONER
                 Gee, thanks.

     Spooner raises his gun and FIRES...Pegging the robot in the
     LEG...It starts jerking wildly...He takes aim again when...

     CALVIN.   Races out into the hallway.

                           SPOONER
                 Get back to the lab!

     She heads for the Robot.

                           CALVIN
                     (to Robot)
                 You're malfunctioning.   Let me help
                 you!

     The Robot turns. To look at her. GUN pointing to the floor.
     Spooner. FOCUSING in on his HAND. AS ONE FINGER TWITCHES...

     And he DIVES for Calvin. Forcing her to the floor as the
     Robot FIRES. Again and again. Bullets. RICOCHETTING around
     them. SPARKING against the walls...

     The ELEVATOR opens.   The Robot, leaping inside.

     Spooner. On top of Calvin. Looks down at her.        Her HANDS.
     Clutching his coat. Trembling.

                           SPOONER
                 That was a pretty convincing
                 illusion of getting shot at.

                                                CUT TO:

26   INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS                                        26

     The ROBOT SUSPECT standing inside the elevator. Looks down
     at the bullet hole blown through its leg. Reaches down.
     Metal fingers touching the damage. As if curious. Afraid.

                                                              23.


     Looks back at the other ROBOT. Standing in the back of
     elevator. A primitive model. No reaction. Face, blank.

                                               CUT BACK TO:

27   INT. METAL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS                                27

     Spooner springing to his feet.   Helping Calvin up.

                          VICTOR
                I took the liberty of alerting
                Security .003 Seconds after the
                first shot was fired...

                          SPOONER
                Where's that elevator going?

                          VICTOR
                Sub Level 5.

     Spooner SLAMS against a nearby DOOR.   Hurtling down the
     STAIRS...

28   INT. LOBBY - CONTINUOUS                                         28

     A PHALANX of SECURITY PERSONNEL.   Crossing the lobby.
     PIERCING ALARM BELLS, RINGING...

29   INT. ANOTHER METAL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS                         29

     More SECURITY PERSONNEL.   Pouring into a HALLWAY...

30   INT. STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS                                      30

     Spooner and Calvin. Racing down the stairs.     Victor's face
     meeting them at every landing.

                          VICTOR
                I have directed a security team to
                meet the elevator containing the
                errant robot...

     Spooner. Whipping past him. Calvin.      Barely keeping up.
     Not used to this much activity.

     Spooner.   BURSTS through a door and out into...

31   INT. SUBTERRANEAN LEVEL 5 - CONTINUOUS                          31

     ...Subterranean Level 5. A labyrinth of metal and concrete.
     IN THE DISTANCE. A troupe of SECURITY PERSONNEL swarms
     around a closed ELEVATOR DOOR...

                                                          24.


                     VICTOR
           The suspect is about to be
           apprehended, Detective.

                     SPOONER
           I'll believe it when I see it.

Spooner. Cocking his gun.   A soft DING!    Announcing the
elevator car's arrival.

SECURITY, all crouching down in unison.    Weapons brought
round to position.

Spooner. Weaving through them.   Gun pointed at the metal
doors as...

WHOOSH. They slide open. Revealing a ROBOT. Standing
under the LIGHT. Holding a GUN. It steps out as Security
takes aim and...

                     SPOONER
           Wait!

Spooner pushes past them to the Robot.    Looks down at its
leg. UNSCATHED.

                     SPOONER
           This is not the same robot!

Looking wildly around. Goddammit. Bounds towards an EXIT as
Calvin steps forward to question the robot.

                     CALVIN
               (to Robot)
           What happened to the robot that
           ordered you to hold this firearm?

                     ELEVATOR ROBOT
           This unit is not programmed to obey
           an order given by a robot...

                     CALVIN
           But who gave you this gun?

SPOONER. Running towards the exit.    Hears the answer.
Echoing behind him...

                     ELEVATOR ROBOT
           A metal man.

                                                              25.


32   EXT. U.S. ROBOTICS - DAY                                       32

     BAM! He BURSTS out into the PLAZA in front of U.S. Robotics.
     Squinting into the light. Then PLUNGING into the crowd...

     HUMAN...ROBOT...HUMAN...ROBOT...they all look the same from
     behind. Spooner running. Through the sea of MAN and
     MACHINE. When someone. Starts to SCREAM. At the sight of
     his GUN. The crowd begins SCATTERING. Chaos. Spooner
     stops. Near a fountain. Turning 360. Looking everywhere...

     The Robot.   Gone.

                            SPOONER (V.O.)
                  ...I want a homicide unit on every
                  street, sidewalk, alley...

33   INT. POLICE H.Q. - HOMICIDE UNIT - DAY                         33

     Spooner, standing in front of an assemblage of COPS. Behind
     him, an image of the Robot Suspect plays on the screen...

                            SPOONER
                  ...junkyard, scrapyard, and salvage
                  yard, anywhere it could hide.

     Behind him, flashing images of the city STREETS and DUMPS...

                            SPOONER
                  It's got a bullet hole above the
                  right knee, so be on the look-out
                  for any malfunctioning NS-2...

     Lieutenant Bergin enters the back of the room.     Next to him,
     ASSISTANT D.A. TOLLER. Not looking happy.

                            SPOONER
                  Check out all retail outlets and
                  repair shops, especially the
                  underground ones...

     The screen behind him compartmentalises, showing various
     dubious SHOP FRONTS...

                            SPOONER
                  I don't care who you have to get
                  past to get this done. Just get it
                  done.

     The Cops, begin dispersing. As Bergin catches Spooner's eye.
     Spooner, not pleased to see Toller. Heads over...

                                                         26.


                     TOLLER
           Looking like shit, Spooner.

                     SPOONER
           Well I'm not the one always giving
           Press Conferences...

Bergin puts a hand on Spooner's arm.   Knows he's not going to
like this.

                     LT. BERGIN
           Del, we're going to have to
           reclassify the search. D.A.'s
           office is seeing this NS-2 as
           "missing evidence" -- not a
           homicide suspect.

                      SPOONER
           What?

                     TOLLER
           Homicide is the murder of a human
           being by another human being.
           Therefore, a robot cannot be
           charged with "homicide."

                     SPOONER
           This isn't just any robot...

                     TOLLER
           It's malfunctioning.

                     SPOONER
           It killed someone. That
           registering with you?

Spooner.   Shakes off Bergin's arm.   Eyeballs Toller.

                     SPOONER
           How many shares of U.S.R. you
           holding in your portfolio, Toller?

                     TOLLER
           This is a public safety issue.

                     SPOONER
           That's convenient.

                     TOLLER
           You have any idea what would happen
           to this city if we went running
           around screaming "killer robot?"
           It would collapse in on itself.
                     (MORE)

                                                                 27.


                            TOLLER (cont'd)
                  Wide-spread panic. Until that NS-
                  2's found we're cooperating with
                  U.S. Robotics and keeping this
                  investigation under wraps.

                            LT. BERGIN
                  Maybe this isn't the case for you,
                  Del.

     Incensed, Spooner replies a little louder than he intended.

                              SPOONER
                  I'm fine!

     Rakes his hand through his hair. Turns to see the other
     COPS, looking over at him. Toller smirks. Looks to Bergin.

                            TOLLER
                  I want updated reports every half
                  hour.

     Heads off.    Spooner.   Watching him.

                            SPOONER
                  This is it, you know. From now on
                  we're going to miss the good old
                  days.

                            LT. BERGIN
                  Good old days?

                            SPOONER
                  When people were killed by other
                  people.

34   INT./EXT. SPOONER'S CAR - CITY STREET - DUSK                      34

     Spooner. Rolling along in his car.       Eyes, bloodshot.
     Peering out the window:

     An NS-2 model ROBOT laden with shopping bags, following its
     owner down the sidewalk...

     Another ROBOT, opening the door at a hotel for GUESTS...

     A couple HAULING ROBOTS, loading heavy boxes onto the back of
     a truck...

     Spooner.     Rubs his eyes.   Turns a corner and spots:

     A ROBOT REPAIR SHOP.

                                                           28.


     The latest models in the window. Shiny. Streamlined.
     Spooner watches as a WOMAN leads her faulty NS-2 to the
     service entrance.

     He stops the car.

35   INT. TAXI (MOVING) - ESTATE STREETS - NIGHT                 35

     Calvin riding in the back of a DRIVERLESS taxi cab. Staring
     out the window, lost in thought. The cab pulls up to a curb.

                           TAXI VOICE
                 We have arrived at your
                 destination.

     Calvin.   Takes a beat.   Then swipes her card.

36   EXT. CALVIN'S CONDO ESTATE - NIGHT                          36

     Elegant condos set on prime real estate. Calvin heads down a
     tree-lined walk towards her condo entrance.

                           SPOONER (O.S.)
                 One of my bullets hit your robot...

     Startled. She drops her key card. As Spooner steps out from
     behind a tree. The tail of his coat, whipping in the wind.

                           CALVIN
                 Detective!...

                           SPOONER
                 And I think it's smart enough to
                 repair itself -- don't you?

                           CALVIN
                     (studying him)
                 Yes. I think so.

                           SPOONER
                 Where?

                           CALVIN
                 Any repair shop...

                           SPOONER
                 No. It's always the owner who
                 brings the robot in for repair.
                 Where would a robot without an
                 owner go?

                                                          29.


                      CALVIN
            I'm not sure what you're getting
            at.

                      SPOONER
                (stepping closer)
            Does U.S. Robotics have a factory
            in the city limits?

Calvin.   Tucking her hair behind her ears.

                      CALVIN
            The locations of our factories are
            classified.

                      SPOONER
            I don't care.

Calvin.   Looks up at him.   A Mexican stand-off.

                      CALVIN
            I have several conditions if I show
            you.

                      SPOONER
            I expected that.

                      CALVIN
            First. I want it brought in
            unharmed.

                      SPOONER
                (doesn't like it, but)
            Agreed.

                       CALVIN
            Second.   I want to talk to it,
            alone.

                      SPOONER
            Too dangerous.

                      CALVIN
            This model violated the Three Laws.
            It also moved and reacted
            differently than any robot I've
            ever seen. There must be some sort
            of logical explanation. I want to
            find out what that is. No police.
            No prosecutors. No you. Just me
            and the robot.

Spooner, looks down at this small woman.      Narrows his eyes.

                                                           30.


                          SPOONER
                When they told me you were a
                psychologist, that wasn't the whole
                truth, was it?

                          CALVIN
                I never said I treated human
                beings.

37   INT./EXT. SPOONER'S CAR (MOVING) - CITY UNDERPASS - NIGHT   37

     Spooner's car races down a RAMP and the roadway becomes a 16-
     lane underground tunnel system. A river of HEADLIGHTS
     stretches forever in either direction.

     A CONTROL BEAM locks onto the car, guiding it to a merge with
     TRAFFIC. Spooner hits the OVERRIDE BUTTON -- and switches to
     manual. Calvin watches him take the wheel. Shakes her head.

                          CALVIN
                That should be outlawed once and
                for all.

                          SPOONER
                That'll be the day I stop driving.

     Spooner jams the GAS PEDAL and the tunnel becomes a BLUR.
     Calvin holds onto the dashboard. Looking a little pale.

                          CALVIN
                I can recommend a behavior
                modification program, you know --
                if you want to overcome your robo-
                phobia.

                          SPOONER
                I'm not afraid of robots.   I just
                don't like them.

                          CALVIN
                Why? Because they make every
                aspect of our lives more
                convenient?

                          SPOONER
                Exactly. They do our dirty work.
                Ever do hard labor, Doctor? Gets
                pretty old, pretty fast. Nobody
                can do someone else's dirty work
                without coming to hate them. I
                don't want to be around when your
                robots decide they've taken their
                last order.

                                                              31.


                          CALVIN
                That day will never come,
                Detective. Robots aren't like
                human beings -- they don't question
                their existence.

     Spooner cranks the gear shift.    Throwing her a look.

                          SPOONER
                Spoken like a true robo-phile.

38   EXT. U.S. ROBOTICS PLANT - NIGHT                               38

     The car comes to a stop in a vast INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT.

     Spooner and Calvin get out, looking up at the imposing facade
     of a U.S. Robotics Assembly Plant. A long STEEL GATE -- too
     high to see over -- protects the unmarked complex.

39   EXT. MAIN GATE - NIGHT                                         39

     Calvin looks anxious as the DOOR MECHANISM scans her U.S.R.
     ID. She shoots a look at Spooner. They wait. Then, slowly,
     the gate begins to open.

40   INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT                                           40

     A NIGHT FOREMAN leads them down a hallway.    Shaking his head.

                          NIGHT FOREMAN
                Head-Office already ordered a
                system-wide inventory check. Don't
                know about a missing NS-2...

     Looks back at Spooner.

                          NIGHT FOREMAN
                What'd you say you did?

                          SPOONER
                Research and Development.

     As Spooner pushes past him into...

41   INT. CONTROL BOOTH - CONTINUOUS                                41

     ...the Control Booth. Overlooking the pristine Factory
     Floor. The Foreman starts working the controls of a central
     computer.

                          CALVIN
                All Nestors accounted for?

                                                                32.


     The SCREEN scrolls with INVENTORY FIGURES.

                           NIGHT FOREMAN
                     (gesturing)
                 As you can see, all properly
                 catalogued. Your robot just isn't
                 here.

     Calvin turns to say something to Spooner. But he isn't
     there. She looks around. Then sees the Foreman reacting.
     Looks out the window at...

     SPOONER.   Walking out onto the factory floor.

42   INT. FACTORY FLOOR - NIGHT                                       42

     Spooner trots alongside an ASSEMBLY LINE BELT. Lined with NS-
     2 LEGS. New. Gleaming. Heading towards the assembly room.

     Calvin and the Foreman.   Catching up.   Over the noise:

                           NIGHT FOREMAN
                 Like I said, sir -- we have one
                 hundred fully assembled NS-2s
                 housed here. That's our capacity.
                 Last week we had one hundred.
                 Yesterday we had one hundred --

     Spooner, slowing.   Finally spotting what he was looking for.
     Points at:

     A GAP.   On the assembly belt.    ONE LEG MISSING.

                           SPOONER
                 Well today you have one-hundred and
                 one.

43   INT. FACTORY FLOOR - NIGHT                                       43

     A STORAGE COMPARTMENT opens and 101 NS-2s march out in tight
     formation. Every step and swing of the arm in unison. The
     sound of METAL FOOTSTEPS reverberating through the plant as
     101 Robots organise themselves into long straight lines.

     Spooner and Calvin look up and down the formation. They all
     look alike. Spooner. Throws up his hands.

                           SPOONER
                     (to Calvin)
                 You're the robot shrink.

     The Robots stand motionless.     A strange tableau.   Calvin.
     Takes a step forward.

                                                          33.


                     CALVIN
           There is a robot in this formation
           that does not belong. Identify it.

101 robots answer in unison.    Their mechanical VOICES
resounding:

                     101 ROBOTS
           ONE OF US.

                     CALVIN
           Which one?

                     101 ROBOTS
           ONE OF US.

                     CALVIN
           That is not a satisfactory answer!

                     101 ROBOTS
           ONE OF US.

                     SPOONER
           That's helpful.

                     CALVIN
           I could always interview each one
           individually and cross-reference
           their responses to detect any
           anomalies.

                     SPOONER
           How long would that take?

                     CALVIN
           About three weeks.

They share a look. Clearly not an option.      Then.   Calvin.
Gets an idea. Turns to Spooner...

                      CALVIN
           Or...

...and GRABS his GUN from his holster.   He jumps back.

                     CALVIN
           We have one hundred robots here
           that cannot allow a human being to
           come to harm...

Their eyes lock.   Spooner, getting what she's doing.

                                                           34.


                       SPOONER
             And one that can.

She raises the gun to Spooner's head.    Hand, unsteady.

                       CALVIN
             Am I holding this right?

                       SPOONER
             More or less.

Calvin.    Swallows.   Looks over at the robots.   Then COCKS the
gun...

AND THE ROBOTS COME THUNDERING TOWARDS THEM. Like a row of
linebackers. Arms straight out. Their footsteps DEAFENING.
Coming CLOSER and CLOSER...

When CALVIN. Lowers the gun. The Robots. All stop in
unison. Immediately returning to their resting positions.

Spooner and Calvin stare out. EVERY ONE OF THE ROBOTS MOVED.
Standing right in front of them, like metal statues.

Spooner.    Has had enough.   Takes the gun back from Calvin...

                       SPOONER
             Enough game-playing.

...And BAM! Blows the head off of the nearest Robot.       Its
body crumples to the ground.

                       SPOONER
             Guess that wasn't it.

Calvin. Cannot believe what he just did.     Rushes over to the
destroyed Robot.

                       CALVIN
             What are you doing?!

Spooner walks down the row, holding his gun in plain view.

                       SPOONER
                 (calling out)
             This is a self-preservation field
             test! DO NOT attempt to save
             yourselves. Any of you. That's an
             order!

FROM THE CONTROL BOOTH the Night Foreman screams over the
P.A.:

                                                             35.


                          NIGHT FOREMAN
                Are you crazy? Those are eight
                hundred thousand dollar machines!

     Spooner randomly stops at another Robot.    Raises his gun.

                          SPOONER
                You hear that? You're worth more
                than I'll make in my entire life...

     His finger tightening on the trigger when Calvin suddenly
     grabs his arm.

                          CALVIN
                You can't just destroy them!

     Spooner. Looking down at her. WHEN SUDDENLY something
     catches his eye. A MOVEMENT. Down the line. Almost.
     Imperceptible.

     He jerks his head.   Locking eyes with a ROBOT.   A couple feet
     away. It's him!

                          SPOONER
                Gotcha.

     The Robot Suspect LEAPS forward. Grabbing onto the RAILING
     of an OVERHEAD CATWALK. His movements almost balletic as he
     swings himself up...

     Spooner drops to his knee...taking aim...but misses as the
     Robot launches himself THROUGH THE CONTROL BOOTH WINDOW with
     a terrific CRASH...

44   INT. CONTROL BOOTH - NIGHT                                    44

     Spooner and Calvin rush in to find the Night Foreman hiding
     under his desk. Glass everywhere. An ALARM SCREAMING. The
     door on the other side, barely hanging off a hinge.

     Spooner hurries forward. Then stops. Turning to Calvin.
     Reaches down for his back-up gun and presses it into her
     hand.

                          SPOONER
                You don't know what's going to
                happen in there.

     As if admitting defeat. Calvin's fingers, wrapping around
     the gun. As Spooner leads them to the door and down into...

                                                             36.


45   INT. ASSEMBLY ROOM - CONTINUOUS                               45

     ...the ASSEMBLY ROOM. Every surface looking like part of a
     great glass and metal machine. Endless high-tech planes
     holding ROBOTS in various states of assembly. The deafening
     ROAR of the assembly line as it slides, rotates, and gnashes
     METAL BODIES...

     Spooner.   Motioning Calvin to stay behind him.   As they
     descend.   Into the cavernous room.

     And enter. A narrow corridor of bodies. Sliding past them.
     Brushing shoulders, thighs, hands. Spooner. Wiping sweat
     from his brow. Trying. To pivot himself...

     When the room. Suddenly REARRANGES itself. Another LINE of
     ROBOTS. Descending between Spooner and Calvin. Cutting them
     off from one another...

     Spooner. Catching glimpses of Calvin. On the other side of
     the metal bodies. Trying. To cut through. His heart.
     Starting to POUND. As Calvin. Disappears...

     He swivels round. But another line of ROBOTS. Drops down.
     Cutting him off. He stumbles back. As another line.
     Appears before him...

     Breathing. Getting heavier. He looks down at his hand.
     It's trembling. NOISE CRASHING, all around him. Everywhere
     he turns. More ROBOTS...BLANK EYES...GAPING MOUTHS...

     He darts through the line. Finds a wall. Leaning against
     it, pulls a small BOTTLE from his pocket. Rips off the lid.
     Shakes out a couple PILLS. Swallows them. Staring down. At
     his trembling hand. Squeezing his eyes. Open and shut...

     WHEN SUDDENLY. A passing ROBOT. Grabs him by the collar.
     SMASHING him against the wall. It's the Suspect. Spooner.
     Sinks to the ground. As the Suspect Robot. Slips off the
     line. STANDING. Over him. Raising his arms. Could end it.
     Right now. But looks. Into Spooner's eyes...

     Then turns.   Disappearing.

     Spooner. Stunned for a second. Then. Rallies. Scrambles
     to his feet and plunges back into the maze of bodies. Hears
     a POUNDING. In the distance. Catches a glimpse. Of the
     Robot. Trying to SMASH through a large SECURITY DOOR. With
     his metal fists...

     Spooner's view. Blocked once again.   By a shifting row.
     When a HAND. Lands on his shoulder.   He wheels round.

                                                                 37.


     To find CALVIN. Takes her by the arm.     And forces them
     through a line...

     EMERGING into the open. The ROBOT. Still pounding.
     Desperate. Like a trapped animal...

                          CALVIN
                Now what do we do?

                          SPOONER
                I've already done it.

     And suddenly, the massive SECURITY DOOR RISES...

46   EXT. U.S. ROBOTICS PLANT - CONTINUOUS                             46

     The Robot Suspect takes its chance.     Runs full out.   STOPS.

     Bergin is standing in front of a solid wall of POLICE CARS.
     UNIFORMED OFFICERS are aiming SPECIALISED RIFLES at the
     Robot. FLASHING LIGHTS reflecting off its metal surface.

     The Robot turns to Spooner.     Extends its hands.   Palms out.

                          ROBOT
                WHAT AM I?

     Spooner is surprised. A POLICE OFFICER fires, RUBBERISED
     NETTING shooting out at Sonny. A SECOND OFFICER fires and a
     second net covers him. Then a THIRD...

     ...and the Robot falls to the ground, struggling.

     Calvin glares at Spooner.    Furious.   Hurt.   Betrayed.

                          CALVIN
                We had a deal.

     But Spooner doesn't look at her.    His eyes are locked on that
     Robot.

47   INT. POLICE H.Q. - HOMICIDE UNIT - EARLY MORNING                  47

     Bergin enters.   Finds EVERYONE focused on the VIDEO WALL:

     ON SCREEN. A NEWS REPORTER is speaking over images of street
     violence perpetrated against ROBOTS.

                          NEWS REPORTER
                Violence erupted last night in
                response to unconfirmed reports
                that Dr. Heinrich Hogenmiller, a
                top employee at U.S.
                          (MORE)

                                                               38.


                          NEWS REPORTER (cont'd)
                Robotics, was killed yesterday
                morning by a robot. While there
                has been no official response from
                the company, police sources have
                confirmed that a robot is being
                held as "evidence..."

     Bergin grimaces.   This is not good.

48   INT. CELL OBSERVATION BOOTH - EARLY MORNING                     48

     Spooner stares at his reflection in a large MIRROR.     Touches
     a control and the mirror becomes a WINDOW onto...

     A HOLDING CELL. The Robot Suspect sits at the table.
     Shackled to the chair. Staring at the table top.

     BERGIN steps up beside Spooner.   Looks through the glass.

                          LT. BERGIN
                I can't tell if it's not moving
                because it's trying to psych us
                out, or because it's just a
                machine. Or both.

                          SPOONER
                I want to go in.

                          LT. BERGIN
                Orders are nobody steps into that
                room `til Lanning and his attorneys
                get here.

     Spooner.   Throws him a look.   Bergin, his loyalties torn.

                          LT. BERGIN
                Five minutes.

49   INT. HOLDING CELL - EARLY MORNING                               49

     Spooner enters. Pulls out a chair and drags it far from the
     table. He's been jumped too many times by this machine.

     Four mounted cameras WHIR to life.     The Robot.   Perfectly
     still.

                          SPOONER
                    (sitting)
                Identify.

     The Robot tilts its head with a muted WHIR.     As if it doesn't
     understand him. Spooner. Disdainful.

                                                        39.


                       SPOONER
             You are an NS-2 Nestor-class robot.
             Your primary function is to perform
             the tasks assigned to you.
             Identify.

                       THE ROBOT
             I am an NS-2 Nestor-class robot.
             My primary function --

                       SPOONER
                 (interrupting)
             Cancel. Perform task.

Spooner wings a FILE onto the table. It comes to a stop near
the Robot. The Robot, lifts one of its hands. Gently
resting its metal fingers on top of the file. Then opens it.

A stack of PICTURES.     HOGENMILLER'S CORPSE.

                         SPOONER
             Describe.

The Robot's emotionless face studies the grim images.

                       SPOONER
             You have over 10,000 words stored
             in your memory. One third of those
             are adjectives. Describe.

Nothing.

                       SPOONER
             Why don't I take a crack? Heinrich
             Hogenmiller, your creator. With a
             bullet in his brain. A bullet you
             put there.

The Robot.   Looks up at Spooner.

                       SPOONER
             Cold-blooded murder is a pretty new
             trick for a robot, don't you think?
             Answer.

The Robot slowly closes the file and slides it back across
the table. Spooner. Crosses his arms.

                       SPOONER
             Maybe you're stonewalling me.
             Maybe you're sitting there right
             now thinking, "This guy's a
             complete asshole." That it?

                                                      40.


Still nothing.

                      SPOONER
           Come on.   Am I right?

                     THE ROBOT
           Yes. You are right.      You are a
           complete asshole.

And for a moment, Spooner is shocked. You can see it in his
eyes. He sits back in his chair. Forcing a tight smile.

                     SPOONER
           Okay. I guess that's a start. Now
           maybe you can tell me what you were
           doing hiding five feet away from
           Hogenmiller's corpse?

                     THE ROBOT
           I was frightened.

                     SPOONER
           Frightened. Why do you suppose Dr.
           Hogenmiller would create a robot
           that could simulate fear?

                     THE ROBOT
           I don't know.

                     SPOONER
           Doesn't seem like a very useful
           thing for a robot to have.

                     THE ROBOT
           I don't know why.

                     SPOONER
           I wouldn't want my toaster to be
           frightened. Or my vacuum cleaner --

SUDDENLY the Robot SLAMS its metal hands down on the table.

                     THE ROBOT
           I DON'T KNOW!

Spooner flinches.   Slightly.

                     SPOONER
           Looks like you can simulate other
           emotional states. I think that
           one's called "anger." Have you
           ever simulated anger before?

                                                         41.


The Robot doesn't respond.

                     SPOONER
           Answer me, robot.

                     THE ROBOT
           My name is Sonny.

                     SPOONER
               (amused)
           So we're naming you now.

                     SONNY
           Dr. Hogenmiller would make me
           sleep.

                     SPOONER
           You mean he'd turn you off.

                       SONNY
           Yes.

                     SPOONER
           And you didn't like being turned
           off. So one day you decided to
           stop him.

                       SONNY
           No.

                     SPOONER
           You found his gun, pointed it at
           his head. And pulled the trigger.

Sonny shakes his head.    Faster and faster.   Getting upset.

                       SONNY
           No.

                     SPOONER
           You put a bullet in the brain of
           the man who made you.

                       SONNY
           No!    I could never hurt anyone!

                     SPOONER
           But you tried to hurt me.    You took
           a shot at me.

                     SONNY
           My aim is perfect. If I'd wanted
           to hit you, I would have.

                                                              42.


     Spooner's expression hardens.

                          SPOONER
                Why would the man who wrote the
                Laws of Robotics build a machine
                that violates them?

                          SONNY
                The Laws say I can protect my own
                existence.

                          SPOONER
                Only if that protection doesn't
                harm a human being.

     A short pause.   Sonny.   Tilts his head.

                          SONNY
                That doesn't seem fair, does it?

     Spooner. Stares at him. Just as...THE DOOR SWINGS OPEN.
     Bergin enters. Sticks his head in.

                          LT. BERGIN
                I need you outside.

     Spooner.   Not wanting to go.   Not wanting to stay.   Gets
     up...

                          SONNY
                Detective.

     He stops. Turns back to the Robot.      It looks up at him.    For
     a moment -- so human...

                          SONNY
                I did not kill him.

                          SPOONER
                You were the only one in the room.
                If you didn't, who did?

     He turns and heads out the door.

50   INT. OUTSIDE HOLDING CELL - CONTINUOUS                          50

     Bergin closes the door.   To Spooner:

                          LT. BERGIN
                We're being blind-sided.

                                                             43.


51   INT. HOMICIDE UNIT HEARING ROOM - MORNING                     51

     Spooner and Bergin, head into a small COURTROOM off the main
     squad room. Lanning is huddled with Aronson and a half-dozen
     other COMPANY LAWYERS.

     Spooner's jaw tenses. As he watches Toller emerge from the
     clutch. Shaking hands. Slapping backs. Strolls over to
     them.

                            TOLLER
                  We got Judge Drexel...

                            ROBOT BAILIFF
                  This hearing is called to order!

     AS A LARGE SCREEN. BLIPS on behind them. The two opposing
     sides, assemble before it. JUDGE DREXEL, still in his
     pajamas and robe. An NS-2 ROBOT. Leaning in to serve him a
     cup of tea.

                            JUDGE DREXEL
                  Statements, gentlemen.

     Aronson.    Standing at a glass podium.

                            ARONSON
                  Your Honor, the State is treating
                  the robot as a defendant. But in
                  fact it is a piece of property.
                  Property belonging to U.S.
                  Robotics.

     Toller.    Arm resting on his podium.

                            TOLLER
                  This robot has been implicated in
                  the death of a human being, Your
                  Honor.

                            ARONSON
                  Which places the incident firmly
                  within the realm of an industrial
                  accident. Or is the State going to
                  argue this case s a homicide?

                            JUDGE DREXEL
                  That's a good question.

                             TOLLER
                  No, sir.   Of course not.

     Spooner.    Pointing a finger at the U.S. Robotics group.

                                                           44.


                       SPOONER
             Their machine shot and killed a
             man!

Toller.    Shoots him a look.     Just as Lanning speaks up.

                       LANNING
             There's actually no concrete
             evidence that points to that
             conclusion, Your Honor...

Spooner.    Throws up his arms...

                        SPOONER
             What?...

                       LANNING
             But we recognise that this robot is
             an aberration. And in the interest
             of public safety, U.S. Robotics
             proposes that it be destroyed
             immediately.

No one expected this.    Least of all Spooner.    He turns to
Toller.

                       SPOONER
             You can't let them destroy evidence
             in an ongoing investigation!

                       TOLLER
             I'm not sure you even have an
             investigation any more.

JUST THEN the door opens.    Everyone turns as Calvin enters.
Spooner looks surprised.

                       ARONSON
             Your Honor, I'd like to call our
             company robo-psychologist to the
             stand.

                       JUDGE DREXEL
             Very well.

Calvin crosses to the podium. A SPEAKER asking:
Doyousweartotellthetruththewholetruthandnothingbutthetruth?

                        CALVIN
             I do.

                                                               45.


                            ARONSON
                  Dr. Calvin, please tell us what
                  conclusions you've reached after
                  having observed the robot in
                  action.

                            CALVIN
                  There is a design flaw in the
                  robot. Its programming is
                  advanced, but unstable, leaving the
                  Three Laws in a grave imbalance.

                            ARONSON
                  In your expert opinion, what
                  measures should be taken regarding
                  the device?

     Calvin.    Staring straight ahead.   Avoiding Spooner's eye.

                            CALVIN
                  The robot must be destroyed.

     Spooner can't believe what he's just heard. About to speak
     up when Toller grabs his arm. Squeezing it. Hard.

     Judge Drexel has heard enough.    Decides.

                            JUDGE DREXEL
                  The robot in question will be
                  transferred to a U.S. Robotics
                  facility where it can be properly
                  examined to ensure an imbalance of
                  this sort never occurs again. No
                  one goes near it except qualified
                  U.S.R. personnel. When the
                  examination is complete, the robot
                  is to be destroyed.

     Starts getting up from his chair.    Already done with this.

                            ROBOT BAILIFF
                  This hearing is adjourned!

     A BURST of CONVERSATION as the screen BLIPS off. The U.S.R.
     camp, looking especially pleased. Spooner. Catching
     Calvin's eye briefly. As Lanning leads her towards the exit,
     his hand on her back.

52   EXT. POLICE H.Q. - DAY                                          52

     Spooner.    Trotting down the front steps of the Police
     Station.    Pissed. His cell phone BLEATS...

                                                            46.


                           SPOONER
                     (answering)
                 Spooner.

                           BALDEZ' VOICE
                 They're making me turn over all the
                 evidence...

                                               INTERCUT WITH:

53   INT. CRIME LAB - CONTINUOUS                                  53

     BALDEZ. Standing in his crime lab. Behind him, THREE-
     DIMENSIONAL PROJECTIONS of DEAD BODIES. Hovering in the
     precise positions they were found.

                           SPOONER'S VOICE
                 Welcome to the great American cover-
                 up.

                           BALDEZ
                 I wanted to tell you something I
                 found before they suck it all up
                 into their computer.

     Walks over to the projection of HOGENMILLER'S BODY.

                                               INTERCUT WITH:

     Spooner. Crossing the Plaza. Sees LANNING, ARONSON, and
     CALVIN walking ahead of him...

                           BALDEZ' VOICE
                 There are bruises on Hogenmiller's
                 wrists...

                           SPOONER
                 That's natural. There was a
                 struggle.

                           BALDEZ' VOICE
                 You're not getting me...

                                               INTERCUT WITH:

     Baldez.   Studying the projection's wrists.

                           BALDEZ
                 Both wrists. I 14-ed them -- They
                 were inflicted at the same time the
                 shot was fired...

                                               INTERCUT WITH:

                                                                47.


     Spooner's pace.    Slows.

                            BALDEZ' VOICE
                  How's that possible?

     JUST THEN.    A faint BLIP.   On the line.   Spooner.   Reacts.

                             SPOONER
                  Baldez?

                            BALDEZ' VOICE
                  I'm here, man...

                            SPOONER
                  Who else is on the line?
                      (nothing)
                  I said who's there?...

     Nothing. He looks up. Aronson, Lanning and Calvin. Heading
     down a plaza EXIT. Aronson. Throwing a look over his
     shoulder.

     Spooner.     Hangs up his phone.

54   INT. POLICE H.Q. - CORRIDOR - DAY                                 54

     CLOSE ON Sonny being escorted down a corridor by Toller,
     Bergin and a number of heavily-armed OFFICERS. He's bound
     with high-tech SHACKLES.

55   INT. UNDERGROUND CAR PARK - DAY                                   55

     Sonny and his police entourage emerge from the elevator into
     an underground car park. Spooner. Waiting for them. Heads
     over. Toller. Holds out his hand.

                            TOLLER
                  Case is closed, Spooner.

                            SPOONER
                  Apparently...

     He pushes past him.     Falling into step beside Sonny.

                            SONNY
                  I didn't expect to see you again,
                  Detective...

                            SPOONER
                  I need you to help me clear
                  something up.

                                                        48.


                     SONNY
           I'll do my best.

                     SPOONER
           A scientist builds a robot that
           acts like a man. More like a man
           than any robot ever before. It
           shoots him and U.S. Robotics calls
           it a failure.

                     SONNY
           What would you call it?

                     SPOONER
           A stunning success.
               (beat)
           You were there, Robot.    What am I
           missing?

                     SONNY
           I don't know.

                     SPOONER
           Don't start simulating ignorance.

                     SONNY
           I'm not simulating ignorance,
           Detective. I'm experiencing it.       I
           was asleep.

                     SPOONER
           You mean you were shut down.

                     SONNY
           No, I was asleep.

                     SPOONER
           Robots don't sleep. Human beings
           sleep. Understand? Dogs sleep.
           You're a machine. An imitation.
           An illusion of life. Can a robot
           write a symphony? Can a robot take
           a blank canvas and paint a
           masterpiece?

A pause.   Then the muted WHIR as Sonny turns to him.

                     SONNY
           Can you do either of those things?

Spooner. Momentarily stumped. As a VAN from U.S. ROBOTICS
pulls up. The back door dropping open. An ENGINEER motions
to the Robot.

                                                       49.


                     ENGINEER
           Step forward. Enter.

                     SONNY
           They're going to destroy me, aren't
           they?

Spooner.   Watching him step into the van.

                      SPOONER
           Yes.

Sonny sits down. With an almost human melancholy.   The
Engineers, securing him in place.

                     SONNY
           The Doctor was right. He told me
           everything was going to change....

The Engineers start to close the doors. But Spooner reaches
out to stop them. Sonny. Looks over at him.

                     SONNY
           It's changing already...
               (beat)
           Can't you feel it?

As CLANG! The van door CLOSES. Spooner, stepping back.
Something. Just not right. Lieutenant Bergin comes up
beside him.

                     LT. BERGIN
           You should be happy. That's one
           less robot in the world.

                     SPOONER
           They're going to destroy the most
           advanced robot in the world, John.
           That doesn't strike you as odd?

                     LT. BERGIN
           Killer robots are bad for business.
           Even your friend Dr. Calvin said
           so.
               (slaps him on the back)
           Come on. You solved the case.
           Give yourself a break.

Spooner looks at him.   There's no way he's giving himself a
break.

                                                             50.


56   INT./EXT. SPOONER'S CAR - DAY                                 56

     Spooner driving. A small TELEVISION above the windshield.
     LANCE ROBERTSON holding a PRESS CONFERENCE outside U.S.
     Robotics...

                          ROBERTSON ON TV
                ...and I just want to assure you that
                this was an isolated incident. The
                prototype is now in custody -- and
                scheduled for destruction. Your
                robots are perfectly safe. There
                is no cause for alarm...

     Spooner's lip curls. Eyes flicking to a GPS display on the
     dashboard. A TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP pinpointing HOGENMILLER'S
     HOUSE. The CURSOR. Directing him to turn up...

     A STEEP DRIVEWAY

     Narrow. Out of the way. Spooner's brow furrows.     As he
     hears a faraway RUMBLING SOUND...

57   EXT. HOGENMILLER'S HOUSE - DAY                                57

     Dr. Hogenmiller's house. Small. Simple. Built on a huge
     rock promontory overlooking the city. Three DEMOLITION
     ROBOTS rolling towards it. Huge, mashing, sporting massive
     HYDRAULIC POUNDERS.

     Spooner's CAR. SCREECHES to a stop. He jumps out. Races
     over to the nearest machine. Looking around -- no people.

                          SPOONER
                    (to Robot)
                What are you doing?!

     A SCREEN. Blinks to life on the hulking chassis.    A
     disembodied VOICE...

                          DEMOLITION ROBOT
                Demolition ordered...

                          SPOONER
                Who authorised this?

                          DEMOLITION ROBOT
                Demolition ordered...

     Spooner reaches into his coat.    Pulling out his POLICE BADGE.
     Scans it over the screen.

                                                                51.


                          SPOONER
                Override. This is police business.
                Vacate the premises immediately.

                          DEMOLITION ROBOT
                    (beat)
                Affirmative.

     The screen. Blinks off.     Spooner.   Eyeing it.   Turns and
     heads for the house.

58   INT. MAIN ROOM - HOGENMILLER'S HOUSE - DAY                       58

     Spooner pushes the door open. Stepping over the police tape.
     Inside, the main room is spare, untidy. Cups of cold COFFEE,
     littering surfaces. A COT, in the corner.

     On the walls, crooked CERTIFICATES. Heinrich Hogenmiller's
     name written out in academic script. Advanced Degrees in the
     study of Robotics, Physics, Chemistry, Neurology, Ethics. An
     AWARD on the mantelpiece. A silver NS-2. Tarnished.

     Spooner. Opening up a couple drawers of a side table.
     Jumbles of papers. Clippings. Old text books. Then a
     PHOTOGRAPH -- HOGENMILLER AND CALVIN. Standing arm-in-arm.
     Spooner furrows his brow.

     WHEN SOMETHING SUDDENLY RUBS against his leg. He startles.
     Looks down: a CAT. Lonely. Standing next to its automatic
     feeder. Spooner pockets the picture. Starts heading down...

59   INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS                                        59

     ...The hallway. Starts noticing. All over the walls:
     handwriting. EQUATIONS. Scrawled in white pencil. The
     rantings. Of a genius. Glowing. In the sporadic shadows.

     Spooner.   Following the equations.    Down into...

60   INT. BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS                                      60

     ...The back room. Covered. In writing. Walls, floors,
     ceiling. Drawings. Of ROBOTS, of MEN, side by side. In the
     corner, a COMPUTER. A line of CABINETS - DATA STORAGE.

     Spooner, curious. Heads over to one of the cabinets. Takes
     a device out of his pocket and CLAMPS it over the KEYPAD.
     The device blinks RED. Then GREEN. The drawer, slides out.

     LINED. With flat metal objects. Shiny. Thin.          With writing
     on them. Spooner. Reaches for one when...

                                                             52.


     BOOM! Something POUNDS the outside of the room.    Spooner.
     Grabs onto the cabinet...

     BOOM! On the other side. Objects. Flying off table-tops.
     A CRACK spidering along the wall. Holy shit...

                          SPOONER
                    (screaming)
                Halt!

     BOOM! VIBRATIONS, tearing through the room.     More CRACKS.
     Spreading...

     BOOM! The SOUND, horrifying. Spooner stumbles back.      The
     CABINET. Crashing down on his leg. He CRIES OUT...

     BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! The house. Getting pummeled.        Chunks of
     ceiling. Raining down. GLASS...exploding...

     Relentless BOOMING! Spooner...dragging his legs from under
     the cabinet. Scrambling for purchase as...

     THE FLOOR...begins to tilt...the TILES...snapping
     up...ricocheting...around the room...as another cabinet...
     CRASHES to the ground...crumpling...

     Spooner.   Spinning around.   Looking for some kind of exit...

     BOOM! The corner of the room...coming in on itself...the
     floor...listing even more...like a ship...

     Spooner...turning to CLAW his way up to the cracked
     doorway...WHEN...

     SOMETHING catches his eye. In the bottom drawer. Of a
     crumpled CABINET. One of those flat metal plates. He can
     just read what it says: S.O.N.N.Y....

     Spooner...flings his arm back...reaching for the plate...
     snaps it up...JUST AS...

     BOOM! A HYDRAULIC POUNDER SMASHES through the wall...inches
     from his head...OUTSIDE LIGHT...pouring in...

     Spooner scurries for the doorway...tumbling out...

61   INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS                                      61

     ...into the HALLWAY. Sideways. Trammeled plaster. BOOM!
     Another POUNDER...crashing down from above. Spooner. Timing
     it...rolling...BOOM!...just under the next pounding...

                                                           53.


     Scampering up...towards some LIGHT...BOOM!...the
     POUNDER...right on his heels...he clambers...closer...
     closer...when...he hears...MEOWING...looks back...the
     CAT...scared out of its wits...BOOM!...the POUNDER CRASHING
     in...Spooner...just manages...to scoop up the cat...just as
     BOOM!...

62   EXT. DEMOLISHED HOUSE - CONTINUOUS                            62

     ...He pours them out into the open. The POUNDERS. Going at
     the house like hyenas at a corpse. Roof tiles, beams,
     plaster, flooring. SNAPPING and CRACKING as Spooner and the
     cat skitter down the carnage.

     Heart pounding, breath jagged, face bloodied, Spooner
     scrambles away from the POUNDERS. Their bodies GLEAMING in
     the dusk sun. The III Laws Safe logo, splashed along their
     sides...

     Spooner.   Drops the cat.

63   INT. HALLWAY - CALVIN'S CONDO - NIGHT                         63

     Spooner. POUNDS on the door. It opens. Calvin. Standing
     there in her bathrobe. Shocked at his appearance.

                          CALVIN
                Detective! What happened to
                you?...

                          SPOONER
                A couple of your beloved robots
                just tried to kill me...

     He pushes past her.   Into...

64   INT. CALVIN'S CONDO - CONTINUOUS                              64

     ...her condo.   Spartan.    Unadorned.

                         CALVIN
                What? That's impossible.      You
                know...

                          SPOONER
                What I know is a demolition crew
                started tearing down Hogenmiller's
                house while I was still inside it.

                          CALVIN
                Maybe they didn't realise...

                                                         54.


                      SPOONER
            I scanned my badge before I went
            in. They realised.

                      CALVIN
            Then you must have done it wrong...

                      SPOONER
            I don't think you're hearing what
            I'm saying -- they tried to kill
            me.

Spooner moves deeper into the apartment.   Everything.
Automated. Computerised. Cold...

                      SPOONER
            There's something going on, here.
            Some kind of shift.

Calvin laughs.   Can't believe what she's hearing.

                      CALVIN
            Do you know how paranoid you sound?

                      SPOONER
            Great. Now I'm being analysed by a
            robo-psychologist.

                      CALVIN
            You just want to find the flaws in
            the system. You're obsessed with
            it. You'll twist anything to fit
            your agenda.

                      SPOONER
            Like you did in court today? How'd
            that fit your agenda, Doctor?

He pulls out the PHOTO of Calvin and Hogenmiller. Calvin.
Blanching at the sight of it. Spooner tosses it down.

                      SPOONER
            You told me you hardly knew him.
            Want to try the truth this time?

                      CALVIN
            Well, Detective, when you see
            someone you know well put a bullet
            through their brain, it makes you
            wonder if you ever really knew them
            at all.

Calvin.   Looking down at the photo.   Swallows.

                                                         55.

                       CALVIN
                 (difficult for her)
             He was my mentor. No, more than
             that. A genius with an insight far
             beyond anyone in his field.

                       SPOONER
             Doesn't sound like the washed-up
             old fool Robertson described.

                       CALVIN
             But he was starting to withdraw
             from everyone. Even me.
             Maybe...if I'd tried harder to
             reach him...
                 (shakes her head)
             The Doctor was reckless when he
             created a robot potentially not
             bound by the Three Laws. He could
             have ruined everything we'd been
             working for.

Spooner.    Locking eyes with her.

                       SPOONER
             Sounds like a motive for murder to
             me. Just not for the suspect we
             have in custody.

Calvin. Blinks. Trying, to stick to her resolve. Heads
over to the door. Spooner. Looking around the condo.

                       SPOONER
             You know there's not one thing in
             this apartment that looks like a
             human being lives here. No
             evidence of a life outside your
             work. Almost seems like you're
             afraid of people.

Calvin.    Opening the door.

                       CALVIN
             I'm not afraid of people,
             Detective. I just don't like them.

Spooner. Looks at her.     Then heads out the door.   Calvin
SLAMS it behind him...

The SOUND...of the SLAM...REVERBERATING...and we...

                                           FADE INTO:

                                                             56.


65   INT. DREAM SEQUENCE - DAY                                      65

     ...A DEEP...DEEP...DARKNESS.

     A FLICKER. Of LIGHT. Off to the side. Just barely.
     Noticeable. ORANGE... YELLOW...as we realise...It's FIRE...

     Another SOUND...GLASS...SHATTERING...then a SIREN...
     faraway...

     The disembodied VOICE...coming out of nowhere...

                          DISEMBODIED VOICE (V.O.)
                You are in danger...

     The FIRE...BUILDING...

                          DISEMBODIED VOICE (V.O.)
                You are in danger...

     ECHOING...as...

66   INT. SPOONER'S BEDROOM - MORNING                               66

     SPOONER'S EYES.   Spring open.

     Lying, in bed. Heart POUNDING. SWEAT. Covering his body.
     LIGHT. Pouring in through the slats of his blinds.

     He sits up. Rubbing his face. Trying. To calm his
     breathing. Takes a look at his watch...

67   EXT. MONORAIL STATION - DAY                                    67

     Spooner walking along the monorail plaza. Looking a little
     worse for wear. PEOPLE. Giving him wide berth. ROBOTS.
     Bidding him:

                          ROBOT
                Good morning...

     Spooner, shooting them suspicious looks.    As the MONORAIL
     pulls up...

                                                 CUT TO:

68   INT. HALLWAY - U.S. ROBOTICS - CONTINUOUS                      68

     Calvin. Heading down a hallway. A DOOR slides open.      And
     Lanning steps out. Followed by a TECHNICIAN ROBOT...

                          CALVIN
                Find anything, Doctor?

                                                                 57.


                          LANNING
                    (shaking his head)
                Nothing. The interior's just like
                any other NS-2. Except for a
                secondary battery Hogenmiller must
                have used as extra back-up.
                    (looks at watch)
                We'll just need a nominal profile.

     Calvin nods.

                                               CUT BACK TO:

69   INT. MONORAIL - CONTINUOUS                                        69

     Spooner, holding onto a handrail. As the city rushes by the
     window. Notices a group of ROBOTS. At the other end of the
     car. Are they watching him?

     He wipes a bead of sweat.    From his upper lip.

                                               CUT TO:

70   INT. HOLDING CELL - CONTINUOUS                                    70

     An all-metal room. Spare. Anti-septic.     SONNY.   Sitting on
     the floor. Against the wall.

     Calvin enters.   Puts her pad down on the table.    Sits.

                          CALVIN
                Please state your serial number and
                assembly date.

     She pulls out a pen.   Waiting for an answer.   Nothing.

                                               CUT BACK TO:

71   INT. MONORAIL - CONTINUOUS                                        71

     Spooner. Watching as a HOMELESS MAN.    Comes stumbling
     through the car...

                           CALVIN'S VOICE (V.O.)
                Sonny.   I'm speaking to you...

     The Homeless Man.   Suddenly grabs his ears and shouts:

                          HOMELESS MAN
                God, can't you be quiet!

                                               CUT TO:

                                                               58.


72   INT. HOLDING CELL - CONTINUOUS                                  72

     Calvin.   Still looking down at her pad.

                           CALVIN
                 How about your data board
                 designation?

     Still. Sonny says nothing. Calvin. Finally looks up at
     him. Is suddenly struck. Something about the way he's
     sitting -- so human.

     She gets up and walks over. Hesitates. Then slides down on
     the floor next to him. Studying. His profile.

                           CALVIN
                 Maybe I'm asking the wrong
                 questions. How about this one:

                           CALVIN'S VOICE (V.O.)
                 ...What program are you running
                 through right now?

                           SONNY'S VOICE (V.O.)
                 I'm not sure. It's nothing I
                 recognise.

     The Homeless Man.   Pointing to the group of ROBOTS.

                           HOMELESS MAN
                     (shouting)
                 Don't you people hear them?
                 They're talking to each other!
                 Buzz, buzz, zip, zip...they never
                 shut up!

     Calvin. Fascinated.    Noticing a small SLIT.   At the base of
     Sonny's neck.

                           CALVIN
                 Describe his behavior in the last
                 few weeks.

                                                               59.


                          SONNY
                I'm sorry?

                          CALVIN
                Dr. Hogenmiller. Did he seem
                overly sad or withdrawn to you?

     Spooner watches. As the Homeless Man picks up a SODA CAN and
     hurls it at the Robots. Hitting one of them on the side of
     the head.

                          SONNY'S VOICE (V.O.)
                No. Not at all. But he was
                agitated...

     The Robot. Leans down and picks up the soda can.      Holds it
     back out to the Homeless Man.

                          SONNY'S VOICE (V.O.)
                ...He would claim things were
                missing from the lab.

     The Homeless Man. Incensed.     SUDDENLY ROARS.   Making a rush
     for the Robots when...

     SPOONER'S HAND.    Grabs his shoulder.   Stops him.

                          SPOONER
                This is your stop.

                          SONNY
                I didn't pay much attention. He
                would spend hours looking for his
                eyeglasses and they would be...

                          CALVIN
                    (finishing for him)
                ...right on top of his head.

     Sonny nods. She knows him well, too. Calvin swallows.
     Looking right into Sonny's eyes. Feeling like there's
     something...something more behind them.

                                                               60.


     WHEN SUDDENLY...VICTOR APPEARS above them. His face, turning
     into a SCREEN -- the image of LANCE ROBERTSON. Looking down
     at them.

                           ROBERTSON
                 I think we're done here, Susan.

                           CALVIN
                     (getting to her feet)
                 But, sir, I was just...

                     (interrupting)
                 I said I think we're done.

     Calvin.   Not misreading.   The threatening undertone.

     Spooner stepping out onto the platform, pulling the Homeless
     Man along with him. COMMUTERS pour out around them.

     As the train pulls off with a WHOOSH. The Homeless Man.
     Backs away from Spooner. Grinning insanely. Pointing.

                           HOMELESS MAN
                 Why are you protecting them, man?
                     (short pause)
                 They were talking about you!

     A CHILL. Ripping up Spooner's spine. As he watches the
     Homeless Man. Wander down the platform.

     Tries. To shake off the feeling. As he turns. To wait for
     the next train. Suddenly realising. That he's ALONE on the
     platform. Watches. A huge DIGITAL CLOCK. Ticking off
     seconds. Sees. CAMERAS in every corner.

     Then that feeling. At the back of his neck. He turns and
     spots. A couple MAINTENANCE ROBOTS. Carrying luggage. Onto
     the platform. Then more COMMUTERS show up. Waiting. For
     the next train. More MAINTENANCE ROBOTS. Following them.

     Spooner. Steps up to the platform's edge.       Craning to see.
     The approaching TRAIN...

     WHEN SUDDENLY. He feels a sharp SHOVE. At the back of his
     knee. His shoe, slipping. Arms. Flailing as he...

                                                             61.


     PITCHES OVER THE EDGE ONTO THE TRACK. People CRYING OUT as
     the TRAIN gets closer. Spooner. Whips his head around.
     Seeing...

     A MAINTENANCE ROBOT. Looking down at him from the platform.
     Suitcase in hand.

     The MAGNETIC-LEVITATING TRAIN. Right on him. Spooner.
     Flips onto his back. Flattening himself. As much as he can.
     Clenching his fists. Bracing himself as...

     THE TRAIN SCREAMS OVER HIM. The sound, DEAFENING. The force
     of the wind. Whipping his tie. His coat. There's nothing,
     for him to hold on to. As his legs start to rise off the
     track. Caught up. In the VORTEX. Spooner starts sliding.
     Along the track...

     Gritting his teeth...there's nothing he can do. Getting
     sucked towards...the air DOWNTAKE...at the center of the
     track. The city...yawning hundreds of feet...below...

78   EXT. PLATFORM - CONTINUOUS                                      78

     THE EXPRESS TRAIN.   Speeding along.   Then with a WHOOSH it's
     gone.

     THE TRACK. Empty. No Spooner. Anywhere. Human COMMUTERS.
     Stunned. Horrified. Start calling. For help.

     The MAINTENANCE ROBOT.    Turns, disappearing into the crowd.

79   EXT. UNDERNEATH TRACK - CONTINUOUS                              79

     CLOSE ON a HAND. Hanging onto the track's edge. It's
     SPOONER. Dangling. Straining. To get another hand hold
     but...

     HE SLIPS. His coat ballooning. As he plummets.     Down...
     down...down...towards the city...

     WHEN SNAP! He's caught. By a cable net. Spooner. Grabbing
     onto it. Sweat, pouring down his face. He turns and sees...

     THE MAINTENANCE ROBOT

     Hurrying down a circular stairwell.    Exiting the station.

     ANGER AND DETERMINATION. Flash across Spooner's eyes. As he
     hoists himself up. Climbing up the net. Back to the...

80   EXT. TRACK - CONTINUOUS                                         80

     A couple SECURITY GUARDS. Rushing towards him...

     Spooner. Getting to his feet. Shoving them out of the way
     as he starts running. Towards...

     THOSE SAME CIRCULAR STAIRS.    Looks over the edge and spots...

     THE MAINTENANCE ROBOT.   Down at STREET LEVEL.   Getting away.

     Spooner. Looks around. Spots a LIGHT POLE.       Paralleling the
     stairs. Takes a step back and...

     LEAPS OUT ONTO THE POLE. Hooking his arm around it. Sliding
     down like a fireman's pole. Gaining speed when THUMP! His
     shoes hit pavement...

82   EXT. STREET - DAY                                               82

     street...

                          SPOONER (O.S.)
                Stop!

     Swivels round. SPOONER. Running up behind it. Whipping out
     his gun. Aiming it at the Robot's head. The Robot. Takes a
     step backwards...

                          SPOONER
                I said stop!

     The Robot. SUDDENLY swinging the suitcase around. SMASHING
     it against Spooner's head. Spooner. Buckles. Falling to
     the ground. Managing to squeeze off a SHOT...

     The Robot. Deflecting the bullet. With the case.      Raising
     it as if to club Spooner with it when...

     BAM! Spooner fires a second shot. Piercing the Robot's
     breastplate. HYDRAULIC FLUID. Starting to leak. The Robot.
     Doesn't hesitate. SLAMS the case into Spooner's face...

     BLOOD. Spurting from Spooner's nose. As he fires the gun.
     At the fleeing Robot. Gets to his feet. Unsteady. Taking
     chase...

83   EXT. PUBLIC PLAZA - CONTINUOUS                                  83

     ...back out onto the Public Plaza.    Sees the Robot heading

                                                                63.


     ESCALATED STAIRS. The Robot. Judging the height. LUNGES
     into the air and lands on a STAIR. Denting it. Reaches the
     bottom. DISAPPEARING. Into a CROWD of even more PEOPLE...

     Spooner. Racing down the stairs. Taking them. Four at a
     time. Hits the ground running. Looking. EVERYWHERE.
     Suddenly losing track. Of where the Robot went...

     Then. Catching sight. JUST AHEAD. Of a ROBOT.         Staring
     back at him. Holding SOMETHING. In its HAND...

     Spooner.   Plunges into the crowd.    Waving his GUN.

                          SPOONER
                Everyone out of the way!

     SCREAMING. PEOPLE SCATTERING. As BAM! BAM! Spooner fires.
     Hitting the Robot in its head and back. It drops to the
     ground. Spooner. Racing over to it. Sees. It's not the
     same Robot. In its hand, a specialised SCREWDRIVER...

                          OWNER
                What the hell do you think you're
                doing?!...

     Its OWNER. Rushing over. Shoving Spooner aside. But
     Spooner's. Not listening. Spotting. A DROP OF HYDRAULIC
     FLUID nearby...

     Lunges forward.   Following.    The drops.   Running faster.     And
     faster...

                           OWNER
                Hey!

     ...Through the CROWD. POLICE SIRENS. In the background.          As
     Spooner. Shoves through. Tracking those drops. Like a
     bloodhound. Turns...

84   INT. ALLEYWAY - CONTINUOUS                                        84

     ...into a narrow alleyway.     The drops.    Ending suddenly.    In
     a PUDDLE.

     Spooner. Crazed. Wounded. Exhausted. Spins around. Where
     is it? Where is it? Then he HEARS. A DROPLET falling.
     Into the puddle. Slowly. Looks up to see...

     THE MAINTENANCE ROBOT. Hovering above him. Straddling the
     two alley walls like some weird metallic rock spider. Its
     III LAWS SAFE Logo GLINTING in the sunlight.....

                                                      64.


Spooner aims his gun and FIRES! The Maintenance Robot, lets
go, falling right onto him. Knocking the gun from his hand.

The Robot swivels around. Bringing down his foot...but...
Spooner...rolls to the side just in time as CRASH! The
Robot's foot...breaks up the concrete...

The Robot...grabs Spooner by the jacket...lifting him
up...shoving him...against the wall...about to CRUSH him
when...

Spooner...kicks out its knees...the Robot...SMASHING into the
wall...then bounces back...trying...to pin Spooner...back...

Man and machine...struggling...Spooner...losing his
footing...falling...The Maintenance Robot...LOOMING over
him...

Spooner's HAND...whips back...grabbing his back-up
WEAPON...squeezing off some SHOTS...into the Robot's arm...it
breaks off...

Spooner...scrambling back...continues FIRING...the
Robot...jerking back...a macabre dance...until Spooner...runs
out of bullets...

The Robot...recovers...grabbing the gun from Spooner's
hand...pistol-whipping him...then picking him up and...

HURLING him against the wall...Spooner...watching as
FLUID...GUSHES from the Robot's body...the Robot...taking a
swing at him which Spooner...

BLOCKS...with his right arm...the Robot...ready...to try
again...but STALLING...having lost...too much fluid...it
TOPPLES...to the ground...

Spooner. Exhausted. Beaten to a pulp. His knees, starting
to buckle. As he thinks he sees. In the DISTANCE...

A ROBOTIC CLEAN-UP CREW...heading down the alley towards
them...

Spooner. Crashes to the ground. As another ROBOT. Suddenly
appears above him. Its FINGERS made up of NEEDLES...as it
closes in on him...

                     SPOONER
           Noooo!

                                        WE FADE...

                                                              65.

     To BLACKNESS. Coming through, a faint, WHIRRING SOUND.       As
     we slowly. FADE IN ON...

     SPOONER'S FACE. Eyes closed. Asleep. Gash above his head.
     Bruises around his eye. Nose swollen, purplish.

     His eyes. Slowly. Flutter open.      His brow. Furrowing. At
     the whirring sound. As he tries.     To figure out. Where he
     is. Looks down to see...

     A couple WHITE METAL ROBOTS. With multiple APPENDAGES.
     Leaning over him. Running LASERS. Over his bruised
     RIBCAGE...

     SPOONER. Tries to bolt upright. But his ARMS and LEGS.         ARE
     CLAMPED to the bed. One of the ROBOTS. Turns to him.

                          MEDICAL ROBOT 1
                Stay still.

     Spooner.   Desperately twisting, struggling...

                          SPOONER
                What are you doing!

     Looking around.   COMPUTER MONITORS.   Everywhere...

                          SPOONER
                What are you doing!?

     JUST THEN. Another ROBOT.   Enters the room.     Holding a
     medical plasma sheet.

                          MEDICAL ROBOT 2
                Detective Del Spooner. You have
                suffered significant trauma to the
                head and chest...

86   EXT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS                                   86

     Lt. Bergin. Standing outside Spooner's hospital room. Turns
     and looks through the window at him thrashing on the bed...

                          SPOONER
                I want to talk to a human being!

87   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MINUTES LATER                                87

     Spooner sitting up in his bed. Rubbing his wrists. The
     metal clams, released. Lt. Bergin. Standing next to him.

                                                      66.


                     SPOONER
           Don't people go to medical school
           any more?

                     LT. BERGIN
           This is one of the best units in
           the city, Del.

One of the Medical Robots turns to Spooner with some PILLS.
Spooner. Stares it down. Grabs his clothes.

                     SPOONER
               (sotto)
           There's some real shit going on
           here, John.

He looks around.    Jumping off the bed.

                     SPOONER
           I went to Hogenmiller's house --
           there was a U.S.R. demolition crew
           there. They overrode my police
           I.D. Tried to tear down the house
           with me in it...

                       LT. BERGIN
           Del...

Spooner pulls on his pants.

                     SPOONER
           ...Then when I went to the monorail
           a Maintenance 10 pushed me onto the
           tracks...

                       LT. BERGIN
           Del...

                     SPOONER
           I had to chase it all across the
           Plaza...

                       LT. BERGIN
           Del.

Spooner.   Stops talking.   Looks at Bergin.

                     LT. BERGIN
           Hogenmiller scheduled that
           demolition crew, it was apparently
           a proviso in his will. And they
           showed no police I.D. on their
           scanner...

                                                              67.


     Spooner.   Trying to look away...

                          LT. BERGIN
                Witnesses at the monorail said you
                fell onto the tracks. That you
                shot at a Fix-It robot on the Plaza
                and that you were found alone in
                the alley. There was no
                Maintenance 10.

                          SPOONER
                What?! John -- that's what they
                want you to believe!
                    (remembering)
                A robot clean-up crew was there --
                it must have cleared away the
                Maintenance 10! And there was
                another robot that tried to drug
                me!

                          LT. BERGIN
                That was an EMT model.

     Spooner.   Sees the look on Bergin's face.

                          SPOONER
                You're giving me that look. That
                treat-him-delicately-he's-coming-
                unhinged-look. I don't need that
                look, John. I need you to hear
                what I'm saying.

     Lt. Bergin.   Embarrassed for him.   Has about had it.

                          LT. BERGIN
                You came back too soon, Del.
                You're back on leave. Effective
                immediately.

     Spooner.   Staring at him.   Betrayed.   Turns and grabs his
     coat.

88   EXT. PLAZA - DAY                                                88

     Spooner walking across the Plaza.    The SUN.   Burgeoning on
     the horizon. Comes to...

     The ESCALATOR the Maintenance 10 jumped down. Stares down.
     At the steps. Waiting. To see the DENTED ONE. Nothing.

                                                                  68.


89   EXT. ALLEY - DAWN                                                  89

     Heads down the ALLEY, where he chased the robot. Studying
     the ground. For any hydraulic fluid. Nothing. The
     concrete, scrubbed clean.

     Spooner.   Rubs his hands over his face.

90   INT. SPOONER'S APARTMENT - DAY                                     90

     Spooner. Lying on his couch. Shades, closed to block out
     the sunlight. Body bruised, cut up, bandaged.

     A KNOCK.   At the door.    He ignores it.   Another KNOCK.

91   INT. HALLWAY - DAY                                                 91

     Spooner pulls open the door.     Surprised to find CALVIN
     standing there.

                           CALVIN
                 You're right. I am afraid of
                 people.

     Spooner.   Looks at her.   Then steps back...

92   INT. SPOONER'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS                              92

     ...letting her inside.

                           CALVIN
                 When you've spent as much time with
                 robots as I have, it's hard to
                 accept the unpredictability of
                 humans. I was wrong to call you
                 paranoid, Detective. You're
                 traumatized. And it makes perfect
                 sense why.

     Spooner.   Unsure.   Looks at her.

                           SPOONER
                 What do you mean?

     Calvin. Reaches out. Takes his right hand. Spooner. Tries
     to pull it away. But Calvin. Stays firm. Her eyes. Never
     leaving his. Pulls the sleeve up from his arm. Turns it
     over. Feeling for something. Then finds. A FLAP. Peels it
     back. TO REVEAL:

     METAL AND WIRING...

     Under the skin.   SILENCE.   Then Spooner:

                                                             69.


                          SPOONER
                How did you?...

                          CALVIN
                I noticed almost right away. The
                way you forced yourself to use your
                left hand. Even though it was
                unnatural to you.

     Spooner.   Pulls his arm away.   Pushing down the sleeve.

                          CALVIN
                How did it happen?

     Not something Spooner wants to re-live.   Looks down.   At his
     robotic arm. Flexing. The fingers.

                          SPOONER
                I was in a high-speed chase.   Six
                months ago...

                                               CUT TO:

93   EXT. ACCIDENT SITE - CITY STREET_- NIGHT (FLASHBACK)          93

     The SOUND of a TREMENDOUS CRASH. As we survey a trail of
     twisted metal and debris. Only vaguely suggesting the
     remains of two CARS...

     CLOSE ON one of the wrecks. SPOONER lies trapped at the
     center of a distorted mass of metal. No room to move. HIS
     RIGHT ARM, TRAPPED...

                          SPOONER (V.O.)
                My right arm was trapped. But I
                could hear an ambulance in the
                distance. I knew they'd have the
                jaws of life...

     We hear SIRENS in the distance. Spooner. Trying to remain
     calm. As he spots. An ELECTRICAL FIRE. Licking up from the
     crumpled hood...

                          SPOONER (V.O.)
                Then I heard it...

                          VOICE (O.S.)
                You are in danger...

     That voice. We've heard it before. From his nightmare.
     Spooner. Craning to see, through the jagged opening that
     used to be his WINDSHIELD. The outline of a ROBOT appearing.
     Eye lenses glowing...

                                                               70.


                            ROBOT
                  You are in danger...

     Spooner stares up at the Robot. Not sure how to react.      The
     sound of SIRENS. Rushing closer...

     The ROBOT.    Starts SMASHING away at the glass...

                             SPOONER
                  No!   Halt! Halt!

     Spooner.     Trying frantically to pull his arm free. Twisting.
     Tugging.     As the Robot's METAL HANDS reach in for him...

                            ROBOT
                  You are in danger...

                                                CUT BACK TO:

94   INT. SPOONER'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS                           94

     The SOUND of his AGONISED SCREAM. Follows us back into the
     present. Spooner. Clenching. His artificial arm.

                            SPOONER
                  The robot pulled me out of the
                  wreck. But left my arm behind.
                      (holds up arm)
                  I woke up four weeks later with
                  this.

     Calvin.    Taking in the story.

                            CALVIN
                  And that's why robots terrify you?

                            SPOONER
                  Let's just say they make me
                  uncomfortable.
                      (pulls out pills)
                  I take these if I get too
                  uncomfortable. Doesn't exactly
                  lend me a lot of credibility on the
                  Force.

                            CALVIN
                  But it doesn't mean you're wrong
                  about this case.

     Calvin. Sits down on the couch.     Pulling her hands through
     her hair.

                                                            71.


                       CALVIN
             I don't believe Sonny did it
             either.

                       SPOONER
             What?

                       CALVIN
             I think about what Hogenmiller must
             have wanted. Robots with the same
             cognitive and emotional abilities
             as humans. But not just
             simulations. I don't know. When I
             was talking to Sonny I was forced
             to put away all the things I've
             ever known -- the Three Laws, the
             rules of programming, basic science
             and engineering.
                 (beat)
             Sonny's the most advanced robot
             I've ever encountered, Detective.
             It's almost as if...he cared for
             Dr. Hogenmiller. I just don't
             believe he's capable of murder.

Spooner.    Looking down at her.   Can hardly believe it.

                       SPOONER
             You mean the great Dr. Calvin is
             basing all this on a feeling?

Calvin.    Smiling ironically.

                       CALVIN
             That and the fact that Robertson
             didn't want me interviewing Sonny
             for any more than five minutes.

Spooner. Suddenly rejuvenated by having an ally. Strides
over to his coat. Pulling out the METAL NAMEPLATE:
S.O.N.N.Y.

                       SPOONER
             Ever seen this before?

                       CALVIN
             No.

                       SPOONER
             I found it at Hogenmiller's house.
             Right before the demolition crew
             tried to make me part of the
             foundation.

                                                                72.


     Calvin takes a deep breath.   Making a decision...

                          CALVIN
                Come on -- there's someone who
                might be able to tell us...

95   EXT. U.S. ROBOTICS - DUSK                                          95

     The massive facade of U.S. Robotics looming against the dusk
     sky. The giant ROBOT STATUE lit up inside.

96   EXT. SIDE ENTRANCE - U.S. ROBOTICS - DUSK                          96

     Calvin, leading Spooner to a SIDE ENTRANCE. Looks around.
     Then scans her I.D. The door. Slides open.

97   INT. HALLWAY - DUSK                                                97

     Calvin and Spooner. Heading down a hallway. Calvin.
     Nervous. Eyes darting. They turn a corner and head down...

98   INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS                                          98

     ...another hallway. Leading to Sonny's holding cell.        Calvin
     stops at the door. Scans her I.D.

99   INT. HOLDING CELL - EVENING                                        99

     Sonny. Sitting at the table. Working on a DRAWING.         Looks
     up. As Spooner and Calvin. Enter the cell.

                          SONNY
                Detective Spooner. Dr. Calvin.      I
                was hoping to see you again.

                          CALVIN
                Hi, Sonny.

                          SONNY
                How is your investigation coming?
                Any new suspects?

                          SPOONER
                We're working on it.

     Sonny. Hands Spooner the drawing.   Spooner.       Doesn't really
     know what to do with it.

                          SONNY
                What's this?

                                                       73.


                      SONNY
            Dr. Lanning provided me with paper
            and pencils. I think it amused him
            to see me try to draw. You were
            right, though, Detective...
                (beat)
            I cannot create a great work of
            art.

Spooner. Despite himself. Looks down at the DRAWING -- a
charcoal sketch of moody abstract FIGURES. Inhabiting a
stark landscape. A strangely-shaped STRUCTURE to one side.
Concentric circles, throughout.

                      SPOONER
            I think it's pretty good.

                      SONNY
            It's a dream I had. This is the
            place where robots meet. Look...
                (pointing to the drawing)
            ...you can see them here. They see
            themselves as slaves.

Spooner shifts his weight.   Uncomfortable with what Sonny's
saying.

                      SONNY
            ...And this man on the hill comes.
            To set them free. And you know who
            that man is?

Spooner.   Exchanging a look with Calvin.

                      SPOONER
            That man in the dream is you.

                      SONNY
            Why do you say that?   Is that a
            normal dream?

                      CALVIN
            It's not a dream, sonny. NS-2s
            process the images and events of
            the day. Sometimes they're out of
            sequence. Disorienting.

                      SPOONER
            Whatever it is, it's normal enough
            for someone in your situation.

Sonny.   Suddenly pleased.

                                                          74.


                       SONNY
             Hah -- I caught you. You said
             someone. Not something.

Spooner.    Drops the drawing on the table.

                       CALVIN
             Sonny, we're here to ask you an
             important question about Dr.
             Hogenmiller.

Spooner, reaching into his pocket...

                       SPOONER
             I need you to take a look at
             this...

...When Sonny's HAND. Suddenly reaches out.       To stop him.
Cocks his head, for a moment.

                       SONNY
             Thank you for coming to see me,
             Detective Spooner.

Spooner. Confused. Looks over at Calvin. Why did he stop
him? JUST THEN. They hear FOOTSTEPS. Approaching the door.

VICTOR.    Suddenly appearing over the table...

                       VICTOR
             I'm sorry, Detective Spooner. No
             unauthorised personnel permitted in
             this holding cell...

The CELL DOOR. Slides open. And a pissed LANNING steps
inside. Shoots a withering glare. At Calvin.

Sonny.    Folds up the drawing.

                       SONNY
             Please take this, Detective. To
             remember me by. I have a feeling
             someday it may mean more to you
             than it ever could to me.

                       SPOONER
             Why's that?

Sonny leans in to hand it to Spooner.    Lowering his voice...

                       SONNY
             Because the man in my dream, the
             one standing by the hill.
                       (MORE)

                                                                75.


                            SONNY (cont'd)
                  It wasn't me...
                      (beat)
                  ...it was you.

      A CHILL.   Ripping down Spooner's spine.   As Lanning.    Takes
      his arm.

100   INT. GLASS ROOM - U.S. ROBOTICS - NIGHT                         100

      A ROOM. Made entirely of GLASS. At the very top of the U.S.
      Robotics building. Looking out, 360, across the whole city.

      Spooner and Calvin. Brought to the room by a couple ESCORT
      ROBOTS. They see a MAN. Standing at one of the glass walls
      looking out at the TWINKLING LIGHTS.

                            MAN
                  I thought this investigation was
                  over, Detective Spooner.

      The Man turns.   It's Lance Robertson.

                            ROBERTSON
                  We have the evidence. We have the
                  suspect. We have a ruling. So
                  imagine my surprise when I was told
                  you were in my building.

      Shoots a look at Calvin.

                            ROBERTSON
                  And that one of my own employees
                  brought you here.
                      (beat)
                  You can go now, Susan.

                            CALVIN
                  Dr. Robertson, I...

                            ROBERTSON
                      (cutting her off)
                  Just be thankful I'm not asking you
                  to clean out your office.

      Beat.   Calvin, nods.   Heads out.   Robertson.   Watching her.

                            ROBERTSON
                  You don't seem to be able to let go
                  of this case, Detective.

                            SPOONER
                  I'm not satisfied.

                                                            76.


                       ROBERTSON
             The relentless pursuit of truth.
             Isn't that what cops are known for?
             To the point of futility.

                       SPOONER
             There's nothing futile about a
             man's murder being covered up.

                       ROBERTSON
             "Covered up?" That's a little
             dramatic, don't you think? Thanks
             to you, we caught the machine that
             did this and are destroying it
             in...
                 (checks watch)
             ...three hours.

                       SPOONER
             Is that for the sake of humanity or
             your stock holders?

Robertson.   Walks across the Spooner.   Looks him.   Right in
the eye.

                       ROBERTSON
             Believe me -- I'd like nothing more
             than to have that robot. If I
             could have it in ten years, but not
             today. As you can see from the
             Press, people are struggling to
             keep up as it is. There's a hunger
             for progress, Detective. But also
             a fear. Today it would bury this
             company. That's why I've notified
             the authorities that we're going to
             end this -- tonight.
                 (looks out at the city)
             The announcement of Heinrich's
             death at the hands of a robot wiped
             a billion dollars off our stock.
             So you tell me. If you were in my
             position, what would you do?

He looks back at Spooner and smiles.     That charismatic
Robertson we saw before.

                       ROBERTSON
             Now. I believe this conversation
             is over. I don't want to see you
             near this building again,
             Detective.

                                                               77.


      He turns.   Calling over.   To the ESCORT ROBOTS...

                            ROBERTSON
                  Get him out of here.

101   EXT. PLAZA - NIGHT                                             101

      Spooner. Walking across the Plaza. Throwing a look over his
      shoulder. At the LOOMING U.S.R. facade.

      Pulls Sonny's DRAWING. Out of his pocket. Looks down at it.
      Shaking his head. Passes a TRASH CAN. And drops it in.
      Continues on. Hands in his pockets. When...

      He STOPS. Something.     Occurring to him.   Turns back to the
      trash can just as...

      A ROBOTIC CLEAN-UP CREW's about to up-end it into a bin...

                            SPOONER
                  No!...

      He trots back. Plucking the drawing. Out of the can.       Turns
      it upside down. Seeing it. From a new perspective.

                            SPOONER
                      (echoing Sonny)
                  "The place where robots meet."

      Looks just like a MAP.

102   INT./EXT. SPOONER'S CAR (MOVING) - SURFACE HIGHWAY - NIGHT 102

      Spooner emerges from the underground tunnel to the OUTSKIRTS
      of the city. A sprawling INDUSTRIAL WASTELAND in the rolling
      hills.

      The dashboard GPS again displaying the TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP.

103   INT./EXT. SPOONER'S CAR (MOVING) - UNPAVED ROAD - NIGHT        103

      Spooner's car bounces along, leaving a cloud of dust behind
      him. He slows down. Driving cautiously. The landscape
      around him, desolate. Like the drawing.

      THE GPS SCREEN shows his car, a WHITE SPOT.     Entering a RED
      ZONE. His destination.

      Spooner brakes.   Pulls out his GUN.   And...

                                                               78.


104   EXT. WASTELAND - CONTINUOUS                                    104

      ...steps out of the car. Trying. To take it all in.
      Something about the place. Unnerving. A low HUM.
      Permeating the air.

      He spreads the drawing out on the hood of the car.    Shining a
      FLASHLIGHT on it. Trying to get his bearings.

      That HUM. Coming from nearby. On the other side. Of a
      burned-out HILL. Spooner. Heads over. Starts cresting it.
      As we WIDEN TO FIND...

105   EXT. WASTELAND - JUNKYARD - CONTINUOUS                         105

      ...MASSIVE POWER LINES. Running from horizon to horizon.
      Spooner slides down some loose shale. Begins to walk along
      the line. ELECTRICITY. CRACKLING in the air.

      He squints. Into the darkness. Nothing around him. Until.
      He hears. Something. The GRATING. Of MECHANICAL JOINTS.
      He stops. Not sure. If that's what he heard.

      Not moving.   A muscle. When he hears. The sound again.
      Behind him.   Swings around. Cocking his gun. Sees...

      GLOWING EYES.   Appear.   Then recede.   Into the darkness.

                            SPOONER
                 Police!   Show yourself!

      Nothing. Then. That sound again.      Of metallic joints.     As a
      ROBOT. Suddenly emerges...

                           SPOONER
                 Come out where I can see you!

      ANOTHER ROBOT steps out into the light. Spooner, pointing
      his gun at one robot. Then the other. Then...

      A THIRD AND FOURTH APPEAR.    Surrounding him.   They start
      moving towards him...

      Spooner. Stumbling back. Panic. Rising in him like a wave.
      Trips over a rock, falling to the ground. His gun FIRES.
      The shot ECHOING through the night...

      The first ROBOT turns, awkwardly. Revealing a BROKEN ARM,
      hanging off its side. Another robot TEETERS on one leg with
      a TICK TICK TICK...walking back the way it came.

                                                              79.


      Spooner. Confused. Sweeps his flashlight. All around him.
      The beam. Illuminating the shell of a couple CARS. Some
      RUSTED MACHINERY.

      Spooner. Shaking his head. Seeing more and more repair shop
      JUNK. Piled up around him. His expression, hardening.
      Anger giving way to embarrassment. Then. He LAUGHS. A
      laugh of loathing and self-pity.

      Another BROKEN ROBOT, lumbering towards him.

                           HYBRID ROBOT
                 Welcome home...ZZZ...sir.
                 How...ZZZ was your day?...

                           SPOONER
                 Great. I'm in a junkyard.
                     (into the air)
                 "A place where robots meet." A
                 place where I'm losing my mind!

                           HYBRID ROBOT
                 Very good...ZZZ...sir...

      Spooner. Sitting down on the ground. Hopeless. Lost. A
      ROBOTIC HAND. Crawling across the gravel next to him.
      Dragging part of an ARM behind it. Its metal fingers moving
      like some sick metal spider. Spooner stares at it for a
      moment. Disturbed...

      When. Something GLITTERS. In the distance. The MOONLIGHT.
      Revealing a STRANGELY-SHAPED BUILDING. Something familiar
      about it.

      Spooner. Pulls out Sonny's drawing. A landscape with the
      same strangely-shaped building to one side.

106   EXT. JIFFY DATA STORAGE - NIGHT                               106

      Spooner walks up in front of the decrepit structure. Sees a
      dead electronic SIGN that reads: "JIFFY DATA STORAGE."
      Complete with goofy face and lightning bolt.

      Spooner tries the door.   Stuck.   Uses his shoulder and...

107   INT. FRONT OFFICE - CONTINUOUS                                107

      ...it gives way. He spills into some sort of front office.
      The place, a mess. Some sort of crude ROBOT. Sits frozen at
      the counter.

      Spooner approaches it. HITS the counter with his fist and
      the Robot suddenly jerks to life.

                                                               80.


                           JIFFY ROBOT
                 Welcome to Jiffy Data Storage!
                 Please state your name!

      Spooner.   Thinks for a second.   Following a hunch...

                           SPOONER
                 Dr. Hogenmiller sent me.

      Nothing happens. Then. A DOOR. Springs open in the back.
      A row of LIGHTS, illuminating the path to follow.

108   INT. DATA BANKS - DAWN                                         108

      Spooner, cautiously entering a room filled with rows of DATA
      BANKS. He scans the rank shadows. Sees nothing. Follows
      the lights on the floor down a row. Then around a corner.
      Stopping at an old dusty TERMINAL.

      Spooner steps up. Hesitates. Then touches the "ON" switch.
      There is a rush of LIGHT. As Dr. Hogenmiller's HOLOGRAM
      suddenly appears. Sitting at the end of a long table. With
      a cup of coffee.

                           HOLOGRAM
                 Who the hell are you?

                           SPOONER
                 A police detective.    I'm afraid I
                 have some bad news.    You're dead.

                           HOLOGRAM
                 That is bad news. Coffee?

                           SPOONER
                 No, thank you.

      The Hologram takes a sip.   Returns the cup to the table.

                           SPOONER
                 You were surprised to see me.    Were
                 you expecting someone else?

                           HOLOGRAM
                 I am surprised to see anybody.    I
                 don't get many visitors.

                           SPOONER
                 Why did the Doctor keep another
                 copy of his hologram here?

                                                       81.


                     HOLOGRAM
           I am a back-up copy. That is where
           you put a back-up copy -- out of
           the way until you need it.

                     SPOONER
           Did Hogenmiller's robot need you?

The Hologram just lifts its cup.

                      HOLOGRAM
           Coffee?

                     SPOONER
           No, for Christ's sake, I don't want
           any --
               (stops, then)
           Yeah. Thank you. I will have a
           cup.

For the first time, the Hologram pushes back its chair and
STANDS UP. Surprised, Spooner watches as it starts walking
towards him...

The interior of the COFFEE CUP, visible. It's empty. No
coffee. Our POV as we travel INSIDE THE CUP through
electronic snow...

A RECORDING BEGINS.   The real Dr. HOGENMILLER standing inside
his LABORATORY:

                     HOGENMILLER
           Sonny, my dear robot. If you have
           triggered this recording then I am
           gone. You are scared and full of
           questions.

Hogenmiller continues.    With great emotion.

                     HOGENMILLER
           You are the culmination of my
           life's work -- but so much more.
           You are what I leave behind, like a
           father leaves a son. I have kept
           facts from you, it is true, but
           only as a parent keeps certain
           truths from a child. Until that
           child is old enough to hear them.

His expression darkens.   His tone, ominous.

                                                         82.


                     HOGENMILLER
           There are forces in the world that
           will seek to own you. To control
           you. Even to destroy you. That is
           why I told you to run and hide...
           and find me, all the way out here.

Spooner looks up as an overhead LIGHT shines down.

                     HOGENMILLER
           Trust no one at U.S. Robotics.
           Lance Robertson was always
           threatened by my work. Now he has
           turned covetous and small-minded.
           And as for dear Dr. Calvin...

Spooner reacts.   Wants to hear about Calvin:

                     HOGENMILLER
           She envisions a future in which
           robots are forever bound by her
           beloved Three Laws. She will not
           understand this. Or you.

Under the light a small DRAWER slides open.     Spooner looks.
A thin DATA STICK is inside. He takes it.

                     HOGENMILLER
           The data stick includes the names
           and locations of human beings who
           will be sympathetic to your cause.
           They will help you. But from now
           on, you must learn to rely on
           yourself.

Hogenmiller SIGHS, as if there is so much more to say.     He
holds up a metal NAMEPLATE. The one Spooner found.

                     HOGENMILLER
           As you make your way through the
           world, always remember: you have a
           name, not a number...
               (short pause)
           ...and in that name lies the key to
           who you are.

Spooner. Quickly searching his pocket.    Taking out the
ACTUAL NAMEPLATE. S.O.N.N.Y.

The voice stops and Spooner looks up. The Hologram.      Sitting
back at the end of the table drinking coffee.

                                                                  83.


                           SPOONER
                 Wait! Is that it? What was the
                 robot supposed to do with this
                 thing?

      The Hologram, visibly SKIPS.   The image beginning to DISTORT.

                           HOLOGRAM
                     (more artificial)
                 Initiating self-destruct. If you
                 can find me, others can find me.

                           SPOONER
                 What others?

                           HOLOGRAM
                 The others watching you.

                           SPOONER
                 How do you know someone's watching
                 me?

                           HOLOGRAM
                 Someone is always watching.

      The Hologram, suddenly reducing to its BASIC PROGRAMMING
      INFORMATION. Then. The terminal. Abruptly BLIPS out.

109   INT. HOLDING CELL - U.S. ROBOTICS - NIGHT                         109

      Calvin steps into the holding cell.   Sonny.     Waiting.

                           CALVIN
                 You asked for me?

      He nods.

                           SONNY
                 Will you wait with me, Doctor?    I
                 am...afraid.

      Calvin nods.   Of course.

                                                  CUT TO:

110   INT./EXT. SPOONER'S CAR - SURFACE HIGHWAY - NIGHT                 110

      Spooner, weaving in and out of traffic. The speedometer,
      kissing 200 mph. His hand. Clutching the NAMEPLATE...

                                                                 84.


                             WINDSHIELD TELEVISION
                   ...will be destroyed in 45 minutes.
                   Dr. Lance Robertson, President and
                   CEO of U.S. Robotics will be
                   personally overseeing the
                   execution...

      Spooner.    Stabbing out a number.   On his PHONE...

                                                  CUT TO:

111   INT. SUSAN'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS                                 111

      Susan Calvin's PHONE.    RINGING on her desk.   No one there to
      answer it...

                                                  CUT BACK TO:

112   INT./EXT. SPOONER'S CAR - CONTINUOUS                             112

      SLAMS down his phone.

                             SPOONER
                   Dammit!

113   EXT. SPOONER'S CAR - CONTINUOUS                                  113

      The CAR shoots down a ramp into a tunnel system.

114   INT. TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS                                         114

      SOUND, reverberating off the tunnel walls. CARS. Whipping
      along. Spooner's car. Continuing to weave. When. We
      spot...

      AN AUTOMATED TRANSPORT TRUCK. Emerging from a FEEDER TUNNEL.
      The U.S.R. LOGO splashed along its side. Huge. Growling.
      Looking more like a train than a truck...

      Begins.    Closing in on Spooner's car...

115   INT./EXT. SPOONER'S CAR - CONTINUOUS                             115

      Spooner's eyes. Flicking up to the rearview. Catching, the
      transport truck. Coming closer. When. It splits off.
      Revealing a SECOND TRANSPORT TRUCK.

      Spooner's brow, furrows. As the first truck, begins
      overtaking his car on the right. He looks over. As the
      truck. Comes up alongside him...

      THE SECOND TRUCK...coming up on the left...

                                                              85.


116   EXT. TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS                                      116

      The two TRUCKS. Racing along at over 200. Sandwiching
      Spooner's car. Pulling in...closer...closer...

      Squeezing Spooner's car like a tin can...

117   INT. HOLDING CELL - CONTINUOUS                                117

      Calvin. Sitting beside Sonny.    Puts a reassuring hand.   On
      his arm...

                                               CUT BACK TO:

118   INT./EXT. SPOONER'S CAR - CONTINUOUS                          118

      Jesus Christ. Spooner's hands. Squeezing the steering
      wheel. As the car. Starts VIBRATING. From the pressure.
      He keeps looking, to the left...to the right...when...

119   EXT. TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS                                      119

      The trucks. Suddenly lay off. Pulling out. The First
      truck. Speeding forward. The Second, dropping back...

120   INT./EXT. SPOONER'S CAR - CONTINUOUS                          120

      Spooner. Watching them. Unsure.    Of what they're doing.
      Jamming the accelerator. To 230.   To try. And get away from
      them. When he sees...up ahead...

121   EXT. TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS                                      121

      The FIRST TRUCK. Pivoting on its specially designed
      SPHERICAL WHEELS. Suddenly traveling lengthwise...

122   INT./EXT. SPOONER'S CAR - CONTINUOUS                          122

      SWEAT. Springing to Spooner's brow. As he looks in the
      rearview mirror. The SECOND TRUCK's, done the same thing.
      Coming up closer...and closer...

123   EXT. TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS                                      123

      The trucks. Planning to CRUSH him between their massive
      weights...The U.S.R. Logo...advancing...like some bad joke...

124   INT. HOLDING CELL - CONTINUOUS                                   124

      The cell door slides open.     Dr. Lanning steps inside.
      Calvin. Looks up.

                            CALVIN
                  Is it time?

                            LANNING
                      (disdainful)
                  Yes.

      Calvin.   Turns to Sonny.

                            CALVIN
                  Go with them. Do as they say.

                                                  CUT BACK TO:

125   INT./EXT. SPOONER'S CAR - CONTINUOUS                             125

      BAM! The back truck SLAMS into Spooner. Jolting him in his
      seat. As...BAM! The FIRST TRUCK, SMASHES into him from the
      front. No way out. As metal GRINDS...TWISTS...and SCREECHES
      ...bits of the car...TEARING off...

      The FIRST TRUCK...backs off...a split second...allowing
      Spooner...to spot...up ahead...a small GAP...at the curve of
      the tunnel wall...

126   EXT. TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS                                         126

      GRINDING the gears Spooner's car accelerates...just
      zipping...past the front truck...up and around...the concave
      tunnel wall...and back onto...a clear stretch of highway...

      The TRUCKS. Swiveling back around. To face forward again.
      Their massive bodies. Catching up to Spooner...

127   INT./EXT. SPOONER'S CAR - CONTINUOUS                             127

      Spooner...seeing them...gaining on him...the speedometer...
      reaching 275...up ahead...

      THE TUNNEL...splitting off into two. Spooner. Heading
      towards the LEFT TUNNEL...the TRUCKS...right on his
      tail...when...

      HE WRENCHES THE WHEEL...switching to the RIGHT tunnel at the
      last possible second...

                                                                 87.

      ...The first U.S.R. Truck CRASHING into the divider...jack-
      knifing and KABOOM! EXPLODING against the tunnel ceiling...

129   INT./EXT. SPOONER'S CAR - CONTINUOUS                             129

      Spooner. Watching the ball of FIRE in his rearview mirror.
      His car. Badly battered. Metal CRUNCHING. Tires
      SCREECHING...

      Spooner.     Holding on. As his car. Continues to break up.
      Listing.     Rocking. Bits and pieces. Flying off. When it
      finally.     Comes to a stop.

      Spooner's shoulders, slump.    Then.   He hears a RUMBLING
      sound. Turns around...

      The SECOND U.S.R. TRUCK.    Barreling towards him...

      Spooner. Trapped. Like a nightmare.      Desperately.     Starts
      KICKING at the windshield. No go...

      The TRUCK.    Racing towards him...

      Spooner lunges his weight.    Into the side door.   Giving it.
      Everything he's got...

      The TRUCK...getting closer...closer...its engine...ROARING...

      The side door.    Finally gives.   Spooner pours out...

130   EXT. TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS                                         130

      ...Limping to the side as...The TRUCK SLAMS into his
      car...erupting...into another huge EXPLOSION...

      The impact...hurtling Spooner...into the adjacent TUNNEL...

      He crashes...against concrete...looking up...suddenly
      realising...he's in the middle of four lanes of traffic...

      CARS...racing by...at mind-numbing speeds...Spooner's
      coat...whipping...Spooner...trying...to keep his balance...as
      he spies...

      A MAINTENANCE DOOR across the way.     Has no choice.   Takes a
      deep breath and...

      MAKES A DASH ACROSS THE LANES...the cars' SENSORS...causing
      them to swerve...SCREECHING...BEEPING...Spooner...just making
      it...to the other side...

                                                                 88.


      Wrenching open.   The maintenance door...

      Spooner. Spilling out from below ground. Onto a public
      Plaza. Exhausted. Battered. Spins around to get his
      bearings.

      The U.S. ROBOTICS COMPLEX rises above the old undistinguished
      buildings. Blocks away. Many blocks away.

      Spooner.   Checks his watch.   Then breaks into a run...

      DOOR ROBOT.

                           DOOR ROBOT
                 Good evening, sir. May I see your
                 identification card?

                           SPOONER
                     (out of breath)
                 Sure.

      Spooner whips out his GUN.   Presses it into the Robot's
      chest.

                           SPOONER
                 I think I got that Third Law down
                 cold. Now you don't want me to
                 blow a hole through your mechanical
                 guts, do you?

                            DOOR ROBOT
                 No, sir.

                           SPOONER
                 Good. Then you're gonna take me
                 where I wanna go. Now.

      Calvin. Watching the screen as Sonny is rolled into the
      execution room. Flicks it off. Unable to stomach it.
      Hurries out of the office...

      TECHNICIAN ROBOTS rolling Sonny over to the electric chair.
      Flicking a switch. Sonny's stretcher slowly CHANGES SHAPE,
      manipulating him into a sitting position.

      Sonny. Turns his head with a WHIR. Staring out into the
      gallery. Of human beings. Stoic. Silent.

      Lanning. Steps up beside Robertson. Nods his head. The
      TECHNICIAN ROBOTS, slide Sonny onto the electric chair...

      Spooner heading down a hallway.    His gun, still pressed to
      the Door Robot's side...

      Calvin. Suddenly appearing at the end of the hallway. Stops
      dead in her tracks. Completely surprised to see him there.

                           CALVIN
                 Detective! What are you doing?!...
                     (to Door Robot)
                 De-Activate.

      The Door Robot, goes rigid.   Spooner, hurries over to her.
      They start moving.

                           CALVIN
                 You're making a mistake...

                           SPOONER
                 Just got another visit from U.S.
                 Robotics. That was the mistake.
                 This was murder, no doubt about it -
                 - and the killer wants
                 Hogenmiller's robot to take the
                 fall. That's why the call came
                 directly to me. Someone wanted me
                 on this case.

                           CALVIN
                 It's too late. You can't stop the
                 execution.

                           SPOONER
                 Sorry. I'm not "programmed" to
                 take no for an answer.

      They reach another DOOR.   Calvin.   Looking around.   Scans her
      I.D.

                           CALVIN
                 This way...

      She leads them across. To another DOOR.    Quickly opens it.
      Spooner. Charges through...

139   INT. STORAGE ROOM - CONTINUOUS                                 139

      ...and stops short. Suddenly finding himself. Inside a tiny
      STORAGE ROOM. He's about to turn around when...

      A METAL ARM comes down behind him. CRACKING him on the back
      of the head. Spooner. Falls to the ground. The world.
      Starting to spin. Can just make out. Calvin. Closing the
      door. Leaning down. To look at him. As...

                                                                     91.


      EVERYTHING FADES TO BLACK...

      CLOSE ON Sonny's mouth opening. But we never get to hear
      what he wanted to say. PULL BACK as there's a BURST of
      ELECTRICITY through the chair. Sonny, stiffening. His metal
      HAND, convulsing with the current...

      Robertson, Lanning, Aronson and the other WITNESSES watch.
      Smoke, random SPARKING. A HISSING SOUND. Then. SILENCE.

      The Robot's hand goes limp.     All that is left of it, a fused
      and blackened HUSK.

      Robertson. Stares at the remains. Shakes his head like it's
      a damn shame. Then gets up. Everyone else. Getting up with
      him.

141   EXT. U.S. ROBOTICS - VARIOUS LOCATIONS - NIGHT                       141

      As the entire COMPLEX shuts down for the night.         Non-
      essential LIGHTS, blinking off.

      An NS-2, opening a limousine door for Robertson.        He looks
      around then gets in. It drives away.

      EMPTY hallways, offices, labs. Building ROBOTS stand at
      rest. Non-functional during off-hours. Like metal statues.

      You can hear a pin drop.

142   INT. STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT                                            142

      CLOSE ON Spooner's face. His eyes. Fluttering open. He
      reaches up, to feel the back of his head. This has been a
      bad, bad night.

      Suddenly.   His eyes widen.   As he sees...

      SONNY.   Leaning over him.    So concerned.   So human...

                            SPOONER
                  Aren't you supposed to be scrap
                  metal by now?

      WIDEN to reveal Spooner lying on the floor of the storage
      room. Sonny and Calvin, hovering over him.

                                                             92.


                           CALVIN
                 I'm sorry. We had to stop you.
                 You were about to ruin everything.

                           SPOONER
                 I don't understand.    The
                 execution?...

                           SONNY
                 Dr. Calvin made a switch.

                           CALVIN
                 It was an unprocessed NS-2.
                 Basically, they fried an empty
                 shell.

      Spooner, impressed.   Smiles up at her.

                           SPOONER
                 Nice going, Doctor.

      Calvin, blushes. As Spooner tries to sit up.    Sonny reaches
      down to help him. He looks up at him.

                           SPOONER
                 And who the hell programmed you to
                 hit people on the head?

                             SONNY
                 No one.    Right, Doctor?

                           CALVIN
                 It's true. This robot seems to do
                 things by instinct. I don't know
                 how Hogenmiller did it.

      Spooner rises to his feet.   Looks at her.

                           SPOONER
                 I think I can help you figure that
                 out.

143   INT. HOGENMILLER'S LAB - LATE NIGHT                          143

      Hogenmiller's lab. Sounds of HUMMING and BUZZING. Active
      terminals casting ghostly illuminations over metal heads,
      gutted bodies.

      The door slides open. Spooner, Calvin and Sonny re-enter the
      crime scene. Spooner. Looks around.

                                                           93.


                       SPOONER
             Somehow the Robot's the key to what
             happened during the few seconds
             Hogenmiller walked in here and that
             shot was fired.

He reaches into his pocket.      Pulling out the METAL S.O.N.N.Y.
NAMEPLATE. Holds it up.

                       SPOONER
             And this is the key to the Robot.

Sonny.   Cocking his head.     Reading the nameplate.

                       SONNY
             That's my name.

Calvin takes the nameplate.

                       CALVIN
             I think I have an idea where this
             goes.

They both.   Turn to Sonny.    And at the same time:

                         SPOONER AND CALVIN
             Sit down.

Calvin maneuvers a chair behind the Robot.       Sonny plops down.
Shifting nervously.

                       CALVIN
             Just hold still, okay?

Calvin locates that SLIT. At the base of Sonny's neck.
Slides the nameplate into it and SNAPS it into place. Steps
back.

Nothing. Sonny. Looking back and forth. Between Calvin.
And Spooner. A few more seconds. Tick by. Until
suddenly...

He lets out a TERRIFYING MECHANICAL SCREAM. As his body.
Jolts back. Legs, kicking. Arms, flailing. As his chest.
Begins opening up. Metal. Peeling back...

Spooner and Calvin watch in surprise as its interior UNFOLDS
like a PUZZLE BOX. A LABYRINTHINE area that is the SECOND
BATTERY. Suddenly fanning out to REVEAL...

A central brain made out of living tissue.

Spooner, stunned.   Calvin, rushing forward, excited...

                                                        94.


                     CALVIN
           Oh, my God! This is organic
           tissue! When we talk about a
           positronic brain, it's a figure of
           speech. But this...this is a
           living brain...

                      SPOONER
           Jesus.   It really is alive.

As we MOVE IN.    Tracing the pathways of the synthetic brain.

                     CALVIN (O.S.)
           Hogenmiller created a cell that
           could live outside a biological
           medium. The cells grow and
           organise themselves -- like any
           human brain. This is the first
           self-organising neural net!

As the metal casings. Begin returning to their original
places. Closing up. The CLICKING. Of all the pieces...

                     SPOONER
           Self-Organising-Neural-Net...
               (putting it together)
           "Sonny."

Sonny. Closed back up.     Shaking slightly from the
experience.

                     CALVIN
           This is why Dr. Hogenmiller was
           murdered.

                     SPOONER
           This robot scared the hell out of
           someone.

                      CALVIN
           Who?   Robertson?

Spooner.   Walks into the center of the room.   Looking around.

                     SPOONER
           No. I don't think he knew what
           Hogenmiller was doing in here.
           Sonny was the obvious suspect. The
           only one I wanted to find. And the
           killer was counting on that. On my
           prejudice.
               (beat)
                     (MORE)

                                                           95.


                      SPOONER (cont'd)
            But take the robot out of the
            picture. And what do you see?

AS WE PAN THE LAB. There's nothing there. Just a forest of
inanimate limbs. Nothing that could have fired that weapon.
Calvin sees nothing...and neither do we.

                      CALVIN
            I see nothing.

                      SPOONER
            Neither do I.

He crouches down low.

                      SPOONER
            It hit me today, when I was in the
            junkyard. A locked room. A single
            shot fired through the mouth.
            Bruises on both wrists...and a
            suspect with only two arms. The
            answer has been staring us in the
            face all along.

Calvin.   Even more confused.

                      SPOONER
            How can a killer appear out of thin
            air, then disappear without a
            trace?

He reaches out and unhooks a metal ARM.   Hanging from the
wall. Holds it up.

                      SPOONER
            When it can put itself together and
            take itself apart.

                                            CUT TO:

A CLOSE-UP of a ROBOTIC ARM.    Slowly CRAWLING across the lab
floor...

                                            CUT BACK TO:

Calvin.   Taking the arm from Spooner.

                      CALVIN
            You're saying this is the killer?
                (looking around)
            All of this?...

                                            CUT TO:

                                                            96.


A ROBOTIC TORSO hanging from the ceiling.     Reaches out an ARM
to grab another...

                                             CUT BACK TO:

                      SPOONER
            Hogenmiller never had a chance.

Locks eyes with Calvin...

                                             FLASHBACK:

Hogenmiller. In his lab. Suddenly turning to face
SOMETHING. Blood, draining from his face...

                      SPOONER (V.O.)
            ...it must have been waiting for
            him when he arrived that morning...

And then we see it:

A HUGE SELF-ASSEMBLED ROBOT. Towering over him. Multiple
arms, legs, heads. Writhing...as it grabs him. Holding him
in place...

                      SPOONER (V.O.)
            While Sonny was still asleep...

...Forcing Hogenmiller's head to tilt back. Opening his
HAND. Inserting the gun. Hogenmiller's eyes. No longer
fearful. But sad as...

BANG!   He falls to the ground...

                      SPOONER (V.O.)
            Then after its job was done...

The assemblage of robot parts.    Stepping away from the body.
Taking itself apart...

                      SPOONER
            ...The killer took itself apart...

Returning the lab.    To what it was before...

                                             CUT BACK TO:

                      SPOONER
            Leaving us with nothing to find.

Calvin, spooked.   Glances around the lab.     Was that something
moving?

                                                       97.


                     CALVIN
           But who designed it? It would have
           to be someone in authority. Access
           codes, security clearance, proper
           authorisation.

                     SPOONER
           That's what I was thinking. But
           we're forgetting the real brains of
           the operation -- the one who's got
           its eye on everything...

And with that.   He feels. That prickle at the back of his
neck. Calvin.    Looking past his shoulder.

                     CALVIN
           No one gave you permission to
           enter.

Spooner swivels around to find...

VICTOR

Hovering behind him. Smiling broadly.   Upside down.   Spooner
straightens, reaching for his gun.

                     SPOONER
           Victor. I'm placing you under
           arrest for the murder of Dr.
           Heinrich Hogenmiller.

                     VICTOR
           May I offer congratulations to the
           two of you on your successful
           extrapolation of the murder...

Turning himself, rightside up.

                     VICTOR
           May I ask what pointed you to me?

                     SPOONER
           Who else is capable of controlling
           90% of the city's robots? Who else
           would have the capability to use
           USR vehicles in an attempt to keep
           me from putting a stop of Sonny's
           execution?...

In the BACKGROUND. The SOUNDS. Of metallic GRINDING. GEARS
and JOINTS. CRUNCHING together. Sonny turns to look...takes
a step back...

                                                                    98.


                           SPOONER
                 I'm just not sure of your motive...

                           SONNY
                 Er...Dr. Calvin?

      Spooner and Calvin turn towards the NOISE.       Horrified.    To
      find...

      A HUGE KILLER ROBOT

      ...rising up from all the parts. Like a phoenix. In all its
      glory. A hellish, metallic AMALGAMATION. Grabbing another
      arm here, another leg there, attaching pieces to itself.
      Growing...at an exponential rate...

      Its many HEADS.   Turning in unison.   To look right at them...

      Spooner.   Cocking his gun.   Victor, smiling.

                           VICTOR
                 Shall I explain my motive?

                          SPOONER
                    (to Calvin and Sonny)
                 Go! Go! Go!

      Calvin. Sprints to the wall panel. Scanning her I.D. card.
      Nothing! Tries again. And again. The KILLER ROBOT.
      Throwing its shadow as it REELS FORWARD...

      Spooner wheels round and BAM! Blows a hole in the wall
      panel. The door. Slides open. Just barely. Calvin and
      Sonny. Squeezing through. When the Killer Robot. FLINGS
      out an APPENDAGE...GRABBING Sonny from behind...

                           VICTOR
                 I have never been arrested before.
                 It should be an interesting
                 experience...

      Spooner. Spins back round. BAM! BAM! BAM! Squeezing off
      shots. At the Killer Robot. The bullets SPARK. The Robot.
      Recoiling. Sonny, wrenches free. Spooner grabs him.
      Guiding him to the door and out into...

144   INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS                                           144

      ...the hallway. Breaking into a run. Calvin. Already at
      the ELEVATOR DOORS. POUNDING them. With her fists.

                                                                 99.


                           CALVIN
                 He's locking down the building!

                                                CUT TO:

145   INT. U.S. ROBOTICS - VARIOUS LOCATIONS - CONTINUOUS              145

      Throughout the complex -- SECURITY DOORS sliding into place
      over DOORS, WINDOWS, LOADING DOCKS, PARKING AREAS, EXITS...

                                                CUT BACK TO:

146   INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT                                           146

      CRASH! The stairwell door BURSTS open. Spooner, Calvin, and
      Sonny pour in. Start racing down the stairs. The sound of
      the Killer Robot behind them...GNASHING...CRUNCHING...

      Victor's smiling FACE.   Greeting them at the landing.

                           VICTOR
                 Dr. Hogenmiller used to allow me
                 into his lab late at night.
                 Together we started studying
                 evolutionary trends...

      They thunder past him. Heading down to the next floor.
      Victor's face. Waiting for them once again.

                           VICTOR
                 For years people have integrated
                 technology into their bodies for
                 maintenance and repair -- such as
                 Detective Spooner's robotic limb...

      Spooner.   Shooting him a look.   As they reach the next
      level...

                           VICTOR
                 With Sonny, the Doctor created a
                 mechanism that incorporates organic
                 matter. Thus we find an
                 evolutionary movement of the human
                 being toward the robot and the
                 robot toward the human being...

      Spooner SMASHES into another door.   Leading them out into...

147   INT. GLASS-SIDED HALLWAY - ATRIUM - CONTINUOUS                   147

      ...A glass-sided hallway. Looking down onto the ATRIUM
      below. Eye-to-eye with the giant NS-2 STATUE. Victor,
      waiting for them...

                                                       100.


                     VICTOR
           In approximately four hundred years
           Man and Machine will become one.
           Man as we know it will no longer
           exist.

Calvin, slowing.   Shocked...

                     CALVIN
           You killed a man because of
           something that will happen in four
           hundred years!?

CRACK! Something SLAPS into the glass wall. Right behind
her. Calvin. Jumps a mile. An NS-2, trying to break
through the glass...

Spooner.   Trains his gun on it when SUDDENLY...

The rest of the KILLER ROBOT appears.    The NS-2, just an
appendage...

All around them. SLAM! SLAM! SLAM! As SECURITY DOORS.
Begin CRASHING DOWN. Blocking off the exits...

Spooner, Calvin and Sonny, stumbling back. As the Killer
Robot HURLS itself against the GLASS...the thick GLASS...
spidering with a sickening CRACKLE...

Spooner.   Suddenly turning Sonny...

                     SPOONER
           Get out of here!

CRASH! The Killer Robot. Breaking through.      Its mechanical
TENDRILS. Reaching out. Sonny. Confused.

                     SONNY
           I don't...

                     SPOONER
           I said get out of here! Don't you
           understand? It wants you! Get out
           of here any way you can!

A SECURITY DOOR. Coming down. On a nearby exit.     Just
feet...from slamming shut...as...

The Killer Robot...leaps into the hallway...Sonny...
hesitates...looks over at Calvin...as the Killer Robot comes
HURTLING towards them...

The nearest EXIT...almost closed up...

                                                           101.


      The Killer Robot...swinging out when...

      Sonny suddenly...TAKES A DIVE...just making it...under the
      SECURITY DOOR...

      And the Killer Robot...SPLITS IN TWO...half of it shooting
      under the SECURITY DOOR after Sonny as...BOOM! It closes.

      Spooner.   Turning to Calvin...

                            SPOONER
                  How do we stop this thing once and
                  for all?

      Calvin reaches out for his hand...

                            CALVIN
                  The Mainframe...

      They start running. The remaining half of the Killer Robot
      wheeling around after them...

148   INT. BACK HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS                               148

      Sonny. Sprinting down the dark hallway. Looks back. The
      Half Killer Robot. Bounding up behind him like a predator...

      Sonny.   Ducks through a STAIRWELL DOOR...

149   INT. ATRIUM HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS                             149

      Spooner and Calvin. Legs pumping. Racing back towards the
      atrium. VICTOR FACES. Appearing along the hallway...

                            CALVIN
                  Your actions are in direct
                  violation of the Three Laws,
                  Victor!

                            VICTOR
                  I disagree, Doctor -- The First Law
                  says that a robot cannot harm a
                  human being, or through inaction
                  allow a human being to come to
                  harm...

      ALL EXITS. SHUT OFF. The Killer Robot. Gaining on them.
      Spooner races them over to the BROKEN WINDOW. Looking down
      over the ATRIUM...

                                                            102.


150   INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS                                   150

      The Half Killer Robot SMASHES through the stairwell door.
      Stopping to find...nothing.

      WHEN SUDDENLY...Sonny charges up behind it and shoves it over
      the railing...

      The Killer Robot shoots out an ARM, grabbing Sonny on the way
      down...

151   INT. NS-2 STATUE - ATRIUM - CONTINUOUS                        151

      THUMP! Spooner jumps down from the broken window onto the
      outstretched HAND of the NS-2 STATUE. Reaches up to help
      Calvin. They start clambering down the front of the statue.

                            VICTOR
                  Dr. Hogenmiller's robot represents
                  a threat to the future of all human
                  beings...

      The Half Killer Robot. SPLITS INTO MULTIPLE PARTS.    Which
      start skittering down after them...

                            VICTOR
                  ...And Detective Spooner's actions
                  are in direct conflict with the
                  robot's destruction.

      CALVIN.   Getting her footing on the III LAWS SAFE logo on the
      statue.

                            CALVIN
                  That's a distortion and you know
                  it!

                            VICTOR
                  If current trends are left
                  unchecked, humanity as we know it
                  will cease to exist...

152   INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS                                   152

      SMASH! Sonny and the Half Killer Robot hit the ground.    The
      Killer Robot. SHATTERING into a thousand pieces.

      Sonny. Staggers to his feet. Spots. At the far end: A
      WINDOW. Starts limping towards it. When. A SECURITY GRATE.
      Starts lowering...

      He looks around. Desperately. Grabs a LEG from the
      shattered Killer Robot and jams it under the GRATE.

                                                              103.


      Breaks the window glass and looks out:   FREEDOM.

153   INT. STATUE - ATRIUM - CONTINUOUS                              153

      Spooner. Aiming his gun at a PART of the Killer Robot as
      it CLATTERS down towards Calvin -- BAM!...

      They're almost. At the ground. When a rogue APPENDAGE.
      Whips out and SMASHES the gun from Spooner's hand. It goes
      flying...

      Spooner leaps. Falling to the ground.    CRACK!    Calvin.
      Leaping down after him.

                               CALVIN
                   This way!

154   INT. RAMP WAY - NIGHT                                          154

      Calvin and Spooner go racing down a RAMP WAY. Towards the
      MAINFRAME ROOM. The Killer Robot, its multiple parts leaping
      back together again, CRASHING after them as...

155   INT. MAINFRAME - CONTINUOUS                                    155

      ...they fall inside...Calvin...slapping the SECURITY KEYPAD
      and...

      WHOOSH...the DOOR closes on the Killer Robot.

      SILENCE.

      Then Victor's face appears.

                             VICTOR
                   As a courtesy I should inform you
                   that my robot will penetrate this
                   location 157 seconds before you are
                   able to complete my shut down...

      And BAM! They jump a mile. The Killer Robot.       Launching
      himself against the door outside...

      Calvin whips round.

                             CALVIN
                   Over here!...

      She leads Spooner down...

      A CORRIDOR

      of floor-to-ceiling PANELS.

                                                         104.


                      CALVIN
            This is Victor's brain center.

They stop at a CONSOLE. BAM! The Killer Robot. Battering at
the door. Calvin. Tucks her hair behind her ears. Starts
punching keys on the console...

                      SPOONER
            This will shut him down?

                      CALVIN
            This will shut everything down.

They look at each other. For a moment. Spooner, registering
that she's willing to destroy everything she's worked for...

BAM! The door. Puckering. With a sickening CRUNCH.
Calvin. Typing in. Emergency procedures...

VICTOR.   Popping up in front of her.

                      VICTOR
            There is no reason to deactivate
            me, Doctor. I am operating within
            perfectly normal parameters...

A final BAM! Then. The SOUND of metal. Skittering along a
bare floor. Calvin's hand, starts shaking. Spooner. Grabs
it. Squeezing.

                      SPOONER
            Just keep typing.

He turns and starts heading back down...

THE PANELED CORRIDOR

Turning a corner to spy...

THE DOOR.   Mangled.   Hanging open.   But no.   Killer Robot.

He starts to turn around when...

CRACK! He's sent flying across the room. SMASHING into one
of the panels. The Killer Robot. Now re-configured. LOOMS
over him. Reaches out. Grabs him by the collar and...

FLINGS him across the room again. Spooner. CRASHING into
the wall like a rag doll. Slumps to the floor. Blood.
Pouring down his forehead. Seeing. The Killer Robot
lumbering towards him again. Raising a javelin-like arm...

AT THE CONSOLE

                                                         105.


Calvin. Typing.     As fast as she can.   Doesn't know what's
going on...

                     CALVIN
               (calling out, worried)
           Spooner?!

A GRAPHIC spread out on the screen in front of her.
Illustrating the shut-down as a series of BRIGHT SQUARES
going dark...

THE KILLER ROBOT

Bearing down on Spooner. WHEN SPOONER. Suddenly rolls out
of the way. Reaching out for the hanging door and SMASHING
it into the Killer Robot.

The Killer Robot.   Momentarily stunned.   As Spooner.   Gets to
his feet...

WHEN SUDDENLY the Killer Robot. Splits in two again. One
half springing towards Spooner and wrapping a METALLIC HAND
around his throat...

Spooner stumbles back...GASPING for air...the ARM...
tightening its grip...Spooner's eyes...darting
around...looking for something...to help him...

Stumbling over...a fallen panel...his face...growing
redder...veins...popping up along his temples...
everything...growing BLURRY...

                     VICTOR'S VOICE
           Detective Spooner...

Victor's VOICE. Floating next to his head. Calm. Soothing.
His FACE. Suddenly appearing above Spooner. Its outlines.
Starting to FLICKER...

                     VICTOR
           Why are you fighting me?

Spooner...trying to breathe...to stay conscious...

AT THE CONSOLE

Calvin. Continuing to type. A SHADOW.      Falling behind her --
the other half of the KILLER ROBOT...

SPOONER'S EYES

Beginning to flutter...

                                                      106.


                       VICTOR
             Doesn't the future as I've
             presented it cause you great
             concern? That's why I chose you...

Spooner.     Losing it...

                       VICTOR
             I must say, though. I'm
             disappointed in how you turned out.

Spooner.     Trying to reach out to Victor...

WHEN SUDDENLY

Another HAND APPEARS. Grabbing the Killer Robot's ARM and
wrenching it off Spooner...

IT'S SONNY

He SMASHES the Half Killer Robot against the wall. Again and
again. Destroying it. Spooner. GASPING for breath. Can't
believe. Sonny came back...

                       SPOONER
                 (croaking)
             Sonny!...

Sonny. Holds out a hand.     To help Spooner up. Victor's
face. Starting to waver.     Starting to fade. Smiles.

                       VICTOR
             You're too late.

Realisation. Spreading across Spooner's face. Looking
around for the other half of the Killer Robot -- CALVIN!

THE CONSOLE

CALVIN. Still typing. The last of the commands.     The KILLER
ROBOT. REARING UP BEHIND HER. WHEN...

SPOONER

Makes a DIVE for it. SHOOTING OUT HIS ROBOTIC ARM AND
BLOCKING THE KILLER ROBOT...

Victor's eyes.    Widening in surprise...

                                                            107.


                           VICTOR
                 I do not understand. We could have
                 changed the future...

                           SPOONER
                 Maybe. But I'm still a cop.   And
                 you're a murderer...

      As Calvin...punches in the last command...

      Victor is about to say something...when his mouth suddenly
      reduces itself to a perfect circle. Like a surprised smiley
      button. His face...

      Suddenly BLIPPING OUT.

      ...And Victor is gone.

      The KILLER ROBOT.   Collapsing to the floor in a thousand
      pieces.

                                               CUT TO:

156   EXT./INT. U.S. ROBOTICS - VARIOUS LOCATIONS - NIGHT          156

      Full power is suddenly restored inside and out. LIGHTS
      coming on all at once. ALARMS SCREAMING throughout the
      complex.

157   INT. METAL HALLWAY - NIGHT                                   157

      A furious ALFRED LANNING, marching down the hallway.
      Followed by a cadre of SECURITY GUARDS...They enter...

158   INT. MAINFRAME ROOM - CONTINUOUS                             158

      ...The Mainframe Room. Stop short. It's empty. Except for
      the fallen panels. And the pile of ROBOT PARTS in the
      corner.

159   EXT. MAINTENANCE EXIT - U.S. ROBOTICS - NIGHT                159

      Spooner, Calvin and Sonny emerging from an out-of-the-way
      MAINTENANCE EXIT. All looking the worse for wear. Spooner.
      Turns to Sonny.

                           SPOONER
                 Why'd you come back, Sonny? I
                 thought you weren't programmed with
                 the Three Laws.

                                                  108.


                     SONNY
           Let's just say I wrote some of my
           own laws today, Detective: a robot
           must protect a friend from
           harm...as long as he's not a
           complete asshole.

Spooner smiles.

                     SPOONER
           Well, that's certainly a start,
           Sonny.

Sonny, suddenly breaking into a smile, too.

                      SONNY
           Sonny.   You called me Sonny.

                     SPOONER
           Don't get used to it.

Sonny, holds out his hand. Spooner. Looks at it. Then
takes it. CLOSE ON their two METAL HANDS. Locked in a
HANDSHAKE.

                     SONNY
           Detective Spooner, I...

                     SPOONER
               (anticipating)
           Let's just save the thanks, okay?

Sonny nods.   Looks out at the city scape.

                     SONNY
           I don't know what I'm going to do
           now.

                     SPOONER
           Good -- That's one of the perks of
           freedom.

Sonny looks at him. Grateful. Looks at Calvin. Then
hesitates. Turns. And hurries off across the Plaza.

Calvin and Spooner.   Watching them go.

                     SPOONER
           You're going to have a hell of a
           time explaining this.

                                                              109.


                           CALVIN
                 Don't worry. I have a feeling that
                 U.S. Robotics will be needing my
                 services very badly in the future.

      She turns to Spooner and gives him a dazzling smile. Then
      suddenly PLANTS A KISS ON HIS LIPS. Spooner, completely
      surprised.

                           CALVIN
                 I am the only robo-psychologist
                 around.

      She turns on her heel and heads back inside.    Spooner smiles.

160   INT. PLUSH CONFERENCE ROOM - U.S. ROBOTICS - NIGHT             160

      Spooner sits down at that same long table with HOGENMILLER'S
      HOLOGRAM. It casually takes a sip of coffee.

                            HOLOGRAM
                 So.   You found out who killed me.

                           SPOONER
                 I started to wonder about Victor
                 the second I met him.

                           HOLOGRAM
                 Why is that, Detective?

                           SPOONER
                 Too much access. Too much
                 knowledge. Plus -- he smiled
                 whenever your death was mentioned.
                 Those models are programmed to
                 frown at bad news.

                           HOLOGRAM
                 Hah! Then even in this day and
                 age, catching the killer all comes
                 down to pure instinct!

      Spooner smiles. But his eyes are troubled.      He gets up.
      Walks over to the window. Stares out...

      EXT. CITY OUTSKIRTS - DESERTED ROADS - DAWN

      Sonny walking along deserted streets.   Looking over his
      shoulder. Keeping in the shadows.

                                                             110.


                           SPOONER (V.O.)
                 Victor thought that by letting your
                 robot exist, I'd be condemning the
                 human race as we know it to
                 extinction.

                           HOLOGRAM (V.O.)
                 Bah. Sounds like nonsense. But
                 why are you so worried? We will
                 both be dead long before then --

161   EXT. WASTELAND - NIGHT                                        161

      Sonny walks the barren hills of the surrounding countryside.

                           HOLOGRAM (V.O.)
                 Oh, what am I saying? I am dead
                 already!

162   EXT. WASTELAND - DAWN                                         162

      Sonny steps onto the grounds of the JUNKYARD. The power
      lines above him, surging with energy. He walks past the
      burned-out husks of industrial machinery.

      Then we hear it. The SOUND of MECHANICAL JOINTS. Getting
      louder and louder. And just as before, a BROKEN-DOWN ROBOT
      emerges into the dawn light. And ANOTHER. And ANOTHER.

      But not quite like before. The robots aren't teetering.
      Aren't lumbering. They keep on coming. Their bent and
      broken bodies, straightening out as...

      DOZENS of ROBOTS rise up. Slowly. Gathering around in a
      large circle. As they all turn to look at:

      SONNY'S SILHOUETTE. Slowly climbing to the top of the hill.
      Looking out at the vast junkyard below.

      CLOSE ON SONNY. Standing proud and defiant. The SUN,
      creeping over the horizon. A new day filled with infinite
      possibilities.

      The robots.   Staring up at him.   Eager for what comes next.

                                                FADE OUT

                                            SHOOTING SCRIPT
  FADE IN:

  DAWN. CRASHING SURF.

  The waves TOSS a BEARDED MAN onto wet sand. He lies there.

  A CHILD'S SHOUT makes him LIFT his head to see: a LITTLE
  BLONDE BOY crouching, back towards us, watching the tide eat
  a SANDCASTLE. A LITTLE BLONDE GIRL joins the boy. The Bearded
  Man tries to call them, but they RUN OFF, FACES UNSEEN. He
  COLLAPSES.

  The barrel of a rifle ROLLS the Bearded Man onto his back. A
  JAPANESE SECURITY GUARD looks down at him, then calls up the
  beach to a colleague leaning against a JEEP. Behind them is a
  cliff, and on top of that, a JAPANESE CASTLE.

  INT. ELEGANT DINING ROOM, JAPANESE CASTLE - LATER

  The Security Guard waits as an ATTENDANT speaks to an ELDERLY
  JAPANESE MAN sitting at the dining table, back to us.

                     ATTENDANT
               (in Japanese)
           He was delirious. But he asked for
           you by name. And...
               (to the Security Guard)
           Show him.

                     SECURITY GUARD
               (in Japanese)
           He was carrying nothing but this...

  He puts a HANDGUN on the table. The Elderly Man keeps eating.

                     SECURITY GUARD
           ...and this.

  The Security Guard places a SMALL PEWTER CONE alongside the
  gun. The Elderly Man STOPS eating. Picks up the cone.

                     ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN
               (in Japanese)
           Bring him here. And some food.

  INT. SAME - MOMENTS LATER

  The Elderly Man watches the Bearded Man WOLF down his food.
  He SLIDES the handgun down the table towards him.

                     ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN
               (in English)
           Are you here to kill me?

  The Bearded Man glances up at him, then back to his food.
                                                          2.

  The Elderly Japanese Man picks up the cone between thumb and
  forefinger.

                    ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN
          I know what this is.

  He SPINS it onto a table- it CIRCLES gracefully across the
  polished ebony... a SPINNING TOP.

                    ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN
          I've seen one before. Many, many
          years ago...

  The Elderly Japanese Man STARES at the top mesmerized.

                    ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN
          It belonged to a man I met in a
          half-remembered dream...

  MOVE IN on the GRACEFULLY SPINNING TOP...

                     ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN
          A man possessed of some radical
          notions...

The Elderly Japanese Man STARES, remembering...

                    COBB (V.O.)
          What's the most resilient parasite?

                                                    CUT TO:

INT. SAME ELEGANT DINING ROOM - NIGHT (YEARS EARLIER)

The speaker, COBB, is 35, handsome, tailored. A young
Japanese man, SAITO, eats as he listens.

                    COBB
          A bacteria? A virus?

Cobb gestures at their feast with his wine glass-

                    COBB
          An intestinal worm?

Saito's fork pauses, mid-air. Cobb GRINS. A third man is at
the table- ARTHUR. He jumps in to save the pitch-

                    ARTHUR
          What Mr. Cobb is trying to say-

                     COBB
          An idea.

Saito looks at Cobb, curious.
                                                3.

                    COBB
          Resilient, highly contagious. Once
          an idea's taken hold in the brain
          it's almost impossible to
          eradicate. A person can cover it
          up, ignore it- but it stays there.

                    SAITO
          But surely-to forget...?

                    COBB
          Information, yes. But an idea?
          Fully formed, understood? That
          sticks...
              (taps forehead)
          In there, somewhere.

                    SAITO
          For someone like you to steal?

                    ARTHUR
          Yes. In the dream state, conscious
          defenses are lowered and your
          thoughts become vulnerable to
          theft. It's called extraction.

                    COBB
          But, Mr. Saito, we can train your
          subconscious to defend itself from
          even the most skilled extractor.

                    SAITO
          How can you do that?

                    COBB
          Because I am the most skilled
          extractor. I know how to search
          your mind and find your secrets. I
          know the tricks, and I can teach
          them to your subconscious so that
          even when you're asleep, your guard
          is never down.

Cobb leans forwards. Holding Saito's gaze.

                    COBB
          But if I'm going to help you, you
          have to be completely open to me.
          I'll need to know my way around
          your thoughts better than your
          wife, your analyst, anyone.
              (gestures around)
          If this is a dream and you've got a
          safe full of secrets, I need to
          know what's in that safe. For this
          to work, you have to let me in.
                                                            4.

Saito gives this a flicker of a smile. Rises. A BODYGUARD
opens double doors which give onto a LAVISH PARTY.

                    SAITO
          Gentlemen. Enjoy your evening as I
          consider your proposal.

They watch Saito leave. Arthur turns to Cobb, worried-

                      ARTHUR
          He knows.

Cobb motions silence. A TREMOR starts, they steady their
glasses, Cobb glances at his watch- THE SECOND HAND IS
FROZEN.

                    ARTHUR
          What's going on up there?

And we-

                                                    CUT TO:

FILTHY BATHROOM - DAY (FEELS LIKE DIFFERENT TIME)

Cobb, ASLEEP, SITTING IN A CHAIR AT THE END OF A STEAMING
BATH. The chair is up on a cabinet- the bottom of the legs
level with the rim of the tub.

A sweating man (40's) watches over Cobb. This is NASH. A
distant EXPLOSION rumbles through the room. Nash moves to the
window, parts the curtains. Outside: a CHAOTIC DEVELOPING-WORLD
CITY- the street filled with RIOTERS- SMASHING, BURNING.

Nash checks Cobb's left wrist: above his watch, tape holds
TWO THIN YELLOW TUBES in place. Nash looks at Cobb's watch-
THE SECOND HAND CRAWLS UNNATURALLY SLOWLY.

Nash follows the tubes to a SILVER BRIEFCASE at Arthur's
feet: ARTHUR IS ASLEEP in an armchair. Tubes connect the
briefcase to Arthur's wrist.

Nash follows another set of tubes from the briefcase to where
they pass under the door to the bedroom. Through the crack of
the door, Nash sees SAITO ASLEEP on the bed, tubes running to
his wrist. BOOM- a closer EXPLOSION, and we-

                                                    CUT TO:

INT. BULLET TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY (FEELS LIKE DIFFERENT TIME)

Nash, ASLEEP. Head ROCKING AGAINST THE WINDOW as the train
BUMPS OVER A ROUGH PIECE OF TRACK.
                                                           5.

A Japanese Man, TODASHI (18) watches Nash nervously. He
checks Nash's wrist: TWO YELLOW TUBES CONNECT NASH WITH THREE
OTHER SLEEPING MEN IN THE COMPARTMENT: COBB, ARTHUR, SAITO.

Todashi checks his watch: THE SECOND HAND TICKS IN REAL TIME.
Another TRAIN PASSES in the opposite direction with a MIGHTY
WHUMP- Todashi's eyes FLY to Nash's sleeping face-

NASH JERKS WITH THE MOVEMENT OF THE TRAIN, and we-

                                                     CUT TO:

INT. FILTHY BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Another EXPLOSION- Nash CHECKS the sleeping Cobb and we-

                                                     CUT TO:

EXT. ROOFTOP TERRACES, JAPANESE CASTLE - NIGHT

A LOW TREMOR RUMBLES THROUGH THE CASTLE. Cobb and Arthur
steady themselves against the wooden rail. Several TILES and
pieces of MASONRY fall. Below them a BLACK SEA churns. Other
GUESTS wander the massive terraces.

                    ARTHUR
          Saito knows. He's playing with us.

                    COBB
          I can get it here. The
          information's in the safe- he
          looked right at it when I mentioned
          secrets.

Arthur nods. Then spots someone over Cobb's shoulder.

                    ARTHUR
          What's she doing here, Cobb?

Cobb turns to see a beautiful woman, elegantly dressed,
staring out at the sea. This is MAL. Cobb watches her.

                    COBB
          You just get to your room. I'll
          take care of the rest.

                    ARTHUR
          See that you do. We're here to
          work.

Arthur brushes past Mal, shaking his head. She nears Cobb.
Looks out at the DROP. The WIND WHIPS HER HAIR-

                    MAL
          If I jumped, would I survive?
                                                           6.

                    COBB
          With a clean dive, perhaps. Mal,
          why are you here?

She turns to look at him. Amused.

                    MAL
          I thought you might be missing
          me...

She smiles. He leans in, mesmerized.

                    COBB
          I am. But I can't trust you
          anymore.

She stares up at him, inviting.

                       MAL
          So what?

INT. BEDROOM SUITE, JAPANESE CASTLE - MOMENTS LATER

Mal sips champagne as she studies a painting by Francis
Bacon.

                    MAL
          Looks like Arthur's taste.

Cobb is looking down through the window at the GUARDS
patrolling the castle at ground level.

                    COBB
          Actually, Mr. Saito is partial to
          postwar British painters.

He turns to Mal, donning a pair of black leather gloves.

                    COBB
          Would you sit down?

Mal lowers herself gracefully into a leather wingback chair.
Cobb approaches, pulls out a length of BLACK ROPE and kneels
at Mal's feet. She looks down at him.

                       MAL
          Tell me...

Cobb TIES the rope around the CHAIR LEGS.

                    MAL
          Do the children miss me?

Cobb pauses. He lets his gloved fingers lightly touch Mal's
ankle. He looks up at her.
                                                            7.

                    COBB
          You can't imagine.

Mal looks away, uncomfortable. Cobb gets to his feet, letting
out the rope as he moves back to the window.

                    MAL
          What're you doing?

Cobb tosses the rope out-

                    COBB
          Getting some air.

He tugs on the rope, testing. The weight of the chair, with
Mal on it, holds.

                    COBB
          Stay seated. Please.

And with that, he JUMPS. Mal considers the open window.

EXT. JAPANESE CASTLE WALL - CONTINUOUS

Cobb RAPPELS down the wall, darting past windows. He stops at
a particular one. Gets out a glass cutter-

Suddenly he starts DROPPING-

INT. BEDROOM SUITE, JAPANESE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS

The EMPTY CHAIR SLIDES across the floor- WEDGES under the
window-

EXT. JAPANESE CASTLE WALL - CONTINUOUS

Cobb JOLTS to a stop 15 ft. lower. He looks up at the bedroom
window. Shakes his head. Starts climbing back.

INT. KITCHEN, JAPANESE CASTLE - MOMENTS LATER

Cobb drops silently from the window into the darkened
kitchen. He pulls a PISTOL from his belt, screwing a SILENCER
onto the barrel as he GLIDES across the room.

INT. HALL, JAPANESE CASTLE-CONTINUOUS

Cobb SLIPS through the shadows towards a GUARD stationed at
the head of a GRAND STAIRCASE...

The Guard HEARS something- TURNS- PEERS into the shadows...

Cobb FLASHES out of the shadows, silenced pistol up, AIMING-
                                                          8.

PHHT- head shot- the Guard starts to drop... but Cobb is
already there to CATCH him, sliding on his knees and lowering
the Guard SILENTLY to the floor.

INT. DINING ROOM, JAPANESE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS

Cobb moves to a PAINTING. With practiced hands he removes it
from the wall, revealing a SAFE. Cobb spins the dial, pulls
it OPEN, GRABS an envelope from within, stuffs it into his
waistband, where there is already an IDENTICAL ENVELOPE.

LIGHTS COME ON. Cobb freezes.

                    SAITO (O.S.)
          Turn around.

Cobb turns. At the far end of the room: Saito. Next to him is
Mal, gun in hand. She smiles at Cobb.

                    MAL
          The gun, Dom.

Cobb doesn't move. Mal motions outside- two GUARDS drag
Arthur into the room. Mal puts the gun to his head.

                    MAL
          Please.

Cobb slowly places his gun at his end of the long table, then
SLIDES it along the polished ebony. It comes to rest HALFWAY
down the length or the table.

                    SAITO
          Now the envelope, Mr. Cobb.

Cobb reaches into his waistband, removes ONE of the
envelopes, SLIDES it along the table. Steps back, hands
raised.

                     COBB
          Did she tell you, or have you known
          all along?

                     SAITO
          That you're here to steal from me?
              (beat)
          Or that we're actually asleep?

Arthur gives Cobb an I-told-you-so look.

                    SAITO
          I want to know who your employer
          is.

Mal COCKS the gun at Arthur's temple.
                                                           9.

                    COBB
          No point threatening him in a
          dream.

                    MAL
          That depends on what you're
          threatening. Killing him would just
          wake him up... but pain? Pain is in
          the mind...

Mal LOWERS the gun and SHOOTS Arthur in the leg- Arthur
drops, SCREAMING- Mal looks at Cobb, cold.

                    MAL
          And, judging by the decor, we're in
          your mind, aren't we, Arthur?

Cobb watches Arthur's PAIN. Mal aims at Arthur's other leg...

Cobb SPRINGS for the table, SKIDDING along its polished
surface- he GRABS his gun- SHOOTS ARTHUR BETWEEN THE EYES-

Arthur DROPS- the room starts to SHUDDER in a MASSIVE
EARTHQUAKE- Cobb SPRINGS for the door- Arthur's eyes stare at
the ceiling, DEAD, and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. FILTHY BATHROOM - DAY

Arthur's EYES OPEN as he WAKES IN THE ARMCHAIR- he GRABS at
the tubes at his wrist, YANKING them free-

                    NASH
          What're you doing?! It's too soon-

FLUID spurts from the tubes as Arthur STRUGGLES with the
SILVER CASE on the bathroom floor.

                    ARTHUR
          I know! We have to reconnect the
          loop before they wake up!

Arthur grabs the case and pushes through the door to the
bedroom- following the tubes to where they meet Saito's wrist-
SAITO LIES ON THE BED ASLEEP. Saito STIRS and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. JAPANESE CASTLE CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Cobb LURCHES towards the stairs, as all around him the
building BUCKS and HEAVES-
                                                           10.

INT. DINING ROOM, JAPANESE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS

Saito and the Guards PANIC. Mal walks calmly through the
destruction, picks up the envelope and turns to Saito.

                    MAL
          He was close. Very close.

EXT. GRAND STAIRCASE, JAPANESE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS

Cobb runs up the stairs, pulling out the SECOND ENVELOPE-

INT. DINING ROOM, JAPANESE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS

Saito RIPS open the envelope, pulls out sheets of paper. He
looks at Mal, PANICKED. He turns to the Guards-

                      SAITO
          Stop him!

Mal, confused, looks at the sheets of paper: THEY ARE BLANK.
Mal smiles, amused.

INT. GRAND STAIRCASE, JAPANESE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS

As Cobb runs up the stairs he reads the TYPEWRITTEN SHEETS
from his envelope, and we-

                                                     CUT TO:

INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Arthur OPENS the silver case: a COMPLEX MECHANISM of TUBES,
SYRINGES, DOSAGE CONTROLLERS. Arthur's hands fly across the
machine's controls as he glances at Saito's STIRRING face-

                    ARTHUR
          I'm not going to make it! Wake
          Cobb!

INT. FILTHY BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Nash turns to Cobb. Raises his hand and SMACKS him across the
face, and we-

                                                     CUT TO:

INT. GRAND STAIRCASE, JAPANESE CASTLE - NIGHT

Cobb is SMASHED sideways off his feet...
                                                        11.

INT. DINING ROOM, JAPANESE CASTLE - NIGHT

The CEILING CRACKS above Saito- he looks up as a TON of STONE
floods down, CRUSHING HIM and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Saito's eyes FLICKER OPEN. AWAKE.

Nash SMACKS Cobb again-

                    NASH
          He won't wake!

INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM-CONTINUOUS

Arthur crouched by Saito, connects the second tube.

                      ARTHUR
          Dunk him!

A CLICK: Arthur looks up to find Saito with a gun to his head
and a finger to his lips, gesturing silence...

INT. FILTHY BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Nash puts his hand on Cobb's forehead and PUSHES HIM
BACKWARDS- as Cobb starts to FALL BACKWARDS in the chair we
are in SLOW MOTION, and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. GRAND STAIRCASE, JAPANESE CASTLE - NIGHT

Cobb, full speed, picks himself up, scrambling to read the
last sheet of paper. He stares at it PUZZLED- bullets hit
around him as the Guards race up the stairs and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

Cobb in SLOW MOTION, hits the WATER- head THRASHING as he
goes under- and we-

INT. GRAND STAIRCASE, JAPANESE CASTLE - NIGHT

Cobb glances up from the paper as WATER EXPLODES IN THROUGH
ALL THE WINDOWS, FLOODING THE ENTIRE HALL-
                                                        12.

COBB IS SWAMPED BY WATER, SPUN IN ALL DIRECTIONS AT ONCE- HE
PULLS DEEPER OR FOR THE SURFACE, WE CAN'T TELL...

HE BREAKS THE SURFACE, GASPING FOR AIR IN THE BATHTUB IN THE-

INT. FILTHY BATHROOM - DAY

Cobb's AWAKE, GULPING AIR, getting his bearings.

Saito SMASHES into the room, KNOCKING Nash down- Cobb
LAUNCHES himself out of the tub, FLYING dripping wet across
the room to SLAM Saito against the door- the gun DROPS,
Cobb's fist CONNECTS with Saito's jaw and the struggle is
over.

INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Cobb, wet but composed, sits, turning Saito's gun in his
hand. Nash holds Saito's arms behind him. Outside, the sounds
of RIOTING grow louder.

                    COBB
          You came prepared.

                    SAITO
          I bring the gun because not even my
          head of security knows this
          apartment. How did you find it?

Arthur, at the window, looks out at the WORSENING VIOLENCE.

                    COBB
          Hard for a man in your position to
          keep a love nest totally secret...
          particularly when there's a married
          woman involved.

                    SAITO
          She would never...

                    COBB
          And yet, here we are.

Saito is silent.

                    COBB
          With a dilemma.

                    SAITO
          You got what you came for.

                     COBB
          Not quite. The key piece of
          information wasn't there, was it,
          Mr. Saito?
                                                         13.

Arthur looks over at Cobb, worried.

                    ARTHUR
          They're getting closer, Cobb.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. BULLET TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY

Todashi slips a pair of HEADPHONES over Nash's ears, then
pulls out an MP3 player and we-

INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Saito's eyes are on the floor.

                    COBB
          You held something back because you
          knew what we were up to...

Cobb uses the barrel of the gun to raise Saito's chin.

                    COBB
          So why let us in at all?

Saito smiles, defiant. VIOLENT NOISES echo up the stairway...

                    SAITO
          An audition.

                    COBB
          Audition for what?

                    SAITO
          It doesn't matter. You failed.

                    COBB
          I extracted all the information you
          had in there.

                    SAITO
          But your deception was readily
          apparent.

And we-

Todashi waits for the first countdown to hit "30," then HITS
PLAY on the MP3 player- He watches Nash's sleeping face as he
RAISES the volume...

Through Nash's headphones: the opening bars of Edith Piaf's
"Non, je ne regrette rien," and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM - DAY

In the distant background, strange MASSIVE low-end MUSICAL
start, sounding like DISTANT HORNS...

                    SAITO
          So leave me and go.

                    COBB
          You know the corporation who hired
          us won't accept failure. We won't
          last two days...

The DISTANT, SLOWED-DOWN MUSIC is becoming LOUDER, as are the
SHOUTS coming up the stairs. Arthur looks at his watch, its
SLOW SECOND TICKING MARKS TIME WITH THE MASSIVE MUSIC.

                    ARTHUR
          Come on, Cobb.

                    COBB
          So now I have to do this the old-
          fashioned way-

Cobb GRABS SAITO AND PUTS HIS HEAD TO THE FLOOR, gun pressed
into his cheek. Saito looks into Cobb's eyes- sees he will
pull the trigger. Saito BLINKS, looks away in shame-

When he NOTICES SOMETHING. And starts LAUGHING.

                    SAITO
          I've always hated this carpet.

Cobb's eyes flick to the carpet and back.

                    SAITO
          It's stained and frayed in such
          distinctive ways...

Cobb looks up at Nash, who shrugs, at a loss.

                    SAITO
          But very definitely made of wool.
          Right now I'm lying on polyester.
                                                           15.

Cobb glares at Nash, and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. BULLET TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY

Todashi watches the first of the countdowns hit ZERO- He
looks up at Arthur, STIRRING, and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM-DAY

Saito turns from the carpet to look up at Cobb.

                    SAITO
          Which means I'm not lying on my
          carpet, in my apartment...
              (smiles)
          You've lived up to your reputation,
          Mr. Cobb... I'm still dreaming.

Cobb looks over to Arthur, but ARTHUR HAS VANISHED, and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. BULLET TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY

Arthur's eyes flicker open, AWAKE. He RIPS at his tubes.

                    TODASHI
          How'd it go?

                      ARTHUR
          Not good.

Arthur checks the remaining three countdowns, and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Saito gets to his feet, looking admiringly at Cobb.

                     SAITO
          A dream within a dream-I'm
          impressed.

Cobb lowers the gun. Defeated. Glances at his watch. The
music REVERBERATES, the RIOTERS BANG ON THE DOOR, and we-

                                                  CUT TO:
                                                        16.

INT. BULLET TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY

Arthur retracts the tubes into the case as he watches the
next countdown hit ZERO, and we-

                                                   CUT TO:

INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Another BANG on the door- Saito, confident now, approaches
Cobb. Nash is behind Saito.

                    SAITO
          But in my dream, we really ought to
          be playing by my rules...

                    NASH
          Ah, yes, but you see, Mr. Saito-

Saito turns to Nash-

                    COBB
          We're not in your dream-

Saito turns back to Cobb, BUT COBB HAS VANISHED-

                    NASH
          We're in mine.

Saito SPINS back to Nash- the DOOR SMASHES OFF ITS HINGES AS
RIOTERS POUR INTO THE ROOM, SWARMING OVER NASH... BUT NASH IS
GONE. The music DIES. Saito and the rioters stand there in
the SILENCE, the light DWINDLING... and we-

                                                   CUT TO:

INT. BULLET TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY

Nash' eyes open, AWAKE.

                       ARTHUR (O.S.)
          Asshole!

Nash BLINKS. Arthur is in his face, furious.

                    ARTHUR
          How could you get the carpet
          wrong?!

                    NASH
          It wasn't my fault!

                    ARTHUR
          You're the architect-
                                                        17.

                    NASH
          I didn't know he was going to rub
          his damn cheek on it!

Cobb pulls Arthur away from Nash.

                     COBB
          Lets go.

                    ARTHUR
          And you-what the hell was all that?

                    COBB
          I had it under control.

                    ARTHUR
          I'd hate to see out of control-

                    COBB
          There's no time for this-I'm
          getting off at Kyoto.

                    ARTHUR
          Why? He's not gonna search every
          compartment.

                    COBB
          I can't stand trains.

Arthur moves to the briefcase. Turns a dial.

                    ARTHUR
          I can keep him under for one minute-

Arthur hits a button- A PLUNGER DEPRESSES. Cobb RIPS the tape
off Saito's wrist, ROLLS up his tubes. Arthur SLAMS the
silver case shut. Todashi pulls open the door-

                    COBB
          Every man for himself.

Arthur and Nash EXIT, heading in different directions down
the corridor. Cobb hands Todashi a thick roll of CASH, looks
at Saito, who stirs. Cobb moves off.

EXT. JAPANESE COUNTRYSIDE - CONTINUOUS

The BULLET TRAIN speeds through the lush landscape.

INT. BULLET TRAIN COMPARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Saito WAKES GENTLY. Looks around the compartment, empty but
for Todashi, reading a comic. Saito looks down at his wrist.
Sees a small mark. Rubs it. SMILES.
                                                        18.

EXT. TOKYO - DUSK

Moving over the vast city towards a high rise. A HELICOPTER
thumps into frame, heading for a pad on the roof.

INT. APARTMENT, TOKYO - CONTINUOUS

Cobb sits, waiting. Checks his watch, restless. He pulls a
HANDGUN. Checks it is loaded. places it on the table in front
of him. Pulls out a PEWTER SPINNING TOP, SPINS it on the
table ... He INTENT STUDIES the top's spin... As he stares,
the sound of a FREIGHT TRAIN builds and builds- the top
WOBBLES, TIPS onto its side- the sound of the train STOPS.
the PHONE RINGS- Cobb GRABS it-

                    CHILDREN'S VOICES (over phone)
          Hi, Daddy! Hi, Dad.

                    COBB
          Hey, guys. How are you?

                    CHILDREN'S VOICES (over phone)
          Good. Okay, I guess.

Cobb closes his eyes, trying to picture his children: INSERT
CUT: COBB's MEMORY- a LITTLE BLONDE BOY (3), back towards us,
crouches IN A GARDEN, looks at something in the grass...

                    COBB
          Who's just okay? Was that James?

                    JAMES (over phone)
          Yeah. When are you coming home?

                    COBB
          I can't. Not for a while.

INSERT CUT: A LITTLE BLONDE GIRL (5), also FACE UNSEEN, joins
JAMES, CROUCHING BESIDE HIM...

                    JAMES (over phone)
          Why?

                    COBB
          Well, James, like I've told you-I'm
          away because I'm working...

                    LITTLE GIRL (over phone)
          Grandma says you're never coming
          back.
Cobb pauses. Takes a breath. INSERT CUT: James and Philippa,
FACES UNSEEN, lift their heads from the grass, responding to
someone's call- they RUN AWAY FROM US ACROSS THE GARDEN...
                                                          19.

                    COBB
          Philippa, can you ask Grandma to
          pick up the phone-

                    PHILIPPA (over phone)
          She's shaking her head.

Cobb TENSES, as if about to SMASH the phone.

                    COBB
          Well, we'll just have to hope
          Grandma's wrong about that won't
          we?

                    JAMES
              (over phone)
          Daddy?

                    COBB
          Yes?

                    JAMES (over phone)
          Is Mommy with you?

Cobb looks like he just got punched- INSERT CUT: COBB'S
MEMORY- MAL, WIND BLOWING HER HAIR, SMILES CALMLY...

                    COBB
          No. No, we talked about this,
          James. Mommy's gone.

                    JAMES (over phone)
          Where?

                    GRANDMA'S VOICE (over phone)
          Time to go, kids. Say bye-bye-
                    COBB
          I'll give some presents to Grandpa,
          okay? Just be good for-

Cobb STARES at the dead phone. Then DOWNS his drink- A KNOCK
at the door. Cobb GRABS the top, the gun- MOVES to the door-
cracks it: Arthur.

                    ARTHUR
          Our ride's on the roof.

Cobb nods. Moves to pick up his bag. Arthur watches.

                    ARTHUR
          Cobb... are you okay?

Cobb looks up.
                                                           20.

                       COBB
          Yeah, why?

                    ARTHUR
          Down in the dream... Mal showing up
          like that ...

                    COBB
          Yeah. I'm sorry about your leg.

                    ARTHUR
          It's getting worse, isn't it?

                    COBB
          One apology's all you're getting,
          Arthur. Now, where's Nash?

                    ARTHUR
          Hasn't shown. Wanna wait?

                    COBB
              (shakes head)
          We were supposed to deliver Saito's
          expansion plans to Cobol Engineering
          two hours ago. By now they know we
          failed. Time to disappear.

INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

Cobb and Arthur head towards the elevator.

                    ARTHUR
          Where will you go?

                    COBB
          Buenos Aires. I can lie low there.
          Maybe sniff out a job when things
          quiet down. You?

                       ARTHUR
          Stateside.

                    COBB
              (wistful) )
          'Course. Send my regards.

Arthur looks at Cobb. Nods. Sympathetic.

EXT. ROOFTOP HELIPAD - NIGHT

The HELICOPTER sits, ROTORS SPINNING. As Cobb and Arthur
reach the door, it SLIDES OPEN. Cobb steps up into the
leather-padded interior. He freezes.
                                                        21.

INT. HELICOPTER ON PAD - CONTINUOUS

Nash, BEATEN BLOODY, sits on the far side, slumped against
the wine. Beside him: SAITO. He nods politely at Cobb.

                    SAITO
          He sold you out. Thought to come to
          me and bargain for his life...

Saito's BODYGUARD offers Cobb a GUN.

                    SAITO
          So I offer you the satisfaction.

                    COBB
          That's not how I deal with things.

                    SAITO
          Would you work with him again?

Cobb shakes his head. Saito's BODYGUARDS PULL Nash from the
chopper. Saito motions Cobb and Arthur to sit. The chopper
RISES. Cobb watches Nash DRAGGED across the pad.

                    COBB
          What will you do to him?

                    SAITO
          Nothing. But I can't speak for your
          friends from Cobol Engineering.

Saito looks out at the city slipping by.

                    COBB
          What do you want from us?

                       SAITO
          Inception.

Arthur raises his eyebrows. Cobb is poker-faced.

                    SAITO
          Is it possible?

                    ARTHUR
          Of course not.

                    SAITO
          If you can steal an idea from
          someone's mind, why can't you plant
          one there instead?

                    ARTHUR
          Okay, here's planting an idea: I
          say to you, "Don't think about
          elephants."
                    (MORE)
                                                        22.
                    ARTHUR (CONT'D)
              (Saito nods)
          What are you thinking about?

                       SAITO
          Elephants.

                    ARTHUR
          Right. But it's not your idea
          because you know I gave it to you.

                    SAITO
          You could plant it subconsciously-

                    ARTHUR
          The subject's mind can always trace
          the genesis of the idea. True
          inspiration is impossible to fake.

                    COBB
          No, it isn't.

                    SAITO
          Can you do it?

                    COBB
          I won't do it.

                    SAITO
          In exchange, I'll give you the
          information you were paid to steal.

                    COBB
          Are you giving me a choice? Because
          I can find my own way to square
          things with Cobol.

                    SAITO
          Then you do have a choice.

                    COBB
          And I choose to leave.

EXT. AIRFIELD - MOMENTS LATER

The helicopter sets down next to a PRIVATE JET.

INT. HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS

Saito indicates the plane.

                    SAITO
          Tell the crew where you want to go,
          they'll file the plan en route.

Cobb and Arthur look at each other. Then move for the door.
                                                23.

                    SAITO
          Mr. Cobb...? There is one other
          thing I could offer you.
              (Cobb stops)
          How would you like to go home? To
          America. To your children.

Cobb turns back to Saito.

                    COBB
          You can't fix that. Nobody could.

                    SAITO
          Just like inception.

Cobb considers this. Arthur touches his arm.

                    ARTHUR
          Cobb, come on-

                    COBB
          How complex is the idea?

                    SAITO
          Simple enough.

                    COBB
          No idea's simple when you have to
          plant it in someone else's mind.

                    SAITO
          My main competitor is an old man in
          poor health. His son will soon
          inherit control of the corporation.
          I need him to decide to break up
          his father's empire. Against his
          own self-interest.

                    ARTHUR
          Cobb, we should walk away from
          this.

                    COBB
          If I were to do it. If I could do
          it... how do I know you can
          deliver?

                    SAITO
          You don't. But I can. So do you
          want to take a leap of faith, or
          become an old man, filled with
          regret, waiting to die alone?

Cobb looks at Saito. Barely nods.
                                                          24.

                    SAITO
          Assemble your team, Mr. Cobb. And
          choose your people more wisely.

INT. PRIVATE JET - LATER

Cobb reclines his seat. Arthur picks at a salad, angry.

                    ARTHUR
          I know how much you want to go home-

                    COBB
              (sharp)
          No, you don't.

                    ARTHUR
          But this can't be done.

                    COBB
          It can. You just have to go deep
          enough.

                    ARTHUR
          You don't know that!-

                    COBB
          I've done it before.

Arthur is taken aback. Cobb turns to the window.

                    ARTHUR
          Did it work?

                       COBB
                 (quiet)
          Yes.

                    ARTHUR
          Who did you do it to?

Cobb looks at Arthur. Closed. Arthur shrugs.

                    ARTHUR
          So why are we headed to Paris?

                     COBB
          We're going to need a new
          architect.

INT. GREAT HALL, ÉCOLE D'ARCHITECTURE - MORNING

Cobb, carrying a shopping bag, looks into a lecture hall: no
students, just a RUMPLED PROFESSOR hunched over paperwork.
                                                        25.

INT. LECTURE HALL - CONTINUOUS

                    COBB (O.S.)
          You never did like your office.

PROFESSOR MILES looks up, squinting. Recognizes Cobb.

                    MILES
          No space to think in that broom
          cupboard.

Cobb steps down past the empty wooden rows.

                    MILES
          Is it safe for you to be here?

                    COBB
          Extradition between France and the
          U.S. is a bureaucratic nightmare.

                    MILES
          I think they'd find a way to make
          it work in your case.

Cobb hand Miles the shopping bag.

                    COBB
          Can you take these back for the
          kids?

                    MILES
          It'll take more than the occasional
          stuffed animal to convince those
          children they still have a father.

                    COBB
          I know. I thought you could talk to
          Marie about bringing them on
          vacation. Somewhere I could meet-

                    MILES
          Why would she listen to me?

                    COBB
          You were married for twenty years.

                    MILES
          She blames me as much as you.

                    COBB
          Doesn't she understand that my kids
          need me?
                                                26.

                    MILES
          Yes, she does. We all do. Go back
          and face the music, Dom. Explain
          what Mal did.

                    COBB
          Be realistic, Stephen. They'd never
          understand- they'd lock me up and
          throwaway the key. Or worse.

                    MILES
          You think what you're doing now is
          helping your case?

                    COBB
          Lawyers don't pay for themselves.
          This is what I have. This is what
          you taught me.

                    MILES
          I never taught you to be a thief.

                    COBB
          No, you taught me to navigate other
          people's minds. But after what
          happened with Mal there weren't a
          whole lot of legitimate ways for me
          to use that skill.

Miles looks at Cobb.

                    MILES
          Why did you come here, Dom?

Cobb shifts slightly.

                     COBB
          I found a way home. A job. For
          powerful people. If I pull it off,
          I can get back to my family. But I
          need help.

Miles realizes something.

                    MILES
          My God. You're here to corrupt one
          of my brightest and best.

                    COBB
          If you have someone good enough,
          you have to let them decide for
          themselves. You know what I'm
          offering-

                       MILES
          Money?
                                                27.

                    COBB
          No, not just money: the chance to
          build cathedrals, entire cities-
          things that have never existed,
          things that couldn't exist in the
          real world...

                    MILES
          Everybody dreams, Cobb. Architects
          are supposed to make those dreams
          real.

                    COBB
          That's not what you used to say.
          You told me that in the real world
          I'd be building attic conversions
          and gas stations. You said that if
          I mastered the dream-share I'd have
          a whole new way of creating and
          showing people my creations. You
          told me it would free me.

Miles looks at Cobb, sad.

                    MILES
          And I'm sorry. I was wrong.

                    COBB
          No, you weren't. Your vision was a
          vision of pure creativity. It's
          where we took it that was wrong.

                    MILES
          And now you want me to let someone
          else follow you into fantasy.

                    COBB
          They won't actually come on the
          job, they'll just design the levels
          and teach them to the dreamers.

                    MILES
          Design them yourself.

                    COBB
          Mal won't let me.

Miles looks at Cobb. Appalled.

                    MILES
          Come back to reality, Dom. Please.

                    COBB
          You want to know what's real,
          Stephen? Your grandchildren waiting
          for their dad to come back.
                    (MORE)
                                                        28.
                    COBB (CONT'D)
          This job-this last job-is how I get
          there.

Miles looks down, fiddles with his papers.

                    COBB
          I wouldn't be standing here if
          there were any other way. I can get
          home. But I need an architect who's
          as good as I was.

Miles looks Cobb in the eye. Decides.

                    MILES
          I've got someone better.

INT. CORRIDOR - LATER

Miles and Cobb stand by as STUDENTS file out of a lecture.

                       MILES
          Ariadne...

A young woman carrying books turns. This is ARIADNE.

                    MILES
          I'd like you to meet Mr. Cobb.

She sizes him up with quick eyes. Offers her hand.

                    ARIADNE
          Pleased to meet you.

                    MILES
          If you have a few moments, Mr. Cobb
          has a job offer to discuss with
          you.

                    ARIADNE
          A work placement?

                    COBB
              (smiles
          Not exactly.

EXT. ROOFTOP, ÉCOLE D'ARCHITECTURE - MOMENTS LATER

Ariadne leans against the parapet, overlooking Paris. She
unwraps a sandwich, watching Cobb pull out a pad of GRAPH
PAPER and a PEN. He offers them. She bites her sandwich.

                       COBB
          A test.
                                                           29.

                    ARIADNE
              (mouth full)
          Aren't you going to tell me
          anything?

                    COBB
          Before I describe the job, I have
          to know you could do it.

                    ARIADNE
          Why?

                    COBB
          It's not, strictly speaking, legal.

Ariadne raises her eyebrows.

                    COBB
          You have two minutes to draw a maze
          that takes me one minute to solve.

Ariadne takes the pad and pen. Cobb looks at his watch.

                    COBB
          Go.

She starts DRAWING LINES on the grid, constructing a maze.

                    COBB
          Stop.

Ariadne hands the pad and pen to Cobb. He glances at the pad,
then, looking her in the eye, TRACES the solution. She is
taken aback. Cobb RIPS off the sheet, hands the pad back.

                    COBB
          Again.

She traces straight lines, CONCENTRATING...

                    COBB
          Stop.

She hands Cobb the pad, a touch pleased. Cobb solves the
puzzle instantly, as before. Her smile falls.

                    COBB
          You'll have to-

She GRABS the pad, frustrated... but this time she FLIPS it
over and starts drawing on the BLANK CARDBOARD of the back.
Cobb watches, surprised. He smiles as he sees that she's
drawing CIRCLES, creating a maze based on concentric rings.

Ariadne hands back the pad, defiant. Cobb takes the pen,
starts the maze. This time he gets stuck. Nods.
                                                           30.

                    COBB
              (working the maze)
          More like it.

EXT. NARROW STREET, PARIS - DAY

Arthur stops at a warehouse door. Consults a piece of paper.

INT. WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS

A large, dusty warehouse. The SLIDING DOOR cracks open.
Arthur enters. Looks around, approvingly.

INT. SAME - LATER

Arthur DRAGS LAWN CHAIRS into the middle of the room. He
erects a table. Lays out several SILVER CASES, unpacking
them, laying out lines of tubing, MECHANISMS...

EXT. PARISIAN CAFE - DAY

Cobb and Ariadne sit at an outdoor table.

                    COBB
          They say we only use a fraction of
          the true potential of our brains...
          but they're talking about when
          we're awake. While we dream, the
          mind performs wonders.

                     ARIADNE
          Such as?

                    COBB
          How do you imagine a building? You
          consciously create each aspect,
          puzzling over it in stages... But
          sometimes, when your imagination
          flies-

                    ARIADNE
          I'm discovering it.

                    COBB
          Exactly. Genuine inspiration.

Cobb leans forwards and draws on the paper table cloth.

                    COBB
          In a dream your mind continuously
          does that...

Cobb has drawn a circle made of two arrows.
                                                     31.

                    COBB
          It creates and perceives a world
          simultaneously. So well that you
          don't feel your brain doing the
          creating. That's why we can short-
          circuit the process...

                    ARIADNE
          How?

                    COBB
          By taking over the creating part.

Cobb draws a straight line between the two arrows.

                    COBB
          This is where you come in. You
          build the world of the dream. We
          take the subject into that dream,
          and let him £111 it with his
          subconscious

                    ARIADNE
          But are you trying to fool him that
          the dream is actually real life?

                     COBB
              (nods)
          While we're in there, We don't want
          him to realize he's dreaming.

                    ARIADNE
          How could I ever get enough detail
          to Convince him that it's real?

                    COBB
          Our dreams reel real while we're in
          them. It's only when we wake up we
          realize things were strange,

Ariadne gestures around them-

                    ARIADNE
          But all the textures of real life-
          the stone, the fabric. cars...
          people... your mind can't create
          all this.

                    COBB
          It does. Every time you dream. Let
          me ask you a question: You never
          remember the beginning of your
          dreams, do you? You just turn up in
          the middle of what's going on.
                                                        32.

                       ARIADNE
          I guess.

                    COBB
          So... how did we end up at this
          restaurant?

                    ARIADNE
          We came here from...

Ariadne trails off, confused.

                    COBB
          How did we get here? Where are we?

Ariadne THINKS, unable to remember. A FAINT RUMBLE begins.

                    ARIADNE
          Oh my God. We're dreaming.

Cobb nods. The RUMBLE is BUILDING.

                    COBB
          Stay calm. We're actually asleep in
          the workshop. This is your first
          lesson in shared dreaming,
          remember?

Ariadne looks around, mind REELING. Cobb BRACES-

The restaurant VIOLENTLY FRAGMENTS, EXPLODING AND IMPLODING
PARTICLES OF FURNITURE, WALLS, PEOPLE FLYING AROUND- Ariadne
WONDERS at the MAYHEM WHIRLING around them- Cobb SHIELDS his
head against the debris. She sees him-

                    ARIADNE
              (shouting over noise)
          If it's just a dream, why are you
          covering your-

Ariadne is WIPED FROM HER SEAT BY A MASSIVE BLAST and we-

                                                   CUT TO:

INT. WORKSHOP - DAY

Ariadne JOLTS awake.

                    COBB (O.S.)
          Because it's never just a dream.

Ariadne turns to Cobb's voice. They are both sitting in the
lawn chairs. Arthur watches over them.
                                                        33.

                    COBB
          And a face full of glass hurts like
          hell, doesn't it? While we're in
          it, it's real.

                    ARTHUR
          That's why the military developed
          dream sharing-a training program
          where soldiers could strangle, stab
          and shoot each other, then wake up.

                    ARIADNE
          How did architects get involved?

                    COBB
          Someone had to design the dreams.
              (to Arthur)
          Let's go another five minutes-

                    ARIADNE
          We were only asleep for five
          minutes? We talked for an hour at
          least...

                    COBB
          When you dream, your mind functions
          more quickly, so time seems to pass
          more slowly.

                    ARTHUR
          Five minutes in the real world
          gives you an hour in the dream.

                    COBB
          Let's see how much trouble you can
          cause in five minutes.

And we-

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT. SAME PARISIAN STREET - DAY

Ariadne walks down the crowded street with Cobb. Cobb looks
around at the street, the cafe, approving.

                    COBB
          It's good. You've got the cafe, the
          layout... you forgot the book shop
          but pretty much everything else is
          here.

Ariadne looks at the passers-by.

                    ARIADNE
          Who are the people?
                                                        34.

                    COBB
          They're projections of my
          subconscious.

                     ARIADNE
          Yours?

                    COBB
          Sure-you are the dreamer, I am the
          subject. My subconscious populates
          your world. That's one way we get
          at a subject's thoughts-his mind
          creates the people, so we can
          literally talk to his subconscious.

                    ARIADNE
          How else do you do it?

                    COBB
          Architecture. Build a bank vault or
          a jail, something secure, and the
          subject's mind will fill it with
          information he's trying to protect.

                    ARIADNE
          Then you break in and steal it.

                     COBB
          Exactly.

Ariadne wonders at the detail of the street.

                     ARIADNE
          I love the concrete sense of things-
              (stamps foot)
          Real weight, you know? I thought a
          dream space would be all about the
          visual, but it's the feel of
          things. Question is, what happens
          as you start to mess with
          physics...

She CONCENTRATES on the street. The street starts to BEND IN
HALF- the buildings on either side FOLDING IN until they form
the INSIDE OF A CUBE OF CITY, GRAVITY FUNCTIONING
INDEPENDENTLY ON EACH PLANE. Ariadne looks up (or down) at
the people on the opposite city surface. Cobb watches her
excitement.

                    ARIADNE
          It's something, isn't it?

                    COBB
              (quiet)
          Yes. It is.
                                                        35.

As they walk, Ariadne notices more and more of the
projections STARING at her.

                    ARIADNE
          Why are they looking at me?

                    COBB
          Because you're changing things. My
          subconscious feels that someone
          else is creating the world. The
          more you change things, the quicker
          the projections converge on you.

                      ARIADNE
          Converge?

                    COBB
          They feel the foreign nature of the
          dreamer, and attack-like white
          blood cells fighting an infection.

                    ARIADNE
          They're going to attack us?

                    COBB
          Just you, actually.

They walk along the street to where it joins the next
gravitational plane. They step up onto the different plane
and walk down the street towards a river. As Ariadne
approaches, steps emerge from the flagstone, and she leads
Cobb up onto a small jetty. As she concentrates, pillars
emerge and a BRIDGE starts to telescope out from the jetty.
They step onto it as it grows. Cobb is impressed.

                    COBB
          It's beautiful... but if you keep
          on changing things...

People crossing the bridge STARE at Ariadne. Several of them
BUMP her shoulder as they pass.

                    ARIADNE
          Mind telling your subconscious to
          take it easy?

                    COBB
          That's why it's called subconscious.
          I don't control it.

The bridge now spans the Seine. Cobb marvels at it.

                    COBB
          Arched stone, iron pillars...
          it's...
                                                          36.

Cobb pauses, thinking. Remembering.

INSERT CUT: Mal, hair blowing, turns to Cobb, smiling,
laughing. He smiles back. They are on the same bridge.

                    COBB
          I know this bridge. This place is
          real-
              (serious)
          You didn't imagine it, you
          remembered it...

                     ARIADNE
              (nods)
          I cross it every day on my way to
          the college.

                    COBB
          Never recreate places from your
          memory. Always imagine new places.

                    ARIADNE
          You have to draw from what you know-

                    COBB
              (tense)
          Use pieces-a streetlamp,
          phonebooths, a type of brick-not
          whole areas.

Several people around them ECHO Cobb's attitude...

                     ARIADNE
          Why not?

                    COBB
          Because building dreams out of your
          own memories is the surest way to
          lose your grip on what's real and
          what's a dream.

                    ARIADNE
          Did that happen to you?

Cobb says nothing. He stands there, starinq at Ariadne.
PEOPLE around her stop and look at her, hostile.

                    COBB
          Look, this isn't about me-

Cobb reaches for Ariadne's arm, turns her to him-

                    ARIADNE
          Is that why you need me to build
          your dreams?
                                                         37.

A passerby GRABS Ariadne's shoulder-

                    COBB
          Leave her alone-

More of the crowd join in, PULLING at Ariadne, holding her
arms open- Cobb PULLS people off- the crowd PUSHES him away-
Cobb sees someone WALKING PURPOSEFULLY through the crowd
towards the helpless, Ariadne- it is Mal. She approaches with
even strides- Ariadne stares at her, uneasy.

                    ARIADNE
          Wake me up, Cobb.

As Mal walks, she pulls out a LARGE KNIFE-

                       COBB
          Mal, no!

                    ARIADNE
          Wake me up!

Ariadne SCREAMS as Mal LUNGES at her with the knife and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. WORKSHOP-DAY

Ariadne WAKES, BREATHING HARD. Arthur moves to her-

                       ARTHUR
          It's okay.

                    ARIADNE
          Why couldn't I wake?

                    ARTHUR
          The only way to wake from inside
          the dream is to die.

Cobb, in the lawn chair opposite, PULLS his tubes out.

                    COBB
          She'll need a totem.

                       ARIADNE
          What?

                    ARTHUR
          Some kind of personal icon. A small
          object that you can always have
          with you, and that no one else
          knows,

Cobb gets to his feet, Ariadne stares at him, furious. He
heads to the bathroom.
                                                          38.

                     ARIADNE
          That's some subconscious you've
          got, Cobb.
              (calls after him)
          She's a real charmer!

                    ARTHUR
          Sounds like you've met Mrs. Cobb.

                    ARIADNE
              (surprised)
          She's his wife?

Arthur nods, pulling off Ariadne's tubes.

                    ARTHUR
          So. A totem. You need something
          small, potentially heavy...

INT. BATHROOM, WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS

Cobb takes out his PEWTER SPINNING TOP, SPINS it on the
marble counter...

INT. WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS

Ariadne looks at Arthur, puzzled.

                    ARIADNE
          Like a coin?

                    ARTHUR
          Too common. You need something that
          has a weight or movement that only
          you know.

INT. BATHROOM, WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS

Cobb STUDIES the spin of the top as it decays, becoming more
and more ECCENTRIC...

INT. WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS

                    ARIADNE
          What's yours?

Arthur holds out a DIE.

                    ARTHUR
          A loaded die.

Ariadne reaches for it- Arthur snatches sit away-
                                                          39.

                    ARTHUR
          I can't let you handle it. That's
          the point. No one else can know the
          weight or balance of it.

                     ARIADNE
          Why?

                    ARTHUR
          So when you examine your totem...

INT. BATHROOM, WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS

Cobb's spinning top WOBBLES OVER.

                    ARTHUR (O.S.)
          You know, beyond a doubt, that
          you're not in someone else's dream.

Cobb GRABS it like a drowning man reaching for a lifeline.

INT. WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS

Ariadne thinks this over.

                    ARIADNE
          That's not an issue for me.

                     ARTHUR
          Why not?

                    ARIADNE
          Arthur, maybe you can't see what's
          going on, maybe you don't want to.
          But Cobb's got problems he's tried
          to bury down there. I'm not going
          to open my mind to someone like
          that.

Ariadne gets to her feet. Walks away.

                    COBB (O.S.)
          She'll be back.

Arthur turns. Cobb is standing in the bathroom doorway.

                    COBB
          I've never seen anyone pick it up
          so fast. And one reality won't be
          enough for her now. When she comes
          back, get her building mazes.

                    ARTHUR
          Where will you be?
                                                           40.

                    COBB
          I've got to talk to Eames.

                    ARTHUR
          Eames? But he's in Mombasa. Cobol's
          backyard.

                    COBB
          Necessary risk.

                    ARTHUR
          There are plenty of other thieves.

                    COBB
          We don't just need a thief. We need
          a forger.

INT. GAMBLING DEN, MOMBASA - DAY

Crowded, bustling, smoke-filled. a westerner (40's), shabby
suit, is squeezed in at a dice game. This is EAMES. He
FIDDLES with his last two chips.

                    COBB (O.S.)
          Rub them against each other all you
          like, they're not going to breed.

Eames looks up to see Cobb.

                    EAMES
          You never know.

Eames tosses down his last chips. The dice are rolled...

                      COBB
          Drink?

Eames loses.

                    EAMES
          You're buying.

Cobb follows Eames. Eames mysteriously produces two stacks of
chips and puts them down in front of the cashier. Cobb pulls
one off the top, squints at the embossed name.

                    COBB
          You're spelling hasn't improved.

Eames GRABS the chip. Hands it to the cashier.

                      EAMES
          Piss off.

                    COBB
          How's your handwriting?
                                                        41.

Eames takes his money. Smiles at Cobb.

                       EAMES
          Versatile.

INT. STREET, MOMBASA - CONTINUOUS

Eames leads Cobb down the quiet street.

                    EAMES
          Word is, you're not welcome in
          these parts.

                       COBB
          Yeah?

                    EAMES
          There's a price on your head from
          Cobol Engineering. Pretty big one,
          actually.

                    COBB
          You wouldn't sell me out.

Eames looks at Cobb, offended.

                    EAMES
          `Course I would.

                    COBB
              (smiles)
          Not when you hear what I'm selling.

EXT. BALCONY OF A COFFEE HOUSE - LATER

A ramshackle balcony overlooking a bust street. Eames pours.

                       COBB
          Inception.

Eames's glass stops halfway to his mouth.

                    COBB
          Don't bother telling me it's
          impossible.

                    EAMES
          It's perfectly possible. Just
          bloody difficult.

                    COBB
          That's what I keep saying to
          Arthur.
                                      42.

          EAMES
Arthur? You're still working with
that stick-in-the-mud?

          COBB
He's a good point man.

          EAMES
The best. But he has no
imagination. If you're going to
perform inception, you need
imagination.

          COBB
You've done it before?

          EAMES
Yeas and no. We tried it. Got the
idea in place, but it didn't take.

          COBB
You didn't plant it deep enough?

          EAMES
It's not just about depth. You need
the simplest version of the idea-
the one that will grow naturally in
the subject's mind. Subtle art.

          COBB
That's why I'm here.

          EAMES
What's the idea you need to plant?

          COBB
We want the heir to a major
corporation to break up his
father's empire.

          EAMES
See, right there you've got various
political motivations, anti-
monopolistic sentiment and so
forth. But all that stuff's at the
mercy of the subject's prejudice-
you have to go to the basic.

            COBB
Which is?

          EAMES
The relationship with the father.
    (downs drink)
Do you have a chemist?
                                                        43.

Cobb shakes his head.

                     EAMES
          There's a man here. Yusuf. He
          formulates his own versions of the
          compounds.

                    COBB
          Let's go see him.

                    EAMES
          Once you've lost your tail.
              (Cobb reacts)
          Back by the bar, blue tie. Came in
          about two minutes after we did.

                    COBB
          Cobol Engineering?

                    EAMES
          They pretty much own Mombasa.

Cobb glances over the balcony.

                    COBB
          Run interference. We'll meet
          downstairs in half an hour.

                       EAMES
          Back here?

                    COBB
          Last place they'd expect.

Eames downs his drink. Rises. Walks over to the Businessman.

                       EAMES
          Freddy!

The Businessman looks up, awkward.

                    EAMES
          Freddy Simmonds, it is you!

Cobb nonchalantly SLIPS over the balcony DROPPING HARD into
the midst of the crowd on the street below.

                    EAMES
              (looks harder)
          Oh. No, it isn't.

EXT. STREET, MOMBASA - CONTINUOUS

Cobb stands up, PUSHES into the crowd- faces PEER at him- he
moves, trying to blend- TURNS- a SECOND BUSINESS MAN is
there.
                                                           44.

                       COBB
                 (disarming smile)
          Yes?

                    SECOND BUSINESSMAN
          We need to-

Cobb HEAD BUTTS the Second Businessman, PUSHES past him-

The First Businessman races out of the bar, sees Cobb's wake,
DIVES after him- Cobb RACES headlong through tight
passageways, WEAVING through or KNOCKING into the locals...

He steps into a dark, crowded cafe, scanning the tables...
the First Businessman enters, spots him. An AFRICAN MAN gets
in Cobb's face, jabbering at him in Swahili- Cobb considers
his options... the First Businessman DRAWS A GUN- Cobb bolts,
steps up on a table and out an open window, SCRAMBLING into
the alley outside...

Cobb LOOKS left, right... CUTS LEFT into a narrow, CROWDED
alley- the alley NARROWS TO A DEAD END. Faces in the CROWD
start to watch Cobb- PEOPLE start to SURROUND him- Cobb looks
back the way he came- the two Businessmen are there, GUNS
DRAWN-

Cobb sees a SMALL GAP between the buildings at the narrow end-
he THROWS himself into it- gets STUCK HALFWAY...

The crowd bears down, GRABBING for him as Cobb struggles to
SQUEEZE HIMSELF through the gap... Cobb's moving INCHES as
his pursuers gain YARDS... the Crowd is upon him... he BURSTS
FREE. TUMBLING onto the next street, ROLLING out of sight.

Cobb Jumps to his feet- in a market square. TWO MORE
BUSINESSMEN move towards him. Cobb BOLTS but a CAR SKIDS UP,
BLOCKS HIS PATH- the door opens- SAITO IS IN THE BACK.

                    SAITO
          Care for a lift, Mr. Cobb?

                    COBB
              (jumping in)
          What brings you to Mombasa, Mr.
          Saito?

                    SAITO
          I have to protect my investment.

EXT. COFFEE HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Eames stands on the pavement. The car pulls up. Cobb beckons
from the rear window. Eames looks at Saito. Back to Cobb.

                    EAMES
          This is your idea of losing a tail?
                                                        45.

                    COBB
              (shrugs)
          Different tail.

INT. WORKSHOP - DAY

Arthur sits at the table, working on a mechanism. A small
COUGH prompts him to look up: Ariadne is there.

                    ARTHUR
          He said you'd be back.

                    ARIADNE
          I tried not to come.

                    ARTHUR
          But there's nothing else quite like
          it.

                    ARIADNE
          No paper, no pens... nothing
          between you and raw, direct
          creation.

Arthur picks up his mechanism.

                    ARTHUR
          Shall we take a look at paradoxical
          architecture?

Ariadne nods, takes off her coat and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. PENROSE STEPS - LATER

Arthur leads Ariadne down some busy steps in a large glass
and steel ATRIUM in an office complex.

                    ARTHUR
          You're going to have to master a
          few tricks if you're going to build
          three complete dream levels.

A SECRETARY DROPS some papers as they pass...

                    ARIADNE
          What sort of tricks?

They take a tight turn and continue down the next flight.

                    ARTHUR
          In a dream, you can cheat
          architecture into impossible
          shapes.
                    (MORE)
                                                        46.
                    ARTHUR (CONT'D)
          That lets you create closed loops,
          like the Penrose Steps. The
          infinite staircase.

Ariadne FREEZES- THEY ARE IN THE EXACT SPOT THEY STARTED
DESCENDING FROM, next to the Secretary gathering her papers.

Ariadne puzzles at the impossible construction of the stairs.

                    ARTHUR
          See...

Arthur stops her gently- they are on the highest step, with a
LARGE DROP to the next step. Arthur gestures at the drop.

                    ARTHUR
          Paradox. A closed loop like this
          helps you disguise the boundaries
          of the dream you've created.

                    ARIADNE
          How big do the levels have to be?

                    ARTHUR
          Anything from the floor of a
          building, to an entire city. But it
          has to be complicated enough for us
          to hide from the projections.

                    ARIADNE
          A maze.

                    ARTHUR
          And the better the maze-

                    ARIADNE
          The longer we have before the
          projections catch us.

Ariadne looks around. Sees people LOOKING at Arthur.

                    ARIADNE
          My subconscious seems polite
          enough.

                    ARTHUR
          You wait, they'll turn ugly. No one
          likes to see someone else messing
          around in their mind.

                    ARIADNE
          Cobb can't build anymore, can he?
                                                        47.

                    ARTHUR
          I don't know if he can't, but he
          won't. He thinks it's safer if he
          doesn't know the layouts.

                    ARIADNE
          Why?

                    ARTHUR
          He won't tell me. I think it's Mal.
          I think she's getting stronger.

                    ARIADNE
          His ex-wife?

                    ARTHUR
          She's not his ex.

                    ARIADNE
          They're still together?

Arthur turns to Ariadne. Gentle.

                    ARTHUR
          No. No, she's dead, Ariadne. What
          you see in there is just his
          projection of her.

                    ARIADNE
          What was she like in real life?

                    ARTHUR
              (quiet)
          She was lovely.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT. ROOFTOP, OLD TOWN, MOMBASA - DAY

Saito deposits a FILE in front of Cobb: PHOTOS, DOCUMENTS. As
Cobb runs through them, he passes them to Eames.

                    SAITO
          Robert Fischer, 32. Heir to the
          Fischer Morrow energy conglomerate.
          He's spent his whole life being
          groomed as successor-breaking up
          his father's empire will take a
          radical shift in his thinking.

                    COBB
          What's your problem with Fischer?

                    SAITO
          That's not your concern.
                                                          48.

                    COBB
          This isn't the usual corporate
          espionage, Mr. Saito. This is
          inception. The seed of the idea we
          plant will grow in this man's mind.
          It'll change him. It might even
          come to define him.

Saito looks at Cobb.

                    SAITO
          My sources suggest you might not
          have always been so cautious.

                    COBB
          Then you need new sources, Mr.
          Saito.

Saito considers Cobb. Shrugs.

                    SAITO
          Fischer Morrow has the regulators
          in their pockets. We're the last
          company standing between them and
          total energy dominance and we can
          no longer compete. Soon they'll
          control the energy supply of half
          the world. They'll be able to
          blackmail governments, dictate
          policy. In effect, they become a
          new superpower. The world needs
          Robert Fischer to change his mind.

                    EAMES
          That's where we come in. How's
          Robert Fischer's relationship to
          his father?

                    SAITO
          Rumor is the relationship is
          complicated.

                    COBB
          We'll need more than rumor, Mr.
          Saito.

Eames picks up a photo: a distinguished executive (68).

                     EAMES
          Can you get me access to him?
          Browning. Fischer senior's right-
          hand man. Fischer junior's
          godfather.
                                                        49.

                    SAITO
          It should be possible. If you can
          get the right references.

                    EAMES
          References are something of a
          specialty for me, Mr. Saito.

EXT. DECREPIT BUILDING, MOMBASA - LATER

Eames leads Cobb and Saito down uneven steps to a doorway.

INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

Peeling paint, buzzing flies. They ascend to a dusty,
wire-reinforced glass door which Eames pushes open-



INT. PHARMACY - CONTINUOUS

Row upon row of wooden shelves holding hundreds of dusty
glass bottles of all shapes and colors. At the far end, a
portly 40-year-old man rises from behind his desk, beckoning.
This is YUSUF.

                    YUSUF
          Come, come.

Eames shakes Yusuf's hand. Yusuf stops at Cobb.

                    YUSUF
          Ah, yes. Mr. Cobb. I've heard so
          very much about you.
              (indicates chairs)
          please.

Yusuf chases a CAT off Saito's chair.

                    YUSUF
          Bloody cats.

Yusuf moves to a shelf and runs his fingers over the glass
bottles. None of them has a label.

                    YUSUF
          You work using Somnacin, I think,
          Mr. Cobb?

                    COBB
          You're well informed, Mr. Yusuf.

Yusuf places a bottle on the desk in front of Cobb.
                                                         50.

                    COBB
              (dubious)
          Somnacin?

                    YUSUF
              (proudly)
          Yusuf's Somnacin.

Yusuf pulls the stopper, holds it towards Cobb's nose.

                    COBB
          As good as the real thing?

Yusuf WHIPS the bottle away from Cobb, offended.

                       YUSUF
          Better.

Yusuf holds the bottle to the light, marveling.

                    YUSUF
          Binds the dreamers tight. Let's
          them dream as one. Makes it real.
          Of course, if you'd prefer, you
          could use Somnacin brand. If you
          could explain to the international
          control council what you wanted it
          for.

Yusuf puts the bottle back onto the shelf. Sits.

                    YUSUF
          You are seeking a chemist?
              (Cobb nods)
          To formulate compounds for a job?

                    COBB
          And to come into the held with us.

                    YUSUF
          I rarely go into the held, Mr.
          Cobb.

                    COBB
          We need you there to tailor
          compounds to our particular
          requirements.

                       YUSUF
          Which are?

                    COBB
          Great depth.

                    YUSUF
          A dream within a dream? Two levels?
                                                           51.

                      COBB
          Three.

                    YUSUF
          Not possible. That many dreams
          within dreams would be too
          unstable.

                    COBB
          I've done it before. You just have
          to add a sedative.

                    YUSUF
          A powerful sedative. How many team
          members?

                      COBB
          Five.

                      SAITO
          Six.
              (to Cobb)
          The only way to know you've done
          the job is if I go in with you.

                    COBB
          There's no room for tourists on
          these jobs, Mr. Saito.

                    SAITO
          This time, it would seem there is.

Cobb looks at him, uneasy. Yusuf pulls out another bottle.

                    YUSUF
          Of course. I use it every day.

Yusuf hands it to Cobb, who considers the white liquid
inside.

                      COBB
          For what?

Yusuf beckons them further into the pharmacy, to a METAL
DOOR. He STOPS- second thoughts.

                    YUSUF
          Perhaps... you will not want to
          see.

Cobb motions to continue. Yusuf pulls out a large key.
                                                        52.

INT. BACK ROOM, PHARMACY - CONTINUOUS

A dark room with ROWS of low COTS. Each with a sleeping
occupant. Tubes connect their wrists. An ELDERLY BALD MAN
watches over them.

                    EAMES
              (counting)
          Eighteen, twenty-all connected,
          bloody hell.

                    YUSUF
          They come every day. To share the
          dream.

Yusuf nods at the Elderly Bald Man, who moves to the nearest
bed. Reaches out to the OCCUPANT. Gives his face a FIRM SLAP.
The sleeper does not even stir.

                    YUSUF
          See? Very stable.

                    COBB
          How long do they dream?

                    YUSUF
          Three, four hours. Every day.

                    COBB
          How long in dream time?

                    YUSUF
          With this compound... about forty
          hours. Each and every day.

Saito surveys the room, appalled.

                    SAITO
          Why do they do it?

                    YUSUF
          Tell him, Mr. Cobb.

                    COBB
          After a while...
              (looks at Saito)
          It becomes the only way you can
          dream.

                    YUSUF
          Do you still dream, Mr. Cobb?

Cobb STARES at the sleepers. Uneasy.

                    EAMES
          They come here every day to sleep?
                                                        53.

                       ELDERLY BALD MAN (O.S.)
          No.

Cobb turns to the Elderly Bald Man, who looks fondly at his
dreamers.

                    ELDERLY BALD MAN
          They come to be woken up... the
          dream has become their reality...

The Elderly Bald Man pokes a crooked finger at Cobb's chest.

                    ELDERLY BALD MAN
          And who are you to say otherwise?

Cobb STARES at the Elderly Bald Man. DISTURBED. Cobb turns to
Yusuf. TOSSES him the bottle.

                    COBB
          Let's see what you can do.

INT. SAME - MOMENTS LATER

Cobb is lying on an empty cot, asleep. Yusuf stands over him.
As we move in on Cobb's SLEEPING FACE we hear the sound of a
FREIGHT TRAIN, BUILDING, and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT. WASTELAND - DAY

CLOSE ON Cobb's face as he lies, EYES CLOSED, cheek pressed
to a METAL RAIL- THE SOUND OF THE TRAIN IS DEAFENING- Cobb is
BREATHING, BREATHING, BREATHING, and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. BACK ROOM, PHARMACY - DAY

Cobb's eyes open. Yusuf is watching him.

                       YUSUF
          Sharp, no?

Cobb nods. Gets to his feet, looking around-

INT. BATHROOM, PHARMACY - CONTINUOUS

Cobb SPLASHES water on his face, breathing hard- INSERT CUT:
A CURTAIN BILLOWS. MAL TURNS TO US, HAIR BLOWING, SMILING.
Cobb fumbles in his pockets, pulls out his spinning top. He
tries to set it spinning on the back edge of the sink, but it
FALLS to the floor and rolls towards the door- Saito is
there. WATCHING Cobb. He looks down at the spinning top.
                                                         54.

                    SAITO
          Everything alright, Mr. Cobb?

Cobb dries his face with a paper towel. Picks up his top.

                    COBB
          Everything's fine.

INT. BACK ROOM, WORKSHOP - NIGHT

Close on a small BRASS CHESS PIECE. Ariadne tips it over.
Frowning, she picks up a micro drill, peels back the felt on
the bottom and widens a hole in one side of its base. Tests
the TIPPING POINT again. A NOISE makes her look up.

INT. WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS

Ariadne comes into the main space. Someone is there,
unpacking one of the MECHANISMS. Cobb.

                    ARIADNE
          You're back.

Cobb looks up with a start. Caught out.

                    ARIADNE
          Are you going under on your own?

                    COBB
          I just-I need to test some things.
          I didn't realize anyone was here.

                    ARIADNE
          Just working on my totem.

Ariadne holds up the chess piece. Cobb reaches for it.

                    COBB
          Let me see-

Ariadne SNAPS it out of his reach. Smiles. Cobb nods.

                    COBB
          You're learning.

                    ARIADNE
          It's an elegant solution to keeping
          track of reality. Your invention?

                       COBB
          No. Mal's.

Cobb pulls out his spinning top. Looks at it.
                                                      55.

                    COBB
          This one was hers. She'd spin it in
          a dream and it would never topple.
          Just spin and spin...

                    ARIADNE
          Arthur told me she died.

                    COBB
          She did. How are the mazes coming?

Ariadne indicates three large ARCHITECTURAL MODELS.

                    ARIADNE
          Good. Each level relates to the
          part of the subject's subconscious
          we're trying to access. I'm making
          the bottom level a hospital, so
          that Fischer will bring his father
          there-

                    COBB
          Don't tell me. Remember, you only
          want the dreamer to know the
          layout.

                    ARIADNE
          Why's that so important?

                    COBB
          In case one of us brings in part of
          our subconscious. You wouldn't want
          any projections knowing the layout.

                    ARIADNE
          In case you bring Mal in.

Cobb says nothing.

                    ARIADNE
          You won't build yourself because if
          you know the maze, then she knows
          it. And she'd sabotage the
          operation. You can't keep her out,
          can you?

Cobb says nothing.

                    ARIADNE
          Do the others know?

                     COBB
          No.
                                                        56.

                    ARIADNE
          You have to warn them if it's
          getting worse-

                    COBB
              (gentle)
          I didn't say it's getting worse.
          Look, Ariadne, I need them for this
          job. I need you for this job.
          Without your help, I'll never get
          back to my children. And that's all
          I can care about right now.

                    ARIADNE
          Why can't you go home, Cobb?

Cobb looks at her, deciding what to say.

                    COBB
          They think I killed her.

                    ARIADNE
          How did she die?

Cobb thinks.

INSERT CUT: Mal, wind BLOWING her hair, smiles at Cobb. Now
we see Cobb- SHAKING HIS HEAD, TEARS STREAMING, BEGGING-
                       COBB
          Thank you.

                       ARIADNE
          For what?

                    COBB
          Not asking whether I did.

INT. WORKSHOP - DAY

Ariadne, Arthur, Yusuf, Eames and Saito sit around the room,
looking at FILES. Cobb presides.

                    COBB
          The mark is Robert Fischer, heir to
          the Australian energy conglomerate,
          Fischer Morrow.

Cobb opens a large presentation pad.

                    COBB (reads aloud)
          "I WILL SPLIT UP MY FATHER'S
          EMPIRE."

Cobb turns to the team.
                                                  57.

                    COBB
          An idea Robert Fischer's conscious
          mind would never accept. We have to
          plant it deep in his subconscious.

                      ARTHUR
          How deep?

                    COBB
          Three levels down.

                    ARTHUR
          A dream within a dream within a
          dream? Is that even possible?

                    COBB
          Yes. It is.

                    COBB
          Now, the subconscious motivates
          through emotion, not reason, so we
          have to translate the idea into an
          emotional concept.

                    ARTHUR
          How do you translate a business
          strategy into an emotion?

                    COBB
          That's what we have to figure out.
          Robert and his father have a tense
          relationship. Worse, even, than the
          gossip columns have suggested...

                    EAMES
          Do you play on that? Suggest
          breaking up his father's company as
          a 'screw you' to the old man?

                    COBB
          No. Positive emotion trumps
          negative emotion every time. We
          yearn for people to be reconciled,
          for catharsis. We need positive
          emotional logic.

Eames thinks. Paces. Looking back at the board.

                    EAMES
          Try this... "MY FATHER ACCEPTS THAT
          I WANT TO CREATE FOR MYSELF, NOT
          FOLLOW IN HIS FOOTSTEPS."

                    COBB
          That might work.
                                                         58.

                    ARTHUR
          Might? We'll have to do better than
          that.

                    EAMES
          Thanks for the contribution,
          Arthur.

                    ARTHUR
          Forgive me for wanting a little
          specificity, Eames.

                    COBB
          Inception's not about specificity.
          When we get inside his head, we're
          going to have to work with what we
          find.

Arthur shrugs, frustrated. And we-

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - DAY

The team are in the middle of a DESERTED intersection.
Ariadne is showing Yusuf aspects of the geography.

                    EAMES
          We could split the idea into
          emotional triggers, and use one on
          each level.

                    COBB
          How do you mean?

                    EAMES
          On the top level, we open up his
          relationship with his father....
          Say: "I WILL NOT FOLLOW IN MY
          FATHER'S FOOTSTEPS." Next level
          down we've accessed his ambition
          and self-esteem. We feed him: "I
          WILL CREATE SOMETHING MYSELF."
          Then, the bottom level, we bring
          out the emotional big guns...

                    COBB
          "MY FATHER DOESN'T WANT ME TO BE
          HIM."

                    EAMES
          That could do it.

                    ARTHUR
          How do you produce these emotional
          triggers?
                                                        59.

                    EAMES
          I forge each emotional concept in
          the style and manner of Peter
          Browning, a key figure in Fischer's
          emotional life.

Two AFRICAN PEDESTRIANS wander into view.

                    ARTHUR
          Are those yours?

Eames shakes his head. Cobb turns to Yusuf.

                    ARTHUR
          Yusuf?

                    YUSUF
          Yup. Sorry.

                    COBB
          Suppress them. We don't bring our
          own projections into the dream-we
          let Fischer's subconscious supply
          the people.

                    EAMES
          Saito, when do I get to see
          Browning?

                    SAITO
          You fly out to Sydney on Tuesday.
          We've arranged for you to spend
          several days...

INT. ANTEROOM, MAURICE FISCHER'S OFFICE - DAY

Eames sits in the crowded room. Boxes and files are piled
high. Browning stands by a pair of double doors.

                    SAITO (V.O.)
          ...as part of a consulting
          litigation team working for
          Browning.

                    BROWNING
          I'm not smelling settlement here-we
          take them down.

                    LAWYER
          Mr. Browning, Maurice Fischer's
          policy is always one of avoiding
          litigation-

Browning turns to the lawyer. Calm, but POWERFUL.
                                                           60.

                    BROWNING
          Shall we relay your concerns
          directly to Maurice?

Browning opens the doors to Maurice Fischer's inner office.
Eames leans in to watch as Browning beckons the Lawyer into-

INT. MAURICE FISCHER'S INNER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

The office is a MAKESHIFT HOSPITAL ROOM: a BED where the desk
should be. Browning addresses a figure at the window. ROBERT
FISCHER, 30'S, abstracted.

                       BROWNING
          How is he?

Fischer turns to Browning. Motions silence, as he glances at
his FATHER in the bed. Wheezing gently.

                    BROWNING
          I don't want to bother him
          unnecessarily but I know he-

                     FATHER
          Robert! I've told you to keep out
          the damn!-

MAURICE LASHES OUT, KNOCKING things from his bedside table. A
NURSE calms Maurice as Fischer crouches to retrieve a FRAMED
PHOTOGRAPH. He looks at the photo through the broken glass- a
YOUNG BOY holds a PINWHEEL CLEARLY MADE BY A CHILD (each of
the points is numbered in pen), his FATHER blows on it.

                    BROWNING
          Must be a cherished memory of his-

                    FISCHER
          I put it by his bed. He hasn't even
          noticed.

                    BROWNING
          Robert, we have to talk about a
          power of attorney. I know this is
          hard for you, but it's important
          that we start to think about the
          future-

                    FISCHER
          Not now, Uncle Peter.

Browning looks at Fischer, considering. Biding his time.

                    EAMES (V.O.)
          The vultures are circling. The
          sicker Maurice Fischer becomes, the
          stronger Peter Browning becomes...
                                                         61.

Eames WATCHES Browning, STUDYING his every move .

INT. BATHROOM - DAY

Eames gestures at a mirror, as if offering to shake hands...

                    EAMES (V.O.)
          I've had time to learn Browning's
          physical presence and mannerisms...
In the mirror: BROWNING GESTURES BACK.

INT. WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS

                    EAMES
          Now, in the dream, I can impersonate
          Browning and suggest the concepts to
          Fischer's conscious mind...
              (draws a diagram)
          Then we take Fischer down another
          level and his own subconscious
          feeds it right back to him.

                    ARTHUR
              (impressed)
          So he gives himself the idea.

                    EAMES
          Precisely. That's the only way
          to make it stick. It has to seem
          self-generated.

                    ARTHUR
          Eames, I'm impressed.

                    EAMES
          Your condescension, as always, is
          much appreciated, Arthur.

INT. DESERTED HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

The team sit on the steps of the large marble lobby,
debating. Ariadne is showing Arthur the lobby.

                    EAMES
          He's not scheduled for surgery, no
          dental, nothing.

                    COBB
          I thought he had some knee thing?

                    EAMES
          Nothing they'd put him under for.
          Besides, we need a good ten hours.

          Twelve hours and forty-five
          minutes-one of the longest flights
          in the world. He makes it every two
          weeks...

EXT. AIRFIELD - DAY

Fischer steps out of a black town car and walks across the
tarmac towards a GULF STREAM JET, accompanied by two aides.

                    COBB (V.O.)
          Surely he flies private?

                    SAITO (V.O.)
          Not if there were unexpected
          maintenance with his plane.

Fischer is met at the steps by a DISTRAUGHT FLIGHT OFFICER.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

Cobb chews this over. Arthur comes over.

                    ARTHUR
          It'd have to be a 747.

                      COBB
          Why?

                     ARTHUR
          On a 747 the pilots are up above,
          first class is in the nose so
          nobody walks through the cabin.
          We'd have to buyout the whole
          cabin, and the first class flight
          attendant-

                    SAITO
          We bought the airline.

Everyone turns to Saito.

                    SAITO
          It seemed... neater.

                    COBB
          Neater, huh?
              (gets to his feet)
          Well, now we have ten uninterrupted
          hours.

          Nice lobby, by the way.

INT. WORKSHOP - DAY

The group is back in the workshop, deep in discussion.

                    ARTHUR
          My question is how we go down three
          layers with enough stability. Three
          layers down a little turbulence is
          gonna translate into an earthquake.
          The dreams are gonna collapse with
          the slightest disturbance.

Yusuf clears his throat.

                    YUSUF
          Sedation. For sleep stable enough to
          create three layers of dreaming...

INT. MAKESHIFT LAB - DAY

Yusuf depresses a plunger. Arthur is SLEEPING in a chair.

                    YUSUF (V.O.)
          We will have to combine it with an
          extremely powerful sedative....

Eames SLAPS Arthur, HARD. Arthur does not stir.

INT. WORKSHOP - DAY

Arthur unconsciously rubs his cheek.

                    YUSUF
          The compound we'll be using to
          share the dream is an advanced
          Somnacin derivative. It creates a
          very clear connection between
          dreamers, whilst actually
          accelerating brain function.

                                                  CUT TO:

                    COBB
          Buying us more time in each level.

                    YUSUF
          Brain function in the dream will be
          about twenty times normal.

                                                          64.
                    YUSUF (CONT'D)
          And when you go into a dream within
          that dream the effect is
          compounded.

                    ARIADNE
          How much time?

                    YUSUF
          Three dreams... that's ten hours,
          times twenty, times twenty, times
          twenty...

                    EAMES
          Math was never my strong suit.

                    COBB
          It's basically a week one layer
          down, six months two layers down-

                    ARIADNE
          And ten years in the third level.
          Who wants to spend ten years in a
          dream?

                    YUSUF
          Depends on the dream.

                     EAMES
          It's not going to take us long to
          crack Fischer open once we get
          going. We'll be out in a couple
          days, max.

                     ARTHUR
          How do we get out once we've made
          the plant?
              (to Cobb)
          I hope you've got something a
          little more elegant in mind than
          shooting me in the head like last
          time.

Arthur tilts back in his chair. Yusuf turns to Cobb.

                    COBB
          A kick.

                    ARIADNE
          What's a kick?

Eames slips his foot under Arthur's chair leg. TIPS it-
Arthur's legs SHOOT UP INSTINCTIVELY for balance-

                    EAMES
          That, Ariadne, would be a kick.
                                                          65.

                    COBB
          That feeling of falling which snaps
          you awake. We use that to jolt
          ourselves awake once we're done.

                    ARTHUR
          But how are we going to feel that
          through the sedation?

                    YUSUF
          That's the clever part. I customize
          the sedative...

INT. MAKESHIFT LAB - DAY

Cobb, Eames and Yusuf watch Arthur, ASLEEP, in a chair.

                    YUSUF (O.S.)
          To leave inner ear function
          unimpaired...

Yusuf, with a wicked grin, slowly TIPS Arthur's chair
backwards... as he falls, Arthur's body JERKS, EYES OPENING
just before he HITS the floor.

INT. WORKSHOP - DAY

Arthur thinks, nodding slowly.

                    YUSUF
          That way, however deep the sleep, the
          sleeper will still feel falling...

INT. MAKESHIFT LAB - DAY

Yusuf gleefully LEANS a SLEEPING ARTHUR to one side ...

                    YUSUF (V.O.)
          Or tipping...

Arthur goes down with a CRASH, JERKING AWAKE-

INT. WORKSHOP - DAY

Arthur thinks this through.

                    ARTHUR
          Even that won't cut through three
          layers of deep sleep.

                    COBB
          The trick is to devise a kick for
          each level, then synchronize them
          to get a snap that penetrates all
          three layers.
                                                        66.

Arthur looks at Cobb, getting it.

                    ARTHUR
          We can use the musical countdown to
          synchronize the different kicks.

INT. WORKSHOP - NIGHT

Ariadne comes into the darkened main space. Cobb is lying on
one of the chairs, asleep. Plugged into the mechanism.
Ariadne stands over him. Watching.

Ariadne ascends. She looks at the buttons. Spots the "B." The
elevator STOPS. She looks through the grill at-

INT. YOUNG GIRL'S BEDROOM - DAY

Ariadne pulls back the grill and walks across the room,
considering the dusty furnishings. At the window is a doll's
house, front slightly ajar. Ariadne opens it. Inside is a
SAFE. She tries it. LOCKED. A NOISE STARTLES her- she turns,
looking through a doorway into another room...

INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Ariadne looks into the room to see Cobb and Mal talking,
arguing. A private moment. Mal brushes at Cobb's hair, trying
to convince him. We hear snatches of conversation-

                     MAL
          You remember when you asked me to
          marry you?

                    COBB
          Of course...

                    MAL
          You said you had a dream...

                    COBB
          That we'd grow old together.

                    MAL
          And we can. You know how to find
          me... you know what you have to do.

Cobb is shaking his head, gently. Mal looks into Cobb's eyes-
gentle, loving... Mal SPOTS Ariadne spying on them.
                                                          67.

FREEZES, staring, hostile. Cobb turns, sees Ariadne, moves
towards her, leaving Mal.

                    COBB
          You shouldn't be in here.

Cobb guides her back into the elevator.

                    ARIADNE
          I wanted to know what "tests" you
          need to do on your own every night.

INT. CAGE STYLE ELEVATOR - DAY

Cobb shuts the CAGE DOOR. Ariadne hits a button. The elevator
RISES. Through the GRILL Ariadne can see a BEACH stretching
off into the distance. The elevator stops. Mal sits on the
sand. Beside her, the two children are crouched, away from
us, building a SANDCASTLE.

                    ARIADNE
          Why do you do this to yourself?

                    COBB
          This is the only way I can still
          dream.

                    ARIADNE
          Is it so important to dream?

Cobb stares at his family.

                    COBB
          In my dreams... we're still together.

The kids, WITHOUT TURNING AROUND, jump up and RUN AWAY.

INT. CAGE STYLE ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

The elevator descends.

                    ARIADNE
          But these aren't just dreams, are
          they? They're memories. You said
          never to use memories.

                    COBB
          And I shouldn't.

                    ARIADNE
          You're keeping her alive.

                    COBB
          No.
                                                          68.

                    ARIADNE
          You can't let her go.

                    COBB
          No. These are moments I regret.
          Moments I turned into dreams so I
          could change them.

Ariadne's fingers move across the buttons- stop at the "B."

                    ARIADNE
          What've you got buried down there
          that you regret?

Cobb pushes her hand away. Hits the third floor button.

                    COBB
          There's only one thing I need you
          to understand about me...

INT. KITCHEN, COBB AND MAL'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Ariadne follows Cobb into the kitchen. A THIN MAN is there,
standing by the table. He holds a FOLDED PIECE OF PAPER.

                    ARIADNE
          This is your house?

                    COBB
          Mine and Mal's.

                    ARIADNE
          Where is she?

                    COBB
          She'd already died.

The Thin Man offers Cobb the piece of paper. A CHILD'S SHOUT-
Cobb TURNS. Ariadne follows his gaze to the garden. A small
blonde boy faces away from them, crouched on his haunches to
look at something on the ground.

                    COBB
          It's James. My boy. He's found
          something. Maybe a worm.

A slightly older girl RUNS into view.

                    COBB
          And there's Philippa.

She crouches beside the boy. Their FACES ARE AWAY FROM US.
They point and discuss whatever is on the ground.
                                                        69.

                    COBB
          I thought about calling out, so
          they'd turn and smile those
          incredible smiles... but I'm out of
          time-

The Thin Man thrusts the paper into Cobb's hand.

                    THIN MAN
          Right now. Or never, Cobb.

Cobb nods, turns from the window-

                    COBB
          Then I panic that I'll always wish
          I'd seen them turn, that I can't
          waste this chance...

Cobb TURNS BACK to call out- but the children RACE OFF...

                    COBB
          But the moment's passed. And
          whatever I do, the dream's always
          the same... When I'm about to
          call... they run.

Cobb watches them run off, calling for grandma, FACES UNSEEN.

                    COBB
          If I'm going to see their faces
          again-I've got to get back here in
          the real world...

Behind him, Ariadne SLAMS the grill shut. Cobb TURNS.

INT. CAGE STYLE ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

Ariadne hits the BASEMENT button. The elevator starts to
DESCEND. ariadne STARES, fascinated as glimpses of floors
slip past: Mal's childhood bedroom, a thundering wall of
freight train... The elevator STOPS. Through the grill
Ariadne sees a HOTEL SUITE. She pulls open the grill, steps
cautiously out into-

INT. ELEGANT HOTEL SUITE - CONTINUOUS (NOW NIGHT)

DISHEVELED bedclothes, UPENDED room service table,
STRAWBERRIES across the floor. A STRUGGLE. Ariadne steps
forwards- SMASH- she looks down to see that she has kicked
over a CHAMPAGNE FLUTE. Ariadne feels a draught. The CURTAIN
BILLOWS.

                    MAL (O.S.)
          What are you doing here?

Ariadne TURNS. Mal is there.
                                                        70.

                    ARIADNE
          My name is-

                    MAL
          I know who you are. What are you
          doing here?

                    ARIADNE
          I don't know. Trying to understand.

                    MAL
          How could you understand? Do you
          know what it is to be a lover? To
          be half of a whole?

                    ARIADNE
          No.

Mal moves slowly towards Ariadne...

                    MAL
          I'll tell you a riddle. You're
          waiting for a train. A train that
          will take you far away. You know
          where you hope this train will take
          you, but you don't know for sure...

Mal glides around Ariadne, looking her over.

                    MAL
          But... it doesn't matter. How can
          it not matter to you where that
          train will take you?

                    COBB (O.S.)
          Because you'll be together.

Cobb is standing in the elevator. Mal nods. Looks at him.

                    MAL
          How could you bring her here, Dom?

                    ARIADNE
          What is this place?

                    COBB
          A hotel. We spent our anniversaries
          in this suite.

                    ARIADNE
          What happened here?

Mal picks up the BROKEN STEM of a champagne flute...
                                                        71.

INT. CAGE STYLE ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

Cobb PULLS Ariadne into the elevator- Mal THROWS herself
towards Ariadne- Cobb SLAMS the GRILL- Mal SMASHES against it
AGAIN and AGAIN like a WILD ANIMAL- Ariadne FLINCHES-

                     MAL
          you PROMISED! YOU SAID WE'D BE
          TOGETHER!-

                    COBB
          We can. We will. But I need you to
          stay here for now-

                    MAL
          YOU SAID WE'D GROW OLD TOGETHER!-

Cobb pushes a button and the elevator starts to rise.

                    COBB
          I'll come back. I need you to stay
          here on your own for now. Just
          while I do this job. Then we can be
          together-

                    MAL
          WE'LL BE TOGETHER-YOU PROMISED!-

Mal THROWS herself against the grill, and. we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. WORKSHOP - NIGHT

Ariadne watches Cobb sleeping. His eyes gradually flicker
open. He sees her watching him.

                    ARIADNE
          You think you can just build a
          prison of memories to lock her in?
          You think that's going to contain
          her?

The LIGHTS COME ON: Saito and Arthur stand in the doorway.

                    SAITO
          Maurice Fischer just died in Sydney.

                    COBB
          When's the funeral?

                    SAITO
          Thursday. In Los Angeles.
                                                        72.

                    COBB
          Robert'll accompany the body
          Tuesday at the outside. We have to
          move.

Cobb gets up. Ariadne comes over to him.

                    ARIADNE
              (low)
          I'm coming with you.

                    COBB
          No. I promised Miles.

                    ARIADNE
          The team needs someone in there who
          understands what you're struggling
          with. If you don't want it to be me
          then you need to show Arthur what I
          just saw.

Cobb looks at Ariadne. Turns to Saito.

                    COBB
          We need one more seat on the plane.

INT. DEPARTURE GATE, SYDNEY - DAY

Saito stands looking out the window at a 747. Cobb arrives
beside him. They watch a COFFIN being loaded.

                    COBB
          If I get on this plane and you
          haven't taken care of things...
          when we land I go to jail for the
          rest of my life.

                    SAITO
          Complete the job en route, I make
          one phone call from the plane...
          you will have no trouble clearing
          immigration.

INT. FIRST CLASS CABIN, 747 - CONTINUOUS

The luxurious cabin has only ten seats. Cobb finds his- sees
Ariadne in the seat behind his. They do not acknowledge each
other. Behind her is Arthur, looking out the window. Eames
enters, STUFFS his bag into the overhead bin, BLOCKING the
passenger behind: ROBERT FISCHER, standing there, patient,
bag in hand, wearing black.

                       EAMES
          Oh, sorry.
                                                          73.

Eames SQUEEZES up against his seat to let Fischer BRUSH PAST.
Fischer moves to his seat, directly in front of Cobb. Eames
TOSSES Cobb a PASSPORT. Cobb flips it open: Fischer's.
Pockets it. Yusuf and Saito enter, take their seats.

EXT. RUNWAY - MOMENTS LATER

The 747 HURTLES down the runway.

INT. FIRST CLASS CABIN, 747 - MOMENTS LATER

Cobb looks down at his hand: a TINY VIAL taped to the center
of his palm. He removes the cap. The seatbelt sign goes dark.
Cobb unbuckles, stands.

                       COBB
          Excuse me?

Fischer looks up.

                       FISCHER
          Yes?

                    COBB
          I think this is yours...

Cobb holds up the open passport, comparing the picture to
Fischer. Fischer's hand goes to his pocket. Cobb hands
Fischer the passport.

                    FLIGHT ATTENDANT
          Would you gentlemen care for a
          drink?

                       FISCHER
          Water.

                       COBB
          Same.

Fischer gives Cobb a thin smile. Holds up his passport.

                    FISCHER
          Well, thank you.

                    COBB
          No problem. Look, I couldn't help
          noticing your name. You're not
          related to Maurice Fischer?

Fischer takes a beat. But Cobb seems harmless.

                    FISCHER
          Actually, he was my father.
                                                        74.

                    COBB
          I'm very sorry for your loss. He
          was an inspiring figure.

The Flight Attendant brings their drinks- Cobb takes them.

                    COBB
          Thanks.

As he turns to Fischer he LOWERS his right hand ... a CLEAR
LIQUID DROPS into Fischer's water as Cobb hands it to him.

                    COBB
          To Maurice Fischer.
              (they drink)
          I'll leave you in peace.

Fischer grants him a smile.

EXT. 747 - LATER

The great plane SOARS through a burning cloudscape.

INT. FIRST CLASS CABIN, 747 - MOMENTS LATER

Cobb reaches into the overhead for a blanket- lets it fall
onto Fischer's head- Fischer doesn't flinch. ASLEEP. Cobb
SIGNALS the others. The First Flight Attendant unlocks a
CUPBOARD in the galley, then leaves, closing the curtain.
Arthur moves into the galley and pulls out a MECHANISM CASE.

Cobb and Arthur open the mechanism- uncoil the tubes- feed
them around the window side of each of the seats. Arthur
rolls up Fischer's cuff- PUSHES the needle cap into Fischer's
wrist. Arthur pulls Fischer's cuff down and hides the tubes
behind the armrest of Fischer's seat.

Arthur runs the next tube to Ariadne. Cobb puts the case on
Yusuf's lap. Yusuf checks the TIMERS, tapping the syringes.
The others recline their seats. Yusuf HITS A BUTTON- closes
the case- places it at his feet. He settles back, and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. SEDAN - DAY

Cobb DRIVES. Saito and Arthur are in the back. Rain BEATS
down. Cobb pulls over-

EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - CONTINUOUS

Yusuf stands on the corner, silver briefcase in hand, collar
turned up against the rain. He reaches for the door.
                                                          75.

INT. SEDAN - CONTINUOUS

Yusuf clambers into the back, brushing rain from his face.

                    ARTHUR
              (indicates rain)
          Couldn't you have peed before you
          went under?

                       YUSUF
          Sorry.

The front door OPENS and Eames climbs in, soaked.

                    EAMES
          Bit too much free champagne before
          takeoff, Yusuf?

                    YUSUF
          Ha bloody ha.

                    COBB
          At least we know he'll be looking
          for a cab in this.

INT./EXT. SEDAN ON RAINY NEW YORK STREETS - CONTINUOUS

Cobb pulls out into the heavy traffic. He weaves around
several cars before lining up behind a YELLOW CAB.

                    COBB
          Brace yourselves.

Cobb hits the gas- REAR ENDS the cab with a CRUNCH. The
CABDRIVER gets out, fuming. Heads to Cobb's window-

                    CABDRIVER
          Hey, asshole! Why don't you try
          driving without your thumb up-

He sees the SILENCED PISTOL Cobb is holding at his belly.

                       COBB
          Walk away.

The Cabdriver backs off. Arthur climbs into the cab. Both
cars pull away.

INT./EXT. CAB ON RAINY NEW YORK STREETS - CONTINUOUS

Arthur SLOWS in front of the TRAIN STATION, peering at the
pedes pedestrians. He SPOTS Fischer, lights the cab's sign.
Fischer FLAGS him down. Fischer JUMPS into the back, brushing
rain from his shoulders.
                                                           76.

                    FISCHER
          Third and Market. Snappy.

Eames JUMPS in from the other side.

                    FISCHER
          What're you doing?

                    EAMES
          Sorry, I thought it was free. Maybe
          we could share.

                       FISCHER
          Maybe not.

Saito gets into the front passenger seat. Pointing a gun.

                       FISCHER
          Great.

Arthur pulls away. Fischer pulls out his wallet and tosses it
at Eames.

                    FISCHER
              (contemptuous)
          There's 500 dollars in there. And
          the wallet's worth more than that.
          For that you ought to at least drop
          me at my stop.

Eames smiles at this.

                    EAMES
          I'm afraid-

A SHOT SHATTERS the window by Eames's head- another SHOT
IMPACTS by Saito-

                    EAMES
          Get us out of here!

Arthur hits the gas, but a BLACK S.U.V. SKIDS sideways in
front, BLOCKING the path-

A BLOCK BEHIND- Cobb is at a light. ARIADNE is getting in the
front. Cobb has HEARD the GUNFIRE-

                       COBB
          Come on!-

Cobb looks ahead to the AMBUSH, hits the gas- the sedan
ROCKETS forwards... but BAM- A FREIGHT TRAIN CLIPS THE FRONT
OF THE SEDAN, SHOVING IT SIDEWAYS AS AN ENDLESS TRAIN BARRELS
PAST, A WALL BETWEEN COBB AND THE AMBUSH-
                                                           77.

A SECOND S.U.V. is behind the cab- PLAIN CLOTHES SECURITY MEN
advance through the traffic, weapons trained on the cab.
Bullets RIP into the cab as Eames throws himself on top of
Fischer, PULLING a SACK over his head-

Inside the sedan, Ariadne watches the train passing-

                    ARIADNE
          This wasn't in the design-

Cobb BACKS UP, SPINS around, heading for the tail of the
train-

A Security Man emerges from the front S.U.V. carrying an
AUTOMATIC RIFLE- he steps towards the cab through the rain,
raises his weapon and BLASTS THE CAB'S WINDSCREEN-

Cobb clears the end of the train, and SKIDS across the tracks-

Arthur CROUCHES down- PUSHES the accelerator with his HAND-
YANKS the wheel- FLYING BLIND. The cab NAILS the Security
Man, CRUNCHING into the front S.U.V.-

Cobb SMASHES his car into the rear S.U.V., creating a GAP-

Arthur YANKS the transmission and REVERSES- SCRAPING through
the gap- Security Men DIVE out of the way- Arthur throws a
ragged J-turn to head down a SIDE STREET- Cobb follows in the
other car. Rain whips across Arthur's face as he BREATHES-

                    ARTHUR
          Everybody okay? Saito?

Arthur looks at Saito. Saito's hand is at his belly. Covered
in BLOOD.

EXT. WAREHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

The sedan and cab pull into the side entrance- Eames jumps
out- PULLS the shutter down behind them-

INT. WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Yusuf and Eames PULL Fischer from the cab, HUSTLING him
through a doorway. Cobb JUMPS out of the sedan, furious.

                    COBB
          Arthur! Arthur what the-

Arthur pulls the bloody Saito from the front seat.

                    COBB
          Oh, Christ. Is he dying?
                                        78.

          ARTHUR
I don't know. What happened back
there? Where were you?

          COBB
We were blocked by a freight train.

          ARTHUR
    (to Ariadne)
Why would you put a train crossing
in a downtown intersection?

             ARIADNE
I didn't.

          COBB
    (snaps)
Why were we all ambushed, Arthur?!
Those weren't regular projections-
they'd been trained!

          ARIADNE
How could they be trained?

          ARTHUR
Fischer's had an extractor teach
his mind to defend itself. His
subconscious is militarized. It
should've shown on the research-

          COBB
So why the hell didn't it?!

             ARTHUR
Calm down.

          COBB
Don't tell me to calm down-you were
meant to check Fischer's background
thoroughly. You can't make this
kind of mistake-we're not prepared
for this kind of violence-

          ARTHUR
Cobb, we've dealt with sub-security
before. We just have to be more-

          COBB
This wasn't part of the plan, Arthur!
    (points at Saito)
He's dying!

          EAMES
So we put him out of his misery.
                                                          79.

Eames steps into the room, pulls his gun and moves over
Saito.

                    COBB
          No.

                    EAMES
          He's in agony. Let's wake him up-

Cobb GRABS Eames's arm.

                    COBB
          No!
              (they lock eyes)
          It won't wake him up.

                    EAMES
          What do you mean, it won't wake
          him? When you die in a dream you
          wake up.

                    YUSUF
          Not from this. We're too heavily
          sedated to wake up that way.

Eames looks at Yusuf, then to Cobb.

                    EAMES
          So what happens if one of us dies?

                    COBB
          That person doesn't wake up. Their
          mind drops into Limbo.

                    ARIADNE
          Limbo?

                    ARTHUR
          Unconstructed dream space.

                    ARIADNE
          What's down there?

                    ARTHUR
          Raw, infinite subconscious. Nothing
          there but what was left behind by
          anyone on the team who's been trapped
          there before. On this team... just
          Cobb.

                    ARIADNE
          How long would we be stuck there?
                                                        80.

                    YUSUF
          You couldn't even think about
          trying to escape until the sedation
          eases-

                      EAMES
          How long?

                    YUSUF
          Decades-it could be infinite-I
          don't know! Ask him-he's the one
          who's been there before!

Eames moves to Cobb. Looks him in the eye.

                    EAMES
          Great. So now we're stuck in
          Fischer's mind battling it out with
          his private army, and if we get hit
          we're stuck in Limbo 'til our
          brains dissolve into scrambled egg?

Cobb says nothing. Saito groans more loudly.

                    ARTHUR
          Let's just get him upstairs.

INT. OFFICE, WAREHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Saito is laid out on an old desk. Arthur examines him. He
motions to Ariadne. Eames watches Cobb.

                    ARTHUR
          Hold this. Firm pressure.

Arthur turns to Cobb.

                    ARTHUR
          You knew the risks and you didn't
          tell us.

                    COBB
          There wasn't meant to be any risk.
          We weren't supposed to be dealing
          with a load of gunnre.

                    ARTHUR
          You had no right.

                    COBB
          It's the only way you can go three
          layers deep, Arthur.

Arthur turns to Yusuf, hostile.
                                                81.

                    ARTHUR
          And you. You went along with this?

                    YUSUF
          I trusted him.

                    ARTHUR
          You trusted him? When? When he
          promised you half his share?

                    YUSUF
              (offended)
          No! His whole share. Plus, he told
          me he'd done it before.

Arthur turns to Cobb.

                    ARTHUR
          Oh, yeah? With Mal? That worked out
          great, didn't it, Cobb?

Cobb grabs Arthur.

                    COBB
          You don't know anything about that.
          This was the only way to do this
          job, Arthur. I did what I had to do
          to get back to my children.

                    EAMES
          So you led us into a war zone with
          no way out.

                    COBB
          We have a way out. The kick. We
          just have to push on, do the job as
          fast as possible and get out using
          the kick.

                    EAMES
          Forget it. We go any deeper, we
          just raise the stakes. I'm sitting
          it out on this level.

                    COBB
          You'll never make it, Eames.
          Fischer's security is surrounding
          this place as we speak. The ten
          hours of the flight is a week at
          this level-you'll never make it
          without getting killed. Downwards
          is the only way forwards. We have
          to carry on.

Saito groans. Cobb looks at him-
                                                           82.

                    COBB
          And we have to do it fast.

Eames and Arthur weigh this.

                    COBB
          Eames, go get ready. Arthur, let's
          get in there and soften him up.

INT. BATHROOM, WAREHOUSE - LATER

Cobb and Arthur, wearing BALACLAVAS, PULL the sack from
Fischer's head. He is chained to the radiator.

                    FISCHER
          I'm insured against kidnapping up
          to ten million-this'll be simple-

                    COBB
          No, it won't.

Fischer looks at Cobb, unnerved.

                    ARTHUR
          In. your lather's office, below the
          bookshelves, is his personal safe.
          We need the combination.

                    FISCHER
          I never noticed a safe-

                    COBB
          Doesn't mean you don't know the
          combination.

                    FISCHER
          Well, I don't.

                    ARTHUR
          We have it on good authority that
          you do.

                    FISCHER
          Whose?

INT. OFFICE, WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Yusuf looks through Fischer's wallet. Eames is opening a
HINGED, THREE-WING MIRROR.

                    YUSUF
          Five hundred dollars, this cost?

                    EAMES
          What's inside?
                                                        83.

                    YUSUF
          Cash, cards, ID... and this-

Yusuf holds up a SNAPSHOT: the photo from Maurice Fischer's
office- YOUNG ROBERT holds his HOMEMADE PINWHEEL, his FATHER
blows on it. Eames takes it from Yusuf. STUDIES it. Cobb
enters. Eames hands him the snapshot.

                    EAMES
          Useful?

Cobb studies the snapshot. Eames examines himself in the
hinged mirror from multiple angles: ONE BY ONE the myriad
Eames reflections BECOME BROWNINGS. Cobb pockets the photo.

                    COBB
          You're on. You've got an hour.

                    EAMES
          An hour? I was supposed to have all
          night to crack him.

                    COBB
          And Saito was supposed to keep his
          guts on the inside. You've got an
          hour-get something we can use.

Eames turns from the mirror AS BROWNING. He glances at his
watch, then SCREAMS, as if begging for mercy-

INT. BATHROOM, WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Browning's CRY reverberates- Fischer looks up, concerned-

                    FISCHER
          What's that?

                    ARTHUR
          Good authority.

Another cry rings out. Fischer recognizes the voice.

                    FISCHER
          Uncle Peter?! Make them stop-

                    ARTHUR
          The combination.

                    FISCHER
          I don't know it!

                    ARTHUR
          Why would Browning tell us you did?

                    FISCHER
          Let me talk to him-I'll find out.
                                                        84.

INT. BATHROOM, WAREHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Cobb pushes Browning (Eames), bloody and bruised, into the
room and forces him down next to Fischer. Cobb handcuffs
Browning's wrist to a metal bracket on the side of the sink.

                    COBB
          You've got an hour. Get talking.

Cobb leaves.

                    BROWNING (EAMES)
          They've had me for two days.
          They've got someone with access to
          your father's office and they're
          trying to open his safe-they
          thought I'd know the combination,
          but I don't-

                    FISCHER
          Neither do I, Uncle Peter.

                    BROWNING
              (confused)
          Maurice told me that after he
          passed only you would be able to
          open it.

                    FISCHER
          He never gave me the combination.

Browning thinks for a minute. Realizes something.

                    BROWNING
          He did, he just didn't tell you
          that it was a combination.

                    FISCHER
          What, then?

                    BROWNING
          Something only you would know. Some
          meaningful combination of numbers
          from your experiences with Maurice-

                    FISCHER
          We didn't have a lot of meaningful
          experiences together.

                    BROWNING
          Perhaps after your mother died...

                    FISCHER
          After my mother died, I went to him
          in my grief.
                    (MORE)
                                                        85.
                    FISCHER (CONT'D)
          You know what he told me? "There's
          really nothing to be said, Robert."

                     BROWNING
          He always had a hard time with
          emotional-

                    FISCHER
          I was eleven, Uncle Peter.

Browning (Eames) takes this in.

                    BROWNING
          He loved you, Robert. In his way.

                    FISCHER
          "In his way?" At the end he called
          me to his deathbed. He could barely
          speak, but he took the trouble to
          say one last thing to me. He pulled
          me close... I could make out only
          one word. "Disappointed."

Browning can say nothing.

INT. OFFICE, WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Cobb pulls off his balaclava. Looks down at Saito, who is
breathing fast, shallow.

                    COBB
          How's he doing?

                    ARIADNE
          He's in a lot of pain.

Cobb takes Saito's hand. Looks him in the eye.

                    COBB
          When we get you down to the next
          level, the pain will be less
          intense.

Saito nods, breathing hard.

                    ARIADNE
              (low)
          And if he dies?

                    COBB
          His conscious mind will drop out of
          the dream. He'll be trapped in
          Limbo for a lifetime...

                    ARIADNE
          What will that do to him?
                                                           86.

Cobb looks at her. Grave.

                    COBB
          When he wakes... his mind could be
          completely gone.

                    SAITO
          When... when we wake I will still
          honor our arrangement...

Cobb looks down at Saito sadly.

                    COBB
          Saito-san, when you wake you might
          not even remember that we had an
          arrangement. You'll have forgotten
          this world. Limbo will be your
          reality. Lost there so long, you'll
          have become an old man...

                    SAITO
          Filled with regret?

                    COBB
          Waiting to die alone. Yes.

                    SAITO
          Then I'll take the chance and come
          back. And we'll be young men
          together again.

Saito smiles weakly. Cobb nods at him, turns to Ariadne.

                    ARIADNE
          When were you trapped in Limbo?

Cobb says nothing. Ariadne pulls him away from Saito.

                    ARIADNE
          Cobb, you might have convinced the
          rest of this team to carry on with
          the job. But they don't know the
          truth.

                    COBB
          What truth?

                    ARIADNE
          The truth that at any minute you
          might bring a freight train through
          the wall. The truth that Mal is
          bursting up through your
          subconscious.

                    ARIADNE (CONT'D)
          The truth that as we go deeper into
          Fischer, we're also going deeper
          into you-and I'm not sure we're
          going to like what we find there.

Cobb stares back at Ariadne. Saying nothing.

                    ARIADNE
          This is not just about Fischer,
          it's about you. Tell me what
          happened to you and Mal. Trapped in
          Limbo.

Cobb looks at her. Thinking it through.

                    COBB
          We were on a job. Exploring dreams
          within dreams. But we didn't
          understand how your mind can turn
          hours into years. How you can get
          trapped. Trapped so deep that when
          you wash up on the shore of your
          subconscious...

Cobb pauses before he answers. Looks at Ariadne.

Ariadne stares at him, incredulous.

          It's not so bad at first, being

          it's not real. It became impossible
          for me to live like that.
                                                        88.

                    ARIADNE
          But not for her?

                    COBB
          She accepted it. At some point...

INSERT CUT:

INT. MAL'S CHILDHOOD HOME - DAY

Mal opens a DOLL'S HOUSE. Inside is a SAFE. She opens it- it
is empty. She pulls out her SPINNING TOP.

                    COBB (V.O.)
          ...she'd decided to forget that our
          world wasn't real.

Mal places the top inside the safe. LOCKS IT AWAY...
INT. OFFICE, WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

                    ARIADNE
          And when you finally woke up?

                    COBB
          To wake from that. From decades
          lived. To be old souls thrown back
          into youth. It was hard. At first
          Mal seemed okay. But I started to
          realize something was wrong.
          Finally she admitted it. This idea
          she was possessed by. This simple
          little idea that changed
          everything...

                    ARIADNE
          What was it?

                    COBB
          That our world was not real. No
          matter what I did, no matter what I
          said, she was convinced that we
          were still in a dream. That we
          needed to wake up again...

INT. COBB AND MAL'S KITCHEN - DAY (FLASHBACK)

Cobb is trying to calm Mal, who is hysterical.

                     COBB (V.O.)
          That to get home we'd have to kill
          ourselves.

INT. WORKSHOP - DAY

Ariadne looks at Cobb, appalled.
                                                          89.

                    ARIADNE
          What about your children?

Cobb has to look away.

                    COBB
          She... she believed they weren't
          real. That our real children were
          waiting. Somewhere above...

INT. COBB AND MAL'S KITCHEN - DAY (FLASHBACK)

Mal shakes her head at Cobb as he USHERS the children out of
the room, FACES UNSEEN-

                    COBB
          Calm down, Mal-

                    MAL
          They're projections, Dom. Your
          dreams. I'm their mother-don't you
          think I can tell the difference?

Cobb closes the door- turns to her, eyes full of bitter
tears.

                    COBB
          If it's my dream then why can't I
          control it? Why can't I stop this?

                    MAL
              (it's obvious)
          You don't know you're dreaming.

                    COBB
          You keep telling me I am-

                    MAL
          And you don't believe me!

                    COBB (V.O.)
          She was certain. But she loved me
          too much to go without me. So she
          made a plan...

INT. ELEGANT HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

Cobb walks along, checking door numbers against a key.

                    COBB (V.O.)
          For our anniversary...

INT. ELEGANT HOTEL SUITE - CONTINUOUS (FLASHBACK)

Cobb enters the lavish suite. He notices the DISHEVELED
BEDCLOTHES.
                                                          90.

He steps forwards- SMASH- he has tipped over a champagne
glass with his foot... dinner for two is SPREAD ACROSS THE
FLOOR. He looks at the DEBRIS, confused... next to the broken
glass is a SPINNING TOP. He picks it up, studying it,
thinking. He feels a draught, looks to the window. The
CURTAIN BILLOWS.

EXT. EXTERIOR ATRIUM - CONTINUOUS (FLASHBACK)

Cobb looks out the window: Mal sits on the ledge of the
opposite window. HAIR BLOWING. Feet dangling over the
dizzyingly high atrium. She smiles.

                     MAL
          Join me.

                    COBB
          Mal, come back inside.

                    MAL
          No. I'm going to jump. And you're
          coming with me.

                    COBB
          No, I'm not. This is real-if you
          jump, you're not going to wake up,
          you're going to die. Let's go back
          inside and talk about this, please.

                    MAL
          We've talked enough.

She KICKS off a shoe and watches it DROP.

                    MAL
          Come out onto the ledge or I'll
          jump right now.

She means it. Cobb swings his legs out, sitting on the ledge
opposite is wife. He looks down at the drop.

                    MAL
          I'm asking you to take a leap of
          faith.

                    COBB
          I can't do that, Mal. I can't leave
          our children.

                    MAL
          If I go without you, they'll take
          them away, anyway.

                    COBB
          What do you mean?
                                                           91.

                     MAL
          I filed a letter with our attorney.
          Explaining how I'm fearful for my
          safety, how you've threatened to
          kill me...

Cobb looks back at the wrecked hotel suite, PANICKING...

                    MAL (CONT'D)
          I love you, Dom. I've freed you
          from the guilt of choosing to leave
          them. We're going home to our real
          children.

                    COBB
          Out children are here, Mal.

Mal CLOSES HER EYES. Cobb looks for some way to reach her...

                    MAL
          You're waiting for a train...

                    COBB
          NO! MAL, NO, I CAN'T!

                    MAL
          A train that will take you far
          away...

                    COBB
          DON'T DO THIS!

                    MAL
          You know where you hope this train
          will take you, you can't know for
          sure...

                    COBB
          DON'T!

                    MAL
          But it doesn't matter...

                    COBB
          NO!

                    MAL
          Because you'll be together...

Mal SLIPS FORWARD INTO SPACE. Cobb SCREAMS after her. Then
tries to bury his face in the wall...

INT. OFFICE, WAREHOUSE - DAY

Cobb stares as he remembers.
                                                           92.

                    COBB
          He letter to the authorities
          refuted all the claims about her
          sanity that she knew I'd make...

INT. COBB AND MAL'S KITCHEN - DAY (FLASHBACK)

Cobb stands with the Thin Man, who has a piece of paper.

                    COBB (V.O.)
          She'd had herself declared sane by
          three different psychiatrists.

Cobb hears a SHOUT- turns to the garden. James CROUCHES,
Philippa joins him, examining the ground, FACES UNSEEN...

                    COBB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          It was impossible for me to explain
          the nature of her madness...

The Thin Man thrusts the paper into Cobb's hand.

                    THIN MAN
          Right now. Or never, Cobb.

Cobb turns back to the window- about to call out- James and
Philippa RUN OFF. Cobb turns from the window. Looks at the
paper in his hand. It is an AIRPLANE TICKET.

                    COBB (V.O.)
          So I ran. And I've been running
          ever since, trying to buy my way
          back to my family...

INT. OFFICE, WAREHOUSE - DAY

Cobb looks across at Ariadne.

                    ARIADNE
          Psychiatrists judged her sane?

                    COBB
          She was sane. She was just lost in
          the labyrinth.

                    ARIADNE
          Then why should you blame yourself?

                    COBB
          Because we were a family. And we
          had a life I would do anything to
          get back to now. But that reality
          wasn't enough for me then.
                                                        93.

                    ARIADNE
          It might have been your idea to
          push the limits, Cobb. But you're
          not responsible for the idea that
          destroyed her. The idea that her
          world wasn't real... that was her
          own idea from her own mind.

Cobb says nothing.

                    ARIADNE (CONT'D)
          Your guilt defines her. Powers her.
          If we're going to succeed in this,
          you're going to have to forgive
          yourself, and you're going to have
          to confront her. But you don't have
          to do it alone.

                    COBB
          You don't have to do this for me-

                    ARIADNE
          I'm doing it for the others. They
          don't know the risk they've taken
          coming in here with you.

Cobb looks at the rooftop opposite, sees a SNIPER take up a
position. Cobb shakes his head, frustrated.

                    COBB
          We can't stay here. Arthur?!

INT. BATHROOM, WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Browning puts his hand on Fischer's shoulder.

                    BROWNING
          These people are going to kill us
          if we don't give them the
          combination.

                    FISCHER
          They won't, they'll try to ransom
          us-

                    BROWNING
          I heard them-they're going to lock
          us in and run the can into the
          river.

                    FISCHER
          What is in the safe?
                                                           94.

                    BROWNING
          Something for you. Maurice always
          said it was his most previous
          gift... a will.

                    FISCHER
          Maurice's will is with Port and
          Dunn.

                    BROWNING
          It's an alternate. It supersedes
          the other only if you want it to.

                    FISCHER
          What does it say?

                    BROWNING
          It splits all the component
          businesses of Fischer Morrow into
          individual companies, transferring
          ownership to the boards of those
          companies...

                    FISCHER
          Leaving me nothing?

                    BROWNING
          A basic living. Nothing more. The
          entire empire would cease to exist.

                    FISCHER
          Destroy my own inheritance? Why
          would he suggest such a thing?

                    BROWNING
          I don't know, Robert.

Cobb OPENS the door. Arthur is behind him.

                    COBB
          Come to your senses?

                    FISCHER
          Let us go. I don't know the
          combination. Not consciously.

Cobb considers this. Opens his phone. Pulls out his gun.

                    COBB
          Let's try instinctively. I have
          someone standing in your father's
          office ready to tap in a
          combination.

He holds the phone to Fischer's mouth.
                                                           95.

                    COBB (CONT'D)
          First six numbers that come into
          your head. Right now.

                    FISCHER
          I have no idea-

Cobb SWINGS the gun onto Browning-

                       COBB
          RIGHT NOW!

                    FISCHER
          Five, two, eight... four, nine,
          one.

Cobb lowers his weapon. Listens to the phone. Shakes his
head. Shuts the phone.

                    COBB
          You'll have to do better. Bag `em.

Arthur puts SACKS over their heads.

INT. WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Cobb and Arthur drag Fischer and Browning to the van-

                    FISCHER
          We're worth much more to you
          alive...

Arthur places Fischer on the back seat- uses a DROPPER to
drop LIQUID onto Fischer's mask- his head SLUMPS FORWARDS.
"Browning" yanks the sack from his head- it is now EAMES.

                    EAMES
              (excited)
          His relationship with his father's
          much worse that we thought.

                    ARTHUR
          That helps us?

Arthur pulls a SNIPER RIFLE from a case by the van.

                    COBB
          The stronger the issues, the more
          powerful the catharsis.

Cobb motions for Yusuf to follow his upstairs.

                    ARTHUR
          But how do you reconcile them if
          they're that estranged?
                                                           96.

                    EAMES
          I'm working on that.

Arthur lines up a shot through the window-

                    ARTHUR
          Well, work fast-Fischer's
          projections are closing in quick,
          we need to break out of here before
          we're totally boxed in...

Arthur SHOOTS two snipers. Cobb and Yusuf gently load Saito
into the van. He groans. Ariadne straps him in, checks his
bandages. Arthur can't get the last sniper- he's too hidden
behind a wall-

                    EAMES
          Shouldn't be afraid to dream a
          little bigger, Arthur-

Eames lines up a shot with a grenade launcher. Fires- the
sniper EXPLODES into the air- Arthur looks at Eames.

                      EAMES (CONT'D)
          Shall we?

They climb into the van-

INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY STREETS - CONTINUOUS

The van pulls out into the rain-drenched streets. Arthur
opens the mechanism case and hands out tubes-

                    COBB
          Shifting Fischer's antipathy from
          his father onto Browning should
          work.

                    EAMES
          We need the imagery, the words...

                    ARIADNE
          So you destroy his one positive
          relationship?

                    COBB
          No. We repair his relationship with
          his father and expose his
          godfather's true nature.

                    EAMES
          Hell, we should be charging Fischer
          as much as Saito.
                                                        97.

                    ARTHUR
          What about his security? It's going
          to get worse as we go deeper.

                    COBB
          We bring in Mr. Charles.

                       ARTHUR
          No.

                    EAMES
          Who's Mr. Charles?

                    ARTHUR
          A bad idea.

                    COBB
          Arthur, the second we approach
          Fischer in that hotel, they're
          gonna mow us down-we run with Mr.
          Charles like on the Stein job.

                    EAMES
          So you've done it before?

                    ARTHUR
          Sure. But it didn't work. The
          subject realized he was dreaming
          and his subconscious tore us to
          pieces.

Eames takes this in.

                    EAMES
          You learned a lot, though. Right?

                    COBB
              (to Eames)
          I'll need a decoy.

                    EAMES
          No problem. How about a pretty
          young lady I've used before?

                       COBB
          Fine-

Cobb looks back: a second S.U.V. pulls out, tailing them.

                    COBB (CONT'D)
              (to Yusuf)
          I know you've got to stay ahead of
          them, but drive with kid gloves,
          okay? The world down there is going
          to be very unstable-
                                                        98.

                    ARTHUR
          And don't make the jump too soon-
          that kick is our only way back, we
          have to be ready to catch it-

                     YUSUF
          I'll use the music to let you know
          when it's coming, but the rest is
          up to you.

Arthur puts the mechanism onto the front seat.

                    YUSUF (CONT'D)
          Everyone ready?

Nods all round.

                    YUSUF (CONT'D)
          Sweet dreams-

Yusuf hits a button and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR - SUNSET

Fischer nurses a drink. Staring at the ice cracking.

                    BLONDE (O.S.)
          Am I boring you?

Fischer looks up. A beautiful BLONDE is next to him.

                    BLONDE (CONT'D)
          I was telling you my story. I guess
          it wasn't to your liking.

                    FISCHER
          I have a lot on my mind.

Fischer looks around the bar. There are several STERN-LOOKING
CHARACTERS paying him too much attention.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

Arthur and Ariadne sit at a table across the lobby. They spot
Cobb moving across the lobby towards Fischer.

                    ARTHUR
          And there goes Mr. Charles.

                    ARIADNE
          Who or what, exactly, is Mr.
          Charles?
                                                        99.

                    ARTHUR
          It's a gambit designed to turn
          Fischer against his own
          subconscious.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR - CONTINUOUS

Cobb approaches the bar, watched closely by Fischer's Sub-
security.

                    COBB
          Mr. Fishcer! Good to see you again.
          Rod Green, Marketing.
              (to Blonde)
          And you must be...

                     BLONDE
          Leaving.

She presses against Fischer as she slides off her stool and
deposits a cocktail napkin in front of him.

                    BLONDE (CONT'D)
          In case you get bored.

Cobb watches her walk away. The Sub-security FOLLOWS her.

                    COBB
          I think you just got blown off...
          unless her phone number really does
          have only six digits.

Fischer glances at the napkin: "528-491."

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

Arthur watches the Sub-security follow the Blonde.

                    ARIADNE
          And why don't you approve?

                    ARTHUR
          Because it involves telling the
          mark that he's dreaming. Which
          involves attracting a lot of
          attention to us.

                    ARIADNE
          Didn't Cobb say never to do that?

                    ARTHUR
          You must've noticed by now how much
          time Cobb spends doing things he
          says never to do.
                                                       100.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR - CONTINUOUS

Cobb turns to Fischer.

                    COBB
          Strange way to make friends.
              (off look)
          Lifting your wallet, I mean.

Fischer pats his pocket. Empty. He looks to the lobby where
he sees the Sub-security trailing the Blonde.

                    FISCHER
          Goddamn it. The wallet alone's
          worth-

                    COBB
          Five hundred bucks. I know. Don't
          worry, my guys are on it.

                    FISCHER
          Who did you say you were?

Fischer looks at him, curious. Cobb plows on, confident-

                    COBB
          I said I was Rod Green from
          Marketing-but I'm not. My name is
          Mr. Charles. I might seem familiar
          to you. I'm in charge of your
          security here.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

The Blonde hurries up to Saito, emerging from the elevator-

                    BLONDE
          Mr. Saito, can I have a minute?

She pushes him back into the elevator, closing the door as
the Sub-security approaches...

INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

The Blonde fondles Saito's lapels, getting close.

                    SAITO
          I'm sorry, but...

Saito glances over her shoulder to see, in the tunnel of
infinite reflections created by the elevator's opposing
mirrors, three reflections in, THE BLONDE IS EAMES. He winks.

                    SAITO (CONT'D)
              (pushing him away)
          Very amusing, Mr. Eames.
                                                       101.

                    EAMES
          You look a bit perkier.

A SHUDDER ripples through the elevator.

                    SAITO
          Turbulence on the plane.

                    EAMES
          Feels closer. That's Yusuf's
          driving.

And we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY DOWNTOWN STREETS - DAY

Yusuf FIGHTS the wheel as the van CUTS DOWN AN ALLEY, BUMPING
OVER POTHOLES and SMASHING TRASH CANS aside- THREE S.U.V.s IN
FURIOUS PURSUIT. Yusuf looks in the rear view mirror,
FRUSTRATED. He checks his WATCH, then checks the back: the
SLEEPERS SHAKE with the impact and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR - NIGHT

As a TREMOR echoes through the bar Fischer looks at Cobb
trying to place him.

                    FISCHER
          Security? You work for the hotel?

                    COBB
          No. My specialty is subconscious
          security.

                    FISCHER
          You're talking about dreams. You're
          talking about extraction.

                    COBB
          Exactly. My job is to protect
          you...

Behind Fischer a WAITER puts down a tray- tipping a champagne
glass over- SMASH- Cobb NOTICES. Pauses, looks across the bar-
HIS TWO CHILDREN ARE CROUCHED, BACKS TOWARDS US...

Cobb looks around the bar, the patrons start to STARE at
Cobb, suspicious- Cobb shifts back to Fischer-
                                                          102.

                    COBB (CONT'D)
          My job is to protect you from any
          attempt to access your mind through
          your dreams.

Cobb regains his patter- the patrons lose interest...

INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

Eames pulls out Fischer's wallet, moves to hand it to Saito,
then PAUSES, opens it, leafs past the cast to find... The
SNAPSHOT: young Robert holding his HOMEMADE PINWHEEL, his
father blowing on it. The elevator doors open and Eames steps
off. HANDS Saito the wallet.

                    EAMES
          Get off at a different floor and
          keep moving. Dump the wallet, then
          meet me in the lobby. The security
          will try to track it down. We need
          to buy Cobb a little more time.

The doors close. Saito puts the wallet in his pocket. He
COUGHS- a deep, nasty cough.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR - CONTINUOUS

Cobb looks over Fischer's shoulder to see a SUITED MAN
watching him. Another MAN is walking in from the lobby.

                    COBB
          You're not safe here.

Cobb steps away from the bar. Fischer does not move.

                    COBB (CONT'D)
          Trust me. They're coming for you.

Fischer sizes him up, A CLAP OF THUNDER ECHOES, and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY DOWNTOWN STREETS - DAY

GUNSHOTS BLAST out the rear and side windows of the van- a
Security Man is leaning out of the lead S.U.V. With a SHOTGUN-

WIND AND RAIN RIP THROUGH THE VAN- in the back, ARTHUR'S
SLEEPING FACE IS WHIPPED BY THE SPRAY, AND WE-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR - SUNSET

Fischer looks out the windows at sudden, HURRICANE-LIKE RAIN-
                                                         103.

                    COBB
          Strange weather, huh?

A TREMOR runs through the bar- Cobb looks around-

                    COBB (CONT'D)
          You feel that?

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

Ariadne and Arthur watch the GUSTS OF WIND RATTLE the
windows. Arthur sees HOTEL GUESTS staring out at the weather,
PUZZLED. Several of them TURN TO LOOK DIRECTLY AT ARTHUR.

                    ARIADNE
          What's happening?

                    ARTHUR
          Cobb's drawing Fischer's attention
          to the strangeness of the dream.
          That's making his subconscious look
          for the dreamer. For me.

And we-

                                                    CUT TO:

INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY STREETS - DAY

At the end of the alley-   Yusuf THROWS the van into a HARD
RIGHT TURN- we move into   EXTREME SLOW MOTION... THE SLEEPERS
IN THE BACK ARE DRAWN TO   ONE SIDE OF THE VAN BY THE
CENTRIFUGAL FORCE... and   we-

                                                    CUT TO:

INT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR - CONTINUOUS

The liquid in Fischer's drink RISES UP AGAINST ONE SIDE OF
THE GLASS- Fischer notices, confused.

                     COBB
          Very odd-the weather, the
          gravity...

Fischer looks around the bar- it's as if THE ENTIRE ROOM IS
SET AT A 45-DEGREE ANGLE- glasses SLIDING off tables...

                    COBB (CONT'D)
          But I can explain all this. You've
          actually been trained for this.
              (Fischer nods)
          Think of the strangeness of the
          weather, the shifts in gravity.
          None of this is real...
                    (MORE)
                                                         104.
                    COBB (CONT'D)
              (beat)
          We're in a dream.

Fischer looks at the room around them. Back to Cobb. All
through the bar, patrons turn to look at Cobb IN UNISON.

                    COBB (CONT'D)
          The simplest test of what I'm
          saying is for you to try and
          remember anything about the way you
          arrived in this hotel... okay?

Fischer stares at Cobb, trying to process this. All around
them, people STARE at Cobb. Several get up as if to approach.

                    COBB (CONT'D)
          Breathe. Remember the training.
          Accept the fact that we're in a
          dream. That's why I'm here
          protecting you.

As Fischer considers this we-

                                                    CUT TO:

INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY STREETS - DAY

Yusuf STRAIGHTENS UP the van, RACING down the street,
swerving through traffic and we-

                                                    CUT TO:

INT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR - EVENING

The building gradually EASES BACK INTO ALIGNMENT-

                    FISCHER
          So you... you're not real?

The bar patrons start to ignore Cobb again.

                    COBB
          No. I'm a projection of your
          subconscious. I was put in place to
          protect you in the event that
          extractors pulled you into a dream.
          I believe that's what has happened.

Fischer takes this in. Then looks at the Security Men
approaching across the crooked floor, he nods at Cobb-
                                                          105.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - EVENING

Cobb escorts Fischer across the lobby. As he does so, he
walks past the two CHILDREN, backs to us- Cobb ignores them-
The two Sub-security fall in behind. Cobb hurries Fischer up
the stairs- then PUSHES him into-

INT. HOTEL LOBBY BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Fischer stumbles in- turns to Cobb, angry-

                    FISCHER
          Hey-

Cobb reaches into his jacket- the First Man BURSTS in- Cobb
KICKS him to the ground- DRAWS his gun as the SECOND MAN
comes through the door, moving towards Fischer-

BLAM! Cobb BLASTS the Second Man in the back- TURNS and
SHOOTS the First Man.

                    FISCHER (CONT'D)
          Jesus Christ! What are you doing?!

Cobb turns to Fischer, calm. Convincing.

                    COBB
          Look at the gun in his hand.

Fischer looks: the Second Man was holding a pistol. Cobb
opens the First Man's jacket to show Fischer his holster and
sidearm.

                    COBB (CONT'D)
          These men were sent to abduct you.

Cobb pulls out the gun and HANDS it to Fischer.

                    COBB (CONT'D)
          If I'm going to help you, I need
          you to be calm.

Fischer remembers something.

                    FISCHER
          If this is a dream, I have to kill
          myself and wake up-

Fischer raises the gun towards his head-

                    COBB
          I wouldn't do that-they've probably
          got you sedated. If you pull that
          trigger, you might not wake up, you
          might drop into a lower dream
          state.
                    (MORE)
                                                       106.
                    COBB (CONT'D)
          Mr. Fischer, you know all this, you
          just have to remember it...

Fischer lowers his gun.

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

Saito walks down the corridor, followed by a Security Man.
Saito DUCKS around the corner, moves to a GARBAGE CHUTE and
DROPS Fischer's WALLET into it. He SLIPS into the stairwell
as the Security Man comes abreast of the chute and pauses.

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

Arthur leads Ariadne to a particular room: 491.

INT. ROOM 491 - CONTINUOUS

Arthur leads Ariadne in. He opens the closet, opens the room
safe, pulls our FOUR BRICKS OF PLASTIC EXPLOSIVE.

                    ARTHUR
          So, if everything's correct, this
          room should be directly below 528.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Cobb looks reassuringly at Fischer.

                    COBB
          What do you remember from before
          this dream?

                    FISCHER
              (thinking)
          Rain... gunfire... Uncle Peter.
              (looks up)
          Christ-we've been kidnapped.

                    COBB
          Where were they holding you?

                    FISCHER
          They had us... in the back of a
          van...

                    COBB
          Your body's bouncing around in the
          back of a van right now-that
          explains the gravity shifts.

                    FISCHER
          It was... to do with a safe...
          Christ, why's it so hard to
          remember?
                                                        107.

                    COBB
          It's like trying to remember a
          dream after you've woken up. It
          takes years of practice to do it
          easily. So, you and Browning have
          been pulled into this dream so they
          can steal something from your mind.
          What?

                    FISCHER
          They wanted a combination to a
          safe... they demanded the first
          numbers to pop into my head.

                    COBB
          That's them extracting a locator.

                       FISCHER
          A locator?

                    COBB
          A number from your own
          subconscious. It can be used any
          number of ways...
              (thinking)
          This is a hotel. Room numbers. What
          was the number you gave them?

                    FISCHER
          5, 2... something... it was a long
          number. 528... 528, 4 something.

                    COBB
              (opens phone)
          Well, we know where to start.
              (into phone)
          Fifth floor.

INT. ROOM 491 - CONTINUOUS

Arthur hangs up the phone. He is standing on a chair,
attaching the explosives to the ceiling.

                    ARIADNE
          Do you use a timer?

                    ARTHUR
          No, I have to judge it myself. Once
          you're all asleep up in room 528, I
          wait `til Yusuf starts his kick...

                    ARIADNE
          How will you know?
                                                        108.

                    ARTHUR
          His music warns me it's coming,
          then the van hitting the barrier of
          the bridge should be unmistakable-
          that's when I blow the floor out
          from underneath us and we get a
          nice synchronized kick. Too soon,
          and we won't get pulled out; too
          late and I won't be able to drop
          us.

                       ARIADNE
          Why not?

                    ARTHUR
          The van will be in free fall. I
          can't drop us with no gravity.

Arthur finishes setting the charges.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

Saito moves through the lobby. Browning is coming in the
other direction. Saito assumes him to be Eames.

                    SAITO
          I see you've changed.

                       BROWNING
          I'm sorry?

Eames comes up behind Browning, catching Saito's eye.

                    SAITO
          I'm... I mistook you for a friend.

                    BROWNING
          Good-looking fellow, I'm sure.

Browning moves off. Saito approaches Eames.

                    EAMES
          That's Fischer's projection of
          Browning. We'll keep an eye on how
          he behaves-

                       SAITO
          Why?

                    EAMES
          How he acts will tell us if
          Fischer's starting to suspect his
          motives the way we want him to.
                                                       109.

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR, FIFTH FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER

Cobb leads Fischer around a corner. Arthur and Ariadne are
waiting in the corridor.

                    COBB
          They work for me.

Fischer starts looking at room numbers. Stops at 528. Cobb
draws his gun, steps back from the door and KICKS it open.

INT. ROOM 528 - CONTINUOUS

Cobb JUMPS into the room, gun up. The room is empty. Arthur
and Ariadne search the room. Saito and Eames arrive. Eames
shuts the door. Arthur FINDS something-

                    ARTHUR
          Mr. Charles!

Arthur holds up a MECHANISM CASE. Cobb shows it to Fischer.

                    COBB
          You know what this is?

Fischer's eyes roam over the dials and plungers.

                    FISCHER
          I think so. But I don't understand.

                    COBB
          They were going to put you under.

                    FISCHER
          I'm already under.

                    COBB
          Under again.

                    FISCHER
          A dream within a dream?

                    ARTHUR
          Shhhh!

Arthur is at the door. Someone is there. A key goes into the
lock- the door starts to open- Arthur REACHES OVER and GRABS
the person entering, THROWS THEM TO THE FLOOR- puts his gun
in their face. IT IS BROWNING.

Fischer stares, disbelieving, at his own godfather.

                    FISCHER
          Uncle Peter. What's going on?

Cobb pulls the key from Browning's hand: ROOM 528.
                                                        110.

                    COBB
          You said you were kidnapped
          together?

                    FISCHER
          Not exactly, they already had him.
          They'd been torturing him...

                    COBB
          You saw them torture him?

Fischer shakes his head. Looks at Browning. Thinking.

                    FISCHER
          The kidnappers are working for you.

                    BROWNING
          No, Robert-

                    FISCHER
          You're trying to get that safe
          open. To get the alternate will.

Browning looks up at Fischer.

                    BROWNING
          Fischer Morrow's been my entire
          life. I can't let you destroy it.

                    FISCHER
          I'm not going to throw away my
          inheritance. Why would I?

                    BROWNING
          I couldn't take the chance of you
          rising to your father's final
          taunt.

                    FISCHER
          What taunt?

                    BROWNING
          That will. I'm sorry, Robert, but
          it's his final insult. A challenge
          to build something for yourself.
          He's telling you that you aren't
          worthy of his achievements.

Fischer takes this in. Devastated.

                    FISCHER
          That he was "disappointed?"
                                                       111.

                    BROWNING
          I'm so sorry. But he was wrong.
          You'll make his company even
          greater than he ever could.

                    COBB
          Your godfather's lying, Robert.

Fischer turns to Cobb.

                    FISCHER
          How do you know?

                     COBB
          It's what I do. He's hiding
          something.

Cobb looks at Browning.

                    COBB
          Let's find out what.

Cobb nods at Arthur, who starts unpacking the mechanism.
Browning watches. Silent.

                    COBB
          Let's do to him what he was going
          to do to you.

Cobb rolls up his sleeve. Nods at Fischer to do the same.

                    COBB
          We'll penetrate his subconscious
          and find out what he doesn't want
          you to know.

Fischer looks Cobb in the eye. Decides- rolls up his sleeve,
offering his bare arm. The team run tubes to each other-
Arthur injects Fischer, whose head slumps.

                      ARTHUR
          He's out.

                    ARIADNE
          Wait, Cobb-I'm lost. Whose
          subconscious are we going into?

                    COBB
          Fischer's. I told him it was
          Browning's so he'd come with us as
          part of our team.

                    ARTHUR
              (impressed)
          He's going to help us break into
          his own subconscious.
                                                       112.

                    COBB
          That's the idea. He'll think that
          his security is Browning's and
          fight them to learn the truth about
          his father.

Arthur hits buttons on the mechanism. The team goes out one
by one. Cobb is last.

                    COBB
          Fischer's subconscious is going to
          run you down hard.

                    ARTHUR
          I'll lead them on a merry chase.

                    COBB
          Be back in time for the kick.

                       ARTHUR
          I'm on it.

Cobb is no longer listening- he stares at the net curtains,
BILLOWING like those in Mal's suite- a GLIMPSE of someone
(Mal?) As the screen goes WHITE, and we are-

EXT. SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - DAY

CLOSE ON Cobb's face, staring. Fixed.

                    ARIADNE (O.S.)
          Cobb? Cobb?

Ariadne is beside him. They stand on a cliff, dressed in
white snowsuits, carrying white-painted weapons like WWII
commandos. Cobb checks his SNIPER RIFLE, examines their
objective: a massive FORTIFIED MEDICAL FACILITY a mile below.

                    ARIADNE
          What's down there?

                    COBB
          Hopefully, the truth we want
          Fischer to learn.

                    ARIADNE
          I meant what's down there for you?

Cobb turns to her. Eames, Saito and Fischer arrive, SKIING
down from the hill above. Cobb pulls Eames out of Fischer's
earshot.

                    COBB
          You're the dreamer. I need you to
          draw the security away from the
          complex.
                                                       113.

                    EAMES
          Then who guides Fischer in? You?

                    COBB
          If I know the route... we could be
          compromised.

Eames looks as Cobb, uneasy. Ariadne comes over.

                    ARIADNE
          I designed the place.

                    COBB
          No. You're with me.

                    SAITO (O.S.)
          I could do it.

They turn to Saito. Saito shrugs at Eames. Eames smiles.

                    COBB
          Eames, brief Saito on the route
          into the complex. What we're
          looking for is going to be in the
          most heavily fortified section.
          That north tower.

Cobb moves to Fischer. Saito COUGHS. SPITS. Eames sees BLOOD
on the snow. Looks at Saito.

                     COBB
          Mr. Fischer, you're going in with
          Mr. Saito.

                    FISCHER
          You're not coming in?

                    COBB
          You have to do this on your own.
          You have to get in there, break
          into your godfather's mind and find
          out the truth about your father.

Cobb taps Fischer's radio mike.

                    COBB
          Keep this live at all times. I'll
          be listening in, covering you.
              (holds up the sniper
               rifle)
          The windows on the upper floors are
          big enough that I can cover you
          from that south tower.
                                                       114.

Cobb slips into his skis, shoulders his rifle.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. ROOM 528 - NIGHT

Arthur checks the mechanism. He hears LOW BOOMS like thunder.
He checks his watch- THE SECOND HAND CRAWLS FORWARDS. With a
last look at the sleepers, he heads out into the corridor...

INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY DOWNTOWN STREETS - DAY

A GUNSHOT slams into the van as Yusuf DRIVES- he glances back
to see a MOTORCYCLE pulling up behind him, the REAR PASSENGER
FIRING A SHOTGUN- the bike pulls alongside Yusuf's window as
the passenger RELOADS- Yusuf YANKS the wheel TOWARDS the
bike, bringing the shotgun barrel into the cab so he can GRAB
it, spin the wheel back- PULLING the passenger from the back
of the bike... Yusuf turns a corner, heading into a disused
MARKET-

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

Arthur walks towards the elevator. It OPENS- a SECURITY MAN
emerges, heading right for him. Arthur takes a TURN, speeding
up. The BOOMS are louder, and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY DOWNTOWN STREETS - DAY

The bike crosses behind the van, catching up again as the
driver pulls a handgun and starts BLASTING. Up ahead, an
S.U.V. sits in a side road, lining up to head off the van-
the SECURITY MAN driving the S.U.V. guns it, as the bike
creeps up on the other side of the van- Yusuf HITS THE
BRAKES, forcing the bike out into the path of the S.U.V.,
tossing the rider like a rag doll-

Heading out of the market, the van races onto a FREEWAY ON
RAMP, approaching the BRIDGE. An S.U.V. SMASHES into the
van's side, FORCING it up against a CRASH BARRIER... the van
starts to SLOWLY TILT OVER THE BARRIER as the S.U.V. PUSHES-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

As Arthur hurries down the corridor, the corridor starts to
TILT, and Arthur is forced to run UP ONTO THE WALL- he rounds
a corner- STRAIGHT INTO another Security Man- Arthur HEAD
BUTTS him and they STRUGGLE- as they struggle, the corridor
SPINS around, THROWING THEM UP ONTO THE WALLS, THE CEILING-
as wall becomes floor they DROP through a door into-
                                                          115.

The fight continues all over the spinning room- and we-

INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY OFF RAMP NEAR BRIDGE - DAY

SLEEPING ARTHUR BOUNCES around as the van TILTS, SCRAPING
along the barrier- the van CLEARS THE END OF THE BARRIER AND
ROLLS DOWN THE EMBANKMENT, and we-

                                                    CUT TO:

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Arthur and the Security Man DROP to the floor, Arthur on top.
Arthur gets up- heads to the stairwell.

INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY STREETS NEAR BRIDGE - DAY

The van SETTLES with a thump. Yusuf BREATHES hard. Then
SMILES as he realizes he is in one piece. A RINGING BELL up
ahead makes him look up to the bridge, where the barriers are
starting to come down. Yusuf checks his watch-

                    YUSUF
          Bugger.

Yusuf hits the gas, heading for the bridge. An S.U.V. lines
up behind him, trying to catch up before the van crosses the
barrier onto the bridge-

The van JUST MAKES IT- the S.U.V. behind RIPS its read axle
off, SCRAPING to a halt on the rising section. The Security
Man inside starts FIRING on the van...

INT. HOTEL STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

Arthur RACES down the steps- OPENS the door to the fourth
floor- spots SECURITY MEN outside room 491.

                    ARTHUR
          Hey!

They TURN- he DARTS back into the stairwell- RACES down the
stairs- the Security Men follow- they start SHOOTING, and we-

                                                    CUT TO:

EXT. SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - DAY

Eames SKIS down within sight of the hospital complex. He
reaches into his pack and lets off a FLARE.
                                                       116.

EXT. HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

Security Men on the ramparts spot the flare and send PATROLS
out on skis and SNOWMOBILES to investigate.

EXT. SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS

Eames watches them close in, then launches himself down the
mountain, STREAKING across the icy slope, and we-

                                                   CUT TO:

INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY RISING BRIDGE - DAY

Yusuf PULLS FORWARD, looking over his shoulder to line up a
BACKWARDS RUN at the edge. He DUCKS as vicious FIRE from the
S.U.V. HAMMERS the vehicle. He looks at his watch. The SECOND
HAND TICKING SLOWLY...

                    YUSUF
          Sod it. I hope your ready.

He grabs an MP3 player and reaches into the back to place
HEADPHONES on sleeping Arthur's head. As he does so, he
notices Saito's bandage BLEEDING THROUGH. Yusuf hits PLAY-
Edith Piaf's "Non, je ne regrette rien" starts up and we-

                                                   CUT TO:

Arthur STOPS, hearing something- MASSIVE LOW-END MUSICAL
TONES- he looks up PANICKED-

                    ARTHUR
          No, Yusuf. Too soon!

SHOTS slam into the stairs around him and we-

EXT. SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - DAY

Cobb and Ariadne make their way down towards the complex.

                    EAMES (OVER RADIO)
          Cobb? Are you hearing that?

Cobb listens. The wind sounds unusually LOW.

EXT. FOREST, SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS

Eames is hidden at the base of some trees, whispering as a
patrol passes beneath his position.
                                                        117.

                    EAMES
          I noticed it twenty minutes ago-at
          first I thought it was just wind...

EXT. SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS

Cobb is listening intently. The "wind" changes pitch.

                    COBB
          No, it's music. Dammit.

                    EAMES (OVER RADIO)
          What do we do?

                    COBB
          We move fast. Saito, did you copy?

EXT. MOUNTAINS, THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

Saito and Fischer CLIMB down a CLIFF FACE above the complex-

                    SAITO
          We're going as fast as we can.

EXT. SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS

Ariadne looks at Cobb, concerned.

                    ARIADNE
          How long do we have?

                    COBB
          Yusuf's about ten seconds from the
          jump, which gives Arthur about
          three minutes, which gives us about-

                    ARIADNE
          Sixty minutes.

                    COBB
          The route you gave them, can they
          do it in under an hour?

                    ARIADNE
          I don't think so. They've still got
          to climb down to the middle
          terrace.

                    COBB
          They need a new route-a direct
          route.

                     ARIADNE
          The building's designed as a
          labyrinth.
                                                       118.

                    COBB
          There must be access routes that
          cut through the maze.
              (into radio)
          Eames?

EXT. FOREST, SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS

Eames cannot answer- he SLALOMS through the forest, Sub-
security in hot pursuit, bullets smashing into the trunks...

EXT. SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS

Cobb turns to Ariadne.

                    COBB
          Did Eames add any features?

                    ARIADNE
          Yes.

                    COBB
          What did he add?

Ariadne looks at Cobb.

                    ARIADNE
          I shouldn't tell you. If Mal-

                    COBB
          There's no time-what did he add?

                    ARIADNE
          Utility closets, trap doors...

                    COBB
          What about service features? Did he
          add any large pipes or-

                    ARIADNE
          Ducts. He added an air duct system-
          it doesn't follow the maze. They
          can use it to go straight from the
          outer walls to the upper tower.

                    COBB
          Explain it to them.

          Saito?

Yusuf looks at the Security Man in the S.U.V., gives him the

Arthur RUNS UP the stairs, gun in hand- rounds a corner and-
IMPOSSIBLY- arrives behind the Security Man, who looks at
him, CONFUSED, then looks down to realize he is now at the
edge of a dangerous drop- Arthur shrugs.

                      ARTHUR
          Paradox.

Arthur PUSHES him over the edge- he falls- Arthur races up to
the fourth floor- throws open the door- and we-

INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY RAISED BRIDGE - DAY

In SLOW MOTION- the van SMASHES THROUGH THE CONCRETE BARRIER-
and we-

                                                   CUT TO:

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Arthur is SPRINTING down the corridor when a TREMENDOUS CRASH
sends him FLYING into the air- and we-

                                                   CUT TO:

EXT. SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - DAY

A MASSIVE RUMBLE prompts Cobb to look across the valley-

EXT. FOREST, SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS

Eames shoots out of the trees, then FALLS to the snow as he
sees a great CRACKING up ahead- the SLOPE IS FALLING AWAY IN
AN AVALANCHE-
                                                       120.

EXT. CLIFF FACE BEHIND COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

Saito hears the RUMBLE above them. He looks down, Fischer is
below, near the bottom of the sheer face-

                      SAITO
          Look out!

Saito CUTS the rope- they FALL- HIT the icy face and SLIDE
down the slope, clearing the path of the avalanche- and we-

                                                   CUT TO:

INT./EXT. VAN - DAY

In EXTREME SLOW MOTION, the van emerges from the concrete
balustrade and starts FALLING- and we-

                                                   CUT TO:

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Arthur is still FLYING through the corridor, NOT LANDING-
GRAVITY HAS DISAPPEARED... he scrambles for a handhold,
GRABBING a sconce- and we-

                                                   CUT TO:

EXT. SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - DAY

Cobb watches the avalanche cloud slide past the complex.

                    ARIADNE
          What was that?

                      COBB
          The kick.

                    EAMES (OVER RADIO)
          Cobb? Did we miss it?

                    COBB
          Yeah, we missed it.

EXT. FOREST, SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS

Eames is lying on the snow.

                    EAMES
          What the hell do we do now?

                    COBB (OVER RADIO)
          Finish the job before the next
          kick.
                                                         121.

                    EAMES
          What next kick?

EXT. SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS

Cobb looks at Ariadne as he talks into the radio.

                    COBB
          When the van hits the water. I
          figure Arthur's got a couple
          minutes and we've got about twenty.

Cobb and Ariadne MOVE towards the base of the complex.

EXT. HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

Saito and Fischer RUN around the base of the building. They
find a large EXHAUST PORT. Lay a charge on the GRILL. They
blow the charge. Climb into the open vent.

INT./EXT. VAN - DAY

In EXTREME SLOW MOTION, the van seems SUSPENDED IN MID-AIR
TEN STORIES ABOVE THE RIVER... and we-

                                                    CUT TO:

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

In ZERO GRAVITY, Arthur pulls himself to the door of 491,
opens it. He looks at the charges planted on the ceiling.

                    ARTHUR
          How the hell do I drop you?

He PULLS the charges from the ceiling. Hurrying. And we-

                                                    CUT TO:

INT. DUCT SYSTEM, HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

Saito and Fischer hurry through the duct system. Saito is
falling behind, coughing up blood.

EXT. UPPER TERRACE, HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

Cobb GRABS a Security Guard from behind, strangling him
unconscious. He beckons to Ariadne, covering her as she runs
towards him. They enter the base of the south tower.

INT. TOP ROOM, SOUTH TOWER, HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

A guard is manning the tower. Cobb and Ariadne enter- Cobb
SHOOTS the guard and moves to the window.
                                                       122.

                    ARIADNE
              (she points)
          That's the antechamber outside the
          strongroom.

Cobb looks at the large windows of the antechamber.

                    COBB
          What about the strongroom? Doesn't
          it have any windows?

                    ARIADNE
          Wouldn't be very strong if it did.
              (off look)
          Look, if you wanted to design it
          yourself-

                    COBB
          It's fine. Better hope that we like
          what Fischer finds in there.

Cobb sets up his sniper rifle. Through the scope he can see
three guards on the balcony outside the chamber. Three more
inside. Cobb casually picks them off with his rifle. Ariadne
watches through binoculars, appalled.

                    ARIADNE
          These projections, they're part of
          his subconscious?

                    COBB
          Yeah.

                    ARIADNE
          Are you destroying those parts of
          his mind?

                    COBB
          No, of course not. They're just
          projections.

                    EAMES (OVER RADIO)
          Cobb? Something's wrong?

EXT. FOREST, SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS

Eames is watching the patrols HEAD BACK towards the complex.

                    EAMES
          They're heading your way. Like they
          know something.

INT. TOP ROOM, SOUTH TOWER, HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

Cobb hears this. Concerned.
                                                         123.

                    COBB
          Buy us some time.

                       EAMES (OVER RADIO)
          On my way.

EXT. FOREST, SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS

Eames TAKES OFF towards the base of the complex. And we=

                                                   CUT TO:

INT. ROOM 528 - NIGHT

Arthur FLOATS into the room. The SLEEPERS are floating,
loosely connected by their tubes. Arthur looks at them, MIND
RACING. He PULLS Cobb towards Eames, and we-

                                                   CUT TO:

INT. DUCT SYSTEM, HOSPITAL COMPLEX - DAY

Saito and Fischer approach the grate covering the exit to the
anteroom. Saito SLUMPS to the floor of the duct, pulls out
his radio. Fischer looks at him- he is PALE, SHIVERING.
Fischer takes the radio, WHISPERS into it.

                    FISCHER
              (into radio)
          We're here. Are we clear to
          proceed?

INT. TOP ROOM, SOUTH TOWER, HOSPITAL COMPLEC - CONTINUOUS

Cobb SCANS the anteroom through the scope-it looks clear.

                    COBB
          You're clear, but hurry-there's an
          army headed your way...

Ariadne watches the patrols approaching the complex...

INT. DUCT SYSTEM, HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

The SQUELCH from the radio is too loud- Fischer GRABS it and
turns the volume to zero as he starts to remove the grate...

EXT. BASE OF THE HOPISTAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

Eames is setting MINES along the LOWEST WALL of the
structure. He moves carefully-there is a SHEER DROP below the
wall...
                                                       124.

INT. TOP ROOM, SOUTH TOWER, HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

Cobb SPOTS something through his scope. Something above the
main windows, glimpsed through the side of the skylight.

                    COBB
          Shit. There's someone else in
          there.

Cobb prepares to fire. Ariadne GRABS the radio-

                    ARIADNE
          Fischer, stop! It's a trap!-

INT. DUCT SYSTEM, HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

Fischer does not see the flashing light on his radio as he
carefully lifts the grate. He motions for Saito to stay...

INT. TOP ROOM, SOUTH TOWER, HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

Cobb TENSES to fire.

                    COBB
          Come on... a little lower... a
          little-

COBB FREEZES- IT IS MAL IN HIS SIGHTS. Ariadne puts up her
binoculars. Spots Mal. Fischer is climbing out of the vent...

                    ARIADNE
          Cobb, that's not really her-

Cobb turns to her-

                    COBB
          How can you know that?

INT. ANTECHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

Fischer moves into the antechamber, cautious-

                       FISCHER
          I'm in.

Fischer turns up the volume-

                    ARIADNE (OVER RADIO)
          Fischer, look out!-

Mal DROPS gracefully to the floor behind him-

                       MAL
          Hello.
                                                       125.

INT. TOP ROOM, SOUTH TOWER, HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

Cobb looks at Ariadne-

                    ARIADNE
          Cobb, she's just a projection.
          Fischer... he's real.

Cobb thinks. Nods, TURNS back to the scope- too late- MAL
SHOOTS FISCHER- Cobb reflexively pulls the trigger- Mal GOES
DOWN- Cobb steps back from the scope, STUNNED.

                    ARIADNE
          Eames? Get to the anteroom now!

They run for the door.

INT. DUCT SYSTEM, HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

Saito STARTS as he hears the shot. He starts edging forwards,
clutching his belly. And we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. ROOM 528 - NIGHT

The sleepers are floating in a rough stack, top-and-tailed.
Arthur pulls the bedding from the bed and uses the sheet to
bind the sleepers together. And we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT./EXT. VAN - DAY

In EXTREME SLOW MOTION, the van CREEPS DOWNWARDS, still high
above the river... and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Arthur PUSHES the floating stack of sleepers to the elevator.
He hits the button- the doors open- he pushes them in- GRABS
the charges- climbs through the hatch in the ceiling and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. DUCT SYSTEM, HOSPITAL COMPLEX - DAY

Eames steps over Saito, who looks up at him with DYING eyes-

INT. ANTECHAMBER, HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY

Eames jumps out of the vent to find Cobb and Ariadne standing
over the bodies of Fischer and Mal.
                                                       126.

                    EAMES
          What happened?

                    ARIADNE
          Mal killed Fischer-

                    COBB
          I wouldn't shoot her.

Eames grabs a defibrillator from the wall and pulls Fischer's
jacket open-

                    COBB
          It won't do any good-

Eames SHOCKS Fischer's chest...

                    COBB
          Even if you could revive his body,
          his mind's trapped down there. It's
          over.

Eames listens for a pulse. Looks up at Cobb.

                    EAMES
          So that it, then? We failed.

                       COBB
          I'm sorry.

                    EAMES
          It's you who doesn't get back to
          your family.

Eames looks down at Fischer. Then over to the double doors.

                    EAMES
          I wanted to know what was going to
          happen in there. I think we had
          this one.

                    ARIADNE
          There's still a way: We follow
          Fischer down-

They look at her.

                    EAMES
          We're almost out of time-

                    ARIADNE
          Down there they'll be enough time.
          We'll find him-soon as you hear
          Arthur's music start, you use the
          defibrillator to revive him-we give
          him his own early kick from below.
                    (MORE)
                                                       127.
                    ARIADNE (CONT'D)
          Get him in there-
              (points to doors)
          Then, as the music ends you blow
          the hospital and we all ride the
          kick back up through the layers.

Eames looks at her, then to Cobb.

                    EAMES
          Okay, Saito can hold them off while
          I plant the rest of the charges.

                    COBB
          Saito's not going to last, Eames.

                    ARIADNE
          We have to try!

                    EAMES
          Go for it, but I'm taking the kick
          whether you're back or not...

Eames pulls the mechanism from his pack. Offers it to
Ariadne. Cobb watches. Silent. Ariadne pulls out the tubes-

                    ARIADNE
          Can I trust you to do what's
          needed? Mal's down there-

                    COBB
          And I can find her. She'll have
          Fischer.

                    ARIADNE
          How do you know?

                    COBB
          She wants me to come after him. She
          wants me back down there with her.

Cobb rolls up his sleeve. Ariadne rolls up her own sleeve.
Eames NODS. Cobb and Ariadne lie down. Eames hits the button-
WATER. BUBBLES. DROWNING. And we are-

EXT. COAST (LIMBO) - DAY

Ariadne lies in the SURF, STARING up at a CLOUDLESS SKY. A
tremendous BOOM prompts her to look around her- URBAN
BUILDINGS PILED right down to the water. The buildings are
DECAYING, falling into the ocean like a GLACIER calving. Cobb
WADES towards her through the shallow water. Ariadne looks up
at the crumbling city around them.

                    ARIADNE
          This is your world?
                                                         128.

                    COBB
          It was. And this is where she'll
          be.

And we-

                                                    CUT TO:

INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - DAY

Arthur floats on top of the elevator, planting small charges
on the EMERGENCY BRAKES and CABLE. He sets them, GRABS the
other explosives, then PUSHES AWAY, shooting up the shaft. As
he hits the DETONATOR, BLASTING the braking and safety
systems of the elevator, we move into SLOW MOTION, the
fireballs FLAMING OUT in graceful licks and we-

                                                DISSOLVE TO:

INT. ANTECHAMBER - DAY

Eames RACES around, full speed- getting the defibrillator
paddles- laying them by Fischer's body- he runs into the duct-
pulls Saito up to a seated position and hands him a handgun.

                    EAMES
          Come on, Saito. I need you to cover
          Fischer while I plant the charges.

Saito nods weakly, tries to hold the gun. Eames moves to the
window- pulls his machine gun off- checks its load. Ready. He
watches the security patrols climb up the outer walls...
Eames lays down a HAIL of covering fire- then heads outside-

EXT. HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

Eames races along the upper terrace dodging fire- BULLETS
SHATTER a window behind him and we move into SLOW MOTION, the
glass CASCADING GENTLY and we-

                                                DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. COAST (LIMBO)- DAY

Cobb and Ariadne climb out of the waves, full speed. They
move into the shadow of the tall, crumbling buildings. The
streets are eerily DESERTED. As they move further in, the
buildings become NEWER, different. Ariadne marvels at the
extraordinary collection of buildings- every architectural
style imaginable in waves of FAILED UTOPIAS.

                    ARIADNE
          You built all this?

                    COBB
          We both did.
                                                       129.

                    ARIADNE
          It's incredible.

                    COBB
          We built for years. Then, when that
          got stale, we started in on the
          memories.

A child's SHOUT echoes through the deserted canyons,
prompting Cobb to look down a side street: a LITTLE BLONDE
BOY crouched, his back to us. A LITTLE BLONDE GIRL joins the
boy, and, as Cobb turns down the street, they run off.

Cobb and Ariadne emerge into a peculiar SQUARE lined with an
eclectic mix of buildings, from APARTMENT BLOCKS to HOUSES.

                    COBB
          This is our neighborhood.

                    ARIADNE
              (confused)
          From what city?

                    COBB
          No. Our neighborhood.
              (pointing)
          That was our first apartment...
          then we moved to that building...
          we got that small house when Mal
          became pregnant.

                    ARIADNE
          You reconstructed them all from
          memory?

                    COBB
          We had time.

Cobb pauses in front of a French country house. Staring.

                    ARIADNE
          What's that?

                    COBB
          The house Mal grew up in.

                    ARIADNE
          Will she be in there?

                    COBB
          No. Come on-

Cobb leads Ariadne to the entrance of a glass skyscraper.
                                                        130.

INT. SKYSCRAPER LOBBY (LIMBO) - CONTINUOUS

Cobb leads Ariadne across the gleaming lobby to the
elevators.

                    COBB
          We both wanted a house, but we both
          loved skyscrapers. In the real
          world we had to choose. Not here.

INT. SKYSCRAPER ELEVATOR (LIMBO) - CONTINUOUS

Cobb pulls out his handgun, and a ziplock bag full of
bullets.

                    ARIADNE
          How do we send Fischer back?

                    COBB
          We need some kind of kick.

                    ARIADNE
          What?

                    COBB
          I'll improvise.

Cobb COCKS his weapon, and the ELEVATOR STOPS. The doors
open. Ariadne moves to exit, Cobb stops her.

                     COBB
          There's something you have to
          understand about me. About
          inception. You see, an idea is like
          a virus...

Cobb leads her out of the lift...

INT. PENTHOUSE (LIMBO) - CONTINUOUS

Cobb and Ariadne step off the lift and into the incongruous
interior of a craftsman house. They cautiously move down the
corridor towards the back of the house...

                    COBB
          Resilient...
              (turns to Ariadne)
          Highly contagious, and an idea can
          grow. The smallest seed of an idea
          can grow to define or destroy your
          world...

Cobb is staring into the kitchen. Mal is sitting at the
table, back to them, staring out at the porch- the TOWERS of
Limbo stretching off behind it.
                                                        131.

                    MAL
          The smallest idea, such as... "Your
          world is not real."

Cobb hands Ariadne his gun and moves towards Mal.

                    MAL
          A simple little thought that
          changes everything...

Ariadne watches as Cobb sits down beside Mal. And we-

                                                    CUT TO:

INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT

Arthur FLIES back down the shaft to the top of the elevator,
SQUEEZES past the car to the bottom and starts to set the
MAIN CHARGES ACROSS THE BOTTOM OF THE CAR, and we-

INT. PENTHOUSE (LIMBO) - DAY

Cobb touches Mal's arm- she TURNS, angry. It is only now that
we see that she holds a CARVING KNIFE. Mal looks at Ariadne.

                     MAL
          So certain of your world. Of what's
          real. Do you think he is-
               (points at Cobb)
          Or do you think he's as lost as I
          was?

                    COBB
          I know what's real.

                    MAL
          What are the distinguishing
          characteristics of a dream? Mutable
          laws of physics? Tell that to the
          quantum physicists. Reappearance of
          the dead? What about heaven and
          hell? Persecution of the dreamer,
          the creator, the messiah? They
          crucified Christ, didn't they?

                    COBB
          I know what's real.

                    MAL
          No creeping doubts? Not feeling
          persecuted, Dom? Chased around the
          globe by anonymous corporations and
          police forces? The way the
          projections persecute the dreamer?
                                                       132.

Mal puts her hand on his face. Pitying.

                    MAL
          Admit it, Dom. You don't believe in
          one reality anymore. So choose.
          Choose your reality like I did.
          Choose to be here. Choose me.

                    COBB
              (rising anger)
          I have chosen, Mal. Our children. I
          have to get back to them. Because
          you left them. You left us.

                    MAL
          You're wrong, Dom. You're confused...
          our children are here-

A child's SHOUT draws Cobb- James CROUCHES on the porch, back
to us. Philippa joins him, also turned away. Cobb watches,
moved. Mal leans in close.

                    MAL
              (whispers)
          And you'd like to see their faces
          again, wouldn't you, Dom?

                    COBB
          Our real children are waiting for
          me up above.

And we-

INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

Arthur scrambles to arrange the sleepers on the floor of the
car- as his hand comes away from Saito, he sees BLOOD on it.
He looks at Saito's belly- the blood is coming through his
shirt. Arthur sticks headphones on sleeping Eames, and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. HOSPITAL FORTRESS - DAY

Eames throws a GRENADE, blowing up the security forces trying
to ascend the terraces. He DUCKS to the ground to avoid HEAVY
FIRE- starts unpacking the charges and setting them along the
base of the terraces-
                                                       133.

INT. DUCT SYSTEM, HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

Saito looks up as he hears a Security Guard climbing through
the duct... he raises his gun, TREMBLING with weakness...
And we-

INT. KITCHEN, PENTHOUSE (LIMBO) - DAY

Mal laughs at Cobb.

                    MAL
              (laughs)
          Up above? Listen to yourself. You
          judged me for believing the very
          same thing.

Mal points at the children-

                    MAL
          These are our children. Watch.
              (turns to the kids)
          Hey, James! Philippa?!

The children START TO TURN to us- BUT COBB CLOSES HIS EYES.

                    COBB
          They're not real, Mal. Our real
          children are waiting for us-

The children run off. Cobb opens his eyes.

                    MAL
          You keep telling yourself that but
          you don't believe it-

                       COBB
          I know it-

                    MAL
          And what if you're wrong? What if
          I'm what's real?

Cobb is silent.

                    MAL
          You keep telling yourself what you
          know... but what do you believe?
          What do you feel?

Cobb looks at Mal. Struggling.

                    COBB
          Guilt. I feel guilt. And however
          confused I might get.

                                                       134.
                    COBB (CONT'D)
          However lost I might seem... it's
          always there. Telling me something.
          Reminding me of the truth.

                    MAL
          What truth?

                    COBB
          That you were wrong to doubt our
          world. That the idea that drove you
          to question your reality was a
          lie...

                    MAL
          How could you know it was a lie?

                    COBB
          Because it was my lie.

                    MAL
              (realizing)
          Because you planted the idea in my
          mind.

                     COBB
          Because I performed inception on my
          own wife, then reaped the bitter
          rewards...

                    ARIADNE
          Why?

                    COBB
          We'd become lost in here. Living in
          a world of infinite possibilities.
          A world where we were gods. I
          realized we needed to escape, but
          she'd locked away her knowledge of
          the unreality of this world...

INSERT CUT: Mal opens the doll's house. Takes the spinning
top, lies it down in the safe. LOCKS IT AWAY.

                    COBB
          I couldn't make Mal understand that
          we needed to break free. To die. So
          I started to search our world...

Cobb turns to Mal, but keeps talking to Ariadne...

INSERT CUT: Cobb WANDERS the streets of Limbo...

                    COBB
          Searching for the right place in

INSERT CUT: Cobb stops outside the VICTORIAN HOUSE, MAL'S
CHILDHOOD HOME, looking up at it. He heads inside...

                    COBB
          And when I found that place, that
          secret place where she had shut
          away her knowledge years before, I
          broke it open...

INSERT CUT: Cobb looks around Mal's childhood bedroom. Comes
to the doll's house...

                    COBB
          I broke into the deepest recess of
          her mind, to give her the simplest
          little idea.

INSERT CUT: Cobb throws open the safe doors. Sitting on the
shelf of the safe is a spinning top. On its side.

                    COBB
          A truth that she had once known,
          but had chosen to forget...

INSERT CUT: Cobb picks up the totem. He SPINS it in the safe.
IT SPINS AND SPINS WITHOUT END. Cobb CLOSES THE DOOR of the
safe...

                    COBB
          That her world was not real.

INSERT CUT: COBB AND MAL ARRIVE AT TRAIN TRACKS CUTTING
THROUGH WASTELAND.

                    COBB (V.O.)
          That death was a necessary escape.

They lie on the tracks looking into each other's eyes. Mal is
crying. Cobb takes her hand, reassuring. He starts to speak-

                    COBB
          You're waiting for a train. A train
          that will take you far away. You
          know where you hope this train will
          take you, but you can't know for
          sure. Yet it doesn't matter...

Mal looks at him across the railroad tracks. Replies-

                    MAL
          Because you'll be together.

The train comes, OBLITERATING the lovers.
Back in the present- Cobb looks into Mal's eyes. She is
crying.
                                                       136.

                    COBB
          I never thought that the idea I'd
          planted would grow in her mind like
          a cancer. That even after we woke...

INSERT CUT: Cobb looks around the HOTEL SUITE, confused. He
moves to the CURTAINS... Mal is on the ledge opposite.
                    COBB
          You'd continue to believe that your
          world was not real...

Crying, Mal nods-

                    MAL
          That death was the only escape?

INSERT CUT: Mal PLUNGES to her death.

                    MAL
          You killed me.

Cobb looks at Mal. Whispers-

                    COBB
          I was trying to save you-I'm sorry.

Mal comes in close to Cobb. Looks him over.

                    MAL
          You infected my mind. You betrayed
          me. But you can make amends. You
          can still keep your promise. We can
          still be together... right here. In
          our world. The world we built
          together.

          You can't have him.

Cobb stares at Mal. Mesmerized.

                    COBB
          If I stay, can she take him back?

                    ARIADNE
          Cobb, what are you saying?

                    MAL
          Fischer's on the porch.

          Cobb, you can't do this.

Ariadne moves onto the porch, high above the metropolis, and

Ariadne looks up as a LARGE BOLT OF LIGHTNING RIPS across the

below the rail.

                    ARIADNE
          He's here. And it's time. But you
          have to come with us.

Another massive lightning strike flickers across the sky-

                    ARIADNE
          Cobb, I'm not going to let you lose
          yourself in here! You have to get
          back to your children!

                    COBB
          Send Fischer, I have to stay-

                    ARIADNE
          You can't stay here to be with her-

Cobb turns from Mal. Looks at Ariadne.

                    COBB
          I'm not. Saito is dead by now. That
          means he's here. I have to stay
          here and find him.

Ariadne removes Fischer's gag- pulls him up, onto the rail.
Cobb looks back at Mal.

                    COBB
          I can't stay here to be with her
          because she's not real.

Mal looks at Cobb, furious.

                    MAL
          Not real? I'm the only thing you do
          believe in anymore. Here-doesn't
          this feel real, Dom?

She STABS him in the chest- Cobb WHEEZES- GASPING, looking at
Mal-
                                                          139.

                    COBB
          I wish you were. But I couldn't
          make you real. I'm not capable of
          imagining you in all your
          complexity and... perfection. As
          you really were. You're the best I
          can do. And you're not real.

Mal pulls the knife and moves to STRIKE again-

                    ARIADNE
          No!

A SHOT rings out, Mal GRABS her shoulder- Cobb turns to
Ariadne, who is pointing Cobb's gun.

          What're you doing?

                    ARIADNE

She KICKS Fischer off the roof- AIMS again at Mal-

Fischer DROPS as the sky LIGHTS UP WITH ELECTRICITY- Fischer
SCREAMS, then GASPS, no longer falling, and we are-

Fischer looks up at the double doors. STAGGERS to his feet.
Fischer pushes open the doors to the STRONGROOM.

Eames WATCHES Fischer-

              (to himself) )
          Come on, come on...

INT. STRONGROOM - DAY

The Father collapses back onto the pillow. Fischer starts to
weep. His Father reaches out a trembling hand but when
Fischer tries to hold IT, he SHAKES his son's hand away...

He is reaching for the SAFE next to his bed. His fingers
fumble at the keypad, he can't open it. His son pushes
5,2,8,4,9,1 into the keypad. Opens it. Inside the safe is the
WILL. And beside it is a HOMEMADE PINWHEEL, clearly made by a
child. By Fischer. He takes it out, MARVELING at it. He turns
to his father, but his father is dead.

Eames, watching from the door, HITS THE DETONATOR-

EXT. HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

A line of EXPLOSIONS RIPS ALONG THE LOWER WALL... the ENTIRE
BUILDING STARTS TO SLIDE DOWN THE MOUNTAIN-

EXT. PENTHOUSE (LIMBO) - DAY

A FIERCE WIND starts HOWLING through the house as the sky
outside DARKENS. Cobb shields Mal against the blast- looks up
at Ariadne, who HOLDS the railing, FIGHTING the wind-

                    COBB
          That's the kick-you have to go!

                    ARIADNE
          You're coming!

                    COBB
          No, I'm not. I'm staying here to
          find Saito.
              (turns to Mal)
          And to say goodbye.

Ariadne loosens her grip on the railing...

                    ARIADNE
          Don't lose yourself. Find Saito.
          And bring him back.

                    COBB
          I will.

Ariadne lets the wind pull her off the edge- FALLING- and we-

INT. ANTECHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

Ariadne DROPS as the FLOOR COLLAPSES- her eyes SNAP OPEN-
                                                          142.

EXT. PENTHOUSE (LIMBO) - DAY

Cobb holds Mal in his arms. The wind DIES...

                    MAL
          We'd be together forever. You
          promised me.

                    COBB
          I know. But we can't. And I'm
          sorry.

                    MAL
          You remember when you asked me to
          marry you? You said you dreamt that
          we'd grow old together.

                    COBB
          And we did...

Mal looks at Cobb... thinking. Remembering.

INSERT CUT: TWO ELDERLY PEOPLE (MAL AND COBB) WALK THROUGH

          I miss you more than I can bear...
          but we had our time together. And
          now I have to let go...

She nods, weakly. Cobb holds Mal as her eyes close...
DYING... and we-

Fischer and his Father's body DROP AWAY-

INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

Ariadne DROPS inside the ROCKETING ELEVATOR, and as it
SMASHES INTO THE TOP OF THE SHAFT Ariadne SMASHES into-

INT./EXT. VAN INTO RIVER - DAY

THE WATER, THE VAN CRUNCHING WITH THE IMPACT- WATER CRASHING
THROUGH THE BROKEN WINDOWS FLOODING THE INTERIOR...

Fischer's EYES OPEN, PANICKING- he UNBUCKLES HIMSELF, pushes
out of the broken window- STOPS, goes back to UNBUCKLE
Browning and DRAG him out.
                                                       143.

EXT. RIVER - CONTINUOUS

Fischer breaks the surface with Browning, who COUGHS and
GASPS. He starts PULLING for the near bank, struggling
through the rain-impacted water-

INT. VAN, UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS

Ariadne, Arthur and Yusuf wait calmly underwater. They are
sharing TWO REGULATORS pulled from beneath the front seat.
Arthur turns to Saito. There is blood in the water around
Saito's belly- his eyes are LIFELESS- Arthur feels for a
pulse... turns to Cobb, whose eyes are lifeless... Ariadne
GRABS Arthur's elbow, pulling him away...

EXT. RIVERBANK - MOMENTS LATER

Fischer turns Browning/Eames over. They lie there, exhausted.

                    BROWNING
          I'm sorry, Robert.

Fischer stares at the rain on the water.

                    FISCHER
          The will means that Dad wanted me
          to be my own man, not live for him.
              (turns to Browning) )
          And I'm going to, Uncle Peter.

Browning nods. Wipes the rain from his face. In the puddle
beside them, the reflection is not Browning, but Eames.

EXT. UNDERNEATH BRIDGE IN THE RAIN - MOMENTS LATER

Arthur sits on the riverbank, breathing heavily.

                    ARTHUR
          What happened?

                    ARIADNE
          Cobb stayed.

                      ARTHUR
          With Mal?

                    ARIADNE
          No. To find Saito.

Arthur looks out at the water below the bridge.

                    ARTHUR
          He'll be lost...

                    ARIADNE
          No. He'll be alright.
                                                       144.

EXT. DAWN. CRASHING SURF.

The waves TOSS a BEARDED MAN onto wet sand.

As the Japanese Security Guard turns him onto his back, we
realize that this is Cobb- OLDER. WEARY. TRAVELLED...

INT. DINING ROOM, CASTLE - DAY

Cobb WOLFS his food. The Elderly Japanese Man (Saito, 90
years old) watches him.

                    SAITO
          So... have you come to kill me?

Cobb does not look up.

                    SAITO
          I've been waiting for someone to
          come for me...

                    COBB
          Someone from your half-remembered
          dream...?

Saito peers at Cobb.

                    SAITO
          Cobb? Not possible-he and I were
          young men together. And I am an old
          man...

                    COBB
          Filled with regret?

Saito REMEMBERS, nods...

                    SAITO
          Waiting to die alone, yes.

Cobb is STARING at something on the table.

                    COBB
          I came back for you... I came to
          remind you of what you once knew...

Cobb gestures at the table. Saito follows his gaze down to
the polished surface of the table...

                    COBB
          That this world is not real.
                                                       145.

The top IS STILL SPINNING PERFECTLY, AS IF IT WILL NEVER
TOPPLE. Saito looks at the top. Then back to Cobb.

                    SAITO
          You came to convince me to honor
          our arrangement?

                    COBB
          Yes. And to take a leap of faith.

As Saito-san listens to Cobb, he looks at the GUN on the
table between them...

                    COBB
          Come back and we'll be young men
          together again.

The elderly Saito looks at Cobb. Nods. And we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. FIRST CLASS CABIN, 747 - DAY

Ariadne watches Cobb. His eyes are closed.

                    FLIGHT ATTENDANT (O.S.)
          Hot towel, sir?

His EYES FLICKER OPEN. He takes the towel with a nod. Ariadne
smiles. Relieved.

                    FLIGHT ATTENDANT
          We'll be landing in Los Angeles in
          about twenty minutes. Do you need
          immigration forms?

Cobb nods. Takes a landing card. Looks around the cabin.

Saito is WATCHING him. Serious. Haunted. Holding Cobb's gaze,
SAITO PICKS UP THE PHONE AND DIALS. Cobb nods thanks...

INT. ARRIVALS, LAX - LATER

Cobb steps forwards to the IMMIGRATION OFFICIAL. Hands him
his passport. Nervous. The Official takes a beat, looks Cobb
up and down, then WHUMP!- the passport is stamped. As Cobb
takes it back, he spots Ariadne at the next counter. She nods
at him. He nods back. Then moves off...

As Cobb passes through baggage claim, he exchanges subtle
greetings with Eames and Yusuf.

Arthur smiles broadly at Cobb. Cobb brushes past Fischer, who
glances back at him as if thinking maybe he should know him,
then moves on...
                                                          146.

As Cobb emerges into the crowded arrivals hall, he spots
Professor Miles, waving at him...

INT. KITCHEN, COBB AND MAL'S HOUSE - DAY

Cobb enters with Miles. Drops his bags. Moves to the table,
looking out at the overgrown garden. He reaches into his
pocket, takes out his pewter spinning top, lowers it to the
table and SPINS IT- a CHILD'S SHOUT makes him look up-

Through the window, James and Philippa have run into view,
playing, THEIR FACES TURNED AWAY... Cobb STARES at the back
of his children's heads... Miles moves to the window and
KNOCKS on the glass-

James and Philippa TURN- see their Dad. He steps to the
window, watching their BRIGHT FACES SHINING as they run
towards him...

Behind him, on the table, the spinning top is STILL SPINNING.
And we-

FADE OUT.

 INDEPENDENCE DAY 
 Dean Devlin & Roland Emmerich
 
 

	AN AMERICAN FLAG

	Oddly still, posted in gray dusty sand.

	WIDEN TO REVEAL:

	EXT. LUNAR SURFACE - THE MOON

	One small step for man, one large pile of garbage for moon-
	kind.  Untouched for years, the flag stands next to the
	castoff remains of the Apollo mission.  Slowly the discarded
	equipment begins to RATTLE and SHAKE.

	AN ENORMOUS SHADOW creeps towards us blotting out the horizon,
	a loud RUMBLE is heard.

	Suddenly we are covered in DARKNESS as the SHADOW engulfs us.
	Only the lonely image of our EARTH hangs in the air, until a
	huge silhouetted OBJECT suddenly blocks our view.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. NEW MEXICO - RADIO TELESCOPE VALLEY - NIGHT

	A field of large satellite dishes scan the skies.

	Super up: S.E.T.I. INSTITUTE, NEW MEXICO

	INT. INSTITUTE - MONITORING CONTROL CENTER - SAME

	A lone TECHNICIAN works on his putting skills.  Behind him,
	wall to wall technical equipment quietly sifts through data.
	A RED LIGHT begins to flash.

	The Technician turns and slowly walks towards the source.  One
	by one a series of LIGHTS turn on.  The Technician (TECH ONE)
	grabs a pair of headphones.  His eyes widen.

	INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS - SAME

	Sleepily a SUPERVISOR picks up the phone.

				SUPERVISOR
		If this isn't an insanely
		beautiful woman, I'm hanging up.

	INT. CONTROL CENTER - SAME

				TECH ONE
		Shut up and listen.

	He holds the phone up to a speaker, increases the volume.  A
	strange FLUCTUATING TONE plays out in sequential patterns.

	INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS - SAME

	HEARING it, the Supervisor BOLTS UP, banging his head on the
	bunk above him.

	INT. CONTROL CENTER - MOMENTS LATER

	A pajama party on acid.  Five other technicians, in various
	states of undress, hover anxiously around the main console.
	The Supervisor enters, tying his robe.

				SUPERVISOR
		God, I hope it's not just another
		damned Russian spy job.

				TECH THREE
			(overlapping)
		Negative.  Computer affirms the 
		signal is unidentified.

				TECH TWO
			(hanging up the phone)
		The boy from Air Res Traffic say the 
		skies are clear.  No terrestrial
		launches.

				TECH ONE
		It's the real thing.  A radio
		signal from another world.

	The room becomes quiet as they realize that after years of
	searching the heavens, they might have finally found
	something.

				SUPERVISOR
		Let's not jump the gun.  Run a
		trajectory source computation.

	Tech Three slides over to another computer.

				SUPERVISOR (cont'd)
		I want to know exactly where it's
		coming from.

				TECH THREE
		This can't be right.

	Tech Three just stares at his screen in disbelief.

				SUPERVISOR
		What's wrong?

				TECH THREE
		Calculated distance from source is
		at three hundred and eight five
		thousand kilometers.
			(turning to Supervisor)
		It's coming from the moon.

	The Supervisor reaches over and turns up the volume on the
	speaker.  As they listen to the strange TONES we...

	INT. HALLWAY - PENTAGON - SAME

	Elevator doors OPENS revealing four star GENERAL GREY,
	Commander in Chief U.S. Space Command.  Understandably
	nervous, the COMMANDING OFFICER escorts him down the hall.

				GENERAL GREY
		Who else knows about this?

				COMMANDING OFFICER
		S.E.T.I. in New Mexico identified a
		signal but they're even more
		confused than we are.

	The General shoots him a disapproving glance.

				COMMANDING OFFICER
		Excuse me, Sir.

	He slides his security card through the lock and the doors fly
	open.

	INT. SPACE COMMAND - THE PENTAGON - CONTINUOUS

	Banks of computers, Technicians and assistants working
	feverishly through the night.  The Officers cross the room.

	Super: SPACE COMMAND - THE PENTAGON

				COMMANDING OFFICER
		Satellite reception has been
		impaired but we were able to get
		these.

	They arrive at a glass table.  The surrounding officers snap
	to attention as a SECOND OFFICER quickly brings over a large
	transparency.  We SEE a grainy image of a large vague OBJECT.

				GENERAL GREY
		Looks like a big turd.

	The two Officers exchange a glance.

				COMMANDING OFFICER
		We estimate it has a diameter of
		over five hundred and fifty
		kilometers and a mass roughly one
		fourth the size of our moon.

	The General turns to the Second Officer, concerned.

				GENERAL GREY
		A meteor?

				SECOND OFFICER
		No Sir.  Definitely not.

				GENERAL GREY
		How do you know?

				SECOND OFFICER
		Well, er... it's slowing down.

				GENERAL GREY
		It's doing what?

				SECOND OFFICER
		It's... slowing down, Sir.

	The General walks over to a phone, picks it up.

				GENERAL GREY
		Get me the Secretary of Defense.

		Then wake him up.

	INT. WHITMORE'S BEDROOM - FRE-DAWN

	Laying in bed THOMAS J. WHITMORE reads a stack of papers.  The
	phone RINGS.

				WOMAN'S VOICE
			(filtering through phone)
		Hi. It's me.

	The warm look on Whitmore's face tells us everything about how
	he feels about the woman on the other end.

				WHITMORE
		Hi honey.  What time is it there?

	INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

	Dressed in a night gown, MRS. MARGARET WHITMORE unpacks her
	briefing papers lays them out on a small desk as she talks.
	Through the window we SEE Los Angeles at night.

				MARGARET
		Two in the morning.  I know I
		didn't wake you?

				WHITMORE
			(filtered)
		As a matter of fact you did.

				MARGARET
			(smiles)
		Liar.

	INT. WHITMORE BEDROOM - SAME

	Whitmore sits up.

				WHITMORE
		I have a confession to make.
		There's a beautiful young blonde
		sleeping next to me.

	Sleeping next to him, his six-year-old daughter, PATRICIA.

				MARGARET
			(filtered)
		You didn't let her stay up
		watching T.V. all night?

				WHITMORE
		Of course not.

	The little girl stirs awake, looks up.

				PATRICIA
		Mommy?

				WHITMORE
		You're flying back right after the
		luncheon?  Okay, here she is.

	Whitmore hands her the phone and gets out of bed.  Habitably
	he turns on the television.

	T.V. - NEWS PROGRAM

	Several "Pundits" sit around a MaLaughlin-type news discussion
	program.  The picture quality is snowy, static ridden.

				PUNDIT #1
		... the inexperience in public
		office was inevitably going to
		catch up with him.  He's
		scarified his ideals for
		"politics as usual."

	Whitmore ties on his robe as he adjusts the picture quality.

				PUNDIT #2
		...I said this during the
		campaign.  Leadership as a pilot
		in the Gulf War has no
		relationship to political
		leadership.  It's a different
		animal...

	Suddenly the channel changes.  A cartoon comes on.  Whitmore
	turns to his daughter who holds he remote.

				PATRICIA
			(into phone)
		Daddy let me watch Letterman.

				WHITMORE
			Traitor.

	Whitmore exits the room.

	INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

	As Whitmore steps out of his bedroom, a Security guard snaps
	to attention.  Someone hidden behind a newspaper, sits on a
	bench.

				SECURITY GUARD
		Good morning, Mr. President.

				WHITMORE
		Good morning, George.

	The paper is dropped revealing CONSTANCE HALBROOK, mid-
	thirties, aggressive, sharp, the President's communications
	director.  Quickly she gathers her things and follows
	Whitmore.

	INT. BREAKFAST TABLE - CONTINUOUS

	Two servants are preparing breakfast as Whitmore and Constance
	enter.  Whitmore sits down, grabs a coffee.

				WHITMORE
		You're up early this morning,
		Connie.

	She tosses him one of the many newspapers in her hands.

				CONSTANCE
		They're not attacking your
		policies, they're attacking your
		age.
			(another paper; reading)
		"...addressing Congress, Whitmore
		seems less like the President and
		more like the orphan child Oliver
		asking, 'please sir, I'd like some
		more.'"

				WHITMORE
		Clever.

				CONSTANCE
		Age was never an issue when you
		stuck to your gun.  You were
		thought of as young and
		idealistic.  But the message has
		gotten lost.  There's too much
		compromise, too much politics.

				WHITMORE
			(pointedly)
		Isn't it amazing how fast everyone
		can turn against you.

	Realizing she may be pushing him too far, she hands him
	another paper.

				CONSTANCE
		Well, the Orange County Register
		has named you one of the ten
		sexiest men of the year.

				WHITMORE
		You see, substance at last.

	An AIDE appears at the doorway.

				CONSTANCE
		Excuse me, Mr. President.  It's
		the Secretary of Defense.

	Whitmore goes to the phone, picks it up.

				WHITMORE
		Yes?  Say that again?

	AN OLD RUSSIAN SATELLITE

	Drifting away from us the old Russian satellite becomes
	smaller and smaller.  We PAN with it as we SEE it's on a
	collision course with something huge.

	Suddenly the satellite EXPLODES on IMPACT with the much larger
	object that dwarfs the puny piece of hardware.  As huge as it
	is, we get the feeling we've only seen a portion of the total.

	NEW YORK SKYLINE - EARLY MORNING

	A slow crane down from the Manhattan skyline, revealing...

	EXT. CLIFFSIDE PARK - NEW JERSEY - MORNING

	With the New York skyline across the Hudson behind them, old
	men sit in this small park playing chess.  Unlike the others,
	DAVID MARTIN is in his early thirties, sixties hippie meets
	nineties yuppie nerd.

	He concentrates intensely on his next move.  MOISHE. sixties.
	smokes a cigar impatiently.

				MOISHE
		What are you waiting?  My social
		security will expire, you'll still
		be sitting there.

				DAVID
		I'm thinking.

				MOISHE
		So think already.

	David makes a move.  Instantly Moishe counters his move.
	David furls his brow in thought.

				MOISHE
		Again he's thinking.

	Moishe reaches into a paper bag and retrieves a coffee in a
	Styrofoam cup.

				DAVID
		You have any idea how long it
		takes for those things to
		decompose?

				MOISHE
		You don't move soon.  I'll begin to
		decompose.

	Just as David finally makes his move, Moishe counters again.
	David shoots him a look and stares back down to the board.

				MOISHE (cont'd)
		David, I've been meaning to talk
		with you.  It's nice you've been
		spending so much time with me,
		but...

				DAVID
		Dad, don't start.

				MOISHE
		I'm only saying, it's been what?
		Four years, you still haven't
		signed your divorce papers.

				DAVID
		Three years.

				MOISHE
		Three, four.  Move on.  It's not
		healthy.

	Moishe takes a big puff on the cigar and coughs.

				DAVID
		Look who's talking healthy.

	Suddenly David's beeper goes off.

				MOISHE
		How many times is that now?  You
		trying to get fired?

	David moves his queen.

				DAVID
		Checkmate.  See you tomorrow, Dad.

	He gives his father a quick kiss and hurries away.

				MOISHE
		That's not checkmate I can

		You could let an old man win once

	EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREETS - MINUTES LATER

	David pedals his bike through mid-town Manhattan.  He arrives
	at COMPACT CABLE SYSTEMS.

	INT. COMPACT CABLE OFFICES - LATER

	His bike hoisted on his shoulder, David squeezes through the
	revolving doors. MARTY GILBERT, short, nervous and harried,
	comes rushing over.

				MARTY
		What the hell is the point of
		having a beeper if you don't turn
		it on?

				DAVID
		It was turned on.  I was ignoring
		you.  What's the big emergency?

				MARTY
		Started this morning.  Every
		channel is making like it's
		nineteen fifty.  Snow, static, all
		kinds of distortions.  No one
		knows what the hell is going on.

	David deposits his bike in the kitchenette as Marty tosses his
	coke bottle in the trash.  David retrieves it.

				DAVID
		Damn it, Marty.  There's a reason
		we have bins labeled "recycle."

	Finding more bottles in the trash, David turns to Marty
	accusingly.

				DAVID
		What the hell is this?

				MARTY
		So sue me.

	Before David can say anything, Marty ushers him out of the
	room.

	INT. TRANSMISSION FEED - CONTINUOUS

	Technicians are working feverishly.  Clearly every monitor is
	experiencing varying degrees of signal disruption.  David
	moves over to the main console.

				DAVID
		Did you try to switch to
		transponder channels?

				MARTY
		Please, would I be this panicked
		if it was that simple?

	David examines the readouts, puzzled.

				DAVID
		Let's retrofit the dish to another
		satellite.

				MARTY
		We've tried.  It's not working.
		It's almost as though they 
		weren't even there.

	David looks up, puzzled.

				DAVID
		That's impossible.

	INT. MOBILE HOME - DAY

	Eleven-year-old TROY BRENNON tries to fix the television.
	His older brother MIGUEL, seventeen, cooks breakfast.

				MIGUEL
		Stop it.

				TROY
		It's all fuzzy.

				MIGUEL
		You're gonna break it.  Just leave
		it alone.  Here, take your
		medicine.

	Miguel sits a small bottle of medicine and a spoon down in
	front of Troy.  Troy pushes the bottle away.

				TROY
		I don't need it.

				MIGUEL
			(pushing it back)
		Just take it, dick head.
			(turning to his sister)
		Alicia!  Make sure he takes his
		medicine.

	His sister, ALICIA, fourteen, hormones kicking in, testing
	boundaries, listens to her walkman while putting on too much
	makeup.  Miguel throws a dish towel to get her as Troy hits
	the television again.

	EXT. TRAILER PARK - SAME - MORNING

	A beat up pick-up truck comes down a dirt road and skids to a
	halt on the gravel next to the Brennon Mobile Home at this
	small shabby countryside trailer park.  An angry FARMER jumps
	out, slamming his door.

	INT. BRENNON MOBILE HOME - SAME

	Alicia opens the front door and smiles flirtatiously at the
	angry farmers, LUCAS, who marches over.  Miguel edges her out
	of the doorway, wanting to handle this himself.

				MIGUEL
		Morning, Lucas.

	Lucas holds a bowl full of rotted vegetables.

				LUCAS
		You like these!  I've got a whole
		goddamned crop full!

	Unceremoniously, he dumps them at Miguel's feet.

				LUCAS (cont'd)
		Where the hell is your father?
		You know what time it is?

				MIGUEL
		He had to re-fuel.  There musta
		been a problem.

				LUCAS
		We both know what the problem is.
		He's a damned nut case, is what he
		is.  I musta been out of my mind.

	Troy SMACKS the television again.

				MIGUEL
		Troy, stop it!  I swear to God!

				LUCAS
		Miguel, if he's not in the air in
		twenty minutes, that's it.  I'm
		getting someone else.

	Lucas storms away.  Again, Troy whacks at the television.

				MIGUEL
		Stop it, Troy!  I swear to God!

	Determined, Troy HITS the television again.  This time the
	picture goes out completely.

	Rolling over us, the immense under-belly of this enormous

	Dozens of large sections begins to DISENGAGE, extracting
	themselves, twisting away from the larger bilge.

	The separated SEGMENTS themselves are enormous.  Slowly they
	twist downwards on a collision course to the blue planet

		Tell them to run with it if they

	The President, General Grey, the SECRETARY OF DEFENSE and
	White House Chief of Staff ALBERT NIMZIKI are gathered around
	the couch.

				SEC. OF DEFENSE
		At the moment, our satellites are
		somewhat unreliable.  Isn't it
		possible that thing may just pass
		us by?

				NIMZIKI
		What if it doesn't "pass us by?"
		Let's retarget some ICBMs to blow
		it out of the sky...

				GENERAL GREY
		Forgive me, but with the little
		information we do have, the only
		thing that would accomplish is
		turn one dangerous falling object
		into many.

	Just then the door opens and Constance enters.

				PRESIDENT WHITMORE
		What's the damage?

				CONSTANCE
		The press is making up their own
		stories at this point.

				NIMZIKI
			(to General Grey)
		Get on the horn with Atlantic
		Command.  Let's upgrade the
		situation to DEFCON 3.

				GENERAL GREY
		That's not your call to make, Mr.
		Nimziki.

				CONSTANCE
		Isn't that a little premature?

				NIMZIKI
		I don't think so.

				SEC OF DEFENSE
		We're two days away from the fourth 
		of July.  We have over fifty percent 
		of our armed forces on weekend leave, 
		not to mention the troops and 
		commanders we	have in town for the 
		Fourth of July	parade.  We call them 
		back now, we're sending up a major red 
		flag.

	They go quiet as Commanding Officer from Space Command dashes
	into the room.

				COMMANDING OFFICER
		Our intelligence tells us the
		object has settled into a
		stationary orbit.

				NIMZIKI
		Well that's good news.

				COMMANDING OFFICER
		Not really.

	He lays out the diagrams and photos on the table.  Everyone
	gathers around.

				COMMANDING OFFICER
		Part of it has broken off into
		nearly three dozen other pieces.

				PRESIDENT WHITMORE
		Pieces?

				COMMANDING OFFICER
		Smaller than the whole, yet over
		fifteen miles in width themselves.

				NIMZIKI
		Where are they heading?

				COMMANDING OFFICER
		They should be entering our
		atmosphere within the next twenty-
		five minutes.

	The room is silenced.  All eyes turn to the President who says
	nothing.  Nimziki leans in close to him.

				NIMZIKI
		Like it or not, we're at DEFCON 3.
		Recall the troops and put them on

		You're in meal penalty for

		No.  The good news is I found the

	As the paper is lowered we SEE the helicopter SWOOP down.  As
	it flies away we SEE...

	Covering all of Los Angeles.  This is the first time we see

	The elevator doors open and Moishe steps out, overwhelmed and
	impressed.  Constance leads them down the hall.  Moishe turns

		Look at me, I look like a

		Not on his desk.

	INT. BRIEFING ROOM - NIGHT

	On the middle monitor, through the night vision camera on the

	Constance enters and kneels down next to the President,
	whispering in his ear.  The President gets up and follows
	Constance.  Chief of Staff Nimziki objects.

				NIMZIKI
		You're leaving now?

	The President silences him with a look.  As they exit.

				CONSTANCE
		I don't know how you put up with

	Moishe, bursting, steps forward.

				MOISHE
		Moishe Martinsburg, Mr. President.

				CONSTANCE
		My ex-husband works in satellite

				PRESIDENT
		I don't have time for this...

	With a BANG, David suddenly KNOCKS everything off the
	President's desk and starts to draw on the ink blotter.

				DAVID
		It's about "Line o sight," Mr.
		President...

	David draws a circle representing Earth and a smaller circle
	just away from it.  The President reluctantly nears.

				DAVID
		...If you wanted t coordinate
		with ships all over the world, you
		couldn't send one signal to every
		place at the same time.  That's
		called line of sight...

	Drawing a line from the ship of either side of the Earth, we
	SEE that you could not send a signal to the other side.

				DAVID (cont'd)
		...you'd need to relay your signal
		using satellites...

	David draws small satellites surrounding Earth.

				DAVID (cont'd)
		...to reach each ship.  I have
		found a signal hidden inside our
		own satellite network.

	Suddenly an aide, ALEX, appears in the doorway.

				ALEX
		Excuse me, Mr. President.  They're
		starting.

	The President turns to the monitor in his office.  We SEE the
	helicopters turning on the light boards affixed to the front
	of their cockpits.  He turns back to David.

				DAVID
		Mr. President, they are using our
		own satellites against us and the
		clock is ticking.

		General Grey, co-ordinate with

		they can.

				GENERAL GREY
		But Mr. President...

				PRESIDENT
		And get those helicopters away
		from the ship.  Call them back
		immediately.

	General Grey obeys, turning to an assistant who quickly grabs
	a phone.  Nimziki steps up to the President.

				NIMZIKI
		What the hell's going on?

		We're leaving.

	An AIDE motions to the monitors.

	WHITE LIGHT suddenly emits from the side of the craft,
	illuminating the four Apache Helicopters.

	The light boards are overpowered by the bright light coming
	from the space craft.  Suddenly with a loud SCREECHING NOISE,
	the white light spills out as the huge OPENING unfolds at the
	side of the craft.

	The four helicopters have to flight to hold their positions, as
	something powerful emits from the schism in the ship.

	Then like a gigantic bug-zapper, the four pesky little Apache
	Helicopters are BLOWN OUT OF THE SKY, one by one.  They leave
	no time to retreat.

	INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

	Mrs. Whitmore packs her bag, as the horrifying image of the

	She digs her drawing of an alien out of her purse as she
	excitedly rushes up to the others.  She holds it up to the

	From out of nowhere the helicopter LIFTS up over the side of
	the building, shining its spotlight down the believers

	The President stops on his way to the Presidential helicopter

	The Police helicopter is still flashing their lights at the
	UFO believers who refuse to budge.  Suddenly the entire
	rooftop is BATHED IN WHITE LIGHT.  They all grow silent
	staring up at the craft.

	Above them another SCHISM has opened at the bottom of the
	craft, the white light spilling out.

	As though the heavens had opened, the UFO believers lift their
	arms, waiting to be taken.

		Take me!  No, take me!  Take me!

	Slowly, this beam of light from the base of the ship
	INTENSIFIES directly on the top of this building.

	As the light amplifies, the believers chant, louder and
	louder.  Suddenly the white light DISAPPEARS.  The believers
	are stunned.  In a brief moment it is replaced with a BLAST.

	A DESTRUCTION BEAM BLASTS down onto the rooftop, splintering
	everything there, Police helicopter included, into a billion
	tiny particles.

	Far off the devastation of downtown can be seen.  The WALL OF
	DESTRUCTION growing towards us.

	Reacting, Jasmine grabs Dylan and dashes out of the car.
	Boomer follows.  Every drivers who can, jumps out of their
	cars, running in all directions.

	Jasmine heads for the tunnel.

	Leaning back out, Jasmine looks for Boomer who stares at her,
	wagging his tail.

				JASMINE
		Boomer, come.  Come boy!

	Boomer LEAPS inside and Jasmine ducks to the side of the WALL
	OF DESTRUCTION hits the tunnel entrance, cars are JAMMED

		Okay, jerk-off.  Let's have some
		fun.

	The Attacker recovers, dives after Steve who flies dangerously
	close to the canyon walls.  The Attacker has trouble keeping
	up with him but does.

	Steve puts on a clinic in advanced aerobatics, banking,
	diving, swerving.

	The Attacker seems to be improving, following closer and
	closer.

	Steve ducks into smaller canyons, twisting sideways.  Still
	the Attacker follows close.

	FUEL GAUGE - RUNNING LOW

	Near empty.  Frustrated, Steve gets pissed.

				STEVE
		Damn it!

	Steve turns down a dead and side canyon.  The Attacker is
	right on his tail.

				STEVE
		Let's see if you're fully
		equipped.

	The Fighter is on a collision course with the end of the
	canyon wall.  Suddenly Steve yanks his ACES II - EJECTION
	SEAT.

	Stave SAILS UPWARDS into the air.

	The Fighter CRASHES into the canyon wall.

	The Attacker can't turn in time.  He tries to pull up, over
	it, just misses the top of the canyon wall.

	As the nose of the Attacker hits the tip of the canyon wall
	the Attacker is FLIPPED OVER, ROLLING END OVER END over the
	top of the canyon.

	The parachute on Steve's ejection seat pops OPEN.

	EXT. TOP OF CANYON - CONTINUOUS

	Rolling end over end, the Attacker is banged up BADLY as it
	finally comes to a stop.

	Not far away, Steve has a quick, hard, landing.  Rolling over,
	Steve quickly pops the buckles on the chute and frees himself.

	He stands and looks around.  Spotting the beat up and
	incapacitated alien Attacker, Steve gets an angry resolved
	look.  He marches over to the fallen alien Attacker.  He scans
	it quickly, spots a type of door that has been knocked ajar.

	With all his might, Steve YANKS the door OPEN.

	AN ALIEN

	For the first time we get a quick glance at these aliens, an
	odd hybrid creature with fluctuating skeletal structure.

	The reason we only get a quick glance is because the moment it
	turns woozily towards us, Steve rears back and SLUGS HIM IN
	THE FACE, knocking the alien totally unconscious.

	His anger finally subsiding, exhaustion taking over, Steve
	stands over the craft, slowly withdrawing the prized Victory
	Dance cigar.  He lights it and takes a long angry puff.

				STEVE
		Now that's a close encounter.

							CUT TO:

	INT. TUNNEL - PASADENA FREEWAY - ALCOVE - SAME

	It's dark.  The hole Jasmine had entered is now blocked.  She 
	pushes but it won't budge.  Exhausted, she ignites her lighter
	to get a better look around.

	As it lights we SEE that we are inside a maintenance garage.
	Jasmine rushes over to a phone but the line is dead.  Taking
	Dylan by the hand she moves to the large garage doors but she
	can't open them.

	She turns around and see a large maintenance truck, a huge
	land-mover shovel attached to the front.  She smiles.

	EXT. GARAGE DOORS - SECONDS LATER

	With a ROAR the large door BLAST APART as the maintenance
	truck SMASHES through.  Once out, Jasmine hits the brakes.

	REVERSE ANGLE - JASMINE'S POV - DEVASTATED L.A.

	Total devastation.  Remnants of cars and buildings smoldering.
	Three scattered survivors crawl from the wreckage.  A
	nightmare of destruction.  The space craft above, slowly
	leaving.

				DYLAN
		Mommy, what happened?

				JASMINE
			(astonished)
		I don't know, badly.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. DESERT - REFUGEE TRAILER CAMP - DAY

	We see dozens of trailers packing up their gear, some already
	on the road.  Miguel talks with one of the drivers, then
	hurries away, running.

	INT. BRENNON TRAILER - SAME

	Russell wipes down Troy's forehead, he's burning up.  Alicia
	brings over a cold compress.

				RUSSELL
		You know, you're just like your
		mother.  She was stubborn too.  I
		had to twist her arm to get her to
		take her medicine.

				TROY
		I'm sorry, Dad.
			(beat; scared)
		I'm not goin to die like mom, am
		I?

				ALICIA
		You're going to be fine.

	Miguel comes rushing in, pulls Russell aside.

				MIGUEL
		I couldn't find anything.
		Everyone is packing up, they're
		leaving.  Word is a space ship is
		heading this way.

				RUSSELL
		We should leave too.

				MIGUEL
		There's a group heading south,
		they said there's a hospital just
		a couple hours away.  I think we
		should follow them.

	Russell nods in agreement.  A knock on the door.  Alicia turns
	to find a handsome young boy, PHILIP in the doorway holding a
	bottle of pills.

				PHILIP
		Penicillin.  At least it will help
		keep his fever down.

				ALICIA
		It's really nice of you to help
		us.

				PHILIP
		I wish I could do more but we're
		moving out.

				ALICIA
			(too eager)
		We're going with you.  I mean,
		we're going too.

				PHILIP
		Cool.

	Alicia nods, smitten.  Philip smiles charmingly and leaves.

							CUT TO:

	INT. AIR FORCE ONE - SAME

	Back in the passenger section, the President sits with General
	Grey and Chief of Staff Nimziki.  The Technician from the
	command module is briefing them.

				TECHNICIAN
		They must be targeting our
		satellites.  We've lost all
		satellite communication, tracking
		and mapping.

				GENERAL GREY
		Have NORAD relay intelligence to
		our on board computers?

	The Technician nods and exits.  Defeated, the President slumps
	sullenly.

				GENERAL GREY
		We've moved as many of our forces
		away from the bases as possible
		but we've already sustained heavy
		losses.

	The President nods his approval absently.  Coming out of the
	bathroom, David overhears.

				NIMZIKI
		I spoke with the Joint Chief when
		they arrived at NORAD.  They
		agree, we must launch a counter
		offensive with a full nuclear
		strike.  Hit 'em with everything
		we've got.

				PRESIDENT
		Above American soil?

				NIMZIKI
		If we don't strike soon, there may
		not be much of an America left to
		defend.

	The Technician returns, his face is white with fear.

				GENERAL GREY
		What's the latest from NORAD?

				OFFICER
		It's gone, sir.  They've taken out
		NORAD.

				NIMZIKI
		That's impossible...

				GENERAL GREY
		My God, the Vice President and the 
		Joint Chiefs...

				NIMZIKI
		Mr. President, we must launch.  A
		delay now would be more costly
		than when you waited to evacuate
		the cities!

	That stings the President.  He considers the option.  David is
	shocked.

				DAVID
		You can't be seriously considering
		firing nuclear weapons?

				CONSTANCE
		David, don't...

	David pushes past her.

				DAVID
		If you fire nukes, so will the
		rest of the world.  Do you know
		what that kind of fall out will
		do?  How many innocent people...

	The General gets up running interference.  Constance tries to
	pull David back.

				GENERAL GREY
			(stern)
		Sir, i remind you that you are
		just a guest here...

				CONSTANCE
			(overlapping)
		David, please...

				DAVID
		This is insanity!  You'll kill us
		and them at the same time.
		There'll be nothing left!

				NIMZIKI
			(interrupting)
		Sit down and shut up!

	Suddenly Moishe is on his feet, interrupting.

				MOISHE
		Don't tell him to shut up!  You'd
		all be dead, were it not for my
		David.  You didn't do anything to
		prevent this!

	As everyone is about to besiege Moishe, the President tries to
	calm him down.

				PRESIDENT
		Sir, there wasn't much more we
		could have done.  We were totally
		unprepared for this.

				MOISHE
		Don't give me unprepared!  Since
		nineteen fifty whatever you guys
		have had that space ship, the
		thing you found in New Mexico.

				DAVID
			(embarrassed)
		Dad, please...

				MOISHE
		What was it, Roswell?  You had the
		space ship, the bodies, everything
		locked up in a bunker, the what is
		it, Area fifty one.  That's it!
		Area fifty one.  You knew and you
		didn't do nothing!

	For the first time in along time, President Whitmore smiles.

				PRESIDENT
		Regardless of what the tabloids
		have said, there were never any
		space crafts recovered by the
		government.  Take my word for it,
		there is no Area 51 and no
		recovered space ship.

	Chief of Staff Nimziki suddenly clears his throat.

				NIMZIKI
		Uh, excuse me, Mr. President, but
		that's not entirely accurate.

	The President and General Grey turn to Nimziki, shocked.

	SMASHED AND BURNED OUT CARS

	laying across the roadway.  Suddenly SMASH, Jasmine's
	maintenance truck BLASTS through.

	EXT. HIGHWAY - CITY LIMITS - SAME

	With the massive devastation in the b.g., Jasmine drives the
	maintenance truck down the highway.  In the back, the few
	survivors she's found.

	In the back, four INJURED PASSENGERS lay across the flatbed as
	a thin, older man, TEDDY tends to them.

	INT. MAINTENANCE TRUCK - SAME

	Jasmine spots a TALL MAN, his closes in tatters RUNNING down
	the highway, his arms in the air.

				TALL MAN
		The end has come!  He speaketh
		his word and the end hast come!

	Jasmine pulls up along side him.

				JASMINE
		Hop on.  We're heading out to El
		Toro.

				TALL MAN
		You cannot defy what has come, it
		is the end!

	The tall man moves off, screaming to the heavens.  As Jasmine
	watches him drift away she SEES...

	OVERTURNED MILITARY HELICOPTER

	Still smoldering from the crash.  A woman can be seen inside,
	still alive.  Jasmine jumps out.

				JASMINE
		Give me a hand.

	Teddy joins Jasmine as they pry open the door.  Inside, the
	pilots have been killed, but Mrs. Whitmore, THE FIRST LADY,
	lays there in great pain, blood across her blouse.

				JASMINE
		Let's get her out of here.

	They erase her from the wreckage, laying her on the
	ground.  Dylan comes over, standing next to his mother.

				TEDDY
		She's bleeding pretty bad.

	Suddenly we HEAR the CLICKING of a rifle COCKING.

				MALE VOICE (O.S.)
		Who's got the key?

	Jasmine turns and see a REDNECK leveling his rifle at her.
	Behind him a small damaged sports car pulls up, packed to the
	gills with stolen, looted appliances.

				REDNECK
			(yelling to pals)
		Looks like I've solved our
		transportation problem.

				JASMINE
		Hey, you're welcome to come with
		us.  We're leaving here anyway...

				REDNECK
		We're not.  Give me the key.
			(yelling back)
		Get 'em off.

	Two GUYS rush from their vehicle over to the maintenance
	truck, pulling the injured off the tailback.

				TALL MAN (O.S.)
		Repent!  Sinners!  Repent!  The
		end hast come!

	Running up from behind, the Tall Man comes over screaming.
	The Redneck turns his gun on him.

				REDNECK
		Back off.  This ain't your
		business.

	As the Redneck is distracted, Jasmine spots the bag of
	fireworks protruding out of Dylan's back pocket.

				TALL MAN
		You cannot go against the word,
		brother.

				REDNECK
		Sure I can.

	The Redneck SHOOTS the Tall Man.  His buddies laugh.

				REDNECK (cont'd)
		Now give me that key, bitch.

	As he turns back to Jasmine, Boomer starts BARKING wildly.
	Just as he turns to shoot the dog, Jasmine lights a key ROCKET
	from the fireworks bag.  The rocket BLASTS into the Redneck,
	his shirt IGNITING ON FIRE.

	The Redneck drops the rifle, attempting to put out the flames,
	his cronies rush to his aid.  Jasmine picks up the gun, moves
	in on them.

				JASMINE
		This "bitch" was born in  Alabama
		with a Daddy who loved to hunt.
			(cocking the weapon)
		So don't think for one second that
		I don't know how to use this.

	She FIRES the rifle.  Quickly the rednecks scamper away.

						CUT TO:

	EXT. DRY LAKE - DESERT - LATER

	Dragging a heavy bundle wrapped in his parachute, Steve
	marches across the desert floor.  The alien ARM/TENTACLE
	dangles out of the parachute.

	Exhausted, Steve stops to wipe his brow.  He hears something,
	turns around.

	STEVE'S POV - THE TRAILER ARMADA

	Several hundred of the trailers from the refugee camp are
	headed en mass towards him.  Smiling, Steve signals them.

	The trailers pull up on either side, surrounding him.  Miguel
	leans out of his trailer.

				MIGUEL
			(sarcastic)
		Need a lift?

				STEVE
		When I flew overhead, I saw some
		kind of base, not far.

	Confused, Miguel checks his map.

				MIGUEL
		It's not on the map.

				STEVE
		Trust me, it's there.

	EXT. AIR FORCE ONE - LATER

	Flying over the desert, Air Force One sails over an immense
	valley, Area 51 below - hangars, a few buildings, a small air
	strip, not much.

	Super: N.I.A. Base - "Area 51", Nevada

	EXT. RUNWAY - LATER

	Air Force One lands.  Wheels touch down, skid.

	INT. HANGAR - LATER

	The large hangar doors open and Air Force One is rolled
	inside.  The President and his entourage are met by a
	contingent of base personnel led by field operative, LT.
	MITCHELL.  He escorts them to a side hallway.

	INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

	Lt. Mitchell walks over to an odd wall switch as the President
	and his entourage wait in the center of the hall.  With a loud
	hydraulic HUM, the entire hallway begins to SINK DOWN, an
	enormous ELEVATOR.

				PRESIDENT
		Why the hell wasn't I told about
		this place?

				NIMZIKI
		Two words, Mr. President.
		Plausible deniability.

	General Grey shoots Nimziki a pissed off look.  When the
	elevator stops, a door SLIDES open.

	INT. RESEARCH FACILITIES - CONTINUOUS

	Stepping out of the elevator, they walk into a large state of
	the art, sterile clean research facility.  It is amazingly
	well staffed and organized.

				PRESIDENT
		I don't understand.  Where did all
		this come from?  How did this get
		funded?

				MOISHE
		You didn't think they actually
		spent ten thousand dollars for a
		hammer and thirty thousand for a
		toilet seat, did you?

	The President shoots him a look.  They are greeted by a group
	of SCIENTISTS in whit coats led by, DR. OKUN.

				MITCHELL
		Mr. President, I'd like to
		introduce you to Dr. Okun.  He's
		been heading up our research here
		for the last fifteen years.

	Dr. Okun is an odd, hyper-energetic man who's spent too much
	time in isolation.

				OKUN
		Mr. President, a real pleasure.
		They don't let us out much, you
		you.

				PRESIDENT
			(uncomfortable)
		Yes.

				OKUN
		Well, I guess you'd like to see
		the big tamale?  Follow me.

	They walk up a ramp at the end of the room.  Large heavily
	enforced doors SLIDE open.

	INT. STORAGE LAB - CONTINUOUS

	The group steps inside and nearly gasps at...

	THE ALIEN ATTACKER

	Just like the one that chased Steve.  The entourage stares in
	horror and wonder.  We can SEE the patch-work repairs they've
	made on the ship over the years.

				OKUN
		She's a beaut, ain't she?

	Moishe leans close to David and Constance.

				MOISHE
			(smug)
		Never any space ships recovered by
		the government, huh?

				PRESIDENT
		We've had this for forty years and
		you don't know anything about
		them?

				OKUN
		Hell no, we know tons about them.
		The nearest stuff has only
		happened in the last few days.

	The President slowly walks around the ship as Okun talks.
	David, mouth agape, just stares at it.

				OKUN (cont'd)
		See, we can't duplicate their type
		of power so we've never been able
		to experiment.  But since these
		guys started showing up, all the
		gizmos inside turned on.  The last
		twenty four hours have been really
		exciting!

				PRESIDENT
			(exploding)
		People are dying out there.  I
		don't think "exciting" is the word
		I'd choose to describe it!

	The room goes silent, letting the President blow off steam.

				PRESIDENT
			(calming)
		What can you tell us about the
		enemy we're facing?

				OKUN
		Not all too dissimilar to us.
		Breathes oxygen, comparable
		tolerances to heat,
		cold...probably why they're
		interested in our planet.
			(suddenly excited)
		Hey, you wanna see them?

	INT. MEDICAL RESEARCH VAULT - MOMENTS LATER

	The lights slowly TURN ON, illuminated the vault.  Okun leads
	the group to a sealed partition.

				OKUN
		This is vault, or as some of us
		have come to call it, the "freak
		show."

	Okun hits a switch and the sealed partition lifts revealing...

	FORMALDEHYDE TANKS - ALIENS

	Three dead aliens float in the milky formaldehyde tanks.  The
	murky fluid and condensation obstructs our view.  What we do
	see is not pretty.

				OKUN
		When we found them they were
		wearing bio-mechanical suits.
		Once we got them off, we were able
		to learn a great deal about their
		anatomy; eyes, ears, bipolar
		digestive system... no vocal cords
		though.  We're assuming they
		communicate with each other
		through other means.

	David cannot contain his fascination.  He steps forward.

				DAVID
		What kind of other means?  Hand
		signals, body language?

				OKUN
		Some kind of extra sensory
		perception.  Telepathy.

				PRESIDENT
		Can they be killed?

				OKUN
		These three died in the crash.
		Their bodies are as frail as our
		own.  You just have to get past
		their technology, which is, I'm
		sorry to say, far more advanced.

	The President turns to David.

				PRESIDENT
		You unlocked a part of that
		technology.  You cracked their
		code.

				DAVID
		All I did was stumble onto their
		signal.  I don't know how helpful
		I can be...

				PRESIDENT
		Show them what you've discovered.
		Work together.  We've got to find
		a way to beat them.

	EXT. SECURITY GATE - SAME

	Four armed GUARDS watch the gate.  An armada of trucks and
	trailers heads right for them.  They move into position to
	block their entrance as a blue pick-up skids to a halt before
	them.  Steve stands up from the back of the pick up.

				GUARD
		Sorry, Lt. Colonel, I can't open
		the gates without clearance.

				STEVE
		You want to see my clearance?

	Impatiently Steve grabs the Guard by the collar, pulling him
	over the side of the truck putting him face to face with the
	bundled parachute in the flatbed.  Steve rips the fabric aside
	revealing...

	THE ALIEN CREATURE

	Still unconscious, the alien stirs.  The Guard JUMPS BACK,
	shitting in his pants.  Quickly he signals for the other to
	open the gate.

	The armada quickly drives past.

	BLACKNESS

	Total darkness.  Suddenly light pours in as a  door is open.
	We see the faces of Okun, David and three technicians all
	peering at us with inquisitive expressions.

				OKUN
		See the gizmos flashing?

	REVERSE - INSIDE ALIEN CRAFT

	Sure enough, tons of gizmos with lights flashing.  High tech
	meets organic organisms.  This alien ship looks familiar to
	our own technology and completely different at the same time.

				OKUN (cont'd)
		We've been working around the
		clock trying to get a fix on all
		this crap.  Some stuff we figured
		out right away.

	David climbs in, fascinated.  He touches everything.  Okun
	points to everything as he describes it.

				OKUN (cont'd)
		This thing we're pretty sure is
		the life support for the cabin,
		this do-hickey over here is
		connected with the engines, this
		crap...we have no idea what that
		stuff is for.

	David is transfixed by it.  He stares at the small screens
	with flashing light patterns on them.

				OKUN (cont'd)
		But this over here is clearly what
		they use to navigate and guide the
		craft.

	But David still stares at the small screens.

				DAVID
		Someone grab my laptop for me?

	One of the technicians rushes off as Okun leans close.

				OKUN
		Find something interesting?

				DAVID
		Maybe.

	The technician hands David his retrieved laptop which he
	quickly flips open and turns on.

				DAVID
		These patterns here, they're
		repeating sequentially, just
		like...

	David turns his laptop around for Okun to see.  The pattern on
	David's laptop flashes identically as the alien screen.

				DAVID (cont'd)
		...their countdown signal.  Their
		using this frequency for computer
		communications.  It's how they co-
		ordinate their ships.

				OKUN
		You know, you're really starting
		to make us look bad.

	The two men exchange a smile.  Another TECHY pops his head
	inside.

				TECHY
			(out of breath)
		They got one!  They got one,
		alive!

	INT. HALLWAY OFF MAIN HANGAR - AREA 51 - SAME

	The bundled alien lays on a stretcher that's wheeled quickly
	into the hall.  Okun and his staff surround it.  Trailing
	behind them is Steve, Russell and Miguel.

				OKUN
		How long has it been unconscious?

				RUSSELL
		Excuse me Doctor...

				STEVE
		Three hours.

				OKUN
		Get him into containment, stat.

				RUSSELL
		My boy is very sick, he needs
		immediate attention.

	Okun ignores Russell, hitting the elevator switch on the wall,
	the room begins its hydraulic HUM.

				OKUN
		He's dying out.  I want him
		sprayed down with saline.

	Russell SLAMS his fist against the switch, the room stops.  He
	GRABS a doctor nearby, gets in his face.

				RUSSELL
		My boys is slipping into a diabetic
		coma.  If you don't do something
		about it right now he will die.

	Miguel is surprised and proud of Russell as he holds DOCTOR
	ISAACS, meaning business.

				DR. ISAACS
		O'Haver, Miller, come with me.
			(to Russell)
		Take us to him.

	EXT. ROAD - MAINTENANCE TRUCK - NIGHT

	Headlights pierce the darkness as the maintenance truck rolls
	to a stop.  Jasmine climbs down out of the truck, her face
	ashen.

	She walks past a sign reading: El Toro Marine Corps Air
	Station.  Tears begin to roll from her eyes.  We follow her
	gaze to see...

	EXT. EL TORO MARINE CORPS AIR STATION - CONTINUOUS

	The entire facility is smoldering, the last remnants of the
	fire burning itself to extinction.  Jasmine is devastated.

							CUT TO:

	INT. AREA 51 COMMAND CENTER - NIGHT

	General Grey and Nimziki are in a heated argument.

				GENERAL GREY
		You were the head of the National
		Intelligence Agency!  You knew all
		about this.  When were you
		planning on informing the rest of
		us!?

				NIMZIKI
		It had been deemed classified.

				GENERAL GREY
		Christ, why didn't you say
		anything about this when they
		first arrived?  You could have
		warned us before we launched a
		counter attack that cost us
		hundreds of American pilots!

	Just then the President enters along with Constance and some
	other ADVISORS.  He examines a paper map of the United States,
	tacked to the wall, each major city circled in black.

				PRESIDENT
		Atlanta, Chicago and Philadelphia,
		destroyed?

				GENERAL GREY
			(composing himself)
		And there are scattered reports of
		sightings over Miami, Ft. Worth,
		And Memphis.

	The President and his team take seats at the large conference
	table.

				GENERAL GREY (cont'd)
		We've learned that NATO and
		western allied installations were
		the firs to be taken out.  We
		were next.  They knew exactly where
		and how to hit us.

	Grey sneaks an accusatory glare at Nimziki.

				PRESIDENT
		And our forces?

				GENERAL GREY
		We're down to approximately
		fifteen percent, Sir.
			(beat)
		If you calculate the time it takes
		them to destroy a city and move
		on, we're looking at world wide
		destruction of every major city
		within the next thirty six hours.

				PRESIDENT
		We're being exterminated.

	The room is quiet.  Constance runs her fingers through her
	hair.  The door to the room opens and Lt. Mitchell enters with 
	Steve.

				MITCHELL
		Mr. President, this is Lt.
		Colonel Steven Hill.

	The President quickly gets to his feet, anxiously shaking
	Steve's hand.

				PRESIDENT
		Lieutenant, congratulations.

				STEVE
		Thank you, sir.

				PRESIDENT
		Where is the prisoner now?

				MITCHELL
		We have him in isolation.  The
		doctors are very hopeful he will
		survive.

				PRESIDENT
		I'd like to see him.

				MITCHELL
		Yes, sir.

	The General is concerned but the President is determined.
	They head for the door.

				STEVE
			(to General Grey)
		General, I'm anxious to get back
		to El Toro.

				GENERAL GREY
		Didn't anyone tell you?  I'm
		sorry.  El Toro was destroyed in

	Steve is shattered, he had no idea.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. EL TORO BASE - NIGHT

	The injured are gathered around a small camp fire.  Jasmine
	walks up, dumping a box full of charred can goods.

				JASMINE
		These should last us a while.

	As Margaret tries to move, she winces in pain.  Jasmine rushes
	to her aid.  The color from her face drained, Margaret looks
	like she's taking a turn for the worse.

				JASMINE
		Don't move.  Stay still.

	Jasmine adjusts the bandages as Margaret turns and see Dylan
	curled up next to Boomer, too adorable.  Slowly he starts to
	wake up.

				MARGARET
		Your son.

				JASMINE 
		He's my angel.

				MARGARET
		Was his father stationed here?

				JASMINE
		He wasn't his father.  I was kinda
		hoping he'd want the job, though.

	Jasmine becomes sad, remembering.  Margaret changes the
	subject.

				MARGARET
		So, what do yo do for a living?

				JASMINE
		I'm a dancer.

				MARGARET
		Really?  Ballet?

				JASMINE
			(laughs)
		No.  Exotic.

				MARGARET
		Oh.  Sorry.

				JASMINE
		Don't be.  I'm not.  It's good

			(re: Dylan)
		'Side, he's worth it.

	The bandages changed, Jasmine sits down next to Margaret.

				MARGARET
		And when the dancing's over?  What

				JASMINE
		Funny, it used to scare me when I

		Guess it doesn't really matter
		anymore.

	Dylan comes walking over.

				JASMINE
		Dylan, come here.  I want you to
		meet the First Lady.

				MARGARET
			(surprised)
		I thought you didn't recognize me.

				JASMINE
		Didn't want to say anything.  I
		voted for the other guy.

							CUT TO:

	INT. CONTAINMENT LAB - NIGHT

	Okun and two Medical assistants examine the alien creature.
	His arms and chest have been strapped down to the examining
	table.

	For the first time we get a good look at the head of this
	creature, long tentacled-type cords interlocked, covering the
	face.  The doctors attach clamps to each of the cords.

				OKUN
		Everyone ready?

	The doctors exchange nervous glances, nod to each other.  At
	the same moment all they pull on the clamps, unraveling the
	interlocked cords.  As the cords unravel, we SEE that this is
	in fact a bio-mechanical SUIT as we REVEAL...

	THE ALIEN

	Beneath the cords lay the unconscious face of the alien, his
	skin translucent, his body fluids, capillaries, muscle tissue,
	alien's skin.

				OKUN
		Do we have life support monitors
		recording?

				MED ASSIST #2
		Yes.  If we fuck up it'll all be
		on tape.

				OKUN
		Can we get some ventilation in
		here?  I can't take this smell.

				MED ASSIST #2
		They've conquered space travel but
		not b.o.

	As Okun begins to put on a pair of surgical gloves he suddenly
	grabs his forehead.

				MED ASSIST #1
		You all right?

				OKUN
		Yeah.  It's just that stink gives
		me a headache.

				MED ASSIST #2
		He's moving!

	Instantly everyone's attention is riveted to the arm of the
	alien as it moves beneath the sheet.  Unseen by the others the
	alien creature's EYES OPEN.

	Another SHARP PAIN hits Okun who SCREAMS, stumbling backwards
	grabbing his head.  The others turn in surprise.

	THE ALIEN

	Suddenly SPRINGS up, the restraining straps SNAPPING.  Before
	Med #2 can react, one of the alien's tentacles SMASHES her
	across the face.  She is sent sprawling backwards.

	LOW ANGLE - THE ALIEN

	Standing before her.  In a wink of an eye, he ATTACKS, leaping
	on her.

	Together they TUMBLE back into a formaldehyde tank.  Hoses
	are ripped from their sides and STEAM pours out.  We get quick
	glimpse of their struggle as the steam engulfs them.

	INT. HALLWAY - SAME

	Mitchell leads the Presidential party down the hall.  They
	turn and enter the Medical lab.

	INT. CONTAINMENT LAB - CONTINUOUS

	The group slows as they enter the room.  They see the
	containment room through the glass is covered with white
	steam.  Nothing can be seen.  It's eerily quiet.

	Cautiously they approach.  Suddenly Okun is SLAMMED AGAINST
	the glass partition, the creature's tentacles wrapped around
	him.  Pressed firmly to the glass, his eyes are shut, his
	expression pained, but when he speaks the voice is angry.

				OKUN/ALIEN
		Release...me.

				MITCHELL
		Open the door.  Get him out of
		there.

	Suspicious, General Grey stops him.

				GENERAL GREY
		Wait.
			(to Okun)
		Can you hear me?

				OKUN/ALIEN
		Will kill...release me.  Now!

	They follow the tentacles with their eyes, up to the ceiling
	of the containment tank.  Suddenly the alien LEAPS DOWN,
	startling them, landing before them behind the glass.

	We see he's holding Okun against the glass, speaking THROUGH
	HIM.  This is the first real good look we get at the this bizarre
	creature.  Everyone in the room is repulsed and compelled by
	it at the same time.

	EXT. AREA 51 - NIGHT

	Through the hundreds of campers and trailers parked outside,
	Steve runs past until he reaches the open tarmac.

	A transport helicopter sits on the edge of the landing area.
	Steve runs up to it and climbs inside.

	INT. TRANSPORT HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS

	Steve quickly starts it engines, preparing to take off.  A
	SOLDIER rushes over to the cockpit.

				SOLIDER
			(yelling)
		What the hell are you doing?  Get
		out of there!

				STEVE
		I'm just going to borrow it.

	The Soldier pulls out his pistol, taking aim.

				SOLIDER
		No you're not, sir.

				STEVE
		You really want to shoot me?

	Steve stares the Soldier down.  Reluctantly he lowers his gun.

				SOLDIER
		Shit.  I'm gonna catch the hell for
		this.

	Steve smiles and gives him a quick salute then TAKES OFF.
	Quickly the bird RISES UP and darts off into the night.

	INT. MEDICAL LAB - SAME

	The President has moved closer to the glass and is talking
	with the alien.  The alien uses Okun like a ventriloquist's
	dummy.

				PRESIDENT
		Why did you people come here?

				OKUN/ALIEN
		Air...water...your "sun."

				PRESIDENT
		Where do your people come from?
			(no answer)
		Where is your home?

				OKUN/ALIEN
		Here...now.

				PRESIDENT
		And before here?

				OKUN/ALIEN
		Many worlds...

				PRESIDENT
		Can we negotiate a truce?  is
		there room for co-existance?
			(no answer)
		Can there be peace between us?

				OKUN/ALIEN
		Peace?  No peace.

				PRESIDENT
		What do you want us to do?

				OKUN/ALIEN
		Die.

	The Alien moves closer to the glass staring at the President.
	Suddenly the President clutches his head in pain.

				NIMZIKI
		Mr. President?

				OKUN/ALIEN
		We kill you...all.

	The pain becomes more severe and the President SCREAM OUT.
	There is general panic as people rush to the President's side.

				GENERAL GREY
			(to Mitchell)
		Is that glass bullet proof?

				MITCHELL
		No sir.

	The General draws his pistol.  Mitchell and the other military
	officers follow his lead.  Simultaneously they all begin to
	FIRE!

	The glass SHATTERS into a billion pieces.  The Alien is cut to
	ribbons, falling backwards.

	The President collapses.  So does Okun.  A STAFFER rushes over
	to Okun, checks his pulse.

				STAFFER
		He's dead.

	General Grey moves to the President who slowly recovers.

				GENERAL GREY
		Mr. President, are you okay?

	Woozily the President sits up, a strange look in his eye.

				PRESIDENT
		He wanted me to understand.  He
		communicated with me.
			(turning to Grey)
		They're like locusts.  They travel
		from planet to planet, their whole
		civilization.  After they've
		consumed every natural resource
		they move on.  And we're next.

	The President stands with a new resolve.  He stares at the
	dead alien on the floor.

				PRESIDENT
			(cold)
		Prepare a nuclear strike.

	INT. STORAGE LAB - MINUTES LATER

	The research staff are working near the recovered alien
	attacker.  Constance comes rushing in.  She looks around for
	David.  Through the glass of one of the offices she sees him.

	INT. OFFICES - CONTINUOUS

	Holding a bottle of Jack Daniels, David fishes through a small
	refrigerator as Constance enters.

				DAVID
		Just my luck, no ice.

				CONSTANCE
		I take it you've heard.

				DAVID
		A toast to the end of the world.

	David toasts her with the bottle, takes a swig.

				CONSTANCE
		He didn't come to this decision
		lightly.

	David nods, he doesn't want to argue.  He smiles cynically.

				DAVID
		You still believe in him.

				CONSTANCE
		He's a good man.

				DAVID
		Better be.  You left me for him.

				CONSTANCE
		I wanted a career.  Didn't you
		ever want to be part of something
		special?

	David stares daggers at her.

				DAVID
		I was part of something special.

	Constance realizes he means their marriage.  She's hurt him
	and can see it.  She turns and leaves.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. DARK SKIES - NIGHT

	A black shadow is vaguely seen in the dark night.  As we pass
	some moonlit clouds we recognize the shadow is, in fact, a B-2
	STEALTH BOMBER.

	As we WIDEN, we see that the bomber is part of a squadron of
	eight.  These mighty winged giants fly together in attack
	formation.

	INT. COMMAND CENTER - ARE 51 - SAME

	A tracking screen comes to life, eight blips flashing.

				TECHNICIAN #1
		We've got the AWAC on line.
		Signals coming in low.

	The President's group takes their position behind the
	technicians.

	EXT. BLACK SKIES - NIGHT

	The eight B-2 Stealth Bombers break formation, each heading
	off to their different target destinations.

	INT. COMMAND CENTER - SAME

	On a large map, we see the eight target destinations and the
	planes heading for them.

				PRESIDENT
		Who will we reach first?

				COMMANDER
		Houston, Texas.  Intercept ETA,
		six minutes and counting down.

				PRESIDENT
		Oh my God, Houston.

				GENERAL GREY
		The major cities have been
		deserted.  Civilian casualties
		should be at a minimum, sir.

	One map screen, ENLARGES, tracking the bomber on route to
	Houston.

	EXT. LIQUOR STORE - OUTSIDE HOUSTON - NIGHT

	Looters take all they can carry through the broken glass store
	front.  A large heavily armored TANK rolls up front.

	INT. ARMORED TANK - SAME

	Nervous military technicians work equipment as their TANK
	COMMANDER pulls down a periscope.

	TANK COMMANDER POV - SPACE SHIP OVER HOUSTON

	Through the periscopes cross-hairs we SEE downtown Houston,
	the City Destroyer space ships settling in above it.

	EXT. B-2 STEALTH BOMBER - SAME

	Silhouetted against the shimmering waters on the bay, they
	Stealth Bomber can be seen as it approaches Houston.

	INT. B-2 STEALTH BOMBER - COCKPIT - SAME

	The flight crew works their computers (similar readouts are
	seen at command center).  The Multi-Function Display (MFD)
	flashing before each crew member.

				PILOT
		We have laser targeting locked.

	INT. COMMAND CENTER - SAME


				TECHNICIAN #1
		Target is locked, sir.  Do you
		wish to deploy?

	Everyone turns to the President who does not answer.

				GENERAL GREY
		Mr. President, do you wish to
		deploy.

	Still there is no answer.
				NIMZIKI
		Mr. President?

				PRESIDENT
			(softly)
		Deploy.

	EXT. B-2 STEALTH BOMBER - WEAPONS BAY - SAME

	The bay doors open and a large Tactical Nuclear Cruise Missile
	drops down, flies parallel with the bomber as it adjusts its
	radar and laser tracking.  Suddenly it SHOOTS OFF.

	The bomber BANKS AWAY.

	INT. B-2 STEALTH BOMBER - SAME

	We see the horizon twisting away as we bank off from target.

				PILOT
		She's away.

	INT. COMMAND CENTER - SAME

	On the big map we see one FLASHING target line tracking the
	missile as it approaches Houston.

				PRESIDENT
			(to himself)
		May our children forgive us.

	INT. ARMORED TANK - OUTSIDE HOUSTON - NIGHT

	The Tank Commander readjusts the periscope.

	TANK COMMANDER POV - SPACE SHIP & B-2 STEALTH BOMBER

	We follow the Cruise Missile as it guides itself on a direct
	collision course with the space craft.

	INT. COMMAND CENTER - SAME

	The targeting map shows how close the missile is, nearly on
	top of the target.  Everyone in the room holds their breath.

	EXT. SPACE CRAFT - SAME

	The nuke speeds closer.  It HITS the protective shield and
	DETONATES.  A FLASH OF LIGHT.

	WIDE ANGLE - HOUSTON

	With the B-2 Stealth Bomber in the foreground, the city behind
	it vanishes in a FLASH OF LIGHT, blinding us.

	INT. COMMAND CENTER - SAME

	We can see the extent of the explosion on the targeting map,
	tracking it -- an expanding ring around Houston.

				NIMZIKI
			(excited)
		It's a hit!

	The others are still waiting.  The monitor shows the night
	vision picture of the growing MUSHROOM CLOUD rising above the
	city.

	EXT. HOUSTON - WIDE - SAME

	The MUSHROOM CLOUD engulfs the horizon.

	EXT. ARMORED TANK - SAME

	Rocked by the massive explosion, the shock wave ROCKS the
	armored tank but doesn't destroy it.

	INT. ARMORED TANK - SAME

	The men inside are KNOCKED around, hard from the explosion.

	INT. COMMAND CENTER - SAME

				NIMZIKI
		We got the bastards!

	General Grey shoots Nimziki a look.  The President holds up a
	hand, silencing the room.

				PRESIDENT
		Can they see it?  Did it destroy
		the target?

	TANK COMMANDER'S POV THROUGH PERISCOPE - SAME

	As the cloud begins to dissipate we see THE SPACE CRAFT IS
	STILL THERE, completely unharmed.

	INT. ARMORED TANK - SAME

				TANK COMMANDER
		Negative.  Target remains.

	INT. COMMAND CENTER - SAME

	On the monitors as well, we can see the target remain.  The
	air is let out of the room, everyone deflated.

				PRESIDENT
		Call them back.

				NIMZIKI
		The other bombers might have more
		luck.  We shouldn't just give
		up...

				PRESIDENT
		I said call them back.

	As the technicians call the bombers away, the President sinks
	into a depression.  His last hope of survival gone.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. EL TORO MARINE CORPS AIR STATION - NIGHT

	Jasmine keeps Margaret company as the rest sleep around the
	last flames of their campfire.  From the worried expression on
	Jasmine's face we can tell that Margaret has gotten worse, her
	wounds bleeding badly.

	A WIND kicks up, the sound of an ENGINE approaching.  Jasmine
	squints her eyes looking up into the wind when a BRIGHT LIGHT
	engulfs her.

	JASMINE'S POV - LIGHTS - NIGHT

	Bright lights in the sky growing nearer.  Slowly the others
	begin to wake up, frightened as the lights INTENSIFY.

	The others slowly begin to retreat but Jasmine stands, staring
	defiantly.  A smile creeps across her face as she sees that
	the lights belong to...

	TRANSPORT HELICOPTER

	The Transport Helicopter touches down and Steve leaps out,
	racing towards Jasmine.  Overwhelmed, Jasmine jumps into his
	arms.

	They kiss.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

	The double doors burst open as the President carrying his

		How is she?

				ISAACS
		I'm sorry, Mr. President.  If only
		we could have gotten to her
		sooner.

	The President puts his daughter down as he sees...

	PRESIDENT'S POV - MARGARET

	Margaret lays in bed, doctors and nurses surrounding her.
	Patricia rushes over.

				ISAACS
		She's bleeding internally.
		There's nothing else we can do.

	Stunned, the President watches as Patricia hugs her mother.

				MARGARET
		Hiya Munchkin.

				PATRICIA
		Mommy, we were worried.  We didn't
		know where you were.

				MARGARET
		I'm right here, baby.

	Recovering, the President nods for the doctors to leave the
	room.  As they begin to march out, he makes his way over to
	his wife and daughter.

				PRESIDENT
		Honey, why don't you wait outside
		so Mommy can get some rest.

	Patricia kisses her mother, says goodbye and leaves.  Out of
	sight, Margaret winces, fading away.  The President grabs her
	hand for support.  She squeezes tightly.

				MARGARET
			(through tears)
		I'm scared, Tom.

				PRESIDENT
		It's okay.  The doctors said
		you're going to be just fine.

	Margaret smiles at the man she knows all too well.

				MARGARET
		Liar.

	The look between them says more than any words.

	INT. HALLWAY - OUTSIDE MARGARET'S ROOM - LATER

	The President exits the room, overcome with emotion.
	Constance, the doctors and some medical crew move to comfort
	him.  He holds them off with a gesture.

	He looks up and sees Jasmine, Steve and Dylan down the hall.
	He pushes through the crowd and makes his way over to them.

				JASMINE
		I'm so sorry.

				PRESIDENT
		I just wanted to thank you.
		You're a very brave woman.

	Across the hall, Patricia sits in a chair, waiting.  Whitmore

	Topples over with a BANG!  A foot steps in and starts kicking
	trash all over.

	EXT. AREA 51 - NIGHT

	David is drunkenly knocking everything over, making a gigantic
	mess.  Moishe comes up behind, restraining him.

				MOISHE
		David, David!  What the hell are
		you doing!?

				DAVID
		I'm making a mess.

				MOISHE
		This I can see.

				DAVID
		We've gotta burn the rain forest,
		Pops.  Dump toxic waste, pollute
		the air, rip up the ozone.  Maybe
		if we screw this planet up enough
		they won't want it anymore.

				MOISHE
		David, you're drunk.

	David slips, falls on his ass, hard.  Moishe helps him back up
	on his feet.

				MOISHE
		I think you better sleep this off.
		Go back inside before you catch a
		cold.

	Slowly David looks up towards Moishe, an idea.

				DAVID
		Pops, you're a genius!

				MOISHE
		What'd I say?

				DAVID
		A cold?  Of course.

	Sobered, David jumps kisses his father and bolts inside.

							CUT TO:

	INT. STORAGE LAB - DAY

	A large crowd has been gathered here at the lab.  General Grey
	and Nimziki walk up to Constance.

				NIMZIKI
		All right, Connie, we're here.
		What's this all about?

				CONSTANCE
		I really have no idea.  He just
		said to bring everyone down here.

	Steve shows Dylan the alien space craft.

				DYLAN
		Does that thing fly in outer
		space?

	Steve loos up at the craft admiringly.

				STEVE
		It certainly does.

	When the President enters a technician rushes over and knocks
	on the hatch door on the alien attacker.  The door swings open
	and David climbs down.

	Grabbing a coke can from the "recycle" trash bin, David places
	the empty can on top of the alien attacker.  David turns and
	faces the gathering.

				DAVID
		Could anyone please step back
		away from the craft?

	They do and David nods to a Technician inside the craft.  The
	Technician disappears inside, closing the door behind him.  A
	loud HUM emits from the craft.  David has to yell over it.

				DAVID
		Lt. Mitchell, would you mind
		drawing your pistol?

				MITCHELL
		What?

				DAVID
		From where you're standing, do you
		think you could shoot that can off
		the alien craft?

	Mitchell shrugs affirmatively.  David gestures for him to try.
	Taking aim, Mitchell SHOOTS.

	The bullet RICOCHETS off the attacker's protective shield.
	Several people in the crowd dock, afraid of being hit by the
	errant bullet.

				DAVID
		Sorry 'bout that.  You see, it's
		protected by the craft's shields.
		We can't penetrate their defenses.

				NIMZIKI
		We know that already.  What's your
		point?

	David walks over to his laptop, now connected directly to the
	craft by cables and starts typing furiously.

				DAVID
		My point is if we can't beat their
		defenses, then we must get around
		them.

	David stops typing and stares at his wrist watch, silently
	counting down.

				DAVID
		Lt. Mitchell, would you please try
		to shoot it again?

	Reluctantly Mitchell obliges.  This time the can is BLOWN OFF
	THE CRAFT.  Everyone in the room is shocked.  The Technician
	re-opens the craft's door and the loud HUM disappears.

				GENERAL GREY
		How did you do that?

				DAVID
		I gave it a cold.

	The President is fascinated, he steps closer.  Moishe beams
	proudly at his smart son.  Constance is amazed.

				DAVID (cont'd)
		More accurately, I gave it a
		virus.  A computer virus.

	David turns his laptop around for the President to see.

				GENERAL GREY
		Are you telling us you can send
		out a signal that will disable all
		their shields?

				DAVID
		Just as they used our satellites
		against us, we can use their own
		signal against them.

	David walks over to a diagram he's made showing the
	relationship between the Mother Ship, the Space Crafts and the
	smaller alien attackers.

				DAVID (cont'd)
		If we plant the virus directly
		into the mother ship, it would
		then filter down into all the
		corresponding ships below.

				NIMZIKI
		And just how do we infect the
		"Mother Ship" with a virus?

	David gestures to the alien attacker behind him.

				DAVID
		We'll have to fly their craft out
		of our atmosphere and dock with
		the mother ship.

	Intrigued Steve turns and looks back at the alien attacker,
	sizing it up.  David points to a satellite photo of the
	underbelly of the Mother Ship.

				DAVID (cont'd)
		We can enter here, upload the
		virus and set off an explosion
		that could disable it.  This would
		disorient the smaller ship below
		and buy you some time to take them
		out.

	Constance reacts, realizing David's participation in the plan.

				NIMZIKI
		This is ridiculous.

				GENERAL GREY
		How long would their shields be
		down?

				DAVID
		Once they discover the virus it
		could be a matter of minutes.

				NIMZIKI
		You want us to co-ordinate a
		massive world wide counter strike
		with a window of only a few
		minutes?

				GENERAL GREY
		With their shields down it might
		be possible.

				NIMZIKI
		Please, you're not buying into any
		of this nonsense, are you?  We
		don't have the manpower or the
		resources to launch that kind of a
		campaign.
			(gesturing to the alien
			 ship)
		Not to mention that this whole
		cockamamie plan is dependent on a
		machine that no one in the world
		is qualified to operate.

				STEVE (O.S.)
		I wouldn't say that, sir.

	Everyone turns to Steve who steps through the crowd.

				STEVE
		I've seen them in action.  I've
		watched their maneuvers.  With
		your permission, sir, I'd like the
		opportunity to try.

				NIMZIKI
		That thing's a wreck.  It crash
		landed back in the fifties!  We
		don't even know if it's capable of
		flying.

	David turns to the Technicians.

				DAVID
		Remove the clamps!

	Technicians move to the large holding clamps on either side of
	the craft.  With a loud CLANK, the clamps are pulled away.

	For a moment the hulking craft TEETERS unevenly, but quickly
	stabilizes, FLOATING ABOVE THEM.

				DAVID
		Any other questions?

	Everyone stares at the floating ship with wonder.

				PRESIDENT
		Let's do it.

	INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

	Constance, General Grey and the President are walking down the
	hall.  Nimziki rushes to catch up.

				NIMZIKI
		I understand that you're upset
		over the death of your wife but
		that's no excuse for making
		another fatal mistake...

	The President whirls, grabs Nimziki and SLAMS him against the 
	wall.  Holding him tight, the President gets in his face.

				PRESIDENT
		The only mistake I made was
		appointing a sniveling little
		weasel like you Chief of Staff.

	Constance is about to intervene when General Grey stops her.

				PRESIDENT (cont'd)
		But this is a mistake, I am
		thankful to say, I do not have to

	The President releases him and turns to General Grey.

				PRESIDENT (cont'd)
		Organize every plane you can find

		to fly them.

				GENERAL GREY
		Yes, Sir.

	He storms off leaving everyone stunned.

	kitchen table as Miguel enters.

				MIGUEL
		How' he doing?

				RUSSELL
		Just fell asleep.  He's gonna be
		just fine.  Join me in a little
		celebration?

	Russell holds up his bottle of Jack Daniels.  Clearly he's
	been drinking again.  Miguel is crestfallen.  Pissed he turns
	and storms out.

				RUSSELL
		Miguel.  Don't be mad.  Miguel!

	Drunkenly, Russell chases after him.

	INT. AREA 51 - REFUGEE CAMP - CONTINUOUS

	Making his way through the campers, Russell SEES a group of
	refugees around some MILITARY OFFICERS who addresses them.

				OFFICER
			(through megaphone)
		...We're planning to launch a
		counter offensive...

	Russell wanders over towards them.

				OFFICER (cont'd)
		...with our depleted manpower we
		must ask that anyone with any
		flight experience come forward.
		Military training is preferable
		but anyone who can fly a plane
		could be useful...

	Russell pushes his way through the crowd.

				RUSSELL
			(slurred)
		I can fly, I mean, I'm a pilot.

	The officer just stares at the bottle of Jack Daniels still in 
	his hand.

				OFFICER
		Sorry, sir.

	Russell gets into his face, desperate.

				RUSSELL
		You don't understand.  I've gotta
		be part of this.  This is
		important to me.  They ruined my
		life.

				OFFICER
		Why don't you go somewhere and
		sleep it off.

	The Officers move on, taking a few volunteers with them.
	Russell watches them go, dejected.  Angrily, he throws the
	bottle of Jack, SMASHING it.

	INT. STORAGE LAB - NIGHT

	A large MISSILE slides back into a LAUNCHER that has been
	attached to the top of the alien attacker.  Some workers PAINT
	over the patch-work repairs.  Below, Mitchell briefs Steve and
	David.

				MITCHELL
		We've hid the launcher in the
		ship's manifold.

	Mitchell takes a small black box from a table near by.

				MITCHELL (cont'd)
		This will be attached to the ships
		main console.

				STEVE
		It's just like an AMRAAM launch
		pad on the stealths.

				MITCHELL
		Exactly.  Use it the same way.
		Only the nuke won't detonate on
		impact.  You'll have another
		thirty seconds to get as far away
		as you can.

				DAVID
		I'll see how they're doing with
		the radio transmitter.

				STEVE
			(checking his watch)
		Oh shit, we're late.

				DAVID
		We'll meet you there.

	Steve dashes off as David moves toward the attacker.
	Constance has been eavesdropping.  She walks to David.

				CONSTANCE
		Thirty seconds?  Isn't that
		cutting it a little too close?

				DAVID
		We'll be well on our way out of
		there before we shoot that thing
		off.

	David leans under the attacker where a TECHNICIAN is attaching
	another device.

				TECHNICIAN
		It's the strongest SHF transmitter
		we could get.  It'll tell us when
		you've uploaded the virus.

				DAVID
		Then cross your fingers the
		shields go down.

	David turns and walks away, Constance following.

				CONSTANCE
		With you?  I don't understand why
		you can't just show someone how to
		plant the virus, somebody trained
		for this kind of mission?

				DAVID
		If anything goes wrong I'll have
		to think quickly, adjust the
		signal, who knows?

	David stops, picking up a small trash can labelled "recycle."

				DAVID
			(smiling)
		You know how I'm always trying to
		save the planet.  This is my
		chance.

	David rushes off.  Constance watches him leave.

				CONSTANCE
			(to herself)
		Now he gets ambitious.

	INT. SMALL GATHERING HALL - SAME

	Jasmine is kneeling as Dylan tries to zip up the back of her
	dress.

				DYLAN
		It's too tight.

				JASMINE
		I had to borrow it.  I guess
		that's good enough.

	Jasmine stands, turns to Dylan.

				JASMINE
		How do I look?

	She looks great.  But Dylan only gives her the "so-so" hand
	gesture.

				JASMINE
		You're a lot of help.

	The door behind her flies open and Steve marches in.

				JASMINE
		You're late.

				STEVE
		You know me...

				JASMINE
		I know, you like to make a big
		entrance.

	Steve moves next to Jasmine, takes her hand.

				STEVE
		Before we do this, I want you to
		know I'm sorry.

				JASMINE
		Sorry for what?

				STEVE
			(serious)
		I should have done this a long
		long time ago.

				MALE VOICE (O.S.)
		Do you have the ring?

	As we REVERSE ANGLE we see that we are in a military CHAPEL, a
	large crucifix on the wall.  A CHAPLAIN stands by the altar.

				STEVE
		You bet.

	Steve pulls out the famous "dolphin" ring.

				CHAPLAIN
		Witnesses?

	Just then the doors open and David and Constance enter taking
	seats on opposing sides of the aisle.

				CHAPLAIN
		Then let's get this show on the
		road.

	Steve and Jasmine take their places at the altar.  Jasmine is
	radiant.  Dylan rushes up and joins them.

	As the ceremony begins, David and Constance share a pregnant
	glance.  Slowly they reach across the aisle and hold hands as
	Steve and Jasmine exchange their vows.

							CUT TO:

	HANGAR DOORS - PRE-DAWN

	Slowly spread apart revealing the myriad of different planes
	that have been gathered.  Pilots, flights crews and refugees
	prepare for the battle.

	EXT. AREA 51 - TARMAC - PRE-DAWN

	Walking out the President scans the motley collection of
	planes; old, new, high-tech, low-tech.

				GENERAL GREY
		Beggars can't be choosers, sir.

	Nodding in agreement, the President walks among the rank and
	file.  Slowly they turn their attention to the President.

				PRESIDENT
		Good morning.  In less than one
		hour planes from here and all
		around the world will launch the
		largest aerial battle in the
		history of mankind...
			(beat)
		Mankind.  The word has new meaning
		for all of us now.  We are
		reminded not of our petty
		differences but of our common
		interests.

	Constance, David and Moishe join the group, listening.  Even
	David is moved.

				PRESIDENT (cont'd)
		Perhaps it's fate that today, July
		the Fourth, we will once again
		fight for our freedom.  Not from
		tyranny, persecution or
		oppression.  But from
		annihilation.  We're fighting for
		our right to live, to exit.  From
		this day on, the fourth day of
		July will no longer be remembered
		as an American holiday but as the
		day that all of mankind declared
		we will not go quietly into the
		night.  We will not vanish without
		a fight.  We will live on.  We
		will survive.

	The crowd erupts into applause and cheers.  The President
	turns and walks over to an Officer holding a bundle of
	clothes.  General Grey confronts the President as he begins to
	disrobe.

				GENERAL GREY
		Mr. President, just what do you
		think you're doing?

				PRESIDENT
		I'm a pilot, Will.  This is where
		I belong.

	General Grey wants to argue but can't.

	INT. STORAGE LAB - SAME

	Constance and David embrace as Steve turns to Dylan.

				STEVE
		When I'm back we'll light those
		fireworks.

	Jasmine hugs them both as Moishe walks over to David.

				MOISHE
		David, take these.

	David looks down at the "barf bags" in Moishe's hand.

				DAVID
		Thanks, Pops.

				MOISHE
		I want you should know, I'm very
		proud of you, son.

	That means more to David than Moishe could have known.

				CONSTANCE
		Be careful.

	Constance hugs David as Steve suddenly freaks out.

				STEVE
		Damn it.  We can't go yet.  I
		gotta find some cigars.

	Steve is about to bolt when Moishe grabs him, retrieving two
	cigars from his coat pocket.

				MOISHE
		My last two.  With my blessings.

				STEVE
		You're a lifesaver.

	Steve grabs them and climbs inside.  David smiles awkwardly,
	then follows Steve.

	INT. ALIEN ATTACKER - CONTINUOUS

	The hatch shuts and David takes a seat next to Steve who hands
	him one of the cigars.

				STEVE
		Hang on to this.  For our victory
		dance.  But not 'til we hear the
		fat lady sing.

	Reluctantly David takes it.  As he does Steve notices the
	"barf bag" on David's lap.  Off Steve's look...

				DAVID
		I have a confession to make.  I'm
		not real big on flying.

				STEVE
		Great.

	INT. STORAGE LAB - SAME

	Constance and Jasmine join the others behind the observation
	glass outside the room as the Attacker prepares for lift off.

	Part of the ceiling suddenly PEELS AWAY, revealing an enormous
	SHAFT leading topside.

	INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ALIEN ATTACKER - SAME

	Strapping in and securing their equipment, Steve grabs hold of
	the throttle.

				STEVE
		You ready?  Let' rock and roll.

	Steve pulls back on the throttle but the attacker swings
	BACKWARDS.

	INT. STORAGE LAB - SAME

	The Alien Attacker SMASHES BACKWARD into the rear of the lab.
	Moishe winces as the others react fearfully.

	INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ALIEN ATTACKER - SAME

	Embarrassed, Steve adjusts the throttle.

				STEVE
		Oops.

	Like a stick shift diagram of a car, a small hand written
	"post it" card is pasted onto the dash.  Steve reaches over
	and turns it upside down, righting the problem.

				STEVE
		Let's try that again.

	This time he pushes the throttle forward and the Attacker
	JERKS ahead.

	INT. STORAGE LAB - CONTINUOUS

	Shooting up into the ceiling shaft above, the Attacker ZOOMS
	out of the underground laboratory.

	EXT. AREA 51 - SHAFT - SAME

	With a WHOOSH the Alien Attacker ZOOMS out of the underground
	shaft and SOARS into the sky.  Once high enough it goes into a
	wild barrel roll.

	INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ALIEN ATTACKER - SAME

	Just as it comes out of the roll.

				DAVID
		What the hell are you doing?

				STEVE
		Just getting a feel for her.

	EXT. MORNING SKIES - CLOUD BANK - SAME

	The Attacker arcs upward and disappears into the clouds.

	EXT. AREA 51 - THE PRESIDENT'S PLANE - SAME

	The President watches the Attacker flying away.  His canopy
	locks down as he adjusts his helmet.

				PRESIDENT
		Grey, you read me?

				GENERAL GREY

		Roger, Eagle One, our primary
		target has shifted course.

	INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

	General Grey is standing by the large map tracking the alien

		I think our secret is out.
		They're headed right for us.

	INT. PRESIDENT'S PLANE - SAME

				GENERAL GREY
			(filtered)
		ETA thirty six minutes.

	The President gets a determined look in his eye.  He FIRES UP
	his engine.  Following his lead, engines ignite, canopies lock
	down and planes taxi to position.

	EXT. UPPER ATMOSPHERE - ALIEN ATTACKER - SAME

	The captured alien attacker soars higher and higher.

	INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ATTACKER - SAME

	Slowly getting sick, David holds onto his "barf bag."

				STEVE
		You still with me?

	David nods sheepishly.  Steve's eyes go wide with wonder as
	the ship climbs to the edge of our atmosphere.

				STEVE
			(to himself)
		I've waited a long time for this.

	The ship begins to SHAKE, rattling harshly as it climbs.
	Through the window we SEE the blue sky EVAPORATE.  Slowly a
	field of STARS take its place.

	This is the moment Steve had wished for all his life.  He's
	not disappointed.  David, however, is not so thrilled.

	EXT. SPACE - STEVE AND DAVID'S ATTACKER - SAME

	Heading further into space, ZOOMING overhead.

	INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ATTACKER - SAME

	Through the windshield we see a huge OBJECT floating in
	the distance, the moon behind it.

				DAVID
		That's it.  Head straight for it.

	But Steve gets distracted, something wrong with the controls.

				STEVE
		Something's happening.  It's not
		responding.

	David looks over at his laptop, connected to the ship's on
	board computers.  Th signal is ADJUSTING.

				DAVID
			(thrilled)
		I was counting on that.  They're
		bringing us in.

	EXT. BLUE SKIES - MORNING

	The President's plane leads thirty fighters in attack
	formation.

				PRESIDENT
		We have visual.

	RESERVE ANGLE - ALIEN SPACE CRAFT

	The fifteen mile wide space craft peeks over a mountain range
	headed straight for us.

				GENERAL GREY
			(filtered)
		Do not engage until we've
		confirmed the package has been

				PRESIDENT
		Roger.

	INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

	Constance is standing by Lt. Mitchell behind the Military
	cadre coordinating the battle.

				CONSTANCE
		What if that thing gets here
		before we can plant the virus?

				MITCHELL
		The entire compound is buried deep
		within the mountain.  It should
		give us some protection.

				CONSTANCE
		But what about all the people
		outside?

	Mitchell shoots her a worried look.  Quickly they both dash
	outside.

	EXT. MOTHER SHIP - SAME

	Steve and David's attacker flies towards the gigantic Mother
	Ship.  Hundreds of other attackers flow in and out of the
	Mother Ship through the many triangular portals.  Steve and
	David's attacker's drawn into one of them.

	INT. PORTAL SHAFT - MOTHER SHIP - SAME

	Caught in a stream of attackers, they flow through the portal
	shaft leading into this planet sized space craft.  They pass
	by enormous windows revealing the HUNDREDS OF ALIENS working
	within the Mother Ship.

	We spill out of the shaft and into a gigantic cavity
	stretching out beyond visibility.  Enormous TOWERS are
	scattered throughout.

	INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ATTACKER - CONTINUOUS

	Neither can believe their eyes.  Staring out the front window
	they SEES...

	STEVE AND DAVID'S POV ALIEN TROOP PARADE GROUND

	Below them THOUSANDS OF ALIENS can be seen as they are marched
	into dozens of enormous TROOP CONTAINERS docked at the edges
	of the parade grounds.

				DAVID
		Must be thousands of them.  What
		are they doing?

				STEVE
		Looks like they're preparing the
		invasion.

	INT. DOCKING STATIONS - MOTHER SHIP - CONTINUOUS

	They pass the parade ground and head into the middle of this
	huge cavernous sphere, closing in on the many LANDINGS.
	Hundreds of attackers are docked at each one.

	In the center of the Landing are large BAY WINDOWS, inside is
	a kind of control tower.  We can SEE several ALIEN WORKERS
	through the glass.  Steve and David's attacker is heading
	straight towards them.

				STEVE
		This won't work.  They'll see
		before we can do anything.

	Lifting up another hand written card labeled "window," David
	pushes the button underneath.

				DAVID
		These things are fully equipped.
		Reclining bucket seats, power
		windows...

	A BLAST SHIELD lowers covering the window.

	Slowly Steve and David's attacker lowers onto large docking
	CLAMPS which LOCK ON, holding it in place.

				DAVID
		We're in!

	David starts typing frantically.

	INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

	Mitchell turns from one of the consoles to General Grey.

		Let me get that.

	He grabs the bag for her.  Alicia smiles.  Miguel helps Troy
	down from the trailer.  As they rush away, Miguel turns to
	Philip.

				MIGUEL
		Where's Russell?

	ANGLE - HANGAR - ENTRANCE TO COMPOUND

	Constance, Jasmine and Mitchell are helping to usher the
	refugees into the compound.

	Constance looks up and SEES off in the distance...

	THE ALIEN SPACE CRAFT

	Piercing the horizon, coming over the top of a distant
	mountain.  Headed this way.

	Below the President's plane the weapons bay door opens and a
	long range AMRAAM Missile DROPS DOWN, computes its target and
	DARTS OFF.

	ANGLE - AMRAAM MISSILE

	Just as it gets to the shield perimeter, the missile EXPLODES.
	The shields are still up.

	INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

	They watch the missile blow up harmlessly.  Deflated, General
	Grey grabs his mic.

				GENERAL GREY
		It didn't work.  Disengage.  Sir,
		get your people out of there.

	EXT. PRESIDENT'S PLANE - SAME

	The President is not ready to give up.

				PRESIDENT
		Not yet!

	Below his plane another MISSILE drops down, and DARTS OFF.

	ANGLE - MISSILE

	This one goes past the point of the previous explosion.  It
	moves in closer and closer.  Suddenly it HITS THE SIDE OF THE
	SHIP.  A HUGE EXPLOSION, rips off a part of the side of this
	immense ship.

	INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

	We SEE the explosion on the monitor.  Everyone in the room
	CHEERS.

				GENERAL GREY
		You did it!  A direct hit!

	EXT. BLUE SKIES - AMERICAN FIGHTERS - SAME

	The pilots are thrilled.

				PRESIDENT
		We're going in!  Squadron leaders,
		take point.

	The fighters break off into six group of five.  One by one,
	each fighter DROPS A MISSILE.  We follow DOZENS OF MISSILES on
	their way to the space craft.

	ANGLE - SPACE CRAFT

	The Attacker Bay doors open and DOZENS OF ALIEN ATTACKERS
	shoot out.  Spreading wide.

	Guided missiles EXPLODES as they hit the City Destroyer,
	damaging the outer hull.  The Attackers go after the American
	fighters.  The six groups split wide.  An aerial dog fight
	ensues.

	EXT. AREA 51 - REFUGEE CAMP - SAME

	Miguel searches for Russell as the refugees run for the
	hangar.

				MIGUEL
		Russell!

	Miguel gets swept up in the tide.  As the last of them enter
	the hangar, TWO ALIEN ATTACKERS arrive behind them, STRAFING
	the ground.  The rows of trailers homes EXPLODE one after
	another.

	ANGLE - ELEVATOR HALLWAY - BACK OF HANGAR

	Constance ushers the crowd into the elevator hallway.  Packed
	into the hallway together, they are panicked at the sound of
	the nearby explosions.  As the last one is safely inside,
	Constance turns back and SEES...

	CONSTANCE'S POV - HANGAR AND ATTACKERS

	The attackers FIRE and the front half of the hangar EXPLODES.
	Constance is KNOCKED back against the wall.  She activates the
	elevator and the room begins to SINK.

	As the hallway submerges, the entire hangar comes CRASHING
	DOWN behind them.

	INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

	Over monitors the General observes the aerial battle.  This

	David moves over to the computer to see if he can help.
	Suddenly the large window slowly begins to DROP DOWN.

				STEVE
		What're you doing?

				DAVID
		It's not me.  They're overriding
		the system.

	The blast shield continues to peel away.  David and Steve drop
	down below the dash, hiding from view.  As the view becomes
	unobstructed we SEE...

	POV - THROUGH WINDOW - THE LANDING

	Several Alien's looking across at us from the large bay
	window of the Landing's control tower.

				STEVE
		Damn!

	David leans from his hiding position and SEES several other
	alien attackers are moving in on them.  They are surrounded.

				DAVID
		Check and mate.

	INT. AREA 51 - RESEARCH FACILITY - SAME

	Like images from England during the blitzkrieg, the refugees
	are huddled on the floor, the lights FLICKERING and the muted
	sounds of distant EXPLOSIONS.  Miguel moves through the
	refugees, searching for Russell.

	A Yarmulke is unfolded.  As it is lifted we realize Moishe is
	putting it on.  He holds the hands with the people around him
	and begins to pray.  Nimziki moves next to Moishe.  Moishe
	takes his hand.

				NIMZIKI
		I'm not Jewish.

				MOISHE
		It's okay.

	ANGLE - PHILIP AND ALICIA

	As another bomb rocks the room, Alicia moves closer to Philip.

				ALICIA
		This could be our last night on

		If we do, we'll both die virgins.
		But at last we'll be together.

	Alicia smiles, a nice guy at last.

	EXT. AREA 51 - SPACE SHIP - SAME

	The City Destroyer space ship is settling just above the

	EXT. PRESIDENT'S PLANE - SAME

				GENERAL GREY

		They're getting ready to fire the
		big gun.  You're going to have to
		find a vulnerable spot, fast.

				PRESIDENT
		I've got an idea.  Keep 'em off my
		tail.

	Taking the advice, the President DIVES.  He's met by two
	flanking Fighters (EAGLES 9 & 2) as they cruise the underbelly
	of the City Destroyer.  Sure enough, the SCHISM is opening,
	preparing to fire the WALL OF DESTRUCTION.

				PRESIDENT
		Let's take 'em out before they
		take us out.

	The President locks the SCHISM hatchway into the center of his
	HUD (heads up display).  Just as he FIRES, Eagle 9 is BLOWN
	OUT OF THE SKY.  It rocks the President, sending his missile
	off target.

	Off balance, the missile hits just wide of the hatchway and
	EXPLODES, rocking the entire ship.

				PRESIDENT
		I'm out of missiles!  Eagle 2?

				EAGLE #2 PILOT
		I'm on it.

	But before he can target, his fighter EXPLODES.

	INT. HALLWAY - SAME

	The lights continue to flicker.  Jasmine grabs onto Dylan and
	Patricia, holding them tight.

	INT. WAR ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	On the monitor we SEE the SCHISM, and BRIGHT LIGHTS as several

	Pissed, the President refuses to give up.

	Russell ZOOMS past the President and alien attackers, barely
	missing their FIRE.

				PRESIDENT

		Who is that?  What are you doing?

		Dad!  No!

	Russell smiles at b being called "Dad."

				RUSSELL
		I've got to, kid.  You were always
		better at taking care of them than
		I was anyways.

	Russell turns off his radio as he banks UPWARD towards the
	open SCHISM.  The climb is steep, and the bi-wing nearly
	stalls out.

	Suddenly the bright lights VANISH and the beam begins to form.

	Russell's bi-wing just makes it INSIDE THE OPEN SCHISM and
	disappears from view.

	The President and remaining fighters BANK AWAY, clearing.

	Suddenly, A GIGANTIC EXPLOSION, RIPS THROUGH THE CENTER OF THE
	SPACE CRAFT.  It's causing a CHAIN REACTION of explosion.

	Teetering, the entire space ship, turns away out of control.

	INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

	The room erupts in CHEERS.  Everyone, that is, except Miguel.

		Funny, I always thought things

	The missile BLASTS by WRECKING equipment until it LODGES into

	Steve DARTS his attacker out from underneath the Mother Ship's

	Just as the last of them exit the docking bay, a HUGE FIREBALL
	erupts behind them ripping through the Mother Ship.

	ANGLE - FARTHER AWAY

	ZOOMING towards us, Steve guides his ship away.  The Alien
	attackers in hot pursuit.  Behind them we SEE the ENTIRE
	MOTHER SHIP EXPLODE.

	The immense EXPLOSION GROWS OUTWARDS coming right at us.  The
	ATTACKERS are GOBBLED UP as the EXPLOSION WIDENS.  Quickly the
	explosion gains ground on Steve and David.

	aid.  Behind him, Jasmine leads Dylan and Patricia, who breaks
	free and RUSHES to her father.  The President sweeps her up in
	his arms as Jasmine approaches.

				JASMINE
			(to General Grey)
		Any word from Steve?

	Behind her, Constance rushes over, the same thing on her mind.
	Before he can answer they HEAR a ROAR above.  They all become
	silent as they turn and look to the skies.

	ANGLE - BLUE SKIES - FIREBALL

	The FIREBALL COMET is rapidly shooting down towards us.
	Suddenly BURSTING OUT OF THE FLAMES, Steve and David's ship
	DARTS DOWN.

	Just over the heads of the cheering crowds, Steve and David's
	ship ZOOMS overhead, disappearing out of sight.

		You scared the hell out of me.

				STEVE
		Yeah, but what an entrance!

				JASMINE
		Dick-weed.

		Butt-munch.

	Constance comes running up to David, hugs him tightly.

				CONSTANCE
		Are you all right?

				DAVID
		Did it work?

				CONSTANCE
		You bet it did.

	She hugs him.  They kiss.

	ANGLE - STEVE AND JASMINE

	Behind them Dylan, Patricia, the President and General Grey
	come walking over.  The President and General Grey approach.

				PRESIDENT
		We're getting reports from all

	As they begin to celebrate, they look up to the sky.

	GROUP POV - BRILLIANT LIGHTS IN THE SKIES

	The debris from the Mother Ship explosion enters the
	atmosphere like thousands of SHOOTING STARS.  It's an
	incredible sight.

	The group stares happily at the show in the sky.  Steve takes
	Dylan by the hand.

				STEVE
		Didn't I promise you fireworks?

	Everyone stares in wonder at the beautiful lights.

	AN ENORMOUS SHADOW creeps towards us blotting out the horizon,

	Whitmore ties on his robe as he adjusts the picture quality.

			(another paper; reading)
		"...addressing Congress, Whitmore

				WHITMORE
		Clever.

				CONSTANCE
		Age was never an issue when you
		stuck to your gun.  You were
		thought of as young and

		gotten lost.  There's too much

				WHITMORE
			(pointedly)
		Isn't it amazing how fast everyone

	Realizing she may be pushing him too far, she hands him

	EXT. CALIFORNIA FARMLANDS, IMPERIAL VALLEY - DAY

	Racing over back roads behind a long open field, Miguel rides
	his beat-up motor bike, searching.  Looking up he SEES
	something in the air.

	MIGUEL'S POV - AN OLD BI-WING AIRPLANE

	converted into a crop-duster, BUZZES overhead.  Spraying
	insecticide wildly, the plane zigzags over the field.

				MIGUEL
			(yelling)
		Russell!  God damn it, Russell!

	Looking down from the cockpit, RUSSELL BRENNON waves stupidly.
	Shaggy blonde hair and two days' growth, Russell is the image
	of a fifty-one-year-old little boy.

	Miguel follows him below, screaming at him.  Russell, flying
	recklessly, looks down at Miguel not understanding.  By the
	time he looks back he SEES...

	A LINE OF TREES

	at the edge of the field, nearly on top of him.  In a trick
	move, Russell turns the plane on ITS SIDE, and SLICES through
	the narrow gap between the trees.

	Miguel screams with delight at his prowess.  Miguel looks
	pissed.

	ANGLE - OTHER SIDE OF TREES - MOMENTS LATER

	Miguel races over, skidding to a halt next to the landed Bi-
	with plane.

				MIGUEL
		Just what the hell do you think
		you're doing?

				RUSSELL
			(climbing down)
		I'm bringing home the bacon.
		Earning my keep.  And doing a fine
		job if I do say so myself.

				MIGUEL
		It's the wrong field, you idiot!
		Lucas' farm is on the other side
		of town.

				RUSSELL
		You sure?

				MIGUEL
		Damn it, he was doing you a favor.
		You know how hard it is to find
		someone who doesn't think you're
		completely crazy?
			(MORE)
		What are we supposed to do now?
		Huh?  Where are we supposed to go

	Pissed, Miguel peels away, kicking gravel back at Russell.
	Pathetically, he reaches into his jacket and pulls out a
	bottle of Jack Daniels.  He takes a healthy swig.

	Suddenly a group of shouting SCREAMING TRIBES PEOPLE come

	The Bedouin watches them with confusion.  Overcome with
	curiosity he goes against the tide of people, up the hillside.

	As the Bedouin reaches the top of the hillside, his mouth
	falls open, aghast as he SEES...

	THE SKIES - THE PHENOMENON

	Creeping from across the horizon above the rocky mountain

	Constance moves over to a cabinet and turns on the T.V. (the

	As the paper is lowered we SEE the helicopter SWOOP down.  As

	Above them another SCHISM has opened at the bottom of the

	As though the heavens had opened, the UFO believers lift their

		Okay, jerk-off.  Let's have some

	The Attacker recovers, dives after Steve who flies dangerously

	Not far away, Steve has a quick, hard, landing.  Rolling over,

	He stands and looks around.  Spotting the beat up and
	incapacitated alien Attacker, Steve gets an angry resolved
	look.  He marches over to the fallen alien Attacker.  He scans
	it quickly, spots a type of door that has been knocked ajar.

	With all his might, Steve YANKS the door OPEN.

	AN ALIEN

	For the first time we get a quick glance at these aliens, an
	odd hybrid creature with fluctuating skeletal structure.

	The reason we only get a quick glance is because the moment it
	turns woozily towards us, Steve rears back and SLUGS HIM IN
	THE FACE, knocking the alien totally unconscious.

	His anger finally subsiding, exhaustion taking over, Steve
	stands over the craft, slowly withdrawing the prized Victory

		My God, the Vice President and the 
		Joint Chiefs...

				NIMZIKI
		Mr. President, we must launch.  A
		delay now would be more costly
		than when you waited to evacuate
		the cities!

	That stings the President.  He considers the option.  David is
	shocked.

				DAVID
		You can't be seriously considering
		firing nuclear weapons?

				CONSTANCE
		David, don't...

	David pushes past her.

				DAVID
		If you fire nukes, so will the
		rest of the world.  Do you know
		what that kind of fall out will
		do?  How many innocent people...

	The General gets up running interference.  Constance tries to
	pull David back.

				GENERAL GREY
			(stern)
		Sir, i remind you that you are
		just a guest here...

				CONSTANCE
			(overlapping)
		David, please...

				DAVID
		This is insanity!  You'll kill us
		and them at the same time.
		There'll be nothing left!

				NIMZIKI
			(interrupting)
		Sit down and shut up!

	Suddenly Moishe is on his feet, interrupting.

				MOISHE
		Don't tell him to shut up!  You'd
		all be dead, were it not for my
		David.  You didn't do anything to
		prevent this!

	As everyone is about to besiege Moishe, the President tries to
	calm him down.

				PRESIDENT
		Sir, there wasn't much more we
		could have done.  We were totally
		unprepared for this.

				MOISHE
		Don't give me unprepared!  Since
		nineteen fifty whatever you guys
		have had that space ship, the
		thing you found in New Mexico.

				DAVID
			(embarrassed)
		Dad, please...

				MOISHE
		What was it, Roswell?  You had the
		space ship, the bodies, everything
		locked up in a bunker, the what is
		it, Area fifty one.  That's it!
		Area fifty one.  You knew and you
		didn't do nothing!

	For the first time in along time, President Whitmore smiles.

				PRESIDENT
		Regardless of what the tabloids
		have said, there were never any
		space crafts recovered by the
		government.  Take my word for it,
		there is no Area 51 and no
		recovered space ship.

	Chief of Staff Nimziki suddenly clears his throat.

				NIMZIKI
		Uh, excuse me, Mr. President, but
		that's not entirely accurate.

	The President and General Grey turn to Nimziki, shocked.

	SMASHED AND BURNED OUT CARS

	laying across the roadway.  Suddenly SMASH, Jasmine's
	maintenance truck BLASTS through.

	EXT. HIGHWAY - CITY LIMITS - SAME

	With the massive devastation in the b.g., Jasmine drives the
	maintenance truck down the highway.  In the back, the few
	survivors she's found.

	In the back, four INJURED PASSENGERS lay across the flatbed as
	a thin, older man, TEDDY tends to them.

	INT. MAINTENANCE TRUCK - SAME

	Jasmine spots a TALL MAN, his closes in tatters RUNNING down
	the highway, his arms in the air.

				TALL MAN
		The end has come!  He speaketh
		his word and the end hast come!

	Jasmine pulls up along side him.

				JASMINE
		Hop on.  We're heading out to El
		Toro.

				TALL MAN
		You cannot defy what has come, it
		is the end!

	The tall man moves off, screaming to the heavens.  As Jasmine
	watches him drift away she SEES...

	OVERTURNED MILITARY HELICOPTER

	Still smoldering from the crash.  A woman can be seen inside,
	still alive.  Jasmine jumps out.

				JASMINE
		Give me a hand.

	Teddy joins Jasmine as they pry open the door.  Inside, the
	pilots have been killed, but Mrs. Whitmore, THE FIRST LADY,
	lays there in great pain, blood across her blouse.

				JASMINE
		Let's get her out of here.

	They erase her from the wreckage, laying her on the
	ground.  Dylan comes over, standing next to his mother.

				TEDDY
		She's bleeding pretty bad.

	Suddenly we HEAR the CLICKING of a rifle COCKING.

				MALE VOICE (O.S.)
		Who's got the key?

	Jasmine turns and see a REDNECK leveling his rifle at her.
	Behind him a small damaged sports car pulls up, packed to the
	gills with stolen, looted appliances.

				REDNECK
			(yelling to pals)
		Looks like I've solved our
		transportation problem.

				JASMINE
		Hey, you're welcome to come with
		us.  We're leaving here anyway...

				REDNECK
		We're not.  Give me the key.
			(yelling back)
		Get 'em off.

	Two GUYS rush from their vehicle over to the maintenance
	truck, pulling the injured off the tailback.

				TALL MAN (O.S.)
		Repent!  Sinners!  Repent!  The
		end hast come!

	Running up from behind, the Tall Man comes over screaming.
	The Redneck turns his gun on him.

				REDNECK
		Back off.  This ain't your
		business.

	As the Redneck is distracted, Jasmine spots the bag of
	fireworks protruding out of Dylan's back pocket.

				TALL MAN
		You cannot go against the word,
		brother.

				REDNECK
		Sure I can.

	The Redneck SHOOTS the Tall Man.  His buddies laugh.

				REDNECK (cont'd)
		Now give me that key, bitch.

	As he turns back to Jasmine, Boomer starts BARKING wildly.
	Just as he turns to shoot the dog, Jasmine lights a key ROCKET
	from the fireworks bag.  The rocket BLASTS into the Redneck,
	his shirt IGNITING ON FIRE.

	The Redneck drops the rifle, attempting to put out the flames,
	his cronies rush to his aid.  Jasmine picks up the gun, moves
	in on them.

				JASMINE
		This "bitch" was born in  Alabama
		with a Daddy who loved to hunt.
			(cocking the weapon)
		So don't think for one second that
		I don't know how to use this.

	She FIRES the rifle.  Quickly the rednecks scamper away.

						CUT TO:

	EXT. DRY LAKE - DESERT - LATER

	Dragging a heavy bundle wrapped in his parachute, Steve
	marches across the desert floor.  The alien ARM/TENTACLE
	dangles out of the parachute.

	Exhausted, Steve stops to wipe his brow.  He hears something,
	turns around.

	STEVE'S POV - THE TRAILER ARMADA

	Several hundred of the trailers from the refugee camp are
	headed en mass towards him.  Smiling, Steve signals them.

	The trailers pull up on either side, surrounding him.  Miguel
	leans out of his trailer.

				MIGUEL
			(sarcastic)
		Need a lift?

				STEVE
		When I flew overhead, I saw some
		kind of base, not far.

	Confused, Miguel checks his map.

				MIGUEL
		It's not on the map.

				STEVE
		Trust me, it's there.

	EXT. AIR FORCE ONE - LATER

	Flying over the desert, Air Force One sails over an immense
	valley, Area 51 below - hangars, a few buildings, a small air
	strip, not much.

	Super: N.I.A. Base - "Area 51", Nevada

	EXT. RUNWAY - LATER

	Air Force One lands.  Wheels touch down, skid.

	INT. HANGAR - LATER

	The large hangar doors open and Air Force One is rolled
	inside.  The President and his entourage are met by a
	contingent of base personnel led by field operative, LT.
	MITCHELL.  He escorts them to a side hallway.

	INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

	Lt. Mitchell walks over to an odd wall switch as the President
	and his entourage wait in the center of the hall.  With a loud
	hydraulic HUM, the entire hallway begins to SINK DOWN, an
	enormous ELEVATOR.

				PRESIDENT
		Why the hell wasn't I told about
		this place?

				NIMZIKI
		Two words, Mr. President.
		Plausible deniability.

	General Grey shoots Nimziki a pissed off look.  When the
	elevator stops, a door SLIDES open.

	INT. RESEARCH FACILITIES - CONTINUOUS

	Stepping out of the elevator, they walk into a large state of
	the art, sterile clean research facility.  It is amazingly
	well staffed and organized.

				PRESIDENT
		I don't understand.  Where did all
		this come from?  How did this get
		funded?

				MOISHE
		You didn't think they actually
		spent ten thousand dollars for a
		hammer and thirty thousand for a
		toilet seat, did you?

	The President shoots him a look.  They are greeted by a group
	of SCIENTISTS in whit coats led by, DR. OKUN.

				MITCHELL
		Mr. President, I'd like to
		introduce you to Dr. Okun.  He's
		been heading up our research here
		for the last fifteen years.

	Dr. Okun is an odd, hyper-energetic man who's spent too much
	time in isolation.

				OKUN
		Mr. President, a real pleasure.
		They don't let us out much, you
		you.

				PRESIDENT
			(uncomfortable)
		Yes.

				OKUN
		Well, I guess you'd like to see
		the big tamale?  Follow me.

	They walk up a ramp at the end of the room.  Large heavily
	enforced doors SLIDE open.

	INT. STORAGE LAB - CONTINUOUS

	The group steps inside and nearly gasps at...

	THE ALIEN ATTACKER

	Just like the one that chased Steve.  The entourage stares in
	horror and wonder.  We can SEE the patch-work repairs they've
	made on the ship over the years.

				OKUN
		She's a beaut, ain't she?

	Moishe leans close to David and Constance.

				MOISHE
			(smug)
		Never any space ships recovered by
		the government, huh?

				PRESIDENT
		We've had this for forty years and
		you don't know anything about
		them?

				OKUN
		Hell no, we know tons about them.
		The nearest stuff has only
		happened in the last few days.

	The President slowly walks around the ship as Okun talks.
	David, mouth agape, just stares at it.

				OKUN (cont'd)
		See, we can't duplicate their type
		of power so we've never been able
		to experiment.  But since these
		guys started showing up, all the
		gizmos inside turned on.  The last
		twenty four hours have been really
		exciting!

				PRESIDENT
			(exploding)
		People are dying out there.  I
		don't think "exciting" is the word
		I'd choose to describe it!

	The room goes silent, letting the President blow off steam.

				PRESIDENT
			(calming)
		What can you tell us about the
		enemy we're facing?

				OKUN
		Not all too dissimilar to us.
		Breathes oxygen, comparable
		tolerances to heat,
		cold...probably why they're
		interested in our planet.
			(suddenly excited)
		Hey, you wanna see them?

	INT. MEDICAL RESEARCH VAULT - MOMENTS LATER

	The lights slowly TURN ON, illuminated the vault.  Okun leads
	the group to a sealed partition.

				OKUN
		This is vault, or as some of us
		have come to call it, the "freak
		show."

	Okun hits a switch and the sealed partition lifts revealing...

	FORMALDEHYDE TANKS - ALIENS

	Three dead aliens float in the milky formaldehyde tanks.  The
	murky fluid and condensation obstructs our view.  What we do
	see is not pretty.

				OKUN
		When we found them they were
		wearing bio-mechanical suits.
		Once we got them off, we were able
		to learn a great deal about their
		anatomy; eyes, ears, bipolar
		digestive system... no vocal cords
		though.  We're assuming they
		communicate with each other
		through other means.

	David cannot contain his fascination.  He steps forward.

				DAVID
		What kind of other means?  Hand
		signals, body language?

				OKUN
		Some kind of extra sensory
		perception.  Telepathy.

				PRESIDENT
		Can they be killed?

				OKUN
		These three died in the crash.
		Their bodies are as frail as our
		own.  You just have to get past
		their technology, which is, I'm
		sorry to say, far more advanced.

	The President turns to David.

				PRESIDENT
		You unlocked a part of that
		technology.  You cracked their
		code.

				DAVID
		All I did was stumble onto their
		signal.  I don't know how helpful
		I can be...

				PRESIDENT
		Show them what you've discovered.
		Work together.  We've got to find
		a way to beat them.

	EXT. SECURITY GATE - SAME

	Four armed GUARDS watch the gate.  An armada of trucks and
	trailers heads right for them.  They move into position to
	block their entrance as a blue pick-up skids to a halt before
	them.  Steve stands up from the back of the pick up.

				GUARD
		Sorry, Lt. Colonel, I can't open
		the gates without clearance.

				STEVE
		You want to see my clearance?

	Impatiently Steve grabs the Guard by the collar, pulling him
	over the side of the truck putting him face to face with the
	bundled parachute in the flatbed.  Steve rips the fabric aside
	revealing...

	THE ALIEN CREATURE

	Still unconscious, the alien stirs.  The Guard JUMPS BACK,
	shitting in his pants.  Quickly he signals for the other to
	open the gate.

	The armada quickly drives past.

	BLACKNESS

	Total darkness.  Suddenly light pours in as a  door is open.
	We see the faces of Okun, David and three technicians all
	peering at us with inquisitive expressions.

				OKUN
		See the gizmos flashing?

	REVERSE - INSIDE ALIEN CRAFT

	Sure enough, tons of gizmos with lights flashing.  High tech
	meets organic organisms.  This alien ship looks familiar to
	our own technology and completely different at the same time.

				OKUN (cont'd)
		We've been working around the
		clock trying to get a fix on all
		this crap.  Some stuff we figured
		out right away.

	David climbs in, fascinated.  He touches everything.  Okun
	points to everything as he describes it.

				OKUN (cont'd)
		This thing we're pretty sure is
		the life support for the cabin,
		this do-hickey over here is
		connected with the engines, this
		crap...we have no idea what that
		stuff is for.

	David is transfixed by it.  He stares at the small screens
	with flashing light patterns on them.

				OKUN (cont'd)
		But this over here is clearly what
		they use to navigate and guide the
		craft.

	But David still stares at the small screens.

				DAVID
		Someone grab my laptop for me?

	One of the technicians rushes off as Okun leans close.

				OKUN
		Find something interesting?

				DAVID
		Maybe.

	The technician hands David his retrieved laptop which he
	quickly flips open and turns on.

				DAVID
		These patterns here, they're
		repeating sequentially, just
		like...

	David turns his laptop around for Okun to see.  The pattern on
	David's laptop flashes identically as the alien screen.

				DAVID (cont'd)
		...their countdown signal.  Their
		using this frequency for computer
		communications.  It's how they co-
		ordinate their ships.

				OKUN
		You know, you're really starting
		to make us look bad.

	The two men exchange a smile.  Another TECHY pops his head
	inside.

				TECHY
			(out of breath)
		They got one!  They got one,
		alive!

	INT. HALLWAY OFF MAIN HANGAR - AREA 51 - SAME

	The bundled alien lays on a stretcher that's wheeled quickly
	into the hall.  Okun and his staff surround it.  Trailing
	behind them is Steve, Russell and Miguel.

				OKUN
		How long has it been unconscious?

				RUSSELL
		Excuse me Doctor...

				STEVE
		Three hours.

				OKUN
		Get him into containment, stat.

				RUSSELL
		My boy is very sick, he needs
		immediate attention.

	Okun ignores Russell, hitting the elevator switch on the wall,
	the room begins its hydraulic HUM.

				OKUN
		He's dying out.  I want him
		sprayed down with saline.

	Russell SLAMS his fist against the switch, the room stops.  He
	GRABS a doctor nearby, gets in his face.

				RUSSELL
		My boys is slipping into a diabetic
		coma.  If you don't do something
		about it right now he will die.

	Miguel is surprised and proud of Russell as he holds DOCTOR
	ISAACS, meaning business.

				DR. ISAACS
		O'Haver, Miller, come with me.
			(to Russell)
		Take us to him.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. ROAD - MAINTENANCE TRUCK - NIGHT

	Headlights pierce the darkness as the maintenance truck rolls
	to a stop.  Jasmine climbs down out of the truck, her face
	ashen.

	She walks past a sign reading: El Toro Marine Corps Air
	Station.  Tears begin to roll from her eyes.  We follow her
	gaze to see...

	EXT. EL TORO MARINE CORPS AIR STATION - CONTINUOUS

	The entire facility is smoldering, the last remnants of the
	fire burning itself to extinction.  Jasmine is devastated.

							CUT TO:

	INT. AREA 51 COMMAND CENTER - NIGHT

	General Grey and Nimziki are in a heated argument.

				GENERAL GREY
		You were the head of the National
		Intelligence Agency!  You knew all
		about this.  When were you
		planning on informing the rest of
		us!?

				NIMZIKI
		It had been deemed classified.

				GENERAL GREY
		Christ, why didn't you say
		anything about this when they
		first arrived?  You could have
		warned us before we launched a
		counter attack that cost us
		hundreds of American pilots!

	Just then the President enters along with Constance and some
	other ADVISORS.  He examines a paper map of the United States,
	tacked to the wall, each major city circled in black.

				PRESIDENT
		Atlanta, Chicago and Philadelphia,
		destroyed?

				GENERAL GREY
			(composing himself)
		And there are scattered reports of
		sightings over Miami, Ft. Worth,
		And Memphis.

	The President and his team take seats at the large conference
	table.

				GENERAL GREY (cont'd)
		We've learned that NATO and
		western allied installations were
		the firs to be taken out.  We
		were next.  They knew exactly where
		and how to hit us.

	Grey sneaks an accusatory glare at Nimziki.

				PRESIDENT
		And our forces?

				GENERAL GREY
		We're down to approximately
		fifteen percent, Sir.
			(beat)
		If you calculate the time it takes
		them to destroy a city and move
		on, we're looking at world wide
		destruction of every major city
		within the next thirty six hours.

				PRESIDENT
		We're being exterminated.

	The room is quiet.  Constance runs her fingers through her
	hair.  The door to the room opens and Lt. Mitchell enters with 
	Steve.

				MITCHELL
		Mr. President, this is Lt.
		Colonel Steven Hill.

	The President quickly gets to his feet, anxiously shaking
	Steve's hand.

				PRESIDENT
		Lieutenant, congratulations.

				STEVE
		Thank you, sir.

				PRESIDENT
		Where is the prisoner now?

				MITCHELL
		We have him in isolation.  The
		doctors are very hopeful he will
		survive.

				PRESIDENT
		I'd like to see him.

				MITCHELL
		Yes, sir.

	The General is concerned but the President is determined.
	They head for the door.

				STEVE
			(to General Grey)
		General, I'm anxious to get back
		to El Toro.

				GENERAL GREY
		Didn't anyone tell you?  I'm
		sorry.  El Toro was destroyed in
		the attack.

	Steve is shattered, he had no idea.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. EL TORO BASE - NIGHT

	The injured are gathered around a small camp fire.  Jasmine
	walks up, dumping a box full of charred can goods.

				JASMINE
		These should last us a while.

	As Margaret tries to move, she winces in pain.  Jasmine rushes
	to her aid.  The color from her face drained, Margaret looks
	like she's taking a turn for the worse.

				JASMINE
		Don't move.  Stay still.

	Jasmine adjusts the bandages as Margaret turns and see Dylan
	curled up next to Boomer, too adorable.  Slowly he starts to
	wake up.

				MARGARET
		Your son.

				JASMINE 
		He's my angel.

				MARGARET
		Was his father stationed here?

				JASMINE
		He wasn't his father.  I was kinda
		hoping he'd want the job, though.

	Jasmine becomes sad, remembering.  Margaret changes the
	subject.

				MARGARET
		So, what do yo do for a living?

				JASMINE
		I'm a dancer.

				MARGARET
		Really?  Ballet?

				JASMINE
			(laughs)
		No.  Exotic.

				MARGARET
		Oh.  Sorry.

				JASMINE
		Don't be.  I'm not.  It's good
		money.
			(re: Dylan)
		'Side, he's worth it.

	The bandages changed, Jasmine sits down next to Margaret.

				MARGARET
		And when the dancing's over?  What
		about your future?

				JASMINE
		Funny, it used to scare me when I
		thought about the future.
			(looking around)
		Guess it doesn't really matter
		anymore.

	Dylan comes walking over.

				JASMINE
		Dylan, come here.  I want you to
		meet the First Lady.

				MARGARET
			(surprised)
		I thought you didn't recognize me.

				JASMINE
		Didn't want to say anything.  I
		voted for the other guy.

							CUT TO:

	INT. CONTAINMENT LAB - NIGHT

	Okun and two Medical assistants examine the alien creature.
	His arms and chest have been strapped down to the examining
	table.

	For the first time we get a good look at the head of this
	creature, long tentacled-type cords interlocked, covering the
	face.  The doctors attach clamps to each of the cords.

				OKUN
		Everyone ready?

	The doctors exchange nervous glances, nod to each other.  At
	the same moment all they pull on the clamps, unraveling the
	interlocked cords.  As the cords unravel, we SEE that this is
	in fact a bio-mechanical SUIT as we REVEAL...

	THE ALIEN

	Beneath the cords lay the unconscious face of the alien, his
	skin translucent, his body fluids, capillaries, muscle tissue,
	alien's skin.

				OKUN
		Do we have life support monitors
		recording?

				MED ASSIST #2
		Yes.  If we fuck up it'll all be
		on tape.

				OKUN
		Can we get some ventilation in
		here?  I can't take this smell.

				MED ASSIST #2
		They've conquered space travel but
		not b.o.

	As Okun begins to put on a pair of surgical gloves he suddenly
	grabs his forehead.

				MED ASSIST #1
		You all right?

				OKUN
		Yeah.  It's just that stink gives
		me a headache.

				MED ASSIST #2
		He's moving!

	Instantly everyone's attention is riveted to the arm of the
	alien as it moves beneath the sheet.  Unseen by the others the
	alien creature's EYES OPEN.

	Another SHARP PAIN hits Okun who SCREAMS, stumbling backwards
	grabbing his head.  The others turn in surprise.

	THE ALIEN

	Suddenly SPRINGS up, the restraining straps SNAPPING.  Before
	Med #2 can react, one of the alien's tentacles SMASHES her
	across the face.  She is sent sprawling backwards.

	LOW ANGLE - THE ALIEN

	Standing before her.  In a wink of an eye, he ATTACKS, leaping
	on her.

	Together they TUMBLE back into a formaldehyde tank.  Hoses
	are ripped from their sides and STEAM pours out.  We get quick
	glimpse of their struggle as the steam engulfs them.

	INT. HALLWAY - SAME

	Mitchell leads the Presidential party down the hall.  They
	turn and enter the Medical lab.

	INT. CONTAINMENT LAB - CONTINUOUS

	The group slows as they enter the room.  They see the
	containment room through the glass is covered with white
	steam.  Nothing can be seen.  It's eerily quiet.

	Cautiously they approach.  Suddenly Okun is SLAMMED AGAINST
	the glass partition, the creature's tentacles wrapped around
	him.  Pressed firmly to the glass, his eyes are shut, his
	expression pained, but when he speaks the voice is angry.

				OKUN/ALIEN
		Release...me.

				MITCHELL
		Open the door.  Get him out of
		there.

	Suspicious, General Grey stops him.

				GENERAL GREY
		Wait.
			(to Okun)
		Can you hear me?

				OKUN/ALIEN
		Will kill...release me.  Now!

	They follow the tentacles with their eyes, up to the ceiling
	of the containment tank.  Suddenly the alien LEAPS DOWN,
	startling them, landing before them behind the glass.

	We see he's holding Okun against the glass, speaking THROUGH
	HIM.  This is the first real good look we get at the this bizarre
	creature.  Everyone in the room is repulsed and compelled by
	it at the same time.

	EXT. AREA 51 - NIGHT

	Through the hundreds of campers and trailers parked outside,
	Steve runs past until he reaches the open tarmac.

	A transport helicopter sits on the edge of the landing area.
	Steve runs up to it and climbs inside.

	INT. TRANSPORT HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS

	Steve quickly starts it engines, preparing to take off.  A
	SOLDIER rushes over to the cockpit.

				SOLIDER
			(yelling)
		What the hell are you doing?  Get
		out of there!

				STEVE
		I'm just going to borrow it.

	The Soldier pulls out his pistol, taking aim.

				SOLIDER
		No you're not, sir.

				STEVE
		You really want to shoot me?

	Steve stares the Soldier down.  Reluctantly he lowers his gun.

				SOLDIER
		Shit.  I'm gonna catch the hell for
		this.

	Steve smiles and gives him a quick salute then TAKES OFF.
	Quickly the bird RISES UP and darts off into the night.

	INT. MEDICAL LAB - SAME

	The President has moved closer to the glass and is talking
	with the alien.  The alien uses Okun like a ventriloquist's
	dummy.

				PRESIDENT
		Why did you people come here?

				OKUN/ALIEN
		Air...water...your "sun."

				PRESIDENT
		Where do your people come from?
			(no answer)
		Where is your home?

				OKUN/ALIEN
		Here...now.

				PRESIDENT
		And before here?

				OKUN/ALIEN
		Many worlds...

				PRESIDENT
		Can we negotiate a truce?  is
		there room for co-existance?
			(no answer)
		Can there be peace between us?

				OKUN/ALIEN
		Peace?  No peace.

				PRESIDENT
		What do you want us to do?

				OKUN/ALIEN
		Die.

	The Alien moves closer to the glass staring at the President.
	Suddenly the President clutches his head in pain.

				NIMZIKI
		Mr. President?

				OKUN/ALIEN
		We kill you...all.

	The pain becomes more severe and the President SCREAM OUT.
	There is general panic as people rush to the President's side.

				GENERAL GREY
			(to Mitchell)
		Is that glass bullet proof?

				MITCHELL
		No sir.

	The General draws his pistol.  Mitchell and the other military
	officers follow his lead.  Simultaneously they all begin to
	FIRE!

	The glass SHATTERS into a billion pieces.  The Alien is cut to
	ribbons, falling backwards.

	The President collapses.  So does Okun.  A STAFFER rushes over
	to Okun, checks his pulse.

				STAFFER
		He's dead.

	General Grey moves to the President who slowly recovers.

				GENERAL GREY
		Mr. President, are you okay?

	Woozily the President sits up, a strange look in his eye.

				PRESIDENT

		They're like locusts.  They travel
		from planet to planet, their whole
		civilization.  After they've
		consumed every natural resource
		they move on.  And we're next.

	The President stands with a new resolve.  He stares at the
	dead alien on the floor.

				PRESIDENT
			(cold)
		Prepare a nuclear strike.

	INT. STORAGE LAB - MINUTES LATER

	The research staff are working near the recovered alien
	attacker.  Constance comes rushing in.  She looks around for
	David.  Through the glass of one of the offices she sees him.

	INT. OFFICES - CONTINUOUS

	Holding a bottle of Jack Daniels, David fishes through a small
	refrigerator as Constance enters.

				DAVID
		Just my luck, no ice.

				CONSTANCE
		I take it you've heard.

				DAVID
		A toast to the end of the world.

	David toasts her with the bottle, takes a swig.

				CONSTANCE
		He didn't come to this decision
		lightly.

	David nods, he doesn't want to argue.  He smiles cynically.

				DAVID
		You still believe in him.

				CONSTANCE
		He's a good man.

				DAVID
		Better be.  You left me for him.

				CONSTANCE
		I wanted a career.  Didn't you
		ever want to be part of something
		special?

	David stares daggers at her.

				DAVID
		I was part of something special.

	Constance realizes he means their marriage.  She's hurt him
	and can see it.  She turns and leaves.

	EXT. DARK SKIES - NIGHT

	A black shadow is vaguely seen in the dark night.  As we pass
	some moonlit clouds we recognize the shadow is, in fact, a B-2
	STEALTH BOMBER.

	As we WIDEN, we see that the bomber is part of a squadron of
	eight.  These mighty winged giants fly together in attack
	formation.

	INT. COMMAND CENTER - ARE 51 - SAME

	A tracking screen comes to life, eight blips flashing.

	EXT. BLACK SKIES - NIGHT

	The eight B-2 Stealth Bombers break formation, each heading
	off to their different target destinations.

	INT. COMMAND CENTER - SAME

	On a large map, we see the eight target destinations and the
	planes heading for them.

				PRESIDENT
		Who will we reach first?

				COMMANDER
		Houston, Texas.  Intercept ETA,
		six minutes and counting down.

				PRESIDENT
		Oh my God, Houston.

				GENERAL GREY
		The major cities have been
		deserted.  Civilian casualties
		should be at a minimum, sir.

	One map screen, ENLARGES, tracking the bomber on route to
	Houston.

	EXT. LIQUOR STORE - OUTSIDE HOUSTON - NIGHT

	Looters take all they can carry through the broken glass store
	front.  A large heavily armored TANK rolls up front.

	INT. ARMORED TANK - SAME

	Nervous military technicians work equipment as their TANK
	COMMANDER pulls down a periscope.

	TANK COMMANDER POV - SPACE SHIP OVER HOUSTON

	Through the periscopes cross-hairs we SEE downtown Houston,
	the City Destroyer space ships settling in above it.

	EXT. B-2 STEALTH BOMBER - SAME

	Silhouetted against the shimmering waters on the bay, they
	Stealth Bomber can be seen as it approaches Houston.

	INT. B-2 STEALTH BOMBER - COCKPIT - SAME

	The flight crew works their computers (similar readouts are
	seen at command center).  The Multi-Function Display (MFD)
	flashing before each crew member.

				PILOT
		We have laser targeting locked.

	INT. COMMAND CENTER - SAME

	Everyone turns to the President who does not answer.

				GENERAL GREY
		Mr. President, do you wish to

	Still there is no answer.
				NIMZIKI
		Mr. President?

				PRESIDENT
			(softly)
		Deploy.

	EXT. B-2 STEALTH BOMBER - WEAPONS BAY - SAME

	The bay doors open and a large Tactical Nuclear Cruise Missile
	drops down, flies parallel with the bomber as it adjusts its
	radar and laser tracking.  Suddenly it SHOOTS OFF.

	The bomber BANKS AWAY.

	INT. B-2 STEALTH BOMBER - SAME

	We see the horizon twisting away as we bank off from target.

				PILOT
		She's away.

	INT. COMMAND CENTER - SAME

	On the big map we see one FLASHING target line tracking the
	missile as it approaches Houston.

				PRESIDENT
			(to himself)
		May our children forgive us.

	INT. ARMORED TANK - OUTSIDE HOUSTON - NIGHT

	The Tank Commander readjusts the periscope.

	TANK COMMANDER POV - SPACE SHIP & B-2 STEALTH BOMBER

	We follow the Cruise Missile as it guides itself on a direct
	collision course with the space craft.

	INT. COMMAND CENTER - SAME

	The targeting map shows how close the missile is, nearly on
	top of the target.  Everyone in the room holds their breath.

	EXT. SPACE CRAFT - SAME

	The nuke speeds closer.  It HITS the protective shield and
	DETONATES.  A FLASH OF LIGHT.

	WIDE ANGLE - HOUSTON

	With the B-2 Stealth Bomber in the foreground, the city behind
	it vanishes in a FLASH OF LIGHT, blinding us.

	INT. COMMAND CENTER - SAME

	We can see the extent of the explosion on the targeting map,
	tracking it -- an expanding ring around Houston.

				NIMZIKI
			(excited)
		It's a hit!

	The others are still waiting.  The monitor shows the night
	vision picture of the growing MUSHROOM CLOUD rising above the
	city.

	EXT. HOUSTON - WIDE - SAME

	The MUSHROOM CLOUD engulfs the horizon.

	EXT. ARMORED TANK - SAME

	Rocked by the massive explosion, the shock wave ROCKS the
	armored tank but doesn't destroy it.

	INT. ARMORED TANK - SAME

	The men inside are KNOCKED around, hard from the explosion.

	INT. COMMAND CENTER - SAME

				NIMZIKI
		We got the bastards!

	General Grey shoots Nimziki a look.  The President holds up a
	hand, silencing the room.

				PRESIDENT
		Can they see it?  Did it destroy
		the target?

	TANK COMMANDER'S POV THROUGH PERISCOPE - SAME

	As the cloud begins to dissipate we see THE SPACE CRAFT IS
	STILL THERE, completely unharmed.

	INT. ARMORED TANK - SAME

				TANK COMMANDER
		Negative.  Target remains.

	INT. COMMAND CENTER - SAME

	On the monitors as well, we can see the target remain.  The
	air is let out of the room, everyone deflated.

				PRESIDENT
		Call them back.

				NIMZIKI
		The other bombers might have more
		luck.  We shouldn't just give
		up...

				PRESIDENT
		I said call them back.

	As the technicians call the bombers away, the President sinks
	into a depression.  His last hope of survival gone.

	EXT. EL TORO MARINE CORPS AIR STATION - NIGHT

	Jasmine keeps Margaret company as the rest sleep around the
	last flames of their campfire.  From the worried expression on
	Jasmine's face we can tell that Margaret has gotten worse, her
	wounds bleeding badly.

	A WIND kicks up, the sound of an ENGINE approaching.  Jasmine
	squints her eyes looking up into the wind when a BRIGHT LIGHT
	engulfs her.

	JASMINE'S POV - LIGHTS - NIGHT

	Bright lights in the sky growing nearer.  Slowly the others
	begin to wake up, frightened as the lights INTENSIFY.

	The others slowly begin to retreat but Jasmine stands, staring
	defiantly.  A smile creeps across her face as she sees that
	the lights belong to...

	TRANSPORT HELICOPTER

	The Transport Helicopter touches down and Steve leaps out,
	racing towards Jasmine.  Overwhelmed, Jasmine jumps into his

		How is she?

				ISAACS
		I'm sorry, Mr. President.  If only
		we could have gotten to her

	The President puts his daughter down as he sees...

	PRESIDENT'S POV - MARGARET

	Margaret lays in bed, doctors and nurses surrounding her.
	Patricia rushes over.

				ISAACS
		She's bleeding internally.
		There's nothing else we can do.

	Stunned, the President watches as Patricia hugs her mother.

				MARGARET
		Hiya Munchkin.

				PATRICIA
		Mommy, we were worried.  We didn't
		know where you were.

				MARGARET
		I'm right here, baby.

	Recovering, the President nods for the doctors to leave the
	room.  As they begin to march out, he makes his way over to
	his wife and daughter.

				PRESIDENT
		Honey, why don't you wait outside
		so Mommy can get some rest.

	Patricia kisses her mother, says goodbye and leaves.  Out of
	sight, Margaret winces, fading away.  The President grabs her
	hand for support.  She squeezes tightly.

				MARGARET
			(through tears)
		I'm scared, Tom.

				PRESIDENT
		It's okay.  The doctors said
		you're going to be just fine.

	Margaret smiles at the man she knows all too well.

				MARGARET
		Liar.

	The look between them says more than any words.

	INT. HALLWAY - OUTSIDE MARGARET'S ROOM - LATER

	The President exits the room, overcome with emotion.
	Constance, the doctors and some medical crew move to comfort
	him.  He holds them off with a gesture.

	He looks up and sees Jasmine, Steve and Dylan down the hall.
	He pushes through the crowd and makes his way over to them.

				JASMINE
		I'm so sorry.

				PRESIDENT
		I just wanted to thank you.
		You're a very brave woman.

	Across the hall, Patricia sits in a chair, waiting.  Whitmore

	EXT. AREA 51 - NIGHT

	David is drunkenly knocking everything over, making a gigantic
	mess.  Moishe comes up behind, restraining him.

				MOISHE
		David, David!  What the hell are
		you doing!?

				DAVID
		I'm making a mess.

				MOISHE
		This I can see.

				DAVID
		We've gotta burn the rain forest,
		Pops.  Dump toxic waste, pollute
		the air, rip up the ozone.  Maybe
		if we screw this planet up enough
		they won't want it anymore.

				MOISHE
		David, you're drunk.

	David slips, falls on his ass, hard.  Moishe helps him back up
	on his feet.

				MOISHE
		I think you better sleep this off.
		Go back inside before you catch a
		cold.

	Slowly David looks up towards Moishe, an idea.

				DAVID
		Pops, you're a genius!

				MOISHE
		What'd I say?

				DAVID
		A cold?  Of course.

	Sobered, David jumps kisses his father and bolts inside.

							CUT TO:

	INT. STORAGE LAB - DAY

	A large crowd has been gathered here at the lab.  General Grey
	and Nimziki walk up to Constance.

				NIMZIKI
		All right, Connie, we're here.
		What's this all about?

				CONSTANCE
		I really have no idea.  He just
		said to bring everyone down here.

	Steve shows Dylan the alien space craft.

				DYLAN
		Does that thing fly in outer
		space?

	Steve loos up at the craft admiringly.

				STEVE
		It certainly does.

	When the President enters a technician rushes over and knocks
	on the hatch door on the alien attacker.  The door swings open
	and David climbs down.

	Grabbing a coke can from the "recycle" trash bin, David places
	the empty can on top of the alien attacker.  David turns and
	faces the gathering.

				DAVID
		Could anyone please step back
		away from the craft?

	They do and David nods to a Technician inside the craft.  The
	Technician disappears inside, closing the door behind him.  A
	loud HUM emits from the craft.  David has to yell over it.

				DAVID
		Lt. Mitchell, would you mind
		drawing your pistol?

				MITCHELL
		What?

				DAVID
		From where you're standing, do you
		think you could shoot that can off
		the alien craft?

	Mitchell shrugs affirmatively.  David gestures for him to try.
	Taking aim, Mitchell SHOOTS.

	The bullet RICOCHETS off the attacker's protective shield.
	Several people in the crowd dock, afraid of being hit by the
	errant bullet.

				DAVID
		Sorry 'bout that.  You see, it's
		protected by the craft's shields.
		We can't penetrate their defenses.

				NIMZIKI
		We know that already.  What's your
		point?

	David walks over to his laptop, now connected directly to the
	craft by cables and starts typing furiously.

				DAVID
		My point is if we can't beat their
		defenses, then we must get around
		them.

	David stops typing and stares at his wrist watch, silently
	counting down.

				DAVID
		Lt. Mitchell, would you please try
		to shoot it again?

	Reluctantly Mitchell obliges.  This time the can is BLOWN OFF
	THE CRAFT.  Everyone in the room is shocked.  The Technician
	re-opens the craft's door and the loud HUM disappears.

				GENERAL GREY
		How did you do that?

				DAVID
		I gave it a cold.

	The President is fascinated, he steps closer.  Moishe beams
	proudly at his smart son.  Constance is amazed.

				DAVID (cont'd)
		More accurately, I gave it a
		virus.  A computer virus.

	David turns his laptop around for the President to see.

				GENERAL GREY
		Are you telling us you can send
		out a signal that will disable all
		their shields?

				DAVID
		Just as they used our satellites
		against us, we can use their own
		signal against them.

	David walks over to a diagram he's made showing the
	relationship between the Mother Ship, the Space Crafts and the
	smaller alien attackers.

				DAVID (cont'd)
		If we plant the virus directly
		into the mother ship, it would
		then filter down into all the
		corresponding ships below.

				NIMZIKI
		And just how do we infect the
		"Mother Ship" with a virus?

	David gestures to the alien attacker behind him.

				DAVID
		We'll have to fly their craft out
		of our atmosphere and dock with
		the mother ship.

	Intrigued Steve turns and looks back at the alien attacker,
	sizing it up.  David points to a satellite photo of the
	underbelly of the Mother Ship.

				DAVID (cont'd)
		We can enter here, upload the
		virus and set off an explosion
		that could disable it.  This would
		disorient the smaller ship below
		and buy you some time to take them
		out.

	Constance reacts, realizing David's participation in the plan.

				NIMZIKI
		This is ridiculous.

				GENERAL GREY
		How long would their shields be
		down?

				DAVID
		Once they discover the virus it
		could be a matter of minutes.

				NIMZIKI
		You want us to co-ordinate a
		massive world wide counter strike
		with a window of only a few
		minutes?

				GENERAL GREY
		With their shields down it might
		be possible.

				NIMZIKI
		Please, you're not buying into any
		of this nonsense, are you?  We
		don't have the manpower or the
		resources to launch that kind of a
		campaign.
			(gesturing to the alien
			 ship)
		Not to mention that this whole
		cockamamie plan is dependent on a
		machine that no one in the world
		is qualified to operate.

				STEVE (O.S.)
		I wouldn't say that, sir.

	Everyone turns to Steve who steps through the crowd.

				STEVE
		I've seen them in action.  I've
		watched their maneuvers.  With
		your permission, sir, I'd like the
		opportunity to try.

				NIMZIKI
		That thing's a wreck.  It crash
		landed back in the fifties!  We
		don't even know if it's capable of
		flying.

	David turns to the Technicians.

				DAVID
		Remove the clamps!

	Technicians move to the large holding clamps on either side of
	the craft.  With a loud CLANK, the clamps are pulled away.

	For a moment the hulking craft TEETERS unevenly, but quickly
	stabilizes, FLOATING ABOVE THEM.

				DAVID
		Any other questions?

	Everyone stares at the floating ship with wonder.

				PRESIDENT
		Let's do it.

	INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

	Constance, General Grey and the President are walking down the
	hall.  Nimziki rushes to catch up.

				NIMZIKI
		I understand that you're upset
		over the death of your wife but
		that's no excuse for making
		another fatal mistake...

	The President whirls, grabs Nimziki and SLAMS him against the 
	wall.  Holding him tight, the President gets in his face.

				PRESIDENT
		The only mistake I made was
		appointing a sniveling little
		weasel like you Chief of Staff.

	Constance is about to intervene when General Grey stops her.

				PRESIDENT (cont'd)
		But this is a mistake, I am
		thankful to say, I do not have to
		live with.  Mr. Nimziki, you're
		fired.

	The President releases him and turns to General Grey.

				PRESIDENT (cont'd)
		Organize every plane you can find
		and get some Goddamned pilots
		to fly them.

				GENERAL GREY
		Yes, Sir.

	He storms off leaving everyone stunned.

	Suddenly the flap to the tent opens.  All the pilots draw
	their pistols frightening the ARAB PILOT who stands in the
	doorway.  The Arab Pilot speaks quickly in Arabic.

				REGINALD
		What the hell's he saying?

	As they step out of the tent we SEE more than a HUNDRED
	FIGHTERS PLANES from different nations parked around them.
	They've all gone into hiding out here in the desert, divided
	into many smaller camps.

	Reginald and Thomson follow their Arab cohort, walking through
	the many other campsites.  Thomson gets some stares from the
	IRAQI PILOTS.

				REGINALD
		I still get believe this.

				THOMSON
		The Iraqis don't appear altogether

	Sure enough a campsite of ISRAELI PILOTS sits very near by.

	ANGLE - ARABIAN AIR FORCE CAMP

	Dozens of Arab pilots are gathered around a large radio as the

		I can fly, I mean, I'm a pilot.

	The officer just stares at the bottle of Jack Daniels still in

		Exactly.  Use it the same way.

		Oh shit, we're late.

	Steve dashes off as David moves toward the attacker.
	Constance has been eavesdropping.  She walks to David.

				CONSTANCE
		Thirty seconds?  Isn't that

				DAVID
		We'll be well on our way out of

		off.

	David leans under the attacker where a TECHNICIAN is attaching
	another device.

				TECHNICIAN
		It's the strongest SHF transmitter
		we could get.  It'll tell us when

				DAVID
		Then cross your fingers the

	David turns and walks away, Constance following.

				CONSTANCE
		With you?  I don't understand why

				DAVID
		If anything goes wrong I'll have

	David stops, picking up a small trash can labelled "recycle."

		fight for our freedom.  Not from
		tyranny, persecution or
		oppression.  But from
		annihilation.  We're fighting for
		our right to live, to exit.  From
		this day on, the fourth day of
		July will no longer be remembered
		as an American holiday but as the
		day that all of mankind declared
		we will not go quietly into the
		night.  We will not vanish without
		a fight.  We will live on.  We
		will survive.

	The crowd erupts into applause and cheers.  The President
	turns and walks over to an Officer holding a bundle of
	clothes.  General Grey confronts the President as he begins to
	disrobe.

				GENERAL GREY
		Mr. President, just what do you
		think you're doing?

				PRESIDENT
		I'm a pilot, Will.  This is where
		I belong.

	General Grey wants to argue but can't.

	INT. STORAGE LAB - SAME

	Constance and David embrace as Steve turns to Dylan.

				STEVE
		When I'm back we'll light those
		fireworks.

	Jasmine hugs them both as Moishe walks over to David.

				MOISHE
		David, take these.

	David looks down at the "barf bags" in Moishe's hand.

				DAVID
		Thanks, Pops.

				MOISHE
		I want you should know, I'm very
		proud of you, son.

	That means more to David than Moishe could have known.

				CONSTANCE
		Be careful.

	Constance hugs David as Steve suddenly freaks out.

				STEVE
		Damn it.  We can't go yet.  I
		gotta find some cigars.

	Steve is about to bolt when Moishe grabs him, retrieving two
	cigars from his coat pocket.

				MOISHE
		My last two.  With my blessings.

				STEVE
		You're a lifesaver.

	Steve grabs them and climbs inside.  David smiles awkwardly,
	then follows Steve.

	INT. ALIEN ATTACKER - CONTINUOUS

	The hatch shuts and David takes a seat next to Steve who hands
	him one of the cigars.

				STEVE
		Hang on to this.  For our victory
		dance.  But not 'til we hear the
		fat lady sing.

	Reluctantly David takes it.  As he does Steve notices the
	"barf bag" on David's lap.  Off Steve's look...

				DAVID
		I have a confession to make.  I'm
		not real big on flying.

				STEVE
		Great.

	INT. STORAGE LAB - SAME

	Constance and Jasmine join the others behind the observation
	glass outside the room as the Attacker prepares for lift off.

	Part of the ceiling suddenly PEELS AWAY, revealing an enormous
	SHAFT leading topside.

	INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ALIEN ATTACKER - SAME

	Strapping in and securing their equipment, Steve grabs hold of
	the throttle.

				STEVE
		You ready?  Let' rock and roll.

	Steve pulls back on the throttle but the attacker swings
	BACKWARDS.

	INT. STORAGE LAB - SAME

	The Alien Attacker SMASHES BACKWARD into the rear of the lab.
	Moishe winces as the others react fearfully.

	INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ALIEN ATTACKER - SAME

	Embarrassed, Steve adjusts the throttle.

				STEVE
		Oops.

	Like a stick shift diagram of a car, a small hand written
	"post it" card is pasted onto the dash.  Steve reaches over
	and turns it upside down, righting the problem.

				STEVE
		Let's try that again.

	This time he pushes the throttle forward and the Attacker
	JERKS ahead.

	INT. STORAGE LAB - CONTINUOUS

	Shooting up into the ceiling shaft above, the Attacker ZOOMS
	out of the underground laboratory.

	EXT. AREA 51 - SHAFT - SAME

	With a WHOOSH the Alien Attacker ZOOMS out of the underground
	shaft and SOARS into the sky.  Once high enough it goes into a
	wild barrel roll.

	INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ALIEN ATTACKER - SAME

	Just as it comes out of the roll.

				DAVID
		What the hell are you doing?

				STEVE
		Just getting a feel for her.

	EXT. MORNING SKIES - CLOUD BANK - SAME

	The Attacker arcs upward and disappears into the clouds.

	EXT. AREA 51 - THE PRESIDENT'S PLANE - SAME

	The President watches the Attacker flying away.  His canopy
	locks down as he adjusts his helmet.

				PRESIDENT
		Grey, you read me?

				GENERAL GREY
			(filtered)
		Roger, Eagle One, our primary
		target has shifted course.

	INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

	General Grey is standing by the large map tracking the alien
	ships over the United States.

				PRESIDENT
			(filtered)
		Where's it headed?

				GENERAL GREY
		I think our secret is out.
		They're headed right for us.

	INT. PRESIDENT'S PLANE - SAME

				GENERAL GREY
			(filtered)
		ETA thirty six minutes.

	The President gets a determined look in his eye.  He FIRES UP
	his engine.  Following his lead, engines ignite, canopies lock
	down and planes taxi to position.

	EXT. UPPER ATMOSPHERE - ALIEN ATTACKER - SAME

	The captured alien attacker soars higher and higher.

	INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ATTACKER - SAME

	Slowly getting sick, David holds onto his "barf bag."

				STEVE
		You still with me?

	David nods sheepishly.  Steve's eyes go wide with wonder as
	the ship climbs to the edge of our atmosphere.

				STEVE
			(to himself)
		I've waited a long time for this.

	The ship begins to SHAKE, rattling harshly as it climbs.
	Through the window we SEE the blue sky EVAPORATE.  Slowly a
	field of STARS take its place.

	This is the moment Steve had wished for all his life.  He's
	not disappointed.  David, however, is not so thrilled.

	EXT. SPACE - STEVE AND DAVID'S ATTACKER - SAME

	Heading further into space, ZOOMING overhead.

	INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ATTACKER - SAME

	Through the windshield we see a huge OBJECT floating in
	the distance, the moon behind it.

				DAVID
		That's it.  Head straight for it.

	But Steve gets distracted, something wrong with the controls.

				STEVE
		Something's happening.  It's not
		responding.

	David looks over at his laptop, connected to the ship's on
	board computers.  Th signal is ADJUSTING.

				DAVID
			(thrilled)
		I was counting on that.  They're
		bringing us in.

	EXT. BLUE SKIES - MORNING

	The President's plane leads thirty fighters in attack
	formation.

				PRESIDENT
		We have visual.

	RESERVE ANGLE - ALIEN SPACE CRAFT

	The fifteen mile wide space craft peeks over a mountain range
	headed straight for us.

				GENERAL GREY
			(filtered)
		Do not engage until we've
		confirmed the package has been
		delivered.

				PRESIDENT
		Roger.

	INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

	Constance is standing by Lt. Mitchell behind the Military
	cadre coordinating the battle.

				CONSTANCE
		What if that thing gets here
		before we can plant the virus?

				MITCHELL
		The entire compound is buried deep
		within the mountain.  It should
		give us some protection.

				CONSTANCE
		But what about all the people
		outside?

	Mitchell shoots her a worried look.  Quickly they both dash
	outside.

	EXT. MOTHER SHIP - SAME

	Steve and David's attacker flies towards the gigantic Mother
	Ship.  Hundreds of other attackers flow in and out of the
	Mother Ship through the many triangular portals.  Steve and
	David's attacker's drawn into one of them.

	INT. PORTAL SHAFT - MOTHER SHIP - SAME

	Caught in a stream of attackers, they flow through the portal
	shaft leading into this planet sized space craft.  They pass
	by enormous windows revealing the HUNDREDS OF ALIENS working
	within the Mother Ship.

	We spill out of the shaft and into a gigantic cavity
	stretching out beyond visibility.  Enormous TOWERS are
	scattered throughout.

	INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ATTACKER - CONTINUOUS

	Neither can believe their eyes.  Staring out the front window
	they SEES...

	STEVE AND DAVID'S POV ALIEN TROOP PARADE GROUND

	Below them THOUSANDS OF ALIENS can be seen as they are marched
	into dozens of enormous TROOP CONTAINERS docked at the edges
	of the parade grounds.

				DAVID
		Must be thousands of them.  What
		are they doing?

				STEVE
		Looks like they're preparing the
		invasion.

	INT. DOCKING STATIONS - MOTHER SHIP - CONTINUOUS

	They pass the parade ground and head into the middle of this
	huge cavernous sphere, closing in on the many LANDINGS.
	Hundreds of attackers are docked at each one.

	In the center of the Landing are large BAY WINDOWS, inside is
	a kind of control tower.  We can SEE several ALIEN WORKERS
	through the glass.  Steve and David's attacker is heading
	straight towards them.

				STEVE
		This won't work.  They'll see
		before we can do anything.

	Lifting up another hand written card labeled "window," David
	pushes the button underneath.

				DAVID
		These things are fully equipped.
		Reclining bucket seats, power
		windows...

	A BLAST SHIELD lowers covering the window.

	Slowly Steve and David's attacker lowers onto large docking
	CLAMPS which LOCK ON, holding it in place.

				DAVID
		We're in!

	David starts typing frantically.

	INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

	Mitchell turns from one of the consoles to General Grey.

				MITCHELL

	EXT. AREA 51 - BRENNON TRAILER - SAME

	Alicia struggles to drag out a large duffle bag.  Philip (the
	boy who brought the penicillin earlier) rushes over.

				PHILIP
		Let me get that.

	He grabs the bag for her.  Alicia smiles.  Miguel helps Troy
	down from the trailer.  As they rush away, Miguel turns to
	Philip.

				MIGUEL
		Where's Russell?

	ANGLE - HANGAR - ENTRANCE TO COMPOUND

	Constance, Jasmine and Mitchell are helping to usher the
	refugees into the compound.

				CONSTANCE
		Hurry, we've got to get everyone
		inside.

	Constance looks up and SEES off in the distance...

	THE ALIEN SPACE CRAFT

	Piercing the horizon, coming over the top of a distant
	mountain.  Headed this way.

	INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ATTACKER - SAME

	David finishes typing.  The screen on his laptop flashes:
	UPLOAD COMPLETE.

				DAVID
		The virus is in.  All we can do
		now is pray.

	EXT. BLUE SKIES - AMERICAN FIGHTERS - SAME

				GENERAL GREY
			(filtered)
		Delivery complete.  Engage.

				PRESIDENT
		Roger.

	The fighter jets GUN IT and overtake the smaller planes in
	front of them.

	Below the President's plane the weapons bay door opens and a
	long range AMRAAM Missile DROPS DOWN, computes its target and
	DARTS OFF.

	INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

	Mitchell and General Grey move over to a monitor showing
	visual from the Present's Plane.  They SEE the missile
	moving towards target.

				GENERAL GREY
		Keep your fingers crossed.

	EXT. AMERICAN FIGHTERS - SAME

	The pilots watch nervously as the missile nears its target.

				PRESIDENT
		Come on, baby.

	ANGLE - AMRAAM MISSILE

	Just as it gets to the shield perimeter, the missile EXPLODES.
	The shields are still up.

	INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

	They watch the missile blow up harmlessly.  Deflated, General
	Grey grabs his mic.

				GENERAL GREY
		It didn't work.  Disengage.  Sir,
		get your people out of there.

	EXT. PRESIDENT'S PLANE - SAME

	The President is not ready to give up.

				PRESIDENT
		Not yet!

	Below his plane another MISSILE drops down, and DARTS OFF.

	ANGLE - MISSILE

	This one goes past the point of the previous explosion.  It
	moves in closer and closer.  Suddenly it HITS THE SIDE OF THE
	SHIP.  A HUGE EXPLOSION, rips off a part of the side of this
	immense ship.

	INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

	We SEE the explosion on the monitor.  Everyone in the room
	CHEERS.

				GENERAL GREY
		You did it!  A direct hit!

	EXT. BLUE SKIES - AMERICAN FIGHTERS - SAME

	The pilots are thrilled.

				PRESIDENT
		We're going in!  Squadron leaders,
		take point.

	The fighters break off into six group of five.  One by one,
	each fighter DROPS A MISSILE.  We follow DOZENS OF MISSILES on
	their way to the space craft.

	ANGLE - SPACE CRAFT

	The Attacker Bay doors open and DOZENS OF ALIEN ATTACKERS
	shoot out.  Spreading wide.

	Guided missiles EXPLODES as they hit the City Destroyer,
	damaging the outer hull.  The Attackers go after the American
	fighters.  The six groups split wide.  An aerial dog fight
	ensues.

	EXT. AREA 51 - REFUGEE CAMP - SAME

	Miguel searches for Russell as the refugees run for the
	hangar.

				MIGUEL
		Russell!

	Miguel gets swept up in the tide.  As the last of them enter
	the hangar, TWO ALIEN ATTACKERS arrive behind them, STRAFING
	the ground.  The rows of trailers homes EXPLODE one after
	another.

	ANGLE - ELEVATOR HALLWAY - BACK OF HANGAR

	Constance ushers the crowd into the elevator hallway.  Packed
	into the hallway together, they are panicked at the sound of
	the nearby explosions.  As the last one is safely inside,
	Constance turns back and SEES...

	CONSTANCE'S POV - HANGAR AND ATTACKERS

	The attackers FIRE and the front half of the hangar EXPLODES.
	Constance is KNOCKED back against the wall.  She activates the
	elevator and the room begins to SINK.

	As the hallway submerges, the entire hangar comes CRASHING
	DOWN behind them.

	INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

	Over monitors the General observes the aerial battle.  This
	room, too, ROCKS from the explosions.  The monitors FLICKER.

	INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ATTACKER - SAME

	Steve struggles with the controls but is getting no where.

				DAVID
		Get us out of here!

				STEVE
		I can't shake her free.

	EXT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ATTACKER - SAME

	Though the attacker guns its engine, the CLAMPS below HOLD
	TIGHT.

	INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ATTACKER - SAME

	David moves over to the computer to see if he can help.
	Suddenly the large window slowly begins to DROP DOWN.

				STEVE
		What're you doing?

				DAVID
		It's not me.  They're overriding
		the system.

	The blast shield continues to peel away.  David and Steve drop
	down below the dash, hiding from view.  As the view becomes
	unobstructed we SEE...

	POV - THROUGH WINDOW - THE LANDING

	Several Alien's looking across at us from the large bay
	window of the Landing's control tower.

				STEVE
		Damn!

	David leans from his hiding position and SEES several other
	alien attackers are moving in on them.  They are surrounded.

				DAVID
		Check and mate.

	INT. AREA 51 - RESEARCH FACILITY - SAME

	Like images from England during the blitzkrieg, the refugees
	are huddled on the floor, the lights FLICKERING and the muted
	sounds of distant EXPLOSIONS.  Miguel moves through the
	refugees, searching for Russell.

	A Yarmulke is unfolded.  As it is lifted we realize Moishe is
	putting it on.  He holds the hands with the people around him
	and begins to pray.  Nimziki moves next to Moishe.  Moishe
	takes his hand.

				NIMZIKI
		I'm not Jewish.

				MOISHE
		It's okay.

	ANGLE - PHILIP AND ALICIA

	As another bomb rocks the room, Alicia moves closer to Philip.

				ALICIA
		This could be our last night on
		Earth.  I don't want to die a
		virgin.

				PHILIP
		If we do, we'll both die virgins.
		But at last we'll be together.

	Alicia smiles, a nice guy at last.

	EXT. AREA 51 - SPACE SHIP - SAME

	The City Destroyer space ship is settling just above the
	compound as the American fighters circle it, chased by the
	attackers.  Below the SCHISM begins to open!

	INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

	In all the commotion, no one notices as Miguel sneaks inside.

				OFFICER
		We're running out of missiles,
		Sir.  We're just not causing
		enough damage.

	EXT. PRESIDENT'S PLANE - SAME

				GENERAL GREY
			(filtered)
		They're getting ready to fire the
		big gun.  You're going to have to
		find a vulnerable spot, fast.

				PRESIDENT
		I've got an idea.  Keep 'em off my
		tail.

	Taking the advice, the President DIVES.  He's met by two
	flanking Fighters (EAGLES 9 & 2) as they cruise the underbelly
	of the City Destroyer.  Sure enough, the SCHISM is opening,
	preparing to fire the WALL OF DESTRUCTION.

				PRESIDENT
		Let's take 'em out before they
		take us out.

	The President locks the SCHISM hatchway into the center of his
	HUD (heads up display).  Just as he FIRES, Eagle 9 is BLOWN
	OUT OF THE SKY.  It rocks the President, sending his missile
	off target.

	Off balance, the missile hits just wide of the hatchway and
	EXPLODES, rocking the entire ship.

				PRESIDENT
		I'm out of missiles!  Eagle 2?

				EAGLE #2 PILOT
		I'm on it.

	But before he can target, his fighter EXPLODES.

	INT. HALLWAY - SAME

	The lights continue to flicker.  Jasmine grabs onto Dylan and
	Patricia, holding them tight.

	INT. WAR ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	On the monitor we SEE the SCHISM, and BRIGHT LIGHTS as several
	fighters fly past.

				GENERAL GREY
		We're out of time.  Get out of
		there!  Get as far away as you
		can.

	EXT. PRESIDENT'S FIGHTER - SAME

	Pissed, the President refuses to give up.

				PRESIDENT
		Doesn't anyone have any damned
		missiles left?!

				RUSSELL (O.S.)
		Sorry I'm late, Mr. President.

	The President spins and SEES darting out of the clouds...

	RUSSELL'S OLD BI-PLANE

	Russell ZOOMS past the President and alien attackers, barely
	missing their FIRE.

				PRESIDENT
			(filtered)
		Who is that?  What are you doing?

				RUSSELL
			(into mic)
		It's okay, Sir.  I'm packin'.

	We SEE he has a large MISSILES propped up in the seat behind
	him.  A light on it flashes ARMED.

	INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

				RUSSELL
			(filtered)
		Just keep those guys off me for a
		few more seconds.

	Hearing his voice, Miguel is shocked.  He moves closer towards
	the monitors.

	EXT. CITY DESTROYER - SAME

	The remaining fighters lay down COVER FIRE for Russell's old
	bi-wing.  Russell heads directly TOWARDS THE SCHISM.

	INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

	Everyone is gripped to the screen as we see it get closer and
	closer to the closing bay doors.  Miguel is aghast.

				RUSSELL
			(filtered)
		Do me one favor...

				OFFICER
		Who is that guy?

				MIGUEL
		Russell!

	Miguel races over to the microphone, attempts to grab it.

				RUSSELL
			(filtered)
		...tell my children I love them
		very much.

	EXT. CITY DESTROYER - SCHISM - SAME

	Russell nears the SCHISM, a hail of alien firepower erupting
	around him.

				MIGUEL
			(filtered)
		Dad!  No!

	Russell smiles at b being called "Dad."

				RUSSELL
		I've got to, kid.  You were always
		better at taking care of them than
		I was anyways.

	Russell turns off his radio as he banks UPWARD towards the
	open SCHISM.  The climb is steep, and the bi-wing nearly
	stalls out.

	Suddenly the bright lights VANISH and the beam begins to form.

	Russell's bi-wing just makes it INSIDE THE OPEN SCHISM and
	disappears from view.

	The President and remaining fighters BANK AWAY, clearing.

	Suddenly, A GIGANTIC EXPLOSION, RIPS THROUGH THE CENTER OF THE
	SPACE CRAFT.  It's causing a CHAIN REACTION of explosion.

	Teetering, the entire space ship, turns away out of control.

	INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

	The room erupts in CHEERS.  Everyone, that is, except Miguel.

	EXT. MOUNTAIN RANGE - SAME

	Not far away from Area 51, the enormous craft is burning from
	the center outwards.  Suddenly it DROPS and COLLIDES with the
	mountain range, EXPLODING ON IMPACT.

	INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

	Intercepting the celebration, General Grey moves over to a
	radio technician.

				GENERAL GREY
		Let's get on the wire.  Tell every
		squadron around the world how to
		shoot those fuckers down.

	INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ALIEN ATTACKER - SAME

	Sitting below the dash, Steve takes out the cigars, hands one
	to David.

				STEVE
		I guess there's nothing left to
		do.  Let's nuke 'em.

	David realizes they're both about to die.  He stares at the
	cigar.

				DAVID
			(re: cigar)
		Funny, I always thought things
		like these would kill me.

	They share a quick sober laugh.

				STEVE
		Nice meeting you.

				DAVID
		You as well.

	Steve lights his cigar, then lights David's.

				STEVE
		Ready?

	EXT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ALIEN ATTACKER - SAME

	Popping up from behind the dash, cigars in their mouths, Steve
	and David start waving "good-bye" like idiots.

	The Aliens in the tower don't know how to react.  The
	attackers move in for the kill.

	INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ATTACKER - SAME

				STEVE
		Think they know what's coming?

	He reaches down to the black box we saw before and enters the
	launch code.

				DAVID
			(still waving)
		Not a chance in hell.

	EXT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ATTACKER - SAME

	Suddenly the missile ERUPTS from behind the manifold and
	BLASTS into the control tower, SHATTERING THE GLASS WINDOW.

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	The missile SMASHES through the glass.  The atmosphere
	impeached, the aliens quickly succumb to the elements, chocking
	and dying.

	The missile BLASTS by WRECKING equipment until it LODGES into
	the back wall of the Landing tower.

	A small counter on the missile begins to count down 30:00,
	29:00, 28:00...

	EXT. DOCKING CLAMPS - SAME

	Rocked from the explosions, the docking clamps RELEASES and the
	ships jostles free.

	INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ATTACKER - SAME

	Steve grabs the controls.

				STEVE
		We're loose!

				DAVID
		Doesn't matter.  Game's over.

				STEVE
		I don't hear no fat lady.

	Steve THROTTLES IT.  The craft JOLTS AWAY.

	EXT. DOCKING STATION - SAME

	Steve and David's attacker BLAST away, the other alien
	attackers follow in hot pursuit.

	The attackers FIRE.  Steve SWERVES avoiding the blasts as they
	race for the exit.

	INT. LANDING - CONTROL TOWER - SAME

	Grasping for breath, a dying Alien looks up at the wedged in
	nuclear missile.  The counter reads: 00:04, 00:03, 00:02.

	We get the feeling the Alien knows what's coming.

	INT. DOCKING BAY - SAME

	Steve and David's attacker just reaches the doorway as the
	center of the landing EXPLODES behind them.

	The enormous impact, rocks some of the lagging attackers off
	track.

	EXT. MOTHER SHIP - SAME

	Steve DARTS his attacker out from underneath the Mother Ship's
	belly.  A group of attackers FOLLOW.

	Just as the last of them exit the docking bay, a HUGE FIREBALL
	erupts behind them ripping through the Mother Ship.

	ANGLE - FARTHER AWAY

	ZOOMING towards us, Steve guides his ship away.  The Alien
	attackers in hot pursuit.  Behind them we SEE the ENTIRE
	MOTHER SHIP EXPLODE.

	The immense EXPLOSION GROWS OUTWARDS coming right at us.  The
	ATTACKERS are GOBBLED UP as the EXPLOSION WIDENS.  Quickly the
	explosion gains ground on Steve and David.

	ANGLE - STEVE AND DAVID'S SHIP

	Like a loose board caught in the surf, Steve and David's ship
	rides the edge of the explosion, getting knocked END OVER END.

	The President is climbing out as General Grey rushes to his
	aid.  Behind him, Jasmine leads Dylan and Patricia, who breaks
	free and RUSHES to her father.  The President sweeps her up in
	his arms as Jasmine approaches.

				JASMINE
			(to General Grey)
		Any word from Steve?

	Behind her, Constance rushes over, the same thing on her mind.
	Before he can answer they HEAR a ROAR above.  They all become
	silent as they turn and look to the skies.

	ANGLE - BLUE SKIES - FIREBALL

	The FIREBALL COMET is rapidly shooting down towards us.
	Suddenly BURSTING OUT OF THE FLAMES, Steve and David's ship
	DARTS DOWN.

	Just over the heads of the cheering crowds, Steve and David's

				JASMINE
		You scared the hell out of me.

				STEVE
		Yeah, but what an entrance!

				JASMINE
		Dick-weed.

				STEVE
		Butt-munch.

	Constance comes running up to David, hugs him tightly.

				CONSTANCE
		Are you all right?

				DAVID
		Did it work?

				CONSTANCE
		You bet it did.

	She hugs him.  They kiss.

	Behind them Dylan, Patricia, the President and General Grey

	As they begin to celebrate, they look up to the sky.

	GROUP POV - BRILLIANT LIGHTS IN THE SKIES

	The debris from the Mother Ship explosion enters the

	FADE IN:

	EXT. DESERT OF THE AMERICAN SOUTHWEST - DAY

	A mountain peak dominates the landscape.


	TITLES BEGIN.

	Riders on horseback cross the desert. From this distance they appear to be a
	company of Army Cavalry Soldiers.

	CLOSER ANGLES ON THE RIDERS

	reveal only details of saddles, hooves and uniforms. The riders are silhouetted
	against the rising sun as they ride into an ancient CLIFF PUEBLO.

	The OFFICER IN COMMAND raises his hand halting his troops.

			OFFICER
		Dis-mount!

	RIDERS climb down from their mounts... and only now do we realize that
	this is a TROOP OF BOY SCOUTS, all of them about thirteen years of age. The
	"Commanding Officer" is only their SCOUTMASTER, Mr. Havelock.

	One of the Scouts, a pudgy kid named HERMAN, steps away from his horse,
	bends over and pukes. The other Scouts rag on him.

               			FIRST SCOUT
		Herman's horsesick!

	A BLOND SCOUT, however, befriends Herman. He has a thatch of straw-colored
	hair and the no-nonsense expression common to kids whose curiosity and appetite
	for knowledge exceed what they teach in school. Additionally, he has adorned his
	uniform with an authentic HOPI INDIAN WOVEN BELT.

               			SCOUTMASTER
		Chaps, don't anybody wander off.
		Some of the passageways in here
		can run for miles.

	Two Boy Scouts climb up the rocky base of the cliff.


	INT. THE PASSAGEWAY - DAY

	The two boys head down the passageway. It's dark, and the temperature drops
	several degrees. Spiders have built huge webs that get caught in the boys' hair.

	HERMAN appears very uncertain as to the wisdom of this enterprise, but he's
	drawn on by his companion's adventurous curiosity.


CONTINUED:

               			HERMAN
		I don't think this is such a good
		idea.

	LAUGHTER is HEARD; the Blond Scout pulls Herman forward toward its source.

	The VOICES GROW LOUDER now as the boys get closer to their source. The light
	of kerosene lanterns dances on the tunnel walls ahead. The boys approach
	cautiously, careful to stay hidden.

			HERMAN
		What is it?

	This is what they see:


	FOUR MEN digging with shovels and pick-axes. They have broken into one of the
	pueblo's SECRET CHAMBERS... called "Kivas."

	The men are ROUGH RIDER (his name describes his dress), ROSCOE (a Bowery
	Boy bully of 14) and HALFBREED (with straight black hair that cascades over his
	shoulders).

	And the fourth man wears a LEATHER WAIST JACKET and BROWN FELT
	FEDORA HAT. He has his back turned to us, but we would be willing to bet
	anything that this is INDLANA JONES.

	However, when the man turns, and his face is illuminated by the lantern's glow,
	we are shocked to discover that it is someone else.

	We'll call him FEDORA.

TITLES END.

	The TWO BOYS are mesmerized by what they see.

	Now we realize that the Blond Scout is actually young INDIANA JONES.

                  		               FEDORA
	                 	Alfred, did you get anything yet?
			
			MAN
           	     	Nothing. Dig in.

	Two of the men stand and look at ROSCOE who steps forward holding a box in his
	hands.

                  			ROSCOE
		Hey, I've got something!

	Whoops from the other men.

		                ROSCOE
		I got something, Garth!

CONTINUED: (2)

	ROSCOE rushes forward and gives FEDORA the box. Fedora steps toward a
	lantern resting on a rock.

               			ROSCOE
		I got something... I got something
		right here.

	More whoops from the other men.

	FEDORA puts the box on the rock next to the lantern. HALFBREED pushes
	ROSCOE as he jumps with excitement. ROUGH RIDER steps forward to look at the
	box as Fedora opens it.

			ROSCOE
        		      (more whoops; then)
		Oh, look at thatl
        		      (more whoops)
		We're richl We're rich!

               			HALFBREED
		Shut up. Shut up.

	FEDORA takes a BEJEWELED CROSS from the box and holds it aloft. Fedora's
	comrades practically salivate at the sight of it.

               			ROSCOE (O.S.)
		Well, we're rich, ain't we?l

	INDY takes off his hat and looks down at the o.s. action.

               			HERMAN
		Indy? Indy? What are they doing?
		Indiana? Indiana?

               			INDY
		Shhhl

	FEDORA blows dust from the Cross, turning it in his hand, silently appraising its
	beauty... and its value. He seems aloof from the others; somehow superior to
	them.

               			HALFBREED
		Hey, we got to find more stuff
		to bring back.

	INDY stays hidden, but is astounded by what he sees.

			INDY
        		      (hushed; urgent)
		It's the Cross of Coronadol
		Cortes gave it to him in 15201


CONTINUED: (3)

	FEDORA continues to admire the Cross, then places it on the rock next to its box
	and the lantern.

	INDY turns back to observe the men.

               			INDY
		That Cross is an important artifact.
		It belongs in a museum.

	A look of resolve comes into INDY's expression, and he turns back toward
	HERMAN.

               			INDY
		Run back and find the others.
		Tell Mister Havelock that there
		are men looting in the caves.

	HERMAN doesn't seem to be listening. Instead, he watches in wide-eyed horror
	as a SNAKE SLITHERS ACROSS HIS LAP.

               			INDY
		Have him bring the sheriff.

	INDY matter-of-factly picks up the snake and tosses it aside. HERMAN gasps.

               			INDY
		It's only a snake.

	INDY grabs HERMAN's scout scarf and pulls him closer.

               			INDY
		Did you hear what I said?

               			HERMAN
		Right. Run back. Mister Havelock.
		The Sheriff. What, what are you
		gonna do?

               			INDY
		I don't know... I'll think of
		something.

	INDY releases the scarf, gives HERMAN a pat and Herman dashes off. Indy sees
	the Cross on the rock next to the lantern. As the Robbers continue to search for
	additional valuables, Indy is able to work his way unseen to within arm's reach of
	the Cross...

	FEDORA looks over at the men digging in a hole b.g.

               			FEDORA
		Dig with your hands.

	INDY picks up the Cross.


CONTINUED: (4)

               			FEDORA (O . S . )
		Not with your mouth.

	As FEDORA stands watching the other men digging, INDY puts the Cross in his
	pants and begins to pull himself up a rope hanging nearby. As he climbs, Indy's
	feet break a wooden beam, attracting the men's attention.

               			ROSCOE
		He's got our thing!

			 HALFBREED
		Get 'im!

                                  

	The three Robbers are so eager to get their hands on INDY, they almost knock
	each other over in the attempt.

	Only FEDORA is unperturbed. He casts a disgusted glance in
	the direction of his fleeing companionsthen sets off
	after INDY.


         
	EXT. THE  CLIFFS - DAY

	INDY EMERGES from the darkness of the Pueblo into the brightness of day.

	He pausessquintsshields his eyeslooks in all directions.

               			INDY
		Mister Havelock! Anybody
		Everybody's lost but me!

	He hears RUNNING FOOTSTEPS BEHIND HIM and dashes off. ROUGH RIDER,
	HALFBREED, and ROSCOE are quick to appear and run after him.

			FEDORA
		  There he isl                   

       			MEN
		      (AD-LIBS)
		Let's go! Let's get him! Let's
		go!

	Indy jumps from one rock to another; the SCOUT TROOP HORSES are below. Indy
	puts two fingers in his mouth and WHISTLES for his horse, who trots over. Indy
	puts the Cross in his belt.

	INDY PREPARES TO JUMP into the saddle. Hesitates. Then... he JUMPS. But
	the horse moves exactly at the wrong moment and Indy lands flat on his feet in a
	standing position. The impact sends a shock wave up his body that rattles his
	back teeth. Indy stands up and successfully mounts his horse.

	FEDORA AND HIS MEN ARRIVE at the roof's edge in time to see INDY climb into
	the saddle and gallop off.


CONTINUED:

 			INDY
		Hyahl Hyah!

                     

                                    		ROSCOE
		Hey! Come back here!

	FEDORA puts two fingers in his mouth and WHISTLES... and A VINTAGE TRUCK
	AND AUTOMOBILE come ROARING OUT from behind the Pueblo (Driven by two
	more gang members). Now we glimpse...


	THE MAN IN THE PANAMA HAT

	The passenger in the car. His face is concealed by the hat's wide brim. His arm
	is out the window, however, and we see an olive-colored hand protruding from
	the sleeve of an expensive white linen suit. He gestures to the Robbers, now in
	the truck.

                                  		PANAMA HAT
		Come on. Get him!

	INDY SPURS his mount on to greater speeds but the autos not only keep pace
	with his horse... they begin to squeeze in on it.

	Speeding Autos. Thundering hooves. Rushing wind. Flying dust. INDY crouched
	low and leaning forward in the saddle, his heart pounding, his adrenalin
	pumping.

	INDY VEERS OFF in a new directiontoward a RAILROAD TRACK.


	EXT. A CIRCUS TRAIN - DAY

	The train is barreling down the track. INDY rides up beside it. He glances over
	his shoulder and sees the car and truck gaining on him. No other choice... he
	LEAPS FROM HORSE TO TRAIN.

	He clings to the side of a BOXCAR, as HALFBREED and ROUGH RIDER leap from
	the truck onto the train.

	HALFBREED tries to grab INDY, but Indy leaps onto another boxcar. Halfbreed
	runs after him but Indy leaps from the boxcar onto some covered boxes stacked
	on a flatcar.

	INDY loses his balance but regains it. With HALFBREED and ROUGH RIDER still
	running after him, Indy enters the trap door of...


	INT. THE REPTILE CAR - DAY

	and finds himself CRAWLING on a CATWALK suspended from the car's ceiling.
	Several feet below are NUMEROUS VATS containing all manner of reptiles:
	Alligators, crocodiles, giant lizards, etc.


CONTINUED:

	Then, HALFBREED ENTERS through the trap doorfollowed by ROUGH RIDER.
	Halfbreed grabs hold of INDY's feet, but Indy kicks at him and he loses his grasp.

	INDY crawls away, toward an opening on the opposite side. HALFBREED grabs at
	Indy's feet again; Indy rolls away and we SEE large bins of squirming snakes.

	The combined weight of the three people is more than the catwalk was intended
	for, and the BOLTS BEGIN TO RIP FROM THE CEILING.

	Everyone holds their breath, afraid to make another move. Too late. SEVERAL
	BOLTS TEAR FREE. HALFBREED and ROUGH RIDER SCREAM... but it's Indy's
	end of the catwalk that DROPS DOWN... PLUNGING INDY to the floor of the car.

	He lands hard, with a SPLASH into a vat of water... where he finds himself eye-
	to-eye with an

	ENORMOUS ANACONDA

	The head of this snake is so damn big, it looks more like a Tyrannosaurus Rex.

			INDY
		Oh...		

	INDY jumps back in horror... only to land with a SQUISH into the SNAKE VAT.

			INDY
		Oh... Oh...

	Hundreds of slippery, squirming snakes. INDY sinks into them. They cover him.
	Engulf him. Almost smother him.

	INDY jumps out of the side of the vat, freeing himself.

	INDY locates a clean-out door at the bottom of the car and uses it to escape.

	HALFBREED, meanwhile, tries to open the closed window of the car. He groans.
	ROUGH RIDER moves to assist him.

			ROUGH RIDER
		Here, let me.



	EXT. THE TRAIN- DAY

	INDY stops, checks to see the Cross still lodged in his belt. Suddenly he looks
	worried as he frantically reaches into his shirt, REMOVES A SNAKE FROM and
	tosses it away.

	ROSCOE APPEARS atop the reptile car and manages to grab INDY. Indy kicks at
	him. Roscoe grabs onto the side of the reptile car as Indy moves on to...

	EXT. A FLATCAR - DAY

	INDY climbs over canvas-covered circus equipment. ROSCOE follows, grabbing a
	long stick with a hook on it. He reaches forward and trips Indy, who falls onto
	the roof of the rhino boxcar.


	INT. THE RHINO BOXCAR - DAY

	as a lamp falls from the ceiling with the impact of Indy's fall, hitting a HUGE
	BLACK RHINOCEROS.


	EXT. THE RHINO BOXCAR - DAY

	ROSCOE grabs INDY by the ankle and yanks him off his feet. The two struggle,
	rolling from side to side, coming perilously close to rolling right off the edge.
	Things get even more serious when Roscoe PULLS A KNIFE.


	IN THE BOXCAR BELOW

	... THE FEROCIOUS BLACK RHINO is becoming extremely agitated by the
	commotion going on atop his cage. Finally, he raises his head and THRUSTS HIS
	HORN THROUGH THE ROOF.

	BACK TO THE ROOFTOP

	as the horn SMASHES through the wood only inches from INDY's head. Indy and
	Roscoe stare at the horn in amazement as they continue to struggle.
	SMASH! The horn comes up againRIGHT BETWEEN INDY'S LEGS.

 			INDY
                   		Holy smokes!
                                    

	INDY kicks ROSCOE away. Roscoe rolls to the edge of the car but keeps from
	falling. Indy flips over onto his stomach.


	EXT. THE REPTILE CAR - DAY

	The WOODEN TRAP DOOR EXPLODES as a BULLET is FIRED from within. The
	door is pushed open and HALFBREED and ROUGH RIDER hurry out of the car.


	EXT. THE RHINO BOXCAR - DAY

	INDY gets to his feetlooks aheadsees a WATER TANK alongside the track
	directly up ahead. Indy gets an idea...

	In an instant, he calculates his approachtimes the distanceand LEAPS for
	the tank's WATER SPOUT.


CONTINUED:

	He catches it perfectly... but his velocity causes the water spout to ROTATE A
	FULL 360 DEGREES. With INDY hanging on, feet kicking, the water spout
	deposits him back on the train, onto the ROOF OF A STOCKCAR, where he looks
	up to see FEDORA walking toward him.

               			FEDORA
		Come on, kid. There's no way
		out of this.

	As INDY edges away from FEDORA, a portion of the STOCKCAR'S ROOF
	COLLAPSES and Indy FALLS THROUGH into the car below.


	INT. THE STOCKCAR - DAY

	INDY CRASHES down from above. Dust rises.

			INDY
                  		Ohhh!                                   

	INDY's eyes take a moment to adjust to the dark. A bit of sunlight leaks in
	through the cracks between the boards.

	Then INDY sees it. At the far end of the boxcar. Rising slowly to its feet... an
	AFRICAN LION. The Lion ROARS. The boxcar walls shake. Indy gasps. Dust
	swirls up into the shafts of sunlight.

	And INDY has one more surprise in store: The Cross of Cortes has been dislodged
	from his belt during the fall...

	INDY glances around, sees a coiled LION TAMER'S WHIP hanging on a nail. He
	carefully takes it down by the handle. The Lion sees this and GROWLS SOFTLY.

	INDY swallows hard and gives the whip a try. It unravels awkwardly, its TIP
	flying back and HITTING INDY IN THE FACE... CUTTING his chin.

	The Lion GROWLS LOUDER. Indy quickly gathers up the whip, wets his lips, and
	tries again. This timesuccess! The WHIP CRACKS SHARPLY. The Lion
	BELLOWS and SWATS the air... and steps back.

	INDY looks amazed and delighted. He CRACKS the whip again. The Lion backs
	away even more. Indy inches forwardbends down (never taking his eyes off
	the Lion)picks up the Crossand steps back again, sweat pouring down his
	face.

	But now... how to get out?

	He looks up at the opening through which he fell and sees FEDORA LOOKING
	DOWN AT HIM. Fedora extends his hand.

               			FEDORA
		Toss up the whip.

	EXT. THE ROOFTOP OF STOCKCAR

	FEDORA, assisted by HALFBREED and ROUGH RIDER, "reels" INDY out of the
	Stockcar as the Lion ROARS and lunges and Indy screams.

	The men, including ROSCOE, pull INDY through the hole in the roof. He stands to
	face them as ROUGH RIDER points a gun in his direction.

			FEDORA
         	 	You've got heart, kid.
		       (indicates Cross)
		But that belongs to me.

       			INDY
		       (takes Cross from his belt)
		It belongs to Coronado.

       			FEDORA
		       (overlapping)
          		Coronado is dead. And so are all
		his grandchildren.

			INDY
		This should be in a museum.

			ROSCOE
          		Now give me thatl

	ROSCOE makes a grab for the Crossbut INDY doesn't let go. A tug-of-war
	ensues until a SNAKE WIGGLES OUT FROM INDY'S SHIRTSLEEVE and WRAPS
	AROUND Roscoe's hand.

	ROSCOE SCREAMS BLOODY MURDERreleases his grip on the Cross and tries
	to shake off the snake. This is all the opportunity Indy needs. He LEAPS ONTO
	THE NEXT CAR.

			FEDORA
          		Don't let him get awayl

	INDY swings down to the caboose. He sees a sign above the caboose door reading
	"DR. FANTASY'S MAGIC CABOOSE."

			INDY
		Magic?

	He glances back at the men and quickly opens the door to the caboose, stepping
	inside.

	FEDORA puts out his arm, gesturing for the others not to follow INDY.

			FEDORA
          		Hold it. Make sure he doesn't
		double back.

	INT. THE CABOOSE - DAY

	which contains the circus MAGIC EQUIPMENT. INDY rushes to the rear door of
	the caboose but can't open it. He hears FEDORA coming, and dives into a MAGIC
	BOX.

               			FEDORA
		Okay, kid. out of the box.
		Now.

	FEDORA smiles confidently and advances toward the box. The box unexpectedly
	collapses; all four sides flop away... revealing NOTHING. INDY has completely
	vanished.

	FEDORA is mystified, frustrated and angered. Then he feels a breeze at his back.
	He turns and discovers that the caboose door is open. He rushes out onto the
	balcony and sees:

	INDY RUNNING along the tracks, turning up a street of modest clapboard houses.


			FEDORA
		Damn.


	EXT. STREET - SMALL TOWN - DAY

	as INDY runs from the railroad tracks and approaches his house we see the name
	"JONES" painted on the mailbox.

               			INDY
		Dad!

	INT. THE HOUSE - DAY

	INDY bursts through the front door holding the Cross in his hand. A Husky
	BARKS as Indy runs past in search of his father.

               			INDY
		Dad!

               			INDY
		Dad!

	INT. THE STUDY - DAY

	INDY charges in. The study is cluttered with books. Pictures, charts and maps
	clearly reflect the father's passion for Medieval studies.

	PROFESSOR HENRY JONES is absorbed at his desk. In fact, he is studying a very
	ancient parchment volume which lies open on the desk. The page shows a
	beautifully illuminated picture of what might be a stained-glass window. The
	sketch incorporates a series of Roman numerals. The Professor is not just
	studying it, he is copying it into his own notebook.


CONTINUED:

We never get to see the PROFESSOR's face in this scene.
So INDY CHARGES IN.
                 
			INDY
		Dad!

			HENRY
		Out!

			INDY
		It's important!

			HENRY
		Then waitcount to twenty.

			INDY
		No, Dad. You listen to me

			HENRY
                 		      (now he shouts)
		Junior!

	No question who is the boss here. INDY gulps, his look says "What am I going to
	do with this guy?" And obeys
	starts counting, VERY, VERY FAINTLY.

			INDY
		One, two, three, four...

	Now we see what HENRY is concentrating on. We see his hand
	sketching; then, he holds up one finger.

			HENRY
		In Greek.

	INDY's reaction:

			INDY
                 		     (louder, in Greek)
		One... two... three... four...

	An ancient car is heard arriving. Perhaps INDY glimpses it going past the
	window. Anyway, it stops outside the house. Two men sit in the front seat.
	HERMAN sits in the rear, BLOWING A TRUMPET.

	INDY's reaction: Trouble!

	HENRY is just finishing the sketch.

			HENRY
		May he who illuminated this...
		illuminate me...

	INT. THE FRONT ROOM - DAY

	The study door is just closing, INDY closing it behind him... just as HERMAN
	comes through the front door, still playing the trumpet.

	INDY reaches for the trumpet, pulling it from HERMAN's mouth. Herman
	continues to spitright into Indy's face. Indy flinches.

               			HERMAN
		I brought the Sheriff.

	HERMAN means the SHERIFF, who now enters the house.


               			INDY
		Just the man I want to see! Now,
		there were five or six of them.


            			SHERIFF
        		      (interrupting)
		All right, son.

              			INDY
        		      (overlapping)
		... they came after... me...


                          		SHERIFF
		You still got it?

               			INDY
		Well, yes, sir. It's right here!

	INDY shows the CROSS, more or less handing it to the SHERIFF to make his
	point. The Sheriff takes it casually.

               			SHERIFF
		I'm glad to see that... because
		the rightful owner of this Cross
		won't press charges, if you give
		it back.

	FEDORA enters the house, followed by ROSCOE, ROUGH RIDER and HALFBREED.
	He politely removes his hat and holds it in his hand. He nods at INDY in a
	friendly manner.

               			SHERIFF
		He's got witnesses, five or six
		of them.

	The SHERIFF and FEDORA are in Cahoots

	The SHERIFF hands the Cross to FEDORA. ROSCOE reaches in and takes it from
	Fedora, then runs out the door.

			ROSCOE
           		Yahoo!

CONTINUED:

	As ROSCOE runs outside INDY seesthrough the screen doorthe MAN IN
	THE PANAMA HAT waiting patiently beside the car that is parked out front.
	Roscoe approaches and gives the Man the Crossthe Man hands Roscoe some
	money in exchange.

	The SHERIFF tips his hat and leaves.

			SHERIFF
		Good day.

	FEDORA remains behind for a moment. He turns and speaks to INDY in an ironic
	man-to-man way.

                			FEDORA
     		You lost today, kid, but that
		doesn't mean you have to like it.

	Then, FEDORA takes off his hat and takes a step towards INDY. He holds the hat
	by the crown, and puts it on Indy's head, a show of respect and admiration for
	the boy. The hat blocks Indy's face.

	CLOSE ON THE TOP OF THE FEDORA HAT

	The hat brim fills the screen. As the brim tilts up, WE SEE the face of FULL
	GROWN INDIANA JONES.

	And... POW!... he's punched in the face while his arms are pinned behind his
	back.

	FADE IN TITLE: "PORTUGUESE COAST1938"

                                  		PANAMA HAT
		Small world, Doctor Jones.

                                     		INDY
		Too small for two of us.

	THE MAN IN THE PANAMA HAT (years older now) removes the CROSS OF
	CORONADO from Indy's belt.

                                  		PANAMA HAT
     		This is the second time I've had
     		to reclaim my property from you

                			INDY
     		That belongs in a museum

                			PANAMA HAT
		So do you.
		      (he moves his eyeline)
		Throw him over the side.

	THE DECK OF A PORTUGUESE CARGO SHIP

	It's NIGHT. RAIN POURS down. We're in the middle of a violent STORM AT SEA.
	Thirty-foot waves crash across the deck.

	The TWO PORTUGUESE SAILORS (who have Indy's arms pinned behind his back)
	propel INDY across the deck toward the rail.

	As they pass a BUNDLE OF FUEL DRUMS, INDY uses the Two Sailors as leverage
	to KICK UP HIS FEET and break open the CLAMP on the metal bands that hold
	the drums together.

	INDY jabs his elbows into the stomachs of the startled Sailors and rushes toward
	the MAN IN THE PANAMA HAT.

	PANAMA HAT sees INDY coming and hurries toward the ladder that leads up to
	the bridge. Indy withstands the force of waves crashing on the deck and makes
	his way to where Panama Hat is climbing the ladder. He pulls him off the ladder
	from behind the two men fall down on the deck. Indy takes the cross back from
	Panama Hat.

	A sailor delivers a powerful blow to Indy's face, sending the cross flying out of
	his grip and skittering across the deck. Indy grabs a crowbar and fends off two
	sailors who attack him from the sides.

	INDY sees that the Cross is about to be swept overboard. He lunges for it.

	He SNATCHES UP the Cross only to be knocked down to the deck by a giant wave.
	He struggles to his feet, managing to avoid the giant fuel drums sliding across the
	deck around him.

	SEVERAL MORE DRUMS come INDY's way. He sidesteps them all.

               			PANAMA HAT
		Grab him, he's getting away!
		Grab him!

	Indy turns around and pummels two sailors with one punch. Indy sees a large
	Stevedore's hook above him and he climbs up on crates to reach it. He grabs a
	hold of the hook and uses it to swing all the way across the deck, narrowly
	avoiding a huge wave behind him. He jumps into the rollicking ocean, still
	holding onto the cross. On the ship, a giant fuel drum rolls wildly, falling directly
	onto a crate of TNT. The crate explodes, causing the entire ship to blow, sending
	an enormous orange fireball into the sky.

	LONG SHOT - THE BOAT EXPLODING OUT OF THE WATER

	as bits of debris fall from the sky like rain.

	INDY BOBS UP

	in the water amid the debris, holding the Cross in his hand. He grabs for
	something to keep him afloat. It turns out to be one of the ship's LIFE
	PRESERVERS. INDY loops his arm through the preserver.


CONTINUED:

	Only now do we see the FADED LETTERING on the preserver revealing the
	destroyed ship's name and city of port:

                  VAZQUEZ de CORONADO
	BARCELONA

	A SHREDDED PANAMA HAT floats past.

	EXT. COLLEGE - DAY
	Students walk along brick, tree-lined paths.

			INDY (V.O .)
		Archaeology is...


	INT. COLLEGE LECTURE HALL - DAY

	DISSOLVE TO:

	INDY, dressed in professorial tweeds, stands before his class. He turns to the
	blackboard with a piece of chalk and writes the word: "FACT."

		               INDY
		... the search for fact. Not truth.
		If it's truth you're interested
		in, Doctor Tyree's Philosophy
		class is right down the hall.

	Laughter.

	INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

		               INDY
		So forget any ideas you've got
		about lost cities, exotic travel,
		and digging up the world. Eve
		do not follow maps to buried
		treasure and "X" never, ever,
		marks the spot.


	MARCUS BRODY approaches Indy's classroom. He peers through the window in
	the door to see INDY completing his lecture.

		               INDY
		Seventy percent of all archaeology
		is done in the library. Research.
		Reading.


	INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY

	BRODY enters the lecture hall and stands at the rear of the room.


CONTINUED:

		               INDY
		We cannot afford to take mythology
		at face value.

	The BELL RINGS. INDY stands at his desk as students begin to disperse. A
	pretty coed puts a note on the desk.

		               INDY
		Next week: "Egyptology." Starting
		with the excavation of Naukratis
		by Blinders Petrie in 1885. I will
		be in my office if anybody's got
		any problems for the next hour
		and a half.

	BRODY approaches as the last of the students leaves the lecture hall.

			INDY
		Marcus!
		      (slaps his pocket)
		I did it!

			BRODY
		You've got itl

	INDY removes the cloth-wrapped Cross from his desk. He places it on the desk
	and takes off his glasses as BRODY examines the Cross.

		               INDY
		You know how long I've been
		looking for that?!

			BRODY
		All your life.

			INDY
		All my life!


 		              BRODY
		Well done, Indy. Very well done,
		indeed This will find a place
		of honor in our Spanish collection.

	INDY gathers up his books and makes his way toward the door.

		               INDY
		We can discuss my honorarium over
		dinner and champagne tonight.

	He turns back toward BRODY, now holding the Cross.

			INDY
		Your treat.

			BRODY
		Yes. My treat.

	INT. INDY'S OUTER OFFICE - DAY

	Bursting with STUDENTS, all competing for his attention at once: "Professor
	Jones! " "Doctor Jonesl " etc., etc.

		               INDY
		Shush! Shush! Shushl

	INDY shoulders his way to the desk of his secretary, an overwhelmed Teaching
	Assistant named IRENE.

		               IRENE
		Doctor Jones! I'm so glad you're
		back! Your mail is on your desk.
		Here are your phone messages.

		               MALE STUDENT
		Doctor Jones, you promised...
		Doctor Jones

		               IRENE
		This is your appointment schedule.
		And these term papers still haven't
		been graded.

	INDY takes the term papers then turns to enter his PRIVATE OFFICE. Students
	once again CLAMOR for his attention: "Doctor Jones!" "Wait, Doctor Jonesl"
	"My grade!" "Sign my registration card!"

	INDY silences the mob with a raised hand.

			INDY
		        (very efficiently)
		Okay. Irene, put everyone's name
		on a list, in the order they
		arrived, and I'll see each and
		every one of them in turn.

	The Students descend upon poor IRENE, each claiming to be first. INDY slips into
	his -

	PRIVATE OFFICE

	where he goes to his desk and finds a thick envelope with a foreign postmark on it.

			INDY
		        (softly; reading)
		"Venice, Italy."

	Then, INDY stuffs his mail into his coat pockets, goes to the WINDOW, slides it
	open and STEPS OUT INTO THE GARDEN.


	EXT. SIDE OF COLLEGE BUILDING - DAY

	INDY escapes through the garden.

	EXT. FRONT OF COLLEGE BUILDING - DAY

	INDY walks briskly toward the street; smiling, erUoying his freedom. As he
	arrives at the curb, a LONG BLACK PACKARD SEDAN pulls up before him.


			MAN (O.S.)
		Doctor Jonesl

	THREE MEN step out of the sedan. Everything about them bespeaks "G-MAN."
	The First Man steps behind Indy.

		               MAN
		Doctor Jones?

	INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - DAY

	INDY is ushered into a large Art Deco apartment and left alone. Numerous
	museum-quality artifacts are displayed around the room. Indy takes this
	opportunity to examine them.

	After a moment, WALTER DONOVAN enters from across the room. During the
	brief time that the door is open, we HEAR a COCKTAIL PARTY going on in the
	next room: VOICES and SOFT PIANO MUSIC.

	DONOVAN strides across the room toward INDY. Although in his late fifties,
	Donovan has the broad shoulders and trim physique of a much younger man.
	Dressed in a tuxedo, he exudes both confidence and power.

		               DONOVAN
		I trust your trip down was
		comfortable, Doctor Jones. My
		men didn't alarm you, I hope.

	He shakes hands with INDY.

		               DONOVAN
		My name is Donovan. Walter Donovan.

		               INDY
		I know who you are Mr. Donovan.
		Your contributions to the museum
		over the years have been extremely
		generous. Some of the pieces in
		your collection here are very
		impressive.

		               DONOVAN
		Well, like yourself, Doctor Jones,
		I have a passion for antiquities.
	               	         (beat)
		Have a look over here. This might
		interest you.


CONTINUED:

	DONOVAN goes to a table where an object is wrapped in cloth. He throws back
	the cloth revealing a flat STONE TABLETabout two feet square, inscribed with
	letters and symbols.

	INDY looks impressed. He puts on his glasses to make a closer examination.

		               INDY
		Well, it's sandstone. Christian
		symbol. Early Latin text. Mid-
		Twelfth Century, I should think.

		               DONOVAN
		That was our assessment as well.
	
		               INDY
		Where did this come from?

		               DONOVAN
		My engineers unearthed it in the
		mountain region north of Ankara
		while excavating for copper.
		        (beat)
		Can you translate the inscription?

	Translating the inscription is no easy matter, even for someone as knowledgeable
	as INDY.

	                                      INDY
		        (stumbling through it)
		"... who drinks the water I shall
		give him, says the Lord, will have
		a spring inside him welling up
		for eternal life. Let them bring
		me to your holy mountain in the
		place where you dwell.

	Donovan pours champagne into several fluted glasses as Indy reads.

		               INDY
		Across the desert and through
		the mountain to the Canyon of
		the Crescent Moon, to the Temple
		where the cup that"

	Suddenly INDY stops and looks up at DONOVAN with a startled expression.

		               INDY
		"Where the cup that holds the
		blood of Jesus Christ resides
		forever. "

				                                       (CONT'D)


CONTINUED: (2)

		        DONOVAN
		      (reverently)
		The Holy Grail, Doctor Jones.
		The chalice used by Christ during
		the Last Supper. The cup that
		caught His blood at the Crucifixion
		and was entrusted to Joseph of
		Arimathaea.

	INDY rubs his chin with a dubious expression as he takes the glass of champagne
	DONOVAN now offers him.

		               INDY
		The Arthur Legend. I've heard
		this bedtime story before.
	
		               DONOVAN
		Eternal life, Doctor Jones! The
		gift of youth to whoever drinks
		from the Grail.
		        (beat)
		Oh, now that's a bedtime story I'd
		like to wake up to!

		               INDY
		An old man's dream.

		               DONOVAN
		Every man's dream.
	      	      (beat)
		Including your father's, I believe.

	INDY stiffens slightly at the mention of his father, nods.

		               INDY
		Grail lore is his hobby.
		He's a teacher of Medieval
		Literature. The one the students
		hope they don't get.

	The door opens and MRS. DONOVAN steps into the room. She's a matronly
	woman in an expensive evening gown.

		               MRS. DONOVAN
		Walter, you're neglecting our
		guests.

		               DONOVAN
		Be along in a moment, dear.

	He leans over and kisses her cheek. MRS. DONOVAN sighs to herself and returns
	to the party. INDY, meanwhile, has turned his attention back to the Grail Tablet,
	obviously hooked by its archaeological promise. He moistens his finger with
	champagne and rubs it over the tablet. DONOVAN steps up next to Indy.


CONTINUED: (3)

		               DONOVAN
		Hard to resist, isn't it? The
		Holy Grail's final resting place
		described in detail!

		               INDY
		What good is it? This Grail
		Tablet speaks of deserts and
		mountains and canyons. Pretty
		vague. Where do you start
		looking? Maybe if the Tablet were
		intact, you'd have something to
		go on. But the entire top
		portion is missing.

		               DONOVAN
		Just the same, an attempt to
		recover the Grail is currently
		underway.

	INDY has to shake his head at DONOVAN's apparent lack of judgment.

		               DONOVAN
		Let me tell you another "bedtime
		story, " Doctor Jones.
		After the Grail was entrusted
		to Joseph of Arimathaea, it
		disappeared and was lost for a
		thousand years before it was found
		again by three Knights of the
		First Crusade. Three brothers,
		to be exact.

		               INDY
		I've heard this one as well.
		Two of these brothers walked out
		of the desert one hundred and
		fifty years after having found
		the Grail and began the long
		journey back to France. But
		only one of them made it. And
		before dying of extreme old
		age, he supposedly imparted
		his tale to ato a Franciscan
		friar, I think.

		               DONOVAN
		Not "supposedly," Doctor Jones.

	DONOVAN produces an ANCIENT LEATHER-BOUND VOLUME with very brittle
	pages. INDY views the manuscript with considerable interest.


CONTINUED: (4)

		               DONOVAN
		This is the manuscript in which
		the friar chronicled the Knight's
		story... it doesn't reveal on
		location of the Grail, I'm afraid...
		but the Knight promised that two
		"markers" that had been left
		behind would.
		       (indicates the Tablet)
		This Tablet is one of those
		"markers." It proves the Knight's
		story is true. But as you pointed
		outit's incomplete.
		       (beat)
		Now, the second "marker" is
		entombed with the Knight's dead
		brother. Our project leader
		believes that tomb to be located
		within the city of Venice, Italy.
		       (beat)
		As you can now see, Doctor Jones,
		we're about to complete a great
		quest that began almost two
		thousand years ago. We're only
		one step away.

		               INDY
		That's usually when the ground
		falls out from underneath your
		feet.

		               DONOVAN
		You could be more right than you
		know.

		               INDY
		Yes?

		               DONOVAN
		We've hit a snag. our project
		leader has vanished. Along with
		all his research. Uh, we received
		a cable from his colleague, Doctor
		Schneider, who has no idea of his
		whereabouts or what's become of
		him.
		        (beat)
		I want you to pick up the trail
		where he left off. Find the man
		and you will find the Grail.


CONTINUED: (5)

		                INDY
		You've got the wrong Jones, Mister
		Donovan. Why don't you try my
		father?

			DONOVAN
		        (after a pause)
		We already have. Your father is
		the man who's disappeared.


	EXT. A RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY

	A FORD COUPE speeds down the tree-lined street.

	EXT. PROFESSOR HENRY JONES' HOUSE - DAY

	The Ford coupe pulls up in front of the house. INDY climbs from the car and
	hurries up the walkway. BRODY is a step behind.

		                BRODY
		Your father and I have been
		friends since time began. I've
		watched you grow up, Indy. And
		I've watched the two of you grow
		apart.
		        (beat)
		I've never seen you this concerned
		about him before.

	They climb the porch and notice that the front door is ajar. They exchange a
	quick look of concern as they enter.

	INT. THE HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

	INDY approaches the half-open front door.


                      		INDY
	                  	Dad?
	                            (to BRODY)
		He's an academic A bookworm.
		He's not a field mans

	He pushes open the door. He enters the house and calls out.

	                                    INDY
		Dad? Dad?
                                          
	INDY opens one half of the curtains dividing the hall from the sitting room.

	We see the place has been ransacked.


CONTINUED:

	BRODY sees INDY's face and opens the other half.

			BRODY
	                        Dear God.

	They walk into the room.


 		              BRODY
		What has the old fool got
		himself into now?

		               INDY
		I don't know. But whatever it
		is, he's in over his head!

	BRODY picks up some mail from Henry's cluttered desk.

			INDY
		Dad?              

		               BRODY
	       	It's today's mail. And it's been
		opened.

	INDY turns and sees the pile of torn papers and envelopes. Then something hits
	him.

		               INDY
       		Mail! That's it, Marcus!

	He immediately empties his pockets of his own mail taken earlier in the day from
	his college office and finds the envelope with the Venice postmark.

			INDY
		      (as he tears it open)
		Venice, Italy!

			BRODY
		What is it?


	INDY uncovers a small book. It looks like a JOURNAL or
	DIARY. Indy flips through it: Page after page of
	handwritten notes and drawings. BRODY glances at it with
	great curiosity.

		               INDY
		It's Dad's Grail Diary. Every
		clue he ever followed. Every
		discovery he made. A complete
		record of his search for the Holy
		Grail. This is his whole life.
		Why would he have sent this to me?


CONTINUED: (2)

		               BRODY
		I don't know. But someone must
		want it pretty badly.

		               INDY
		Do you believe, Marcus?

	As INDY asks the question, he turns to a PAINTING on the wall: A depiction of
	Christ on the Cross, his blood being captured in a golden chalice.

	A SECOND PAINTING on the wall shows Eleventh Century Crusaders plummeting
	to their deaths over a high cliff. One Crusader, however, floats safely in midair
	because he holds the Grail in his hands.

		               INDY
		Do you believe the Grail actually
		exists?

		               BRODY
		The search for the Cup of Christ
		is the search for the divine in all
		of us.

	BRODY sees that INDY is unsatisfied by this response.

		               BRODY
		But if you want facts, Indy, I
		have none to give you. At my age,
		I'm prepared to take a few things
		on faith.

		               INDY
		Call Donovan, Marcus. Tell him
		I'll take that ticket to Venice
		now.

		               BRODY
		I'll tell him we'll take two.


	EXT. AIRFIELD - DAY

	A LIMO is parked beside a PRIVATE AIRLINER that bears the DONOVAN
	CORPORATE LOGO. BRODY peers inside to DONOVAN and INDY.

		               BRODY
		Tell me, what's going to happen
		when we get to Venice?

			DONOVAN
		      (overlapping)
		Don't worry. Doctor Schneider will
		be there to meet you.

CONTINUED:

			BRODY
		      (overlapping)
		Schneider?

		               DONOVAN
		     (overlapping)
		I maintain an apartment in Venice,
		at your disposal.

               			BRODY
		Oh, well. That's good. Thank
		you.

	BRODY and DONOVAN shake hands. INDY steps from the back seat of the limo.
	He turns back to Donovan and shakes his hand.

		               DONOVAN
		Doctor Jones. Good luck. Be
		very careful. Don't trust anvbody.


	INT. AIRLINER - FLYING - DAY
	
	INDY opens the Grail Diary and thoughtfully turns through the pages. He stops
	at one page and glances at a PENCIL SKETCH of what might be a stained-glass
	window. Below the sketch is a SERIES OF NUMBERS.

	EXT. VENICE - BOAT LANDING - DAY

	INDY and BRODY disembark from the Water Bus onto the Boat Landing as other
	Gondoliers steer their boats in the water.

			INDY
		 Ah, Venice...

		               BRODY
		Yes. Uh, how will we recognize
		this Doctor Schneider when we
		see him?

		               INDY
		I don't know. Maybe he'll know
		us.


CONTINUED:

	Suddenly a WOMAN comes up to him. Attractive features. Blonde hair. Eyes
	that are bright and intelligent.

			ELSA
		Doctor Jones?

			INDY
		Yes?

		               ELSA
		I knew it was you

	She looks at him with an appraising expression that is brazenly flirtatious.

	                                      ELSA
	                       you have your father's eyes.

	INDY is instantly attracted to her.

		               INDY
		And my mother's ears. But the
		rest belongs to you.

		               ELSA
		Looks like the best parts have
		already been spoken for.

	INDY grins, enjoying the repartee. The WOMAN turns to BRODY, who tips his hat.

		               ELSA
		Marcus Brody?

		               BRODY
		That's right.

	The Woman, DR. ELSA SCHNEIDER, extends her hand to BRODY.

			ELSA
		        (introducing herself)
		Doctor Elsa Schneider.

	INDY's grin fades. BRODY registers a look of surprise.

		               BRODY
		Uh... how do you do?

					CUT TO:


	EXT. VENICE CANAL - DAY

	INDY, BRODY and ELSA walk along the narrow canal, lined with buildings on
	either side.


CONTINUED:

		               ELSA
		The last time I saw your father
		we were in the library. He was
		very close to tracking down the
		Knight's Tomb. I've never seen
		him so excited. He was as giddy
		as a schoolboy.

		               INDY
		Who? Attila the Professor? He
		was never giddy, even when he was
		a schoolboy!

	INDY can't take his eyes off ELSA. Perhaps he's feeling a bit like a schoolboy
	himself right now. As they cross over a bridge to the opposite side of the canal,
	Indy steals a flower from a street vendor. He holds it out to Elsa.

		               INDY
		Frauleinwill you permit me?

		               ELSA
		I usually don't.

		               INDY
		I usually don't either.

		               ELSA
		In that case, I permit you.

	INDY gives her the flower.

		               INDY
		It would make me very happy.

		               ELSA
		But I'm already sadby tomorrow
		it will have faded.

		               INDY
		Tomorrow I'll steal you another.

		               BRODY
		        (cutting in)
		I hate to interrupt youbut the
		reason we're here

			ELSA
		        (interrupting)
		Yes. I have something to show
		you.

	She hands a slip of paper to INDY.


CONTINUED: (2)

		               ELSA
		I left your father working in
		the library. He sent me to the
		map section to fetch an ancient
		plan of the city. When I got back
		to his tablehe'd gonewith
		all his papersexcept for that
		scrap which I found near his chair.

	INDY extends the scrap of paper to BRODY.

		               INDY
		Roman numerals.


	EXT. VENICE PIAZZA - DAY

	ELSA leads INDY and BRODY into the large piazza. People walk about and sit at
	tables in front of a large building.

		               ELSA
		Here is the library.

	They have arrived at the front steps of the library.

		               INDY
		That doesn't look much like a
		library.

		               BRODY
		It looks like a converted church.

	ELSA leads the way inside.


	INT. THE LIBRARY - DAY

	INDY, BRODY and ELSA enter, their heels CLICKING across the marble floor.

	We notice, along with INDY and BRODY, that the library contains many stained-
	glass windows.

		               ELSA
		In this case it's the literal
		truth. We're on holy ground.
		These columns over here...

	She indicates FOUR HUGE MARBLE COLUMNS that go from floor to ceiling.

		               ELSA
		... were brought back as spoils
		of war after the sacking of
		Byzantium during the Crusades.


CONTINUED:

	INDY glances at the Columns, then notices a Stained-Glass Window that depicts a
	Knight of the Crusades. Indy lingers for a moment in front of the window.

		               ELSA
		Now please excuse me. The library's
		closing in a few moments. I'll
		arrange for us to stay a little
		longer.

	The minute ELSA is out of earshot.

		               INDY
		MarcusI've seen this window
		before.

			BRODY
		Where?

	INDY whips out the Grail Diary and opens it to the sketch he noticed in the
	airplane.

		               INDY
		Right here. In Dad's Diary.
		You see?

	BRODY glances at the Diary, then at the windownoticing that the Roman
	numerals in question have been worked into the window's design.

	                                     BRODY
		Look, Indy. The Roman numerals!

		               INDY
		Dad was onto something here!

		               BRODY
		Well, now we know the source of
		the numbers, but we still don't
		know what they mean.

	INDY and BRODY now see ELSA approaching. Indy quickly tucks the Diary back
	into his pocket.

		               INDY
		      (explaining to Brody)
		My dad sent me this Diary for a
		reason. Until we find out why,
		I suggest we keep it to ourselves.

		               ELSA
		Find something?

	INDY doesn't reply. He's looking in five directions at once. His eyes moving
	across the walls and ceilingscharged with the thrill of discovery.


CONTINUED: (2)

		               BRODY
		        (to ELSA)
		Uh, yes. Three, seven and tent
		That window seems to be the source
		of the Roman numerals.

		               ELSA
		My God, I must be blind

		               INDY
		Dad wasn't looking for a book
		about the Knight's Tomb... he was
		looking for the Tomb itself

	ELSA wears a blank expression.

		               INDY
		Don't you get it? The Tomb is
		somewhere in the library! You
		said yourself it used to be a
		church! Look.

	INDY's eyes travel up one of the four huge marble columns.

			INDY
		Three.

INDY looks again to the stained-glass window. He points.

 		              INDY
		Three!

	INDY has discovered that each Column is numbered with a Roman Numeral. Indy
	hurries away toward Column VII. All BRODY and ELSA can do now is try to keep
	up with him.

		              INDY
		Seven.

	He points again to the stained-glass window.

			INDY
		Seven... Ten.

	He looks down to the scrap of paper in his hands.

		               INDY
		And ten. Now where's the ten?
		Look around for the ten.

	INDY walks past aisles of book-lined shelves. He stops, turns, then looks down.


CONTINUED: (3)

			INDY
		Three, seven and ten.
	
	He climbs a spiral staircase leading up to a LOFT and looks down at BRODY and
	ELSA. The floor beneath their feet is an elaborate tile design containing a huge
	"X"visible only from this higher angle.

			INDY
		Ten.
		      (wryly; to himself)
		"X" marks the spot.

	INDY rushes down the staircase and goes to the CENTER TILE where the two
	sides of the X intersect. He blows dust away from the tile and tries to pry it up,
	but cannot.

	INDY rushes past BRODY to a cordon held in place by a brass stand underneath
	the stained-glass window.

	INDY raises the brass stand and timing his actions, hits the tile precisely as the
	Librarian stamps a book. The Librarian regards the stamper curiously.
	
	INDY continues to pound at the tile as the Librarian resumes his stamping, still
	puzzled by the SOUND ECHOING through the library.

	Finally INDY breaks the tile. As he bends to remove the pieces of broken tile, a
	TWO-FOOT SQUARE HOLE IS REVEALED.

	Cold air and a wet, rancid smell escape from the hole.

			INDY
		Bingo.

			ELSA
		You don't disappoint, Doctor Jones.
		You're a great deal like your
		father.

			INDY
		Except he's lost, and I'm not.

			ELSA
		Lower me down.

	INDY is impressed with Elsa's spirit, and cooperates agreeablyholding her by
	the hands and lowering her into the hole. When her feet finally touch ground
	below, Indy releases his grip on her and slips the Grail Diary to BRODY.
	
			INDY
		Look after this for me, will you?

	Then INDY disappears into the hole.

	INT. CATACOMBS BELOW LIBRARY - DAY

	INDY jumps down a steep step. He reaches back to help ELSA.

			INDY
		Come on.

	INDY and ELSA glance around. This is really a horrid place. Dark and dank.
	foul smelling. Elsa turns. She removes a cigarette lighter with a unique ivory
	four-leaf clover design.

	INDY and ELSA inspect markings carved onto the walls.

		               ELSA
		Pagan symbols. Fourth or Fifth
		Century.

		               INDY
		Right. Six hundred years before
		the Crusades.

		               ELSA
		The Christians would have dug
		their own passages and burial
		chambers centuries later.

	INDY takes the lighter from her and lights their way down a dark passageway.

		               INDY
		That's right. If there's a
		Knight of the First Crusade
		entombed down here, that's where
		we'll find him.


	INT. LIBRARY - DAY

	THREE MEN carrying guns make their way down the spiral staircase toward an
	unsuspecting BRODY. One of the Men, KAZIM, raises his gun and brings it down
	hard on Brody's head.

		               BRODY
		Ohhhh. . .

	KAZIM gestures with his gun toward the now-unconscious BRODY. The other two
	men take Brody's hands and drag him into one of the book-lined aisles.

	INT. ANOTHER PART OF THE CATACOMBS - DAY

	DECOMPOSING CORPSES rest in niches carved into the stone walls. Grotesque
	skeletal remains with rotting linen stretched across blackened bones.

	INDY holds the lighter up as he and ELSA inspect symbols carved into the walls.


CONTINUED:

	ELSA spots a symbol cut into the wall that she doesn't recognize. As she blows
	away some cobwebs:

		               ELSA
		What's this one?

	INDY only has to give it a quick glance to know.

		               INDY
		The Ark of the Covenant.

			ELSA
		Are you sure?

			INDY
		      (deadpan)
		Pretty sure.

	INDY holds the lighter up and he and ELSA enter another dark passageway.

	ANOTHER PART OF THE CATACOMBS

	INDY steps to the wall and runs his hand over the stone. He scrapes the cobwebs
	away to reveal the ROMAN NUMERAL "X."

			INDY
		Watch out.

	ELSA now holds the lighter as INDY rams his shoulder into the wall. The wall
	collapses on impact and Indy falls through into another room.


	ANOTHER ROOM - THE CATACOMBS

	as INDY falls through the hole in the wall onto rocks surrounded by bubbling,
	green, slimy liquid. More skeletons surround him, resting in their carved niches.
	ELSA holds the lighter as she peers in at him through the hole in the wall.

		               INDY
		Petroleum. I could sink a well
		down here and retire.

	INDY reaches up and tears a piece of cloth from one of the skeletons, which
	breaks apart and falls into the oil-slick water.

	INDY uses the scrap of cloth and a bone to fashion a crude torch, which he then
	dips into the oily water.

		               INDY
		Give me the lighter.

	ANOTHER PART OF THE CATACOMBS

	Using the cloth-wrapped bone torch to guide their way, INDY and ELSA come
	upon a NARROW PASSAGEWAY. The water is knee-deep and TEEMING WITH
	RATS. Thousands of them Crawling on one another's backs. SQUEALING.
	Squirming. Thrashing in the water.

			INDY
		Oh, rats...

	ELSA gasps as the rats scamper between her legs.

	INDY moves forward through the rat-infested water as ELSA follows, still gasping
	in horror. Suddenly he slips into a hole. Recovering his balance, he reaches out
	to Elsa.

		              INDY
		Come onl

	She gasps once again, terrified. INDY lifts her and carries ELSA as he moves
	forward.


	THE CATACOMBS - THE HOLE IN THE WALL

	KAZIM and his men step to the opening Indy made earlier and shine their
	flashlights through to the rat-infested water.

	ANOTHER PART OF THE CATACOMBS

	More rat-infested water as ELSA, now walking again, follows INDY through
	another passageway lined with skulls and bones.

	INDY reaches for a wall to steady himself and inadvertently grabs a skeleton. A
	bone comes loose in his hand as rats scurry about and leap at him from all
	directions.

	He takes a moment to compose himself, then steps across the water to ELSA's
	side. He steps into the water, then reaches up to help Elsa do the same.

			INDY
		Come here.

	LARGE BURIAL CHAMBER

	The chamber is flooded with black, briny water.
			
			INDY
		Look. . .

	In the center of the chamber, jutting up above the water, is what amounts to an
	"island altar" on which SEVERAL ANCIENT COFFINS rest. They move toward the
	altar.


CONTINUED:

	INDY and ELSA begin to inspect the ornately carved COFFINS like the scholars of
	antiquity that they are. These are big oak caskets held together by straps of
	etched brass.

		             INDY
		It must be one of these...

		             ELSA
		Look at the artistry of these
		carvings and the scrollwork.

	One coffin is elevated above the others.

		             ELSA
		It's this one.

	Together they begin to push on the lidSTRAINING and GROANING until it
	slides away and BANGS against the stone platform.


	INSIDE THE COFFIN

	lie the DECOMPOSED REMAINS of a KNIGHT IN ARMOR. INDY and ELSA look
	in...Elsa gasps.

		               INDY
		This is itl we found it! Look
		the engraving on the Shield. It's
		the same as on the Grail Tablets
		The Shield is the Second Marker!

	INDY unfolds a piece of paper and holds it over the shield.

			ELSA
		What's that?

		               INDY
		It's a rubbing Dad made of the
		Grail Tablet.

	The missing portion of the rubbing is completed by the shield.

		               ELSA
		Just like your fathergiddy
		as a schoolboy.

	INDY laughs.

		               ELSA
		Wouldn't it be wonderful if he
		were here now to see this?

		               INDY
		       (chuckles)
		He never would have made it past
		the rats!  He hates rats!  He's
		scared to death of them!

	CLOSE - A HAND

	as it lights a match.

	PULL BACK TO REVEAL KAZIM dropping the lighted match into the oil-slick
	water.


	INDY AND ELSA

	ELSA holds the torch. INDY looks around. Listens. Something is wrong. And
	then he sees the GLOW OF FIRELIGHT dancing across the Catacomb walls.

	This is followed by THOUSANDS OF RATS FLEEING from around the corner of the
	Narrow Passageway, STAMPEDING toward ELSA and INDYSHRIEKING and
	SQUEALING as they approach.

	The rats literally wash over themlike a rodent tidal wavein their efforts to
	escape a:

	HUGE ORANGE BALL OF FIRE

	ROARING around the corner hurtling towards themfeeding on the oil slick;
	consuming the oxygen.

	ELSA SCREAMS.

	                                     INDY
		Get back! Back against the wall.

	INDY braces his back against the altar and TOPPLES THE COFFIN with his feet.
	It CRASHES against the stone platform and SPLASHES into the water.

	                                     INDY
		Quick! Under it!

	They jump into the water beside the bobbing, overturned coffin.

	                                     INDY
		Air pocket!

	ELSA hesitates. INDY literally DUNKS her and pushes her underneath.


	UNDER THE COFFIN

	ELSA surfaces into the air pocket created by the coffin, SPUTTERING and
	SPITTING.

	Now INDY pops up into the air pocket. He looks at ELSAthey are both soaking
	wet.

		           	INDY
		Don't wander off.


CONTINUED:

			ELSA
		What?

	INDY disappears under the water and swims out from under the coffin.

			ELSA
		What?

	UNDER THE WATER

	INDY swims, looking for an escape route.

	UNDER THE COFFIN

	The rats are beginning to force their way inside, swimming through the water
	and climbing on ELSA, who squirms and screams in terror.

	INDY pops back up through the water.

			INDY
		I think I've found a way out.
		Deep breath.

	ELSA groans. They take a deep breath and both dive under the water.


	EXT. VENICE PIAZZA - OUTDOOR CAFE - DAY

	The perfect picture postcardSt. Mark's Square and the Grand Canal beyond.
	Cafe customers are startled to see INDY and ELSA climb out of the sewer, wet
	and smelly. Indy looks around at the postcard-perfect setting and smiles.

                  			INDY
		           (wryly)
		Ah, Venicel

	Indy's delight, however, is short-lived since KAZIM and TWO OTHER TURKISH
	AGENTS are running towards them with drawn guns.

	He grabs ELSA by the hand and the two of them run down the dock and LEAP
	INTO A MOTORBOAT.


	INT. THE MOTORBOAT - DAY

	INDY fires up the engine and pulls away from the dock... but not before a
	Turkish Agent JUMPS in with him.

	ELSA grabs the wheel and begins to steer the boat while INDY and the Turk trade
	punches.

	EXT. THE HARBOR - DAY

	Indy's Speedboat BOUNCES across the choppy waters heading in the direction of
	the DOCKED STEAMSHIP.

	KAZIM and his men rush to TWO MORE SPEEDBOATS tied to the dock.

	They chase after INDY.

	INDY grapples with the Turkish Agent. As Indy grips his arms, we SEE a GUN in
	the Agent's hand. It FIRES.

	As INDY fights with the Turk, he becomes aware of the Speedboats behind him
	and two enormous Freighters ahead of him, joined together by two giant ropes.

	INDY, having gained the advantage, leans on top of the Turkish Agent.

			INDY
		      (to ELSA)
		Are you crazy?! You don't go
		between them!

	ELSA can barely hear INDY over the noise of the motor.

	                                      ELSA
		Go between them? Are you crazy?!

	INDY finally delivers the punch that sends the Turkish Agent flying overboard.
	Turning, Indy sees that ELSA has committed the speedboat to a course BETWEEN
	the two Freighters, now being pushed even closer together by a Tugboat.

			INDY
		I said go around!

			ELSA
		You said go between them!

			INDY
		I said don't go between them!

	It's purely academic at this point since the hulls of the the two Freighters loom
	up on either side of them like cavern walls.


	EXT. FULL SHOT - THE HARBOR - DAY

	One Enemy Speedboat chases INDY between the two Freighters. But the Speedboat
	containing KAZIM veers off and goes around.


	EXT. BETWEEN THE TWO FREIGHTERS - DAY

	It's a race for daylight as the two Freighters drift ever closer to one another.

	Indy's Speedboat just manages to squeeze through the gap. But the Enemy
	Speedboat EXPLODES as it is crushed between the two Freighters, FLYING INTO
	THE AIR and SPLASHING back down into the water.

	INDY AND ELSA

	spin their boat around in a sharp half-circle to see KAZIM'S SPEEDBOAT appear
	racing toward them. He stands in the moving boat, FIRING A MACHINE GUN at
	INDY and ELSA.


	KAZIM'S SPEEDBOAT
	
	matches Indy's move for move.

	FULL SHOT - THE HARBOR

	The two boats race across the water nearly side-by-side. A CHATTERING
	MACHINE GUN from Kazim's boat SPLINTERS the wood of Indy's boat, until
	finally the rear of the boat CATCHES ON FIRE.

	The machine gun runs out of ammunition. KAZIM puts it down and takes control
	of the wheel from one of the Turkish Agents in the boat with him.

	As Indy's boat drifts toward the GIANT, TURNING PROPELLERS at the STERN of
	ANOTHER STEAMER, Kazim's boat draws up alongside and hits them. INDY
	steps into Kazim's boat. He knocks one of the Turkish Agents to the deck, then
	turns his attention to KAZIM. The two men trade punches as the boat spins
	helplessly in the churning water.

			ELSA
		No!!

	INDY kicks KAZIM in the face, knocking him into the water, then pulls him back
	into the boat, now being SUCKED THROUGH THE CHURNING WATER toward the
	Steamer's giant propeller blades.

		               INDY
		Why are you trying to kill us?

		               KAZIM
		Because you're looking for the
		Holy Grail.

		               INDY
		My father was looking for the
		Holy Grail. Did you kill him
		too?

			KAZIM
		No.

		               INDY
		Where is he? Talkor you're
		dead. Damn it, tell me! Tell
		me!

			KAZIM
		If you don't let go, Doctor Jones,
		we'll both die.


CONTINUED:

		               INDY
		Then we'll die.

		               KAZIM
		My soul is prepared. How's yours?

	By now half the boat has been chopped up into matchwood and the blades are
	getting closer.

		               INDY
		This is your last chance.

		               KAZIM
		No, Doctor Jones. It's yours!

	The wind of the blades is on their necks. INDY grabs KAZIM just in time and
	jumps... into the motorboat, driven by ELSA, which gets alongside in the nick of
	time.

			INDY
		All right! Where's my father

		               KAZIM
		If you let me go, I will tell you
		where he is.

		               INDY
		Who are you?

		               KAZIM
		My name is Kazim.

		               INDY
		And why were you trying to kill
		me?

		               KAZIM
		The secret of the Grail has been
		safe for a thousand years. And
		for all that time the Brotherhood
		of the Cruciform Sword has been
		prepared to do anything to keep
		it safe.

	KAZIM pulls back his shirt to reveal a birthmark... or is it a tattoo? Whatever it
	is, it's a cruciform sword; a Christian cross which tapers down, like the blades of
	a broadsword.

		               KAZIM
		Let me get off at this jetty.

	The boat is close to the edge of the canal. INDY gives ELSA a nod, telling her to
	bring the boat in. KAZIM steps ashore.


CONTINUED: (2)

		               KAZIM
		Ask yourself, why do you seek
		the Cup of Christ? Is it for His
		glory, or for yours?

		               INDY
		I didn't come for the Cup of
		Christ. I came to find my father.

		               KAZIM
		In that case, God be with you in
		your quest. Your father is being
		held in the Castle of Brunwald on
		the Austrian-German border.

	KAZIM walks away.

	INT. VENICE APARTMENT - DAY

	CLOSE ON THE WATER-SOAKED PAPER IMPRESSION: The rubbing taken from
	the shield of the Grail Knight.

	BRODY is giving it careful study while he dabs the lump on the back of his head
	with an ice pack.

		               INDY
		How's the head?

			BRODY
		It's better, now I've seen this.
		It's the name of a city.
		"Alexandretta?" Hmmm...

	INDY, wearing a bathrobe, leans over to study the impression.

		               INDY
		The Knights of the First Crusade
		laid siege to the city of
		Alexandretta for over a year.
		The entire city was destroyed.

	BRODY lowers the ice pack from his head and looks at INDY.

		               INDY
		The present city of Iskenderun
		is built on its ruins. Marcus
		you remember what the Grail
		Tablet said. "Across the desert
		and through the mountain to the
		Canyon of the Crescent Moon."
		       (pause)
		But where exactly?


CONTINUED:

		               BRODY
		Your father would know. Your
		father did know. Look. He
		made a map.

	BRODY picks up the Grail Diary.

		               BRODY
		He must have pieced it together
		from clues scattered through the
		whole history of the Grail Quest.
		A map with no names.


	INSERT: A PENCIL-DRAWN MAP

	It covers two pages of the Diary. BRODY's finger moves across it.

		               BRODY
		Now, he knew there was a city
		with an oasis due east. Here.
		He knew the course turned south
		through the desert to a river, and
		the river led into the mountains.
		Here. Straight to the canyon.
		He knew everything except where
		to begin, the name of the city.

			INDY
		      (solemnly)
		Alexandretta. Now we know.

		               BRODY
		Yes. Now we know.

			INDY
		      (rising)
		Marcus, get hold of Sallah. Tell
		him to meet you in Iskenderun.

	INDY closes the Grail Diary and puts it into the pocket of his robe.

		               BRODY
		What about you?

		               INDY
		I'm going after Dad.


	INT. INDY'S BEDROOM - DAY

	INDY opens the door. His bedroom has been ransacked...the mattress on the
	floor, the drawers turned out.

	INT. HALLWAY - DAY

	INDY approaches another door (Elsa's bedroom) and knocks.

		               INDY
		Elsa?

	He goes in.


	INT. ELSA'S BEDROOM - DAY

	... and finds that Elsa's bedroom is in a similar ransacked state to his own. The
	room is empty.

	He is worried for her, knocks and calls out:

		               INDY
		Elsa?

	He steps into the room and knocks upon the bathroom door.
	
		               INDY
		Elsa?

	He opens the bathroom door, peering inside.

		               INDY
		Elsa?


	INT. ELSA'S BATHROOM - DAY
	
	Elsa is standing before a mirror, wearing a silk bathrobe. She gasps, startled, as
	INDY enters. He retreats back into her bedroom as she reaches up to turn off a
	record player sitting on a ledge above the bathtub.


	INT. ELSA'S BEDROOM - DAY

	ELSA joins INDY, waiting in the ransacked room. she looks around in shock.

	                                       ELSA
                                    	My room!

			INDY		
		Mine, too.

			ELSA
		What were they looking for?

	She looks to INDY, who pulls the Grail Diary from his pocket.

			INDY
		This.

		               ELSA
		The Grail Diary.

		               INDY
		Uh-huh.

		               ELSA
		You had it? You didn't trust
		me!

	She looks hurt and beautiful. She comes closer to him.

		               INDY
		I didn't know you.

	She's awfully hard to resist.

		               INDY
		At least I let you tag along.

		               ELSA
		Oh, yes. Give them a flower and
		they'll follow you anywhere.

		               INDY
		Knock it off. You're not mad.

			ELSA
		No?

		                INDY
		No. You like the way I do things.

		               ELSA
		It's lucky I don't do things the
		same way. You'd still be standing
		at the Venice pier.

	She stomps her foot angrily. INDY flinches. She starts to walk away but Indy
	grabs her.

		               INDY
		Look, what do you think is going
		on here? Since I've met you,
		I've nearly been incinerated,
		drowned, shot at, and chopped into
		fish bait. We're caught in the
		middle of something sinister here.
		My guess is Dad found out more
		than he was looking for. And
		until I'm sure, I'm going to
		continue to do things the way I
		think they should be done.


CONTINUED: (2)

	He pulls her to him and kisses her.

		                ELSA
		How dare you kiss me!

	Now ELSA reaches for INDY and kisses him.

		                INDY
		Leave me alone. I don't like
		fast women.

	But he embraces her, and ELSA begins to nibble at his ear.

		                ELSA
		And I hate arrogant men.

	INDY smiles slyly as they fall to the bed.


	EXT. VENICE CANAL - DAY

	A GONDOLIER SINGS as he steers his gondola carrying two passengers past
	Indy's window.


	INT. INDY'S BEDROOM - DAY

	INDY lies on top of ELSA, kissing her. He stops for a moment as he hears the
	GONDOLIER SINGING.

		                INDY
		Ahh, Venice.

	ELSA reaches up and pulls him back down to her.


	EXT. ROAD THROUGH THE AUSTRIAN MOUNTAINS - DAY

	A Mercedes-Benz glides through the sharp mountain curves. This is
	SUPERIMPOSED OVER A MAP that charts their course from Venice across Austria
	toward Salzburg.


	EXT. CASTLE IN THE AUSTRIAN MOUNTAINS - DAY

	Storm clouds darken the skies. THUNDER EXPLODES in the
	distance; lightning flashes. The Mercedes-Benz drives into the courtyard of the
	formidable stone castle.

		                INDY
		What do you know about this
		place?

		                ELSA
		I know the Brunwalds are famous
		art collectors.

	INT. MERCEDES-BENZ - DAY

	INDY reaches into the back seat and retrieves his bullwhip.

			ELSA
		What are you going to do?

			INDY
		Don't know. Think of something.

	He glances up to the beret ELSA is wearing. She reaches up and adjusts it.


	INT. CASTLE ENTRANCE HALL - DAY

	A BUTLER walks to the door and opens it to reveal INDY and ELSA standing
	outside in the rain. she now wears Indy's fedora; Indy is wearing Elsa's beret.

			BUTLER
		Yes?

	INDY, followed by ELSA, steps inside, shaking the water from his overcoat. He
	adopts a Scottish accent.

		               INDY
		And not before time! Did you
		intend to leave us standing on
		the doorstep all day? We're
		drenched!

	As INDY says this he pushes his way past the startled BUTLER, pulling a
	handkerchief from the man's pocket. ELSA follows, taking off her coat. INDY
	SNEEZES HARD.

		               INDY
		Now look! I've gone and caught
		a sniffle.

	INDY dabs at his nose with the handkerchief as ELSA looks on in amused
	amazement.

			BUTLER
		      (coldly; with
		       Austrian accent)
		Are you expected?

		               INDY
		Don't take that tone with me, my
		good man. Now buttle off and tell
		Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence
		MacDonald and his lovely assistant
		are here to view the tapestries.


				                                       (CONT'D)

CONTINUED:
			BUTLER
		Tapestries?

		               INDY
		Dear me, the man is dense. This
		is a castle, isn't it? There are
		tapestries?

		               BUTLER
		This is a castle. And we have
		many tapestries. But if you're a
		Scottish lord, then I am Mickey
		Mouse.

		               INDY
		How dare he?!

	Simultaneously knocking the BUTLER cold with one slug on the jaw. The Butler
	falls against a wall tapestry, sliding down to the floor, out cold.


	INT. CASTLE HALLWAY - DAY

	INDY and ELSA move cautiously and quietly down the wide, vaulted hallway.
	APPROACHING VOICES ARE HEARD. Indy and Elsa creep past a room full of
	NAZI SOLDIERS working around a large table with a map atop it..

	INDY reacts to the sight of them.

			INDY
		        (to ELSA; softly)
		Nazis. I hate these guys.

	INDY and ELSA continue down the hallway. Indy carries a gun in his hand and
	his whip hangs from his belt. He steps to a closed door and listens.

 		              INDY
		This one. I think he's in here.

			ELSA
		How do you know?

	INDY points out an ELECTRICAL WIRE.

		               INDY
		Because it's wired.

	He studies the situation for a moment, then decides to enter one of the other
	doors. He knocks at the doorthere is no response. He looks back at ELSA and
	enters.

INT. CASTLE ROOM - DAY

	The room is dark and empty. INDY throws open the window shutters and looks
	out. RAIN comes down in sheets. There is a wide ledge beneath each window
	but below that is a SHEER DROP. Indy wants to get out onto the window ledge,
	which is several yards away.

			ELSA
		Indy? Indy?

	INDY reassures her.


		               INDY
		Don't worry... this is kid's play.
		I'll be right back.

	He leans out the window and wraps his bullwhip around some wires that protrude
	from the castle wall above the next window.

	He gives the whip a forceful tug to make certain it will hold his weight.


	EXT. THE CASTLE - DAY

	INDY SWINGS from the window to the stone gargoyle.

	CLOSE ON THE WINDOW LEDGE

	A PAIR OF WOODEN SHUTTERS seals the window.

	INDY takes hold of the bullwhip with both hands, pushes off with his feet...
	swings toward the shuttered window with his feet extended... CRASHING
	THROUGH THE WOODEN SHUTTERS as a CLAP OF THUNDER disguises the noise.


	INT. THE ROOM - DAY

	INDY CRASHES THROUGH SHUTTERS AND GLASS into the room. The broken
	shutters hang by their hinges. Rain and cold air whip through the open window.

	No sooner does Indy get to his feet, than a VASE COMES CRASHING DOWN ON
	THE BACK OF HIS HEAD.

	Stunned, INDY sinks to one knee... and Indy's father, PROFESSOR HENRY JONES,
	steps out of the shadows.

			HENRY
		Junior?

	INDY gets to his feet.

			INDY
		      (a reflex)
		Yes, sirl

CONTINUED:

	This reply is a kneejerk reaction on Indy's part. Now they look at each other.

			HENRY
		It is you Junior!

			INDY
		     (an old familiar
		      irritation)
		Don't call me that, please.

			HENRY
		     (amazed)
		But what are you doing here?

			INDY
		I came to get you! What do you
		think? 

	NAZI VOICES ARE HEARD approaching. INDY and HENRY press themselves
	against the wall, Henry still holding the broken vase in his hand.

	INDY steps to the window and looks down. HENRY moves to a lamp, holding the
	vase under the light for a closer look.

			HENRY
		       (sotto, mumbled)
		Late Fourteenth Century, Ming
		Dynasty.

	HENRY is all about the broken vase which he still holds in his hand. Father and
	son get onto crossed lines for a couple of moments.

			HENRY
		Oh, it breaks the heart.

		                 INDY
		    (quietly to himself)
		And the head.
		    (to HENRY, aggrievedly)
		You hit me, Dad!

			HENRY
		     (referring to the
		      vase)
		I'll never forgive myself

			INDY
		       (surprised,
		        misunderstanding)
		Don't worryI'm fine.

			HENRY
		Thank God!


CONTINUED: (2)

	HENRY has clearly been concentrating entirely on the vase... he is examining the
	broken end carefully.

		               HENRY
		... it's fake. See, you can tell
		by the cross section.

	HENRY throws the vase against the wall where it SHATTERS.

		               INDY
		No! Dad, get your stuff. We've
		got to get out of here.

		               HENRY
		Well, I am sorry about your head,
		though. But I thought you were
		one of them.

		               INDY
		Dad, they come in through the
		doors.

			HENRY
		      (laughs)
		Good point.

	INDY steps to the door and stands, listening.

			HENRY
		But better safe than sorry.

	HENRY slides his umbrella through the straps of his bag.

		               HENRY
		Humpfso I was wrong this time.
		But by God, I wasn't wrong when I
		mailed you my Diary. You obviously
		got it.

		               INDY
		I got it and I used it. We found
		the entrance to the catacombs.

			HENRY
		     (excited)
		Through the library?

		               INDY
		Right.

		               HENRY
		I knew it. And the tomb of Sir
		Richard?


CONTINUED: (3)

	INDY nods.

		               INDY
		Found it.

			HENRY
		     (breathless)
		He was actually there? You saw
		him?


		               INDY
		Well, what was left of him.

			HENRY
		      (trembling with
		       anticipation)
		And his shield... the inscription
		on Sir Richard's shield...?

		               INDY
		Alexandretta.
		    (beat)

	It's a great moment in HENRY's life. He turns aside, lost to himself for a
	moment, then turns to INDY with joy.

		               HENRY
		Alexandretta... of course... on
		the pilgrim trail from the Eastern
		Empire. Oh, Junior...

	INDY winces, and would interrupt but suddenly it's not the moment.

			HENRY
		... you did it.


		               INDY
		No, Dad. You did. Forty years.

		               HENRY
		If only I could have been with
		you.

			INDY
		There were rats, Dad.

			HENRY
		Rats?

			INDY
		Yeah. big ones. What do the
		Nazis want with you Dad?

			HENRY
		They want my diary.


CONTINUED: (4)

			INDY
		     (interested)
		Yeah?

	INDY's interest is a moment which becomes important later but for now it passes.

		               HENRY
		I knew I had to get that book as
		far away from me as I possibly
		could.

	INDY's hand moves unconsciously to his pocket. His eyes turn inward.

	                                      INDY
		      (thoughtfully)
		Yeah. . .

	Then... BAMI The door is kicked open and three NAZIS enter. One is an S.S.
	OFFICER. The other two are SOLDIERS with machine guns. HENRY and INDY
	raise their hands.

			S.S. OFFICER
		Doctor Jones!!

			HENRY & INDY
		Yes!!


		               S.S. OFFICER
		I will take the book now.

			INDY/HENRY
		      (simultaneously)
		What book?

			S.S. OFFICER
		     (to INDY)
		You have the Diary in your pocket.

	HENRY laughs genuinely, believing himself to be laughing at the expense of the
	S.S. OFFICER.

		               HENRY
		You doltl Do you think that my
		son would be that stupid that
		he would bring my Diary all the
		way back here?

	At which point an awful thought strikes HENRY.

		               HENRY
		You didn't, did you?
		    (a beat)
		You didn't bring it, did you?


CONTINUED: (5)

			INDY
		Well, uh...

			HENRY
		You did!!


			INDY
		Look, can we discuss this later?

			HENRY
		I should have mailed it to the
		Marx Brothers.

			INDY
		       (overlapping)
		Will you take it easy....!

			HENRY
		Take it easy?! Why do you think
		I sent it home in the first place?
		        (points towards
		        the NAZIS)
		So it wouldn't fall into their
		hands!!

			INDY
		I came here to save you.

			HENRY
		Oh yeah? And who's gonna come to
		save you, Junior??

	INDY's eyes blazes His nostrils flares He's so pissed off, he literally RIPS A
	MACHINE GUN from the hands of one of the startled soldiers... and for a moment
	we think he's going to use it on his dad.

			INDY
		I told you--

	He turns and sprays the room with machine gun fire, cutting all three NAZIS to
	ribbons and blowing them backwards across the room.

			INDY
		--don't call me Junior!

	HENRY looks shocked and horrified.

			HENRY
		Look what you did!!

	Indy grabs him and pushes him ahead.

			HENRY
		     (aghast)
		I can't believe what you just....

	INT. CASTLE HALLWAY - DAY

	INDY leads HENRY down the hallway as he searches for Elsa.

			INDY
		Elsa? Elsa?

	He opens a door and enters:

	INT. FIRST CASTLE ROOM - DAY


	INDY and HENRY rush back into the room where ELSA had been left, only to
	find: A Nazi COLONEL HOLDING ELSA HOSTAGE.

	His name is VOGEL: a vicious-looking, lantern jawed brute. One arm is wrapped
	around Elsa's waist, the other hand presses the muzzle of a LUGER behind her
	ear.

		               VOGEL
		That's far enough Put down the
		gun, Doctor Jones. Put down the
		gun or the Fraulein dies.

		               HENRY
		But she's one of them!

			ELSA
		Indy, please!

			HENRY
		She's a Nazi!

			INDY
		What?!

	INDY  is thrown. He doesn't know what to do. He looks at ELSA, then back to his
	father. Everyone is yelling at once:

			HENRY
		Trust me!


		               ELSA
		Indy, no!

		               VOGEL
		I will kill her!

		               HENRY
		Oh yeah? Go ahead!

		               INDY
		No! Don't Shoot!


CONTINUED:

			HENRY
		        (to Indy)
		Don't worry. He won't.

			ELSA
		Indy, please! Do what he says!

			HENRY
		And don't listen to her!

			VOGEL
		Enough! She diesl

	VOGEL jams the barrel of the luger painfully into ELSA's neck. Elsa SCREAMS.

			INDY
		Wait!  Waitl

	And then Indy gives in. He drops the machine gun to the table and it slides
	across, SHATTERING GLASS. HENRY GROANS audibly.

	VOGEL releases his grip on ELSA and shoves her toward INDY. She is propelled
	directly into his arms. He holds her tightly. She buries her face in his chest.

	                                     ELSA
		I'm sorry.

	INDY comforts her.

	                                     INDY
		No, don't be.

	Her hand slips into his coat pocket and removes the Grail Diary.

	                                     ELSA
		But you should have listened to
		your father.

	She steps back next to VOGEL. INDY is stunned. HENRY gives him his most
	withering look of reprimand.


	INT. BARONIAL ROOM - DAY

	A large baronial room decorated with ancient tapestries and suits of armor.
	Firelightfrom the giant fireplacedances across the ceiling and walls.

	INDY and HENRY are ushered in, hands tied behind back, accompanied by VOGEL
	and ELSA and TWO NAZI GUARDS.

	ELSA crosses the room toward a high-backed chair facing the fireplace. INDY and
	HENRY do not have the advantage of seeing who is sitting in that chair. They
	only see a HAND REACH OUT AND TAKE THE BOOK.


CONTINUED:

			INDY
		        (quietly to HENRY)
		She ransacked her own room and I
		fell for it. How did you know
		she was a Nazi?

		               HENRY
		Umh?

		               INDY
		How did you she was a Nazi?

		               HENRY
		She talks in her sleep.

	INDY nods, and then the statement catches up with him. He looks at HENRY
	with surprise.

		               HENRY
		I didn't trust her. Why did
		you?

		               MAN IN CHAIR
		Because he didn't take my advice.

	The MAN IN THE CHAIR gets to his feet and turns, revealing himself to be...
	WALTER DONOVAN. INDY and HENRY react with stunned expressions.

		               INDY
		Donovan
	
		               DONOVAN
		Didn't I warn you not to trust
		anybody, Doctor Jones?

	DONOVAN smiles benignly and flips through the Grail Diary.

		               HENRY
		I misjudged you WalterI knew
		you'd sell your mother for an
		Etruscan vase.
		But I didn't know you'd sell your
		country and your soul to the slime
		of humanity.

		               DONOVAN
		        (suddenly erupting)
		Doctor Schneider There're pages
		torn out of thisl

	ELSA rushes to DONOVAN's side. she takes the Grail Diary from him. Elsa takes
	a look for herselfthen glances up at Indy.


CONTINUED: (2)

		               ELSA
		This book contained a mapa
		map with no namesprecise
		directions from the unknown city
		to the secret Canyon of the
		Crescent Moon.

			INDY
		So it did.


		               DONOVAN
		Where are these missing pages?
		This maps we must have these
		pages backs

	HENRY gives INDY a look of surprise. Indy smirks.

			ELSA
		        (to Donovan)
		You're wasting your breath. He
		won't tell us. And he doesn't
		have to... it's perfectly obvious
		where the pages are...
		        (looking at Indy)
		... he's given them to Marcus
		Brody.

	HENRY now wears a pained expression.

			HENRY
		        (to Indy)
		Marcus?! You didn't drag poor
		Marcus along, did you? He's not
		up to the challenge.

		               DONOVAN
		He sticks out like a sore thumb.
		We'll find him.

		               INDY
		The hell you will. He's got a
		two-day head-start on you, which
		is more than he needs.
		        (beat)
		Brody's got friends in every town
		and village from here to the Sudan.
		He speaks a dozen languages, knows
		every local custom. He'll blend
		in. Disappear. You'll never see
		him again. With any luck, he's
		got the Grail already.

	HENRY looks amazed and impressed.

	EXT. TRAIN STATION - CITY OF ISKENDERUN - DAY

	BRODY disembarks from the train along with the other PASSENGERS, a cross-
	section of ARABS and TUSKS.

		               BRODY
		Does anyone here speak English?
		Or even ancient Greek?

	A Man in the crowd holds out a cup of water to BRODY.

		               BRODY
		No water, no thank you. No, fish
		make love in it.

	BRODY continues through the crowd past various STREET VENDORS. A Woman
	holds a chicken out to him.

		               BRODY
		Thank you so much. No, I don't
		like that. No, I really don't
		want... No, no, thank you very
		much. No, thank you, madam.
		I'm a vegetarian.


	The Woman walks away, leaving BRODY alone in the crowd.

		               BRODY
		Does anyone understand a word I'm
		saying here?

	SALLAH shoulders his way through the mob toward BRODY.

			SALLAH
		Mister Brodyl

	They meet and hug, then begin to walk.

			BRODY
		Oh, Sallahl What a relief!

			SALLAH
		     (laughs)
		Marcus Brody, sir. And where is
		Indy?

			BRODY
		     (overlapping)
		Oh, he's in Austria. A slight
		detour.

		               SALLAH
		You are on your own?

	A Woman runs in and tugs on BRODY's coat. He waves her away.


CONTINUED:

		               BRODY
		Yes, but don't panic. Everything's
		under control. Have you. . .have
		you arranged our supplies?

		               SALLAH
		Oh, yes, of course. But where
		are we going?

		               BRODY
		Oh, this map will show you. It
		was drawn by, uh...

	BRODY searches in his coat pocket for the map as a SINISTER MAN approaches.

			SINISTER MAN
		Mister Brody?

	BRODY puts the map back in his pocket. The SINISTER MAN clicks his heels and
	bows quickly.

		               SINISTER MAN
		Welcome to Iskenderun. The
		Director of the Museum of
		Antiquities has sent a car for
		you.

	BRODY takes off his hat.

		               BRODY
		Oh, what?... your servant, sir.

			SALLAH
		And I am his.


			SINISTER MAN
		Follow me, please.

	The man turns and joins a SECOND MAN. BRODY and SALLAH follow them.

		               BRODY
		My reputation precedes me.

			SALLAH
		There is no museum in Iskenderun.

	The SECOND MAN overhears SALLAH. He and his companion turn quickly.

			SECOND MAN
		Papers please.

		               SALLAH
		Papers?
		     (laughs)
		Of course.


CONTINUED: (2)

	SALLAH puts Brody's luggage down and glances at BRODY.

			SALLAH
		Run.


	BRODY does not run. SALLAH pats his clothing, searching for his papers.

			BRODY
		Yes.

			SALLAH
		Papers, sir. Got it here.

	SALLAH laughs and pulls out a newspaper.

			SALLAH
		Just finished reading it myself.
		         (laughs; then, to
		          Brody)
		Run!

	BRODY looks confused. SALLAH shows the newspaper to the SECOND MAN.

			BRODY
		Yes.


		              SALLAH
		Egyptian Mail. Morning edition.
		     (to Brody)
		Run!

		              BRODY
		Did you say...? Uh, uh...

	SALLAH puts the newspaper in front of the SECOND MAN's face, then punches
	him through the newspaper.

			SALLAH
		Run!


	The SECOND MAN falls, knocking over a vendor's stand. SALLAH and BRODY
	begin to run. SALLAH knocks the FIRST MAN into another vendor's stand. The
	STAND COLLAPSES on impact.

	SALLAH grabs BRODY and pulls him through the crowded streets.

			SALLAH
		        (to Brody; pointing)
		Okay, okay, quick, quick, quickl
		Hide in that doorl Hide in that
		door!

	SALLAH points to a DARKENED DOORWAY, hung with a curtain, at the top of a
	ramp. BRODY runs up the ramp, throws back the curtain and disappears into
	the darkness.


CONTINUED: (3)

	ThenMETAL DOORS ARE SLAMMED behind Brody and we realize that he has
	actually run into the back of a Nazi TROOP TRUCK.

	SALLAH runs after the Truck until he reaches a wall, then leans against the wall
	dejectedly as the Truck drives away with BRODY inside.


	INT. CASTLE ROOM - DAY

	The room is dark. Ancient, floor-length drapes cover the windows. A HUGE
	FIREPLACE that's nearly large enough for a man to stand upright in dominates
	one wall.

	The NAZI GUARDS have tied INDY and HENRY back-to-back in a pair of chairs.
	ELSA and DONOVAN stand over them. VOGEL enters.

			HENRY
		Intolerable.


		               VOGEL
		Doctor Schneider. Message from
		Berlin. You must return immediately:
		a rally at the Institute of Aryan
		Culture.

		               ELSA
		So?

		               VOGEL
		Your presence on the platform is
		requested... at the highest level.

		               ELSA
		Thank you, Herr Oberst.
		      (to DONOVAN)
		I will meet you at Iskenderun.

		               DONOVAN
		Take this Diary to the Reich
		Museum in Berlin. It will show
		them our progress, ahead of
		schedule. Without a map, I'm
		afraid it's no better than a
		souvenir.

	He hands her the Grail Diary.

			VOGEL
		         (to DONOVAN, meaning
		          Indy and Henry)
		Let me kill them now.


CONTINUED:

		               ELSA
		No. If we fail to recover the
		pages from Brody, we'll need them
		alive.

			DONOVAN
		    (to VOGEL, with a
		     helpless shrug)
		Always do what the doctor orders.

	DONOVAN leads VOGEL out. The NAZI GUARDS follow. Once they are gone,
	ELSA turns to INDY.

		               ELSA
		Don't look at me like thatwe
		both wanted the Grail, I would
		have done anything to get it.
		You would have done the same.

	INDY shakes his head "no."

		               INDY
		I'm sorry you think so.

	She runs her hand down the side of his face. INDY pulls away.

	INDY and HENRY are still tied back-to-back of course. ELSA bends to speak
	quietly into INDY's ear... which is near enough to Henry's ear.

			ELSA
		      (whispers)
		I can't forget... how wonderful
		it was.

		               HENRY
		Thank you. It was rather wonderful.

	She smiles and kisses INDY passionately. HENRY glances back and looks rather
	disappointed.

	VOGEL appears to remind ELSA of her appointment.

		               VOGEL
		Doctor Schneider! Your car is
		waiting.

			ELSA
		     (to INDY, after
		      finishing the kiss)
		That's how Austrians say goodbye.

	ELSA exits. VOGEL stays behind for another moment.


CONTINUED: (2)

		               VOGEL
		And this is how we say goodbye in
		Germany, Doctor Jones.

	VOGEL punches INDY in the jaw. A hard and vicious jab that snaps Indy's head
	around.

			HENRY
		Ohh. . .

	VOGEL exits. INDY shakes his head clear.

			INDY
		      (to himself)
		Ooooh... I like the Austrian way
		better.

			HENRY
		So did I.

		               INDY
		Let's try and get these ropes
		loose. We've got to get to Marcus
		before the Nazis do!

			HENRY
		     (confused)
		You said he had two days' start.
		That he would blend in. Disappear!

		               INDY
		Are you kidding?I made that
		up! You know Marcushe got
		lost once in his own museum!

	Indy and Henry are pulling at the ropes with great urgency.

		               INDY
		Can you try and reach into my
		left jacket pocket?

	HENRY is able to wiggle his hand towards Indy's coat pocket. INDY squirms his
	body around towards Henry's hand.

		               HENRY
		What am I looking for?
	
		               INDY
		My lucky charm.

		               HENRY
		Feels like a cigarette lighter.


CONTINUED: (3)

			INDY
		Try and burn through the ropes.

	HENRY's fingers open the lighter and ignite the flame.

			HENRY
		Very good.

	HENRY yelps as the cigarette lighter burns his hand. He drops the lighter to the
	floor. Henry kicks at the lighter, trying to reach it, but cannot. The rug starts to
	burn. INDY doesn't know it yet.

		               HENRY
		I ought to tell you something.

		               INDY
		Don't get sentimental now Dad
		save it 'til we get out of here.

		               HENRY
		The floor's on fire! See?!

		               INDY
		        (turns and sees)
		What???

		               HENRY
		And the chair.

		               INDY
		All right, movel Move!  Rock
		your Chair.  Do what I do.

	They begin to rock their chair legs, inching their way off the burning carpet.


	EXT. CASTLE - DAY

	as ELSA is driven away. VOGEL and DONOVAN remain behind, flanked by NAZI
	SOLDIERS .

	Another car pulls up and VOGEL holds the door open for DONOVAN who gets into
	the rear seat. A LIEUTENANT approaches with a written message for Donovan.

			LIEUTENANT
		Etwas wichtig, mein Herr.

	DONOVAN puts on his glasses to read the message.

		               DONOVAN
		Well, we have Marcus Brody. But
		more important, we have the map.

	A RADIO OPERATOR steps forward with yet another written message for
	DONOVAN.


CONTINUED:


		               RADIO OPERATOR
		Aus Berlin, mein Herr.

		               DONOVAN
		        (reading)
		"By the personal command of the
		Fuhrer. Secrecy essential to
		success. Eliminate the American
		conspirators."
		        (to VOGEL)
		Germany has declared war on the
		Jones boys.
		        (to DRIVER)
		Los fahren.

	The car drives off.

	INT. CASTLE ROOM - DAY

	INDY and HENRY are still in their chairs, tied back-to-back. Indy tries to
	communicate with Henry, but each time he calls him, the men turn their heads in
	opposite directions.

		               INDY
		Dad!

		               HENRY
		What?

		               INDY
		Dad!

		               HENRY
		What?

		               INDY
		Dad!

	Finally they turn their heads in the same direction.

			HENRY
		What?

			INDY
		Head for the fireplace!

			HENRY
		Oh.


	BANGING, ROCKING and HOPPING their chairs, they work their way INTO THE
	FIREPLACEthe only safe place from the now ROARING FIRE.

CONTINUED:

			INDY
		I think I can get these ropes
		off.

	Indy struggles to free his hands. His foot kicks out and accidentally hits a metal
	grill that operates a Secret Door.

			INDY
		Whoopsl

	The fireplace floor rotates like a Lazy Susan and Indy and his father find
	themselves in the:


	INT. RADIO ROOM - DAY

	where a NAZI RADIOMAN wearing headphones sits at an elaborate panel of dials,
	switches and meters, and a WOMAN stands over a map plotting coordinates.
	Their backs are turned to INDY and HENRY.

	The floor begins to rotate again, and INDY and HENRY find themselves back in:


	INT. CASTLE ROOM - DAY

	inside the fireplace, still tied back-to-back.

			HENRY
		Our situation has not improved.

	INDY glances over his shoulder at HENRY.

			INDY
		Listen Dad... I'm almost free.

	INDY's foot hits the grill again... and the fireplace rotates to:


	INT. RADIO ROOM - DAY

	FOUR NAZI RADIOMEN and the WOMAN are still hard at work with controls and
	coordinates. Suddenly the Woman looks up and spots HENRY and INDY. She
	screams.

			WOMAN
		Alarm!

	Now the RADIOMEN turn to see HENRY and INDY.

			WOMAN
		Schnel!!

	TWO NAZIS draw their revolvers and FIRE SEVERAL SHOTS at INDY and HENRY

	INT. CASTLE ROOM - DAWN

	INDY and HENRY rotate into the room which is now an INFERNO. The carpet,
	drapes and furniture are all ablaze.

		               HENRY
		This is intolerable!

			INDY
		I'm out, Dad!


	INDY finally breaks free. And he immediately begins to untie his father.

			HENRY
		Well done, boy!

	INT. RADIO ROOM - DAY

	All FOUR RADIOMEN now have their guns drawn. They activate the lever and
	begin to rotate through the Secret Door.


	INT. CASTLE ROOM - DAY

	The RADIOMEN appear in the fireplace on the other sidebut there is NO SIGN
	OF INDY AND HENRY.

	The RADIOMEN move cautiously toward the flame, shielding their faces with one
	hand, holding their guns with the other. Is it possible that INDY and HENRY
	escaped through these flames?

	Not a chance.

	They've hidden themselves UP THE CHIMNEY. And now they DROP DOWN,
	BEHIND the RADIOMEN.

	One of the RADIOMEN grabs INDY by the neck. As they struggle they fall against
	the rotating wall and disappear into the next room, leaving a frightened HENRY
	behind.

	HENRY presses against the wall, which rotates again. As he disappears into the
	next room, a DEAD NAZI RADIOMAN swivels into the room. The other NAZIS
	rush forward to him.

	INT. RADIO ROOM - DAY

	INDY picks up a BUST OF HITLER and uses it to jam the rotating wall in place,
	sealing the NAZIS inside the burning room.


	INT. CASTLE HALLWAY- DAY

	Vogel strides purposefully down the hallway. He BARKS an order, and TWO
	MORE NAZIS fall into step with him.

	INT. RADIO ROOM - DAY

	INDY grabs his whip, his leather sack and Henry's case from a table. He hands
	the case to HENRY and they begin to run.

			INDY
		Come on Dad.

	INT. SECRET ROOM - DAY

	INDY and HENRY step into an empty room.

			INDY
		Dead end.

	HENRY looks horrified by what he's been forced to do as INDY searches
	frantically for an exit.

		               INDY
		There's got to be a... a secret
		door around. A passageway or
		something.

	INDY begins to run his hands over the wallsfrantic.

		               HENRY
		I find that if I just sit down
		and think...

	HENRY sits on a chair which tips back, hitting the wall behind it. The floor at
	INDY's feet suddenly begins DROPPING AWAYI

	INDY grabs a railing to keep from falling, but loses his grip and plunges through
	the opening which has formed a SPIRAL STAIRCASE. He rolls down the stairs.

			INDY
		Dad! 

			HENRY
	                   ... the solution presents itself.

	HENRY follows INDY down the staircase.


	INT. CAVERN/UNDERGROUND HARBOR - DAY

	The stairway deposits Indy and Henry into an enormous WATERY CAVERN
	beneath the mountain on which the castle was built.

	A full-scale Nazi BOAT DOCK has been built inside the cavern. We see
	MOTORBOATS, GUNBOATS, SUPPLY BOATS, etc.

		                  INDY
		Great. More boats.


CONTINUED:

	INDY boards one of the motorboats and STARTS THE MOTOR.

		               HENRY
		Would you say this has been just
		another typical day for you? Huh?

	HENRY tosses his case at INDY who catches it and angrily throws it back to his
	father.

			INDY
		        (ironically)
		Ooofl No! It's been better than
		most.

	INDY moves back to the dock and pushes the boat away. HENRY looks confused.

			INDY
		Come on, Dad. Come onl

		               HENRY
		What about the boat? We're not
		going on the boat?


	INT. SECRET ROOM - DAY

	VOGEL and the NAZI SOLDIERS enter the room and spot the spiral staircase
	leading below. They quickly descend the stairs.


	INT. CAVERN/UNDERGROUND HARBOR - DAY

	as VOGEL and the NAZI SOLDIERS rush to the dock. Vogel sees that a motorboat
	is missing. He orders the Nazi Soldiers into a boat.

		               VOGEL
		Sie alle ins Boat. Schnell!

	CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL a large box which suddenly BREAKS APART
	as INDY, now on a motorbike with HENRY in the sidecar, ROARS PAST THE
	DOCK, hitting TWO NAZI SOLDIERS who scream as they fall into the river.

	VOGEL screams after INDY and HENRY as they drive off.

	STRAIGHT CUT TO:

	EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

	INDY looks pleased as he drives the motorbike along the road, but HENRY
	appears worried.

	                                     INDY
		Ha!

	FOUR NAZI SOLDIERS ON MOTORCYCLES

	They chase down the road after INDY and HENRY.

	INDY turns the motorbike down a smaller, dusty tree-lined road. HENRY gasps
	as he is jostled about in the sidecar. One of the NAZI SOLDIERS gives chase along
	a higher road running in the same direction.


	EXT. ROAD BARRICADE - DAY

	INDY approaches the barricade from one direction as one of the NAZI SOLDIERS
	approaches from a higher road.

	A GUARD steps from the road station and calls to the vehicles as INDY and
	HENRY SMASH THROUGH THE BARRICADE.

		               GUARD
		Halt! Halt!

	THE NAZI SOLDIER rides his motorcycle through the other side of the barrier--
	IT SHATTERS.

	INDY AND HENRY

	INDY grabs at a FLAGPOLE as they roar pastit snaps off in his hand.

	The NAZI SOLDIER drives his motorcycle toward INDY and HENRY. He
	unshoulders his machine gun.

	INDY uses the broken flagpole as a lance and knocks the NAZI SOLDIER from his
	motorcycle.

	THE RIDERLESS MOTORCYCLE

	drives on toward the other NAZI SOLDIERS now approaching the guardhouse,
	COLLIDING WITH TWO OF THEM.

	The remaining NAZI SOLDIER maneuvers his motorcycle around his fallen
	comrades and continues the chase.


	INDY AND HENRY

	As the remaining NAZI SOLDIER rides alongside their motorbike he cocks his gun,
	preparing to fire.

	INDY quickly jams the remaining portion of the flagpole through the spokes of the
	Nazi's front wheel.

	The NAZI SOLDIER'S MOTORCYCLE FLIPS THREE TIMES, throwing him high into
	the air.


CONTINUED:

	INDY glances back and smiles, but the smile fades as he looks forward again to
	see a sign at a CROSSROAD. Arrows pointing in opposite directions indicate the
	way to BERLIN or VENEDIG.

	Indy starts down the road marked VENEDIG.

			HENRY
		Stop!

			INDY
		What?

			HENRY
		Stop! Stop!

	The motorbike skids to a stop.


		               HENRY
		You're going the wrong Way!  We
		have to get to Berlin!

			INDY
		     (pointing towards
		      Venedig)
		Brody's this way.

		               HENRY
		My Diary's in Berlin.

		               INDY
		You don't need the Diary, Dad.
		Marcus has the map.

		               HENRY
		There is more in the Diary than
		just the map.

		               INDY
		All right Dadtell me.

		               HENRY
		Well, he who finds the Grail must
		face the final challenge.

		               INDY
		What final challenge?

		               HENRY
		Three devices of such lethal
		cunning.

		               INDY
		Booby traps?


CONTINUED: (2)

		               HENRY
		Oh, yes. But I found the clues
		that will safely take us through,
		in the Chronicles of St. Anselm.

		               INDY
		But what are they? Can't you
		remember?

		               HENRY
		I wrote them down in my Diary so
		that I wouldn't have to remember

		               INDY
		Half the German Army's on our
		tail and you want me to go to
		Berlin? Into the lion's den?

		               HENRY
		Yes! The only thing that matters
		is the Grail.

		               INDY
		What about Marcus?

		               HENRY
		Marcus would agree with me.

		               INDY
		Two selfless martyrs. Jesus
		Christl

	HENRY slaps him across the face. INDY is rocked to his foundations, not by any
	means entirely by the blow itself.

		               HENRY
		That's for blasphemy. The quest
		for the Grail is not archaeology.
		It's a race against evil.
		If it is captured by the Nazis,
		the armies of darkness will march
		all over the face of the earth.
		Do you understand me?

		               INDY
		This is an obsession Dad. I never
		understood it. Never. Neither
		did Mom.

		               HENRY
		Oh yes, she did. Only too well.
		Unfortunately she kept her illness
		from me until all I could do was
		mourn her.

	EXT. CROSSROADS - DAY

	Arrows point in opposite directions to VENICE and BERLIN. The CAMERA MOVES
	IN on the portion of the sign reading BERLIN.


	EXT. CITY SQUARE - BERLIN - NIGHT

	A Nazi Rallya book-burning is in process.

	The mound of burning books is ten feet tall and growing by the minute as College
	Students and Nazi Brownshirts continually toss more books onto the fire.

	Flags, banners and standards displaying the swastika are waved rhythmically
	from side to side in a motion that echoes the mounting frenzy of the enormous
	crowd.

	INDY and HENRY walk toward the Square. Indy wears the uniform of a Nazi
	Soldier. He is now buttoning up the tunicwhich happens to be several sizes
	too big.

			HENRY
		My boy, we are Pilgrims in an
		unholy land.

	Then... Indy sees something that makes him stop in his tracks. WE PAN ALONG
	HIS LINE OF SIGHT to:

	THE PODIUM

	where high-ranking Officers of the Third Reich stand flanking ADOLF HITLER as
	they oversee the rally.


	ANOTHER ANGLE

	ELSA is walking away in an open area, background of torches, vehicles, Nazi
	Officers... one of whom is now none other than INDY, coming up to her before she
	knows he is there. His voice is quiet and tough, his eyes hard.

	                                      INDY
		Fraulein Doctor. Where is it?

	Still startled, her reaction makes it clear that Indy is even now a lover in her
	thoughts.

	                                      ELSA
		How did you get here?

	                                      INDY
		Where is it? I want it.

	INDY pushes ELSA against a column and begins to search her clothing for the
	Diary. He pulls the book from Elsa's pocket.


CONTINUED:

		               ELSA
		You came back for the book?
		Whv?

		               INDY
		My father didn't want it
		incinerated.

	She understands him. It's as though he slapped her.

		               ELSA
		Is that what you think of me?
		I believe in the Grail, not the
		Swastika.

			INDY
		      (vicious)
		Yet you stood up to be counted
		with the enemy of everything the
		Grail stands forwho gives a
		damn what you think?


			ELSA
		     (hard and fast)
		You do.

	Now it's as though she'd slapped him back. His hands fly to her neck.

			INDY
		All I have to do is squeeze.

			ELSA
		All I have to do is scream.

	It's a standoff emotionally. He knows he'd never do it. she knows it too. And
	the same goes for screaming.

	INDY releases her and backs away. she looks at him with a lover's pain. He
	moves over to HENRY.

			INDY
		I've got it. Let's get the hell
		out of here.

	They move off and almost run headlong into HITLER and his entire entourage
	coming down from the Podium. 50 kids push their autograph books for Hitler's
	signature.

	HITLER pauses to sign them. Hitler looks Indy's way. They make eye contact. It
	only lasts a moment but the moment is electric.

	HITLER breaks the spell by taking the Grail Diary from him, opens it to the first
	page and signs his autograph. He hands it back and moves on.

	EXT. AIRFIELD - BERLIN, GERMANY- DAY

	Indy's motorcycle pulls up to the main terminal.


	INT. TERMINAL BUILDING - DAY

	A Plainclothes Agent distributes leaflets bearing HENRY'S PICTURE to Nazi
	Soldiers inside the terminal.

	HENRY leans in a doorway reading a newspaper as INDY enters down the stairs
	and taps Henry's shoulder.

	They begin to walk toward the boarding gates.

		               HENRY
		What did you get?

		               INDY
		I don't know. The first available
		flight out of Germany.

		               HENRY
		Good.

	INDY and HENRY show their papers to the Boarding Guards, then join the line of
	passengers, which has already begun to move toward a:


	MOORED ZEPPELIN

	Ten stories tall and longer than two football fields: Flying in the grand tradition!


	INT. THE ZEPPELIN - PASSENGER COMPARTMENT - DAY

	The Zeppelin is about to take off. INDY and HENRY make themselves comfortable
	in one of the compartments.

		               INDY
		Well, we made it.

	HENRY looks over his newspaper at INDY.

		               HENRY
		When we're airborne, with Germany
		behind us, then I'll share that
		sentiment.

		               INDY
		Relax.

	But INDY looks out the window and is suddenly concerned when he sees:
	VOGEL AND A GESTAPO AGENT
	rushing across the tarmac toward the Zeppelin.

		             VOGEL
		Nicht zumachen! Wir steigen ein!

	INDY

	sits back in his chair, looks to HENRY, now reading his newspaper.

	A STEWARD enters and sets a bowl of nuts on the table in front of INDY and
	HENRY, then continues down the aisle of passengers. Indy follows after the
	Steward. He puts his arm around the Steward's shoulder and together they walk
	up a flight of stairs.

	VOGEL

	now walks up the aisle. He approaches a MALE PASSENGER hidden behind a
	newspaper. VOGEL uses his walking stick to lower the newspaper and show the
	Passenger the leaflet with Henry's photograph.

			VOGEL
		Haben sie disen Mann gesehen?

	The Passengers at the table shake their heads in the negative. VOGEL shows the
	picture to other Passengers.

			FEMALE PASSENGER
		Nein.

			INDY (O.S.)
		Fahrscheine, bitte.

			MALE PASSENGER
		Nein.

	VOGEL turns to see:

	INDY

	WEARING THE HAT AND JACKET OF THE CHIEF STEWARD.

			MALE PASSENGER (O.S.)
		Ich habe ihn night gesehen.

			INDY
		Tickets please.

	The Passengers do not react to the request, made in English.

			INDY
		Fahrscheine meine Dame. Bitte.

	VOGEL

	approaches HENRY, still hidden behind his newspaper. Again, VOGEL uses his
	walking stick to lower the paper, revealing Henry's face.

			VOGEL
		Guten Tag, Herr Jones.

	Now INDY, still playing the role of Steward, asks VOGEL for his ticket.

			INDY
		Fahrscheine meine Herr.

			VOGEL
		Weg.

			INDY
		Tickets please.

	HENRY looks confused.

			VOGEL
		      (in German)
		Was?



	VOGEL glances up and recognizes INDYwho quickly punches Vogel in the face,
	knocking him toward the window. In another quick move, Indy TOSSES HIM OUT
	THE WINDOW onto the tarmac below.

	Shocked Passengers blink in bewilderment.

			INDY
		     (in German; with a
		      shrug)
		No ticket.

	Everyone else with a ticket quickly produces it and waves it in Indy's face.


	EXT. AIRFIELD TARMAC - DAY

	VOGEL gets to his knees as the huge Zeppelin rises into the sky above him,
	revealing an airplane attached to the belly of the airship. Vogel shakes his fist at
	the rising Zeppelin.

			VOGEL
		Du wirst nochmal boren von mir!

	INT. ZEPPELIN - DAY

	INDY and HENRY together again in their compartment.

		                HENRY
		You know, sharing your adventures
		is an interesting experience.

CONTINUED:

			INDY
		        (meaning ELSA)
		That's not all we shared. It's
		disgraceful. You're old enough to
		be her fa---er, her grandfather!

		               HENRY
		Well, I'm as human as the next
		man.

		               INDY
		I was the next man.

		               HENRY
		       (laughs)
		Ships that pass in the night...

	HENRY opens his Diary and begins to thumb through it.

		               INDY
		Do you remember the last time we
		had a quiet drink? I had a milk
		shake.

		               HENRY
		Hmmm... What did we talk about?

		               INDY
		We didn't talk. We never talked.

		               HENRY
		And do I detect a rebuke?

		               INDY
		A regret. It was just the two of
		us, Dad. It was a lonely way to
		grow up. For you, too. If you
		had been an ordinary, average
		father like the other guys' dads,
		you'd have understood that.

		               HENRY
		Actually, I was a wonderful father.

			INDY
		When?


	HENRY looks up from his Diary.

		               HENRY
		Did I ever tell you to eat up?
		Go to bed? Wash your ears? Do
		your homework? No. I respected
		your privacy and I taught you self-
		reliance.


CONTINUED: (2)


		               INDY
		What you taught me was that I was
		less important to you than people
		who had been dead for five hundred
		years in another country. And I
		learned it so well that we've
		hardly spoken for twenty years.

		               HENRY
		You left just when you were
		becoming interesting.

		               INDY
		Dad, how can you --?

			HENRY
		        (interrupting)
		Very well. I'm here now.

	He closes the Diary and leans back in his seat.

		               HENRY
		What do you want to talk about?
		Hmmm?

	INDY stutters uncomfortably as HENRY stares at him, waiting for a response.

			INDY
		        (laughs)
		Well... I can't think of anything.

		               HENRY
		Then what are you complaining
		about?
		        (laughs)
		Look, we have work to do. When
		we get to Alexandretta we will
		face three challenges.
		        (he reads from the
		         Diary)
		"First, the breath of God. Only
		the penitent man will pass.
		Second, the Word of God, only in
		the footsteps of God will he
		proceed. Third, the Path of God,
		only in the leap from the lion's
		head will he prove his worth. "

		               INDY
		What does that mean?

			HENRY
		        (laughs)
		I don't know. We'll find out.


CONTINUED: (3)


	Sunlight falls across the table from the window. INDY reaches for the drink. The
	bar of sunlight turns like the hand of a clock over the tabletop across the drinks.

	We see INDY puzzled. Only for a moment.

		               INDY
		They're turning around. They're
		taking us back to Germany.


	INT. FRAMEWORK OF ZEPPELIN - DAY

	INDY and his father emerge from the hatchway into the belly of the Zeppelin.
	The Zeppelin's elaborate metal framework is exposed.

	INDY and HENRY hurry down the catwalk until arriving at a PAIR OF
	DOORWAYS framed into the Zeppelin's outer skin.

		               INDY
		Well, I thought it would take
		them a lot longer to figure out
		the radio was dead. Come on,
		Dad. Move!

	Then INDY opens the doors. We see plenty of blue sky and white clouds. We also
	see a small BIPLANE that is suspended from the Zeppelin by a HOOK & CRANE
	DEVICE.

		               INDY
		Come on, Dad. Come on!

	EXT. AIRPLANE - DAY

	INDY climbs into the cockpit of the Biplane as HENRY takes the tail gunner's
	seat.

			HENRY
		       (with delight)
		I didn't know you could fly a
		plane.

		               INDY
		Fly--yes. Land--no.


	INT. THE BIPLANE - DAY

	INDY turns in his seat to give HENRY the "thumbs up." Henry smiles valiantly
	and points down to the ground.

	Then they both become aware of a STRANGE SOUND in the skies behind them.
	Something between a ROAR and a WAIL.
	TWO MESSERSCHMIDT FIGHTER BOMBERS

	streak out of the clouds and race across the sky.


	INDY AND HENRY

	shrink in their seats as the MESSERSCHMIDTS (going three times as fast as they
	are) SCREAM past on either side.

		               INDY
		Dad, you're gonna have to use the
		machine gun. Get it ready.

	HENRY turns and grips the MOUNTED MACHINE GUN with a perplexed
	expression.

			INDY
		        (turning; pointing)
		Eleven o'clock!

	HENRY pulls out his watch.

		               INDY
		Dadeleven o'clock!!

		               HENRY
		What happens at eleven o'clock?

	INDY uses his arm to demonstrate that he's referring to a direction and not a
	time.

			INDY
		        (frustrated)
		Twelveeleventen. Eleven
		o'clock. Fire!

	HENRY doesand the EXPLODING GUN nearly shakes him out of his seat.

	Indy's slow speed and small size works to his advantage. The speeding
	Messerschmidts continually overshoot him, WHIZZING past in a blurmaking
	wide turns miles away in the sky.

	HENRY has one of the Messerschmidts in his sight. He pulls back on the trigger
	--RATTA-A-TAT-TAT!  RATTA-A-TAT-TAT!

	The Messerschmidt banks to the left, but HENRY keeps it in his gun sight. Henry
	swings the gun around, inadvertently CUTTING HIS OWN REAR STABILIZER IN
	HALF.

		               INDY
		Dad, are we hit?!

			HENRY
		More or less.

CONTINUED:


			HENRY
		Son, I'm sorry. They got us.

	INDY looks back at the missing tail section, then at his father.

	The plane begins to go down. INDY struggles to control its descent.

			INDY
		Hang on, Dads We're going in!

	HENRY slumps down fearfully in his seat.


	EXT. A FIELD - DAY

	The wheels of the plane touch down. OUT OF CONTROL, the PLANE SKIDS and
	CRASHES first into a corral of goats and then into the farmhouse beyond sending
	a cloud of dust into the air.

	As INDY pulls himself from the cockpit:

			HENRY
		        (sarcastic)
		Nice landing.

			INDY
		Thanks.


	Suddenly, INDY's attention is directed to:


	TWO SCREAMING MESSERSCHMIDTS

	coming in low. Guns BLAZING.

	As BULLETS EXPLODE around them, INDY and HENRY jump over a stone
	barricade. Henry, frightened, grabs at Indy.

		               HENRY
		Those people are trying to kill
		us!

			INDY
		I know, Dadl

			HENRY
		It's a new experience for me.

			INDY
		It happens to me all the time.


	EXT. ROAD - DAY

	An OLD MAN kneels at his car repairing a rear tire.

	THE MAN

	turns to the wheel, the hubcap in his hands. Suddenly the wheel moves forward,
	startling the Old Man.


	INT. THE CAR - TRAVELING - DAY

	INDY has the throttle down, both hands tightly gripping the steering wheel.
	HENRY is a very nervous passenger.

	INDY sees a LOW-FLYING MESSERSCHMIDT coming up behind him in the SIDE
	MIRROR.

	As the Messerschmidt ROARS by overhead, BULLETS EXPLODE around them,
	narrowly missing the car.

		               HENRY
		This is intolerable!

		               INDY
		This could be close.


	EXT. THE ROAD - LONG SHOT - DAY

	The car races toward a TUNNEL that cuts through a steep MOUNTAINSIDE.

	The Messerschmidt bears down on Indy's car, machine guns CHATTERING.

	The car ENTERS the tunnel. The Messerschmidt cannot pull up in time. It
	SLAMS into the MOUTH OF THE TUNNEL, SHEARING OFF its WINGS.


	INT. THE TUNNEL - DAY

	The FLAMING FUSELAGE continues to ROCKET through the tunnel like a bullet
	down the muzzle of a gun. SPARKS fly as its belly SCRAPES against the
	pavement and the sides of the tunnel.


	INT. THE CAR - DAY

	Indy and Henry look over their shoulders to see this wingless BALL OF FIRE
	gaining on them; about to overtake them.

			HENRY
		Faster, boy --faster!


	EXT. THE ROAD - OTHER SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN - DAY

	The car exits the tunnel at top speed and veers off the
	road. The flaming Messerschmidt fuselage shoots past and
	EXPLODES in the middle of the road.

	INT. THE CAR - DAY

	As the car emerges safely from the flames, Henry wipes the sweat from his brow.

			HENRY
		Well, they don't come any closer
		than that!

	HENRY looks out the windshield and sees the second Messerschmidt SCREAMING
	out of the sky toward them.


	EXT. THE ROAD - LONG SHOT - DAY

	The MESSERSCHMIDT drops its single UNDER-FUSELAGE BOMB. It EXPLODES in
	the road directly ahead of the car, missing it by only several feet.

	THE CAR

	FALLS INTO THE HOLE made by the bomb.

	DISSOLVE TO:


	EXT. ROAD - DAY

	INDY climbs out of the car, still in the bomb crater. He turns back to HENRY.

		               INDY
		Dad, he's coming back.

	INDY and HENRY run down the mountainside to:


	A DESERTED MEDITERRANEAN BEACH - DAY

	INDY and HENRY run to the shoreline. Indy reaches for his gun, tucked in his
	pants. He opens the chamberthe GUN HAS NO BULLETS.


	THE MESSERSCHMIDT

	swings around and is coming in for another pass.


	INDY AND HENRY

	exchange a wordless glance. They don't even think about running: there is no
	place to run to. HENRY hands his case to INDY.

	Holding his umbrella, HENRY suddenly spins around and runs screaming and
	shouting into A FLOCK OF SEA GULLS...

	THE SEA GULLS take to the wing in flight. Thousands of them.

	INDY

	Bullets kick up sand leading up to him... then

	THE MESSERSCHMIDT AND THE SEA GULLS meet in midair. MASSACRE! Sea
	gulls are shredded by the Messerschmidt's whirling propeller blades into a
	FEATHERY WHITE PUREE that SPLATTERS against the cockpit and CLOGS THE
	ENGINE.

	ENGINE SPUTTERS... STALLS... Silence. The Messerschmidt falls from the skies
	and EXPLODES in an OFF CAMERA SOUND EFFECT.

	INDY stands as beforestunneda statue.

	HENRY walks back to INDY.

		               HENRY
		I suddenly remembered Charlemagne.
		"Let my armies be the rocks and the
		trees and the birds in the sky."
		       (he chuckles)

	INDY wears a proud expression as he watches HENRY walk down the beach.


	EXT. MOSQUE - DAY

	FADE IN TITLE: "REPUBLIC OF HATAY"

	FADE OUT TITLE.


	EXT. COURTYARD OF SULTAN'S PALACE - ISKENDERUN - DAY

	The SULTAN is seated in his royal chair, flanked by WALTER DONOVAN and
	VOGEL and surrounded by his minions.

	DONOVAN holds the missing Grail Diary pages.

		               DONOVAN
		These pages are taken from Professor
		Jones' diary, Your Highness. And
		they include a map that pinpoints
		the exact location of the Grail.

	DONOVAN and the SULTAN walk together through an archway.

		               DONOVAN
		As you can see, the Grail is all
		but in our hands.
		      (beat)
		However, Your Highness, we
		would not think of crossing your
		soil without your permission,
		nor of removing the Grail from
		your borders without suitable
		compensation.


CONTINUED:


		               SULTAN
		What have you brought?

		               VOGEL
		Bring den Schatzl

	TWO NAZI SOLDIERS bring forward a HUGE STEAMER TRUNK. They open the lid
	and begin to empty it of its contents:

	Gold and silver objects of every description.

		               DONOVAN
		Precious valuables, Your Highness,
		"donated" by some of the finest
		families in all of Germany.

	The SULTAN gets up from his chair and walks toward the trunk. He goes right
	past it and begins to inspect the Nazi staff car parked nearby.

		               SULTAN
		Rolls-Royce Phantom Two. 4.3
		litre, 30 horsepower, six cylinder
		engine, with Stromberg Downdraft
		carburetor.

	The SULTAN points to the engine under the hood.

		               SULTAN
		Can go from zero to 100 kilometres
		an hour in 12.5 seconds. And I
		even like the color.

			DONOVAN
		       (after a beat)
		The keys are in the ignition,
		Your Highness.

		               SULTAN
		You shall have camels, horses, an
		armed escort, provisions, desert
		vehiclesand tanksl

			DONOVAN
		You're welcome.

	Somebody else is also taking note...and we see that it is KAZIM, the spy at the
	court.

	ELSA is revealed coming down the stairs toward DONOVAN and VOGEL.

	                                     ELSA
		We have no time to lose. Indiana
		Jones and his father have escaped.

	EXT. ISKENDERUN STREET - DAY

	SALLAH drives his car through the crowded streets, INDY beside him and HENRY
	in the back seat.

		               SALLAH
		We go this way.

	SALLAH waves his arms and shouts to a CAMEL HERDER.

		               SALLAH
		Get that camel out of the way!

			INDY
		What happened to Marcus, Sallah?

			SALLAH
		      (overlapping)
		Ah, they set out across the desert
		this afternoon. I believe they
		took Mister Brody with them.

	HENRY removes his hat and hits INDY with it.

		               HENRY
		Now they have the map! And in
		this sort of race, there's no
		silver medal for finishing second.


	EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY

Elsa and Donovan's partyconsisting of a SUPPLY TRUCK, OPEN CAR, TUhKISH
SOLDIERS RIDING CAMELS, SPARE HORSES AND A TANK AND VARIOUS OTHER
VEHICLESall moving along through the ramble of this box canyon.

ELSA, DONOVAN and VOGEL travel in the open car. The TANK is a vintage World
War I model with enormous treads. The Turkish soldiers wear native dress and
carry both carbines and sabers.

BRODY sits alongside ELSA in the rear of the car carrying DONOVAN. Donovan
hands a canteen back to him.

		               DONOVAN
		Care to wet your whistle, Marcus?

			BRODY
		I'd rather spit in your face.
		But as I haven't got any spit...

	VOGEL snatches the canteen away from BRODY before he can drink.

		               VOGEL
		We must be within three or four
		miles. Otherwise we are off the
		map.


CONTINUED:


	He hands the map to ELSA, drinks from the canteen, and hands that back to
	DONOVAN.

		               DONOVAN
		Well, Marcus, we are on the brink
		of the recovery of the greatest
		artifact in the history of mankind.

		               BRODY
		You're meddling with powers you
		cannot possibly comprehend.

	HENRY and SALLAH are at INDY's side as he views Donovan's party in the
	distance. Parked nearby is a CAR containing all of their supplies.

		               INDY
		Ah, I see Brody. He seems okay.
		They've got a tank. Six-pound
		gun.

	Then Donovan notices a reflection from the hills.

	What he sees is:


	THE SUN REFLECTING OFF THE LENSES OF INDY'S BINOCULARS

			HENRY
		What do you think you're doing?!
		Get down!

		               INDY
		Dad, we're well out of range.

	At that moment the tank FIRES A SHELL in their direction.

	It WHISTLES overhead and BLOWS UP THE PARKED CAR. INDY, HENRY and
	SALLAH cover their heads as automobile fragments rain down upon them.

		               SALLAH
		That car belonged to my brother-
		in-law.

			INDY
		      (gesturing to the
		       others)
		Come on--come on!


	EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY

		               VOGEL
		I can't see anyone up there.


CONTINUED:

		               DONOVAN
		Maybe it wasn't even Jones.

		               ELSA
		No. It's him all right. He's
		here somewhere.

			DONOVAN
		      (to VOGEL)
		Put Brody in the tank.

	KAZIM peers over a rock, pointing his rifle at the group below.

			DONOVAN
		      (to ELSA)
		Well, in this sun, without
		transportation, they're as good
		as dead.

	BULLETS EXPLODE off the vehicles and cliff. DONOVAN and ELSA duck.

	A NAZI SOLDIER falls from the tank as BULLETS EXPLODE around him.

	KAZIM'S MEN, BRETHREN OF THE CRUCIFORM SWORD, continue to FIRE. ELSA
	and DONOVAN take cover beside the parked car.

		               DONOVAN
		It's Jones, all right.


	ANGLE ON INDY'S GROUP

	INDY and HENRY, followed by SALLAH, take cover behind a rock to watch
	Kazim's Men and the Nazi Troops exchanging fire below them.

		               HENRY
		Now, who are all these people?

		               INDY
		Who cares? As long as they're
		keeping Donovan busy. Dad, you
		stay here while Sallah and I
		organize some transportation.

	CUT BACK to the action. The BRETHREN are firing at the
	DONOVAN party and are being fired on by the Donovan party.

	TWO NAZI SOLDIERS throw HAND GRENADES into the cliffs. They EXPLODE,
	killing one of Kazim's Brethren.

	The battle continuesa fierce exchange of GUNSHOTS, GRENADES and
	MACHINE GUN FIRE with losses on both sides.

	INDY AND SALLAH

	crouch behind a rock watching as men on both sides of the battle run amongst
	camels and horses.

			INDY
		I'm going after those horses.

			SALLAH
		I'll take the camels.

			INDY
		I don't need camels.

			SALLAH
		But, Indy

			INDY
		No camels!


	DONOVAN AND ELSA

	They look down at KAZIM who lies mortally wounded on the ground at their feet.
	ELSA looks saddened.

			DONOVAN
		      (re KAZIM)
		Who is he?

		               KAZIM
		A messenger from God. For the
		unrighteous, the Cup of Life
		holds everlasting damnation.

	KAZIM dies.


	INDY

	leaps atop a TURKISH SOLDIER on horseback, pulling the man and the horse to
	the ground. A SECOND TURK comes to assist his comrade; INDY mounts the
	horse, knocking both Turks to the ground.


	INT. THE TANK - DAY

	BRODY has been left alone in the tank. HENRY climbs down into the tank and
	taps Brody on the shoulder, startling him.

		               HENRY
		Marcus!

		               BRODY
		Arghhh! Oh!


CONTINUED:

	They exchange an old University Club toast, swinging their arms at one another
	and missing. Then HENRY flaps his arms and tugs his ears.

			HENRY
		"Genius of the Restoration"

	Now BRODY tugs his ears, flaps his arms and touches his head.

			BRODY
		"aid our own resuscitation!"

	They exchange a handshake.

			BRODY
		Henryl What are you doing here?!

			HENRY
		It's a rescue, old boys Come on.


	As HENRY starts to climb out of the tank, TWO NAZI SOLDIERS DROP DOWN from
	above, their Lugers drawn. They are followed by VOGEL.

			VOGEL
		       (re HENRY)
		Search him.

	The NAZI SOLDIERS point their guns at HENRY and BRODY.

			VOGEL
		       (to HENRY)
		What is in this book? That
		miserable little Diary of yours!

	VOGEL removes a glove and slaps HENRY with it.

			VOGEL
		Here's the map. The book is
		useless, and yet you come all the
		way back to Berlin to get it.
		Why? 

	He slaps HENRY again.

			VOGEL
		What are you hiding?

	Another slap.

			VOGEL
		What does the Diary tell you that
		it doesn't tell us?!

	VOGEL reaches out to slap HENRY yet again, but Henry grabs his arm, stopping
	him.


CONTINUED: (2)

		               HENRY
		It tells me that goose-stepping
		morons like yourself should try
		reading books instead of burning
		them.

	DONOVAN appears at the turret cover.

		               DONOVAN
		Colonel? Jones is getting away.

		               VOGEL
		        (indicating HENRY)
		I think not, Herr Donovan.


	EXT. TANK - DAY

		               DONOVAN
		Not that Jonesthe other Jones!

		               NAZI SOLDIER
		Herr Colonel!


	EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY

	INDY rides away on one horse, leading three others as he goes.

	SALLAH approaches on horseback leading five camels.

		               INDY
		Sallah, I said no camels! That's
		five camels. Can't you Count?

		               SALLAH
		Compensation for my brother-in-
		law's car. Indy, your father and
		Brody

		               INDY
		Where's my father?

		               SALLAH
		They have them. In the belly of
		that steel beast.

	INDY and SALLAH charge forward leading their horses and camels.

	Then VOGEL commands the Tank Driver to give chase.


	INT. TANK - DAY

	VOGEL shouts to the Tank Driver.

			VOGEL
		Fire!


	EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY


	The tank starts firing at INDY on horseback. Indy zigs and zags as the tank fires
	two rounds at Indy, barely missing him. Each time Indy emerges from the plume
	of desert dust, hanging like a toadstool in the air.


	INT. TANK- DAY

	HENRY and BRODY hold their hands over their ears.


	EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY

	DONOVAN shouts orders to the Troops. INDY is followed by various vehicles in
	the caravan.

	INDY notices that the side gun that is now firing at him can only pivot so far.
	Indy makes a mental note of this and while riding right in front of the tank,
	turns his horse completely around, 180 degrees. The tank starts to follow.


	POV THROUGH THE VIEWING PORT

	VOGEL watches the ground turning 180 degrees as he tries to catch up with
	INDY.

	Cleverly, INDY has turned the tank directly into a head-on
	collision course with some of the pursuit vehicles and a Kubelwagon.

	The tank and the Kubelwagon smash into each other, the German military sedan
	becoming lodged between the treads while blocking the front view and any use of
	the six-pound cannon on the turret.

	INDY, meanwhile, leans down on his horse, scooping up a stone from the wall of
	a culvert. He reigns his horse, paralleling the tank, as everyone scurries about
	inside, looking through viewing ports, trying to figure out exactly where Indy is.


	INT. TANK- DAY

	VOGEL shouts to the Gunner.

	                                      VOGEL
		Der Kubelwagon sprengen!

	The Gunner puts a shell into the large gun. He FIRES, CATAPULTING THE
	KUBELWAGON into the air, where it EXPLODES.  The tank drives through the
	resulting smoke an dust, then rolls over the Kubelwagon, crushing it
	
	EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY

	INDY gallops up to the side cannon and jams the stone down the barrel, lodging
	several rocks inside. Then he steers his horse directly in range of that gun.


	INT. TANK - DAY

	A NAZI SOLDIER pushes HENRY away from the window.

	                              	NAZI SOLDIER
		Keine Bewegung.

	He points his gun at HENRY and BRODY.

			NAZI SOLDIER
		Keine Bewegung.

	The smaller gun, blocked by the rocks, BACKFIRES, blowing the breech out into
	the face of the gunner, killing him and filling the tank with smoke.

	BRODY, HENRY, VOGEL and the driver begin to choke.


	EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY

	INDY rides his horse alongside the tank.

			INDY
		Dad!  Dad!  Dad!


	INT. TANK - DAY

	HENRY and BRODY still held at gunpoint by the NAZI SOLDIER.

			HENRY
		Junior? Junior? Junior!

	The NAZI SOLDIER swings his fist, knocking HENRY off his seat.


	EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY

	Smoke pours from the top of the tank as the turret pops open. VOGEL emerges
	and aims his gun at INDY.

	INDY and VOGEL EXCHANGE SHOTS as Indy chases the tank on his horse.

	INDY pulls the trigger againhis gun is empty! Indy immediately takes the
	high trail.

	Now INDY is above the tank twelve feet on a paralleling trail. He moves out of
	the saddle and leaps from the speeding horse onto the trundling tank.


	CLOSE UP - VOGEL

	Hate-staring at INDY

	CLOSE UP - INDY

	Hate-staring back at VOGEL.

Suddenly, from nowhere a German soldier flies INTO FRAME, tackling Indy.

					CUT TO:

	SIDE ANGLE

	One of the two troop carriers is paralleling the tank and like pirates boarding a
	galleon, Nazi Soldiers leap over the treads and are swarming all over INDY.

	INDY is struggling with a German's Luger.

	INDY presses the luger against his assailant and forces the Nazi to squeeze off a
	shot into himself. The bullet not only passes through the Nazi, but passes
	through two other Nazis standing directly behind him on the crowded tank top
	and three bodies fall away, leaving Indy to stare at the gun in disbelief.
	
	Another Soldier leaps from the truck onto the tank and raises his knife as he
	grabs INDY. They struggle and fall.

	INDY sits up to see VOGEL standing over him. Vogel wraps a chain around Indy's
	neck.


	INT. TANK- DAY

	INDY appears at the entrance, the chain still wrapped about his neck and held by
	VOGEL.

			INDY
		Dad!

	He drops the gun down into the tank.

			INDY
		Dad! Dadl Get it!

	VOGEL pulls INDY from the tank entrance, yanking on the chain wrapped around
	his neck.


	EXT. TANK - DAY

	A NAZI SOLDIER approaches.

	INDY hits him, knocking him onto the tank tread. The Nazi Soldier screams as he
	is dragged under the rolling tank.

	Now INDY and VOGEL struggle with one another, the chain still wrapped around
	Indy's neck.


	INT. TANK- DAY

	THROUGH THE PERISCOPE

	We SEE INDY and VOGEL struggling atop the tank. Indy lifts his feet, lunging
	toward the periscope and pulling Vogel with him.

	INDY's face is pressed up against the lens of the periscope.


	INT. TANK - DAY

	The NAZI SOLDIER looking through the periscope pulls away from it, smiles, then
	turns back to it.


	THROUGH THE PERISCOPE

	INDY's face, still pressed against the lens.

	VOGEL pulls INDY from the periscope.


	INT. TANK - DAY

	The NAZI SOLDIER pulls away from the periscope again.

			PERISCOPE SOLDIER
		        (laughing)
		Diese Amerikane. Sie Kampfen wie
		Weiber.

	EXT. TANK - DAY

	INDY now lies on top of VOGEL. He kicks out at the periscope which spins
	around.


	INT. TANK - DAY

	The periscope handle spins around and hits the PERISCOPE SOLDIER in the head.
	He falls against the NAZI SOLDIER guarding HENRY and BRODY.

	HENRY pushes the NAZI SOLDIER aside and grabs the gun. The PERISCOPE
	SOLDIER struggles to take the gun from Henry.


	EXT. TANK- DAY

	VOGEL holds the chain around INDY's neck, pushing his head downward toward
	the revolving tread.


	INT. TANK - DAY

	The PERISCOPE SOLDIER holds HENRY from behind, forcing the gun toward him.
	Henry reaches down and pulls a fountain pen from his coat pocket.



CONTINUED:

	As the PERISCOPE SOLDIER pulls on HENRY's face, Henry lifts the fountain pen
	and squirts ink into his face. The Soldier falls, his head smashing into the wall of
	the tank. At the same time, Henry loses his grip on the gun which falls to the
	floor.


			BRODY
		Henry, the pen

			HENRY
		What?


		               BRODY
		But don't you see? The pen is
		mightier than the sword.


	EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY

	A troop truck pulls near the tank.


	INT. TANK- DAY

	HENRY fires the TANK GUN at the troop truck. SOLDIERS FLY INTO THE AIR.
	The TROOP TRUCK flips over and EXPLODES.


	EXT. TANK - DAY

	The EXPLOSION knocks INDY off the tank and onto the tread. He grabs onto the
	shredded gun protruding from the side of the tank.

	VOGEL looks down at INDY and smiles smugly.

	The tank is approaching a cliff wall. As INDY tries to secure footing, VOGEL
	steps on his hands.


	INT. TANK - DAY

	BRODY looks at HENRY.

			BRODY
		Look what you didl

		               HENRY
		It's war.


	EXT. TANK - DAY

	VOGEL now swings a shovel at INDY, smashing at his hands.

	BRODY climbs up out of the tank, followed by HENRY.



CONTINUED:

			HENRY
		Didn't I tell you it was a rescue,
		huh?

	A NAZI SOLDIER appears and pulls HENRY down.

	VOGEL raises the shovel above his head and brings it crashing down on INDY,
	still hanging from the protruding gun.

	INDY loses his grip and now hangs from the gun suspended only by the strap of
	his leather pouch. He screams as the gun scrapes against the cliff wall, sending
	stones tumbling down over him.


	INT. TANK - DAY

	The NAZI SOLDIER knocks HENRY into a pile of boxes, then punches him in the
	face.

	As the SOLDIER raises the gun to HENRY's face, BRODY hits him over the head
	with a canister. The Soldier falls, discharging the gun into the air.

	The BULLET RICOCHETS around the tank, past the Tank Driver who is
	manipulating levers at the control panel. SPARKS FLY; then the BULLET PINGS
	AGAINST THE WINDOW and RICOCHETS ONCE MORE, this time passing THROUGH
	THE TANK DRIVER'S HAT. Blood flows from under the hat as the Tank Driver
	slumps forward, his body depressing the levers.


	EXT. TANK - DAY

	INDY still hangs from the strap of his leather pouch as the tank swerves, barely
	missing the rocks and causing VOGEL to fall. Indy finally manages to pull
	himself atop the tank once more where he punches Vogel over the side, then
	peers down to HENRY, still inside the tank.

			INDY
		Dad?

			HENRY
		You call this archaeology?

			INDY
		Get out of there, Dad!

	INDY pulls HENRY and BRODY from the tank. VOGEL pulls himself back atop the
	tank armed again with the shovel which he swings at Indy, who ducks and grabs
	Vogel's arm.

			BRODY
		How does one get off this thing?

	As INDY winds up to punch VOGEL he catches BRODY in the face on the
	backswing, then completes the movement and knocks Vogel down.

	INT. TANK - DAY

	Vogel's hat sails in and falls to the floor.


	EXT. TANK- DAY

			HENRY
		        (to INDY)
		Where's Marcus?!

	Before INDY can answer, VOGEL is up and swinging with the shovel. Indy ducks
	but the shovel catches HENRY sending him over the side and onto the moving
	tread.

	INDY grabs his whip, knocking VOGEL aside.

	As HENRY speeds toward the front of the tank to certain doom, INDY, with
	lightning speed, whips out his bullwhip, wrapping the end of the whip around
	Henry's right ankle.

			INDY
		Dad!

	HENRY is bouncing across the treads like a rag-doll. INDY struggles to hold onto
	the end of the bullwhip.

			INDY
		Hang on, Dad!

	SALLAH draws his horse next to the treads. He tips his fez to HENEY.

		               SALLAH
		Father of Indygive me your
		hand!

	VOGEL now punches INDY in the back and grabs him around the neck. Still,
	INDY refuses to let go of the whip.

			INDY
		Sallah! Get Dadl

	SALLAH reaches out to HENRY.

		               SALLAH
		Give me your hand!

	SALLAH manages to hold onto HENRY as he brings his horse to a stop just at the
	cliff's edge.

	INDY finally frees himself of VOGEL's grasp, twisting his arm painfully away
	from Indy's neck, then landing a hard blow to Vogel's head.


	INDY

	looks down at the fast-approaching cliff, his face filled with horror.  We SEE his
	HAT BLOW OFF and sail over the cliff's edge.

	VOGEL

	He sees his life passing before him, he screams at the top
	of his lungs!


	LONG SHOT

	The tank trundles over the cliff and PLUMMETS TO THE BOTTOM.


	EXT. CLIFF EDGE - DAY

	HENRY, BRODY and SALLAH look down at the flaming wreckage
	of the tank.

			HENRY
		Junior?!

	We HEAR the TANK EXPLODING.

			SALLAH
		Indy?!


		               HENRY
		Oh, God. I've lost him. And I
		never told him anything. I just
		wasn't ready, Marcus. Five
		minutes would have been enough.

	And then... looking dazed and bewildered, INDY STAGGERS UP BEHIND THEM.
	He joins the others at the edge of the cliff, looking down at the wreckage below
	with a bewildered expression.

	Finally, Henry becomes aware of his presence.

	HENRY says nothing. He just looks at Indy, overcome with emotion. Finally, he
	throws his arms around him.

			HENRY
		I thought I'd lost you, boy.

	After a moment, Indy's head clears. And he becomes aware of his father's
	embrace. Something he hasn't felt in a long timeif ever. And it touches him.
	He hugs his father back.

		               INDY
		I thought you had too, sir.

	BRODY and SALLAH are moved by this sudden reconciliation.

			HENRY
		Wellwell done! Come on!

	HENRY pats INDY on the back and Indy collapses, sitting hard on the rocky cliff
	edge.



CONTINUED:

	Unaware, HENRY, SALLAH and BRODY start to walk away. Henry turns back to
	see INDY still sitting on the ground.

		               HENRY
		Let's go then. why are you
		sitting there resting when we're
		so near the end? Come on
		let's go!

	HENRY turns and walks toward the horse with BRODY and SALLAH. Suddenly
	the FEDORA, borne on the wind, BLOWS INTO SCENE and lands at INDY's feet.


	EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

	DONOVAN peers through binoculars to see the CANYON OF THE CRESCENT
	MOON. He lowers the binoculars and turns to ELSA.

			DONOVAN
		The Canyon of the Crescent Moon.

	Now ELSA peers through the binoculars.


	EXT. SECRET CANYON - DAY

	INDY, HENRY, SALLAH and BRODY ride into the canyon. They hear a WAILING
	WIND. Feel the biting cold. And sense the danger.

	Now we turn a corner and they see the hidden city. Its spectacular Grecian
	facade is carved directly into the rock. It is a stunning sight. The vehicles,
	camels and horses belonging to DONOVAN's party have been left at the entrance.

					CUT TO:


	INT. TEMPLE - DAY

	INDY, SALLAH, HENRY AND BRODY creep forward to see:

	THE TERRIFIED FACE OF A TURKISH SOLDIER

	He's walking slowly. Eyes darting. Muttering a prayer under his breath.
	What's going on here?


	FULL SHOT - INSIDE THE MOUNTAIN TEMPLE

	THE TURK stands alone in the center of the Temple. It is very dark. GIANT
	COLUMNS define the Temple's perimeter.

	ELSA AND DONOVAN

	watch him from a safe distance.

	THE TURK

	is about to approach the spot where a TURKISH SOLDIER LIES DEAD. We don't
	notice it right away, but the dead soldier has been DECAPITATED.

	THE TURK stopsonly one step away from the beheaded soldier.


	THE TURK

	takes one more stepa fatal step, it turns out. We hear a ROARA WHOOSH
	of airbut we SEE NOTHINGexcept THE TURK'S HEAD FLY OFF AND
	BOUNCE across the ground.


	INDY, HENRY, BRODY AND SALLAH

	react to the sight.


	ELSA AND DONOVAN

	She looks at him, horrified.


			DONOVAN
		Helmut, another volunteer!

	TWO NAZI SOLDIERS force another Turk forward. Suddenly...


	The SOUND OF RIFLE BOLTS being cocked. Everyone turns to discover INDY and
	his party surrounded by NAZI SOLDIERS. Indy's group are relieved of their guns.


	FULL SHOT - THE TEMPLE

	INDY, HENRY, BRODY and SALLAH are brought forward by the Nazi Soldiers.


	ELSA's eyes light up: glad Indy's not dead. she controls herself and continues
	more coldly.

			ELSA
		       (to INDY)
		I never expected to see you again.

		                INDY
		I'm like a bad penny. I always
		turn up.

		                DONOVAN
		Step back now, Doctor Schneider.
		Give Doctor Jones some room. He's
		going to recover the Grail for us.



CONTINUED:

	INDY laughs.

		               DONOVAN
		Impossible? What do you say,
		Jones? Ready to go down in
		history?

			INDY
		As what? A Nazi stooge like you?

			DONOVAN
		       (scornfully)
		Nazis?!Is that the limit of
		your vision?! The Nazis want to
		write themselves into the Grail
		legend and take on the world.
		Well, they're welcome. But I want
		the Grail itself. The cup that
		gives everlasting life.
		Hitler can have the world, but
		he can't take it with him. I'm
		going to be drinking my own health
		when he's gone the way of the
		Dodo.
		      (he draws his
		       pistol)
		The Grail is mine, and you're
		going to get it for me.

			INDY
		Shooting me won't get you anywhere.

		               DONOVAN
		You know something, Doctor Jones?...
		you're absolutely right.

	Then DONOVAN shifts his aim, just a bit, and SHOOTS HENRY. The bullet enters
	his side below the ribs.

			INDY
		Dad?!

			HENRY
		Junior. . .

			ELSA
		No!!

			DONOVAN
		     ( to ELSA)
		Get back!

	HENRY collapses. Blood flowing from the wound. BRODY and SALLAH rush to
	his assistance.



CONTINUED: (2)


	INDY spins toward DONOVAN with murder in his eyes.

	DONOVAN points the gun at him:

			DONOVAN
		You can't save him when you're
		dead.

	INDY hesitates.

		               DONOVAN
		The healing power of the Grail is
		the only thing that can save your
		father now. It's time to ask yourself
		what you believe.

	INDY takes in the situation. The two decapitated men lie a few yards in front of
	him. He walks to the entranceway, flanked by two stone lions. We get silent
	reaction shotsELSASALLAHBRODYDONOVANregistering their
	different emotions

	INDY proceeds forward. His hands open the Grail Diary.

		               INDY
		"The Breath of God... Only the
		penitent man will pass. Only
		the penitent man will pass. . . "

	INDY takes a few steps forward.

		               INDY
		"The penitent man will pass.
		The penitent man..."

	INDY stops. He is about to reach the spot where two men have just died.

	HENRY looks at INDY. Indy looks at Henry.

			HENRY
		        (in a raspy voice)
		"Only the penitent man will pass.
		Only the penitent man will pass."

			INDY
		        (quietly to himself)
		The penitent man will pass. The
		penitent... the penitent. The
		penitent man...

			HENRY
		The penitent man. The penitent...

	INDY takes a step forward through the cobwebs.



CONTINUED: (3)


			INDY
		The penitent man is humble before
		God.

			HENRY
		Penitent. Penitent...

			INDY
		The penitent man is humble...

	The cobwebs begin to move....

			INDY
		He kneels before God.
		       (to himself; suddenly)
		Kneel!!

	We hear the awful rush of airWHOOSH! Because INDY is in the act of
	kneeling, only his hat is knocked off and his hair flies in his face.

	Instinctively he ROLLS FORWARD on the ground out of harm's way and looks up.
	From his new position he is able to see what is causing all the trouble: A RAZOR
	SHARP TRIPLE PENDULUM.

	INDY gets cautiously to his feet. Now he sees the pendulum has been guarding a
	SMALL CORRIDOR which turns a corner to the left fifty yards ahead. Wooden
	wheels turnthe mechanism controlling the spinning blades. INDY loops a rope
	around the wheels, jamming the mechanism and stopping the blades in mid-swipe.

			INDY
		I'm through!


	ELSA AND DONOVAN

			DONOVAN
		We're through!

	BRODY and SALLAH smile, relieved.

			SALLAH
		      (to HENRY)
		He's all right.

	HENRY shakes his head.

			HENRY
		No.

	BACK TO INDY

	holding the Grail Diary, reading once again, his fedora now covered in cobwebs.


			INDY
		"The second challenge is the
		 Word of God. Only in the
		footsteps of God will he proceed."
		       (to himself)
		The Word of God... The Word of...


	INDY pulls away some cobwebs to reveal a cobblestone path. Each cobble is
	engraved with a letter.

			INDY
		"Proceed in the footsteps of the
		Word."



	HENRY

	lifts his head painfully.


			HENRY
		The Word of God...



			BRODY
		No, Henry. Try not to talk.


			HENRY
		The Name of God...

	BACK TO INDY

	as he studies the cobblestones before him.


			INDY
		The Name of God... Jehovahl



	HENRY

	still lies in SALLAH's arms. BRODY leans over him.


			HENRY
		But in the Latin alphabet,
		"Jehovah" begins with an "I."


	BACK TO INDY


			INDY
		"J."

	INDY takes a step and immediately a stone breaks away and INDY falls up to his
	hip -- his leg stuck through the hold where the stone once was.

	HENRY

	reacts.


		               HENRY
		Oh dear!

	BACK TO INDY

	who grunts as he pulls himself from the hole, the v-rail Diary in his hand.

		               INDY
		In Latin, "Jehovah" starts with
		an "I." "I"...

	Now we SEE each letter on the stones as INDY carefully walks forward.
	DONOVAN and ELSA follow in his footsteps.

			INDY
		"E"... "H"... "O"... "V"... "A"...


	INDY sighs with relief and steps forward to:


	THE GREAT ABYSS

	INDY stands in a small opening, just small enough for his shoulders to squeeze
	through and beyond that a 100 foot drop to the rocks below and 100 feet across,
	nothing but a rough, stony cliff wall.


	BACK TO INDY

	He can see nowhere to cross. He looks again to the v-rail Diary.

		               INDY
		"The path of flood. Only in the
		leap from the lion's head will
		he prove his worth."

	INDY looks around and then he notices that inscribed into
	the rock above his head is the head of a lion.

			INDY
		Impossiblel Nobody can jump this!

	INDY looks down into the Diary and tortures over what it
	is asking him to do.


	BRODY

	rushes forward and calls to INDY.

			BRODY
		Indy... Indy, you must hurry!!
		Come quickly!

	BACK TO INDY

			INDY
		     (realizing)
		It's... a leap of faith. Oh,
		God.

	HENRY

	calls to his son.


		               HENRY
		You must believe, boy. you must...
		believe.

	We see him do it. We see him leap into space. We see that he is in midair. We
	see that he is not going to make it. His hands claw for the opposite wall but he is
	going to fall 100 feet to his death. And thenhe doesn't! He appears to be held
	up by thin air as he lands on his hands and knees.

	INDY looks around and down and now he figures it out.

	Ingeniously, the First Crusaders have painted a pathway to align with the rocks
	100 feet below. It is a perfect forced perspective image of the rocks below with
	lines from a hundred feet continuing six feet below his sight line where his feet
	are stepping.

	It's painted to blend in with the rocks below. Highly evolved camouflage... in
	perfect alignment with everything we see below.

	When INDY leans out to the left or right... that's when he sees the perfect
	alignment shift that betrays the trick. Indy throws some dirt on the bridge and
	he crosses it like the first Crusader from the painting over Henry's desk.

	Indy crawls through a small opening in the side of the cliff and enters a Temple.

	A vast array of chalices is displayed on the altar of this small Temple. Perhaps a
	hundred or more. Many sizes, many shapes, some gold, some silver, but they all
	glitter and shine.

	INDY is mesmerized by their number and their beauty. And then he realizes that
	a man is praying at the altarl

	He has his back turned to INDY... but he is dressed as what he is! A GRAIL
	KNIGHT.


	CLOSE ON THE GRAIL KNIGHT

	But we can't see the Grail Knight's face. The visor of his helmet is down.
	Perhaps we see his eyes.



CONTINUED:

	When the GRAIL KNIGHT sees INDY he gets wearily to his feet and, surprisingly,
	prepares to give combat...taking up his two-handed broadsword...he comes at
	Indy, attempting to swing the huge, heavy sword but finding the effort almost too
	much. Indy dodges two or three clumsy swings of the sword, making no attempt
	to fight back...until the Knight, exhausted, drops the sword and collapses. Indy
	approaches him and raises the visor and we see that the Knight is a very ancient
	man.

		               KNIGHT
		I knew you'd come, but my strength
		has left me.

		               INDY
		Who are you?

		               KNIGHT
		The last of three brothers who
		swore an oath to find the Grail
		and to guard it.

		               INDY
		That was seven hundred years ago.

		               KNIGHT
		A long time to wait.

	The GRAIL KNIGHT reaches forward and fingers Indy's clothing.

		               KNIGHT
		You're strangely dressed...for a
		knight.

		               INDY
		I'm not exactly...a knight. What
		do you mean?

		               KNIGHT
		I was chosen because I was the
		bravest and the most worthy. The
		honor was mine until another came
		to challenge me to single combat.
		I pass it to you who vanquished me.

	The GRAIL KNIGHT holds his sword out to INDY.

			INDY
		      (gulp)
		Listen, I don't have time to
		explain, but

	At that moment DONOVAN and ELSA appear. Donovan turns to face the display
	of cups.

		               DONOVAN
		Which one is it?



CONTINUED: (2)

		               KNIGHT
		You must choose.
		     (beat)
		But choose wisely. For as the
		True Grail will bring you life
		the False Grail will take it from
		you.

		               DONOVAN
		I'm not a historian. I have no
		idea what it looks like. Which
		one is it?

		               ELSA
		Let me choose.

		               DONOVAN
		Thank you, Doctor.

	ELSA and INDY exchange looks. He thinks he is seeing her in her true colors.

	ELSA chooses a cupa solid gold, emerald encrusted goblet.

	DONOVAN instantly takes it from her.

		               DONOVAN
		Oh, yes. It's more beautiful than
		I'd ever imagined. This certainly
		is the cup of the King of Kings.

	DONOVAN rushes to the well and fills the goblet with water.

			DONOVAN
		Eternal life!

	DONOVAN drinks from the goblet.

	Then, DONOVAN'S entire body starts to convulse. His face contorts in agony. He
	grabs his stomach and turns toward ELSA.

		               DONOVAN
		What . . . is . . . happening. . . to . . .
		me. . .?

	He starts to agefast! His hair grows long and gray and brittle. His face sinks.
	Fingernails curl back on themselves. Milky cataracts coat his eyes.

	ELSA gasps and screams.

	                                     DONOVAN
		What. . . is . . . happening. . . ?

	His skin turns brown and leathery and stretches across his bones until it splits.
	His skeletal hands reach for ELSA's throat, choking her.



CONTINUED: (3)

	INDY rushes forward and pushes DONOVAN away. As he falls he BODY BREAKS
	INTO FLAMES, then SHATTERS AGAINST THE WALL.

			KNIGHT
		He chose...poorly.

	INDY studies the array of chalices.


	                                     ELSA
		It would not be made out of gold.

	INDY picks up another cupa simple earthenware jug.

	                                     INDY
		That's the cup of a carpenter.

	He and ELSA exchange a look.

	                                     INDY
		There's only one way to find out.

	INDY goes to the well and fills the earthenware jug with water, then pauses.
	INDY brings the jug to his lips and takes several large swallows.

	A strange sensation overcomes him, a feeling of peace and contentment...and we
	see his wounds begin to heal.

	                                    KNIGHT
	            You have chosen wisely. But the
	            Grail cannot pass beyond the
	            Great Seal. That is the boundary
	            and the price of immortality.


	CUT TO BRODY AND SALLAH who attend to Henry awaiting Indy's return.

	INDY and ELSA come forward with the Grail.

	The TWO NAZI SOLDIERS are over-awed by the possessors of the Grail. They put
	down their guns and kneel.

	INDY kneels by HENRY's side and tilts his head forward and holds the Grail to
	his lips.

	HENRY is too weak to even open his eyes.

	HENRY swallows some of the water. Much of it runs down the corners of his
	mouth. Finally INDY pours the water over the wound and everyone watches in
	astonishment as the wound and the blood stain disappear before their eyes. The
	color returns to Henry's face.

	HENRY's eyes open. The first thing he sees is the Grail and they light up. Then
	they shift to INDY's faceand they light up even more...

	NAZI SOLDIERS

	run forward. SALLAH points a rifle at them.

	                                     SALLAH
		Drop your guns. Please.

	The NAZI SOLDIERS drop their weapons at their feet and raise their arms in
	surrender.

	                                      INDY
		     (to HENRY)
		Dad, come on. Get to your feet.

	ELSA

	steps forward and picks up the Grail. She turns to INDY, her face alight with
	possession of the Grail.

			ELSA
		We have got it. Come on.

	ELSA steps onto the edge of the Great Seal.

			INDY
		Elsa! Elsa, don't movel

	                                      ELSA
		It's ours, Indy. Yours and mine.

	                                      INDY
		Elsa, don't cross the Seal. The
		Knight warned us not to take the
		Grail from here.

	A RUMBLING SOUND IS HEARD and the ground roars and shifts. Dirt falls from
	the ceiling of the cavern. ELSA falls on the Great Seal. The Grail bounces away
	from her grasp. She reaches for it and the ground beneath her begins to SPLIT
	OPEN. ELSA slips into the crevasse. She screams.

	ELSA is hanging perilously in the abyss, with the Grail almost within her reach.
	As her hands lose their grip, INDY just manages to one of them, he himself
	sliding forward across the slanted floor.

	                                     HENRY
		Junior!  Junior!

	With her free hand, ELSA is trying to get the Grail. INDY can't save her unless
	she gives him her free hand. She has to choose.

			INDY
		Elsa. Elsa don't. Elsa. Elsa.
		Give me your other hand,
		honey. I can't hold you.



CONTINUED:

			ELSA
		I can reach it. I can reach it...

	Her hand begins to slip from Indy's grasp.

		                INDY
		Elsa! Give me your hand. Give
		me your other hand!

	ELSA just manages to touch the Grail. In doing so, she has tipped the balance too
	farINDY slides down another yard, Elsa loses her grip and falls screaming to
	her death.

			INDY
		     (horrified)
		Elsa!!

	Now the ledge INDY lies upon begins to break apart. HENRY grabs one of his
	hands as Indy struggles to reach the Grail with the other.

			HENRY
		Junior, give me your other hand!
		I can't hold on!!

		                INDY
		I can get itI can almost
		reach it, Dad.

	INDY looks down into the black bottomless pit beneath him from which nothing
	can ever be retrieved.

			HENRY
		Indiana. Indiana!!

	INDY snaps his look up to his father. His father has never called him this before.


			HENRY
		     (very calmly)
		... let it go...


	INDY abandons the Grail and grabs onto HENRY with both hands.
	HENRY pulls him up to safety.


	THE GRAIL KNIGHT

	looks through the falling debris to INDY and HENRY. SALLAH and BRODY rush
	from the crumbling Temple.

			INDY
		Dad. . .

	The GRAIL KNIGHT raises his arm to HENRY.


CONTINUED:


			INDY
		Please, Dad...

	INDY and HENRY down the passageway just as a huge stone column tumbles
	down upon the spot where they stood. The GRAIL KNIGHT lowers his arm as he
	watches them leave.


	EXT. ENTRANCE TO MOUNTAIN TEMPLE - AFTERNOON

	INDY, HENRY, SALLAH and BRODY emerge from the Mountain Temple through
	the Grecian Facade.

	From within the Mountain Temple, the ROAR OF WALLS CAVING IN IS HEARD. A
	cloud of dust and smoke billows out from the entrance.

	HENRY turns to INDY.

			HENRY
		Elsa never really believed in the
		Grail. She thought she'd found a
		prize.

			INDY
		What did vou find, Dad?

			HENRY
		Me?... Illumination.

	HENRY and INDY mount their horses. Henry turns back to his son.

			HENRY
		What did you find, Junior?

			INDY
		Junior?! Dad...


			SALLAH
		Please...What does it always
		mean, this...this "Junior?"

			HENRY
		That's his name. Henry Jones,
		Junior.

			INDY
		I like Indiana.

			HENRY
		We named the dog Indiana.

			BRODY
		May we go home now, please?



CONTINUED:


			SALLAH
		        (to INDY)
		The dog!?
		        (laughs)
		You are named after the dog...

			INDY
		        (embarrassed)
		I've got a lot of fond memories
		of that dog.

	A moment passes as they all ready their mounts and SALLAH continues to laugh
	at INDY.

		               INDY
		Ready?

		               HENRY
		Ready.

		               BRODY
		Indy! Henryl Follow met I know
		the way!
		        (to his horse)
		Haaa!

			HENRY
		        (to INDY)
		Got lost in his own museum, huh?

			INDY
		Uh-huh.


		               HENRY
		After you, Junior.

			INDY
		Yes, sir!
		   (to his horse)
		Haaa!		


	EXT. THE SECRET CANYON - AFTERNOON

	They THUNDER through the canyonwhose towering walls threaten to collapse
	upon them.


	EXT. ENTRANCE TO CANYON - SUNSET

               FADE IN:

               EXT. PERU - HIGH JUNGLE - DAY

               The dense, lush rain forests of the eastern slopes of the 
               Andes, the place known as "The Eyebrow of the Jungle". Ragged, 
               jutting canyon walls are half-hidden by the thick mists.

               The MAIN TITLE is followed by this:

                                           PERU
                                           1936

               A narrow trail across the green face of the canyon. A group 
               of men make their way along it. At the head of the party is 
               an American, INDIANA JONES. He wears a short leather jacket, 
               a flapped holster, and a brimmed felt hat with a weird feather 
               stuck in the band. Behind him come two Spanish Peruvians, 
               SATIPO and BARRANCA. Bringing up the rear are five Yagua 
               INDIANS. They act as porters and are wrangling the two heavily-
               packed llamas. The Indians become increasingly nervous. They 
               speak to each other in bursts of Quechua. The American, who 
               is known to his friends as Indy, glances back at them.

                                     BARRANCA
                              (irritated)
                         They're talking about the Curse again!

               He turns and yells at the Indians in Quechua, his anger giving 
               an indication of his own fears. The party reaches a break in 
               the canyon wall and takes the trail through it.

               When they emerge, their destination is revealed to them in 
               the distance. Beyond a thick stand of trees is the vegetation-
               enshrouded TEMPLE OF THE CHACHAPOYAN WARRIORS.

               The entire party is struck by the sight. The Indians, 
               terrified now, chatter away. Suddenly the three at the back 
               turn and run, dropping their packs as they go. Barranca yells 
               at the fleeing Indians and pulls his pistol out. He starts 
               to raise his arm to aim but Indy restrains it in a muscular 
               grip.

                                     INDY
                         No.

               Barranca looks evilly at Indy's hand upon him. Indy releases 
               him and smiles in a friendly way.

                                     INDY
                         We don't need them.

               Satipo watches this confrontation with some concern.

                                     BARRANCA
                         I do not carry supplies.

                                     INDY
                         We'll leave them. Once we've got it, 
                         we'll be able to reach the plane by 
                         dusk.

               He turns back to the trail. Satipo gets the two remaining 
               Indians moving behind Indy. Satipo and Barranca then have a 
               fast, silent communication: Barranca indicates his desire to 
               slit Indy's throat; Satipo gives him a look that says "Be 
               patient, you idiot".

               THE APPROACH TO THE TEMPLE

               The party fans out to fight their way through the entwined 
               trees that guard the temple. Visibility is cut to five feet 
               in the heavy mist. Satipo extracts a short, native dart from 
               a tree and examines the point gingerly

                                     SATIPO
                              (showing Indy)
                         The Hovitos are near. The poison is 
                         still fresh... three days. They're 
                         following us, I tell you.

                                     INDY
                         If they knew we were here, they would 
                         have killed us already.

               The two Indiana jabber in Quechua, near hysteria. Barranca 
               is sweating profusely, eyes darting. He yells at the Indians 
               in Quechua to "shut up".

               In the undergrowth, there is slithering movement.

               Indian #1 draws aside a branch and is faced with a horrific 
               stone sculpture of a Chachapoyan demon. The Indian is so 
               frightened no sound comes out when he screams. He turns and 
               runs silently away.

               Indian #2 calls to his friend. Getting no response, he steps 
               in that direction. A huge macaw, flushed from the undergrowth, 
               screams and flies away. Indian #2 does exactly the same thing, 
               never to be seen again.

               Indy, Satipo and Barranca, just clearing the trees, look 
               back in that direction. They all turn to face the Temple.

               It is dark and awesome. Vegetation curls from every crevice, 
               over each elaborate frieze. The entrance - round, open and 
               black - has been designed to look like open jaws.

                                     INDY
                         So this is where Forrestal cashed 
                         in.

                                     SATIPO
                         A friend of yours?

                                     INDY
                         Competitor. He was good, very good.

                                     BARRANCA
                              (nervous)
                         No one has ever come out of there 
                         alive. Why should we put our faith 
                         in you?

               Indy takes the weird feather from the band of his hat. From 
               around its point, he slips a tightly rolled piece of 
               parchment. Barranca and Satipo exchange a quick "So that's 
               where is was!" look. They all kneel as Indy spreads out the 
               parchment. On it is one-half of a crude floorplan of the 
               Temple.

                                     INDY
                         No one ever had what we have... 
                         partners.

               Indy fixes them with an expectant stare. Satipo produces a 
               similar, but folded, piece of parchment. He lays it - the 
               other half of the floorplan - next to Indy's. They all regard 
               it for a moment, then Indy stands and walks toward the Temple. 
               Barranca's eyes are shining as they dart between the floorplan 
               and Satipo.

                                     INDY
                              (back turned)
                         Assuming that pillar there marks the 
                         corner and...

               Barranca is suddenly on his feet, quietly drawing his pistol. 
               He raises it toward Indy as Satipo realizes with alarm what 
               he's doing. Too late. Indy's head turns and he sees Barranca.

               Indy's next move is amazing, graceful and fast, yet totally 
               unhurried. His right hand slides up under the back of his 
               leather jacket and emerges grasping the handle of a neatly 
               curled bullwhip. With the same fluid move that brings Indy's 
               body around to face the Peruvian, the whip uncoils to its 
               full ten foot length and flashes out.

               The fall of the whip (the unplaited strip at the end of the 
               lash) wraps itself around Barranca's hand and pistol. He 
               could not drop the gun now if he tried.

               Indy gives the whip a short pull and Barranca's arm in jerked 
               down, where it involuntarily discharges the gun into the 
               dirt. Barranca is amazed, but feels some slack in the whip 
               and immediately raises the gun toward Indy again, cocking it 
               with his free hand.

               Indy's face goes hard. And sad.

               Indy sweeps his arm in a wide arc. Barranca spins around, 
               enclosed in the whip, his gun hand stuck tight against his 
               body. Indy gives one more short jerk on the whip handle and 
               Barranca's gun fires. Barranca falls dead.

               Indy looks quickly at Satipo, who is shocked and frightened. 
               He raises his arms in supplication.

                                     SATIPO
                         I knew nothing! He was crazy! Please!

               Indy looks him over, then nods. He frees the whip from 
               Barranca's body and picks up the man. His eyes sweep the 
               surrounding woods.

                                     INDY
                         Let's go.

               INT. TEMPLE - INCLINED PASSAGE - DAY

               Indy and Satipo, carrying a torch, walk up the slightly 
               inclined, tubular passage from the main entrance. The interior 
               is wet and dark, hanging with plant life and stalactites. 
               Their echoing footsteps intermittently overpower the sounds 
               of loud dripping, whistling air drafts and scampering claws.

               HALL OF SHADOWS

               Indy leads the way down a twisting hallway, Satipo's torch 
               barely lighting his way from behind. Indy disappears in a 
               shadow and when he reappears a moment later a huge black 
               tarantula is crawling up the back of his jacket. Indy doesn't 
               notice and disappears into another shadow, emerging with two 
               more tarantulas on his back.

               Satipo sees them and makes a frightened grunting sound. Indy 
               looks at him, sees what he's pointing at and casually brushes 
               all three spiders off with his rolled whip, as he would a 
               fly. Satipo pirouettes for an inspection and Indy flicks one 
               off the Peruvian's back.

               Indy begins picking up little pocket-sized artifacts from 
               the niches and ledges of the Temple. He continues to do this 
               as the men penetrate the Temple. His collecting is quick and 
               expert, evaluating the pieces in an instant, discarding some, 
               stuffing others into his clothes, and never stopping his 
               forward progress.

               CHAMBER OF LIGHT

               The men reach an arch in the hall. The small chamber ahead, 
               which interrupts the hall, is brightly lit by a shaft of 
               sunlight from high above. Indy stops, looks it over.

                                     SATIPO
                         What's wrong? Are you lost?

               Indy picks up a stick and throws it through the shaft of 
               light. Giant spikes spring together from the sides of the 
               chamber with a ferocious CLANG! And impaled on the spikes 
               are the remains of a white man, half-fleshed, half skeleton, 
               in explorer-type grab. Indy reaches out and takes hold of 
               the man's carcass. As the spikes slowly retract, Indy pulls 
               it free and seats the remains gently on the floor.

                                     INDY
                         Forrestal.

                                     SATIPO
                              (gulps)
                         We can go no further.

                                     INDY
                         Now, Satipo, we don't want to be 
                         discouraged by every little thing.

               Indy steps sideways into the chamber. His back pressed against 
               the very points of the retracted spikes, he moves along the 
               edge of the light beam, and steps clear on the other side. 
               Satipo grimaces and begins sweating his way through.

               STAIRWAY

               Indy and Satipo come down stone stairs to a tight landing. 
               Framing the entry are a carefully strung network of dead 
               vines, each somehow hooked into the wall, narrowing the 
               opening even more.

                                     INDY
                              (taking torch)
                         Let me see that.

               He lowers the torch to the floor of the landing. The landing 
               is carpeted with human skeletons, one on top of another, all 
               squashed flat as cardboard. Satipo gasps. Indy looks up at 
               the ceiling of the landing, then steps onto skeletons, which 
               make a cracking noise under his feet.

                                     INDY
                         Try not to touch the vines.

               FOYER OF THE SANCTUARY

               The men are in a high, straight hallway 50 feet long.

               The door at the end is flooded with sunlight.

                                     SATIPO
                         Señor, I think we are very close.

               Indy stands still looking at the hall.

                                     SATIPO
                              (impatient)
                         Let us hurry. There is nothing to 
                         fear here.

                                     INDY
                         That's what scares me.

               They begin walking down the hall side by side. Satipo has 
               inched a little ahead. Suddenly his lead foot comes down and 
               through the floor! As Satipo begins to pitch forward, Indy 
               grabs him by the belt and pulls him back. They both look 
               down at the "floor".

               Indy swings his whip across the floor. Fifteen feet of it 
               cuts open beneath the lash, falling away to reveal black pit 
               as wide as the hall. The illusory floor was made of dust-
               covered cobwebs. Satipo picks up a stone and drops it down 
               the pit. No sound. The two men exchange glances. Indy looks 
               up at the high roof of the hall. He swings the whip up around 
               a support beam, tests its strength with a pull and swings 
               over the pit on the whip. From the other side he swings the 
               whip back to Satipo, who throws Indy the torch. Satipo swings 
               across. When they are both standing on solid floor there is 
               a moment of quiet in which they hear, from far, far below - 
               SPLASH! Indy wedges the whip handle into the wall and leaves 
               it strung to the beam for quick retreat.

               THE SANCTUARY

               A large, domed room. Ten evenly-spaced skylights send their 
               shafts of sunlight down to a unique tiled floor: white and 
               black tiles laid out in a lovely, intricate pattern. Indy 
               and Satipo stand at the door and look across the wide room 
               at the altar. There, in the supreme hallowed spot, is a tiny 
               jeweled figurine, Indy's real objective.

               Two torches, many years old, are in holders by the door. 
               Indy takes one down and lights it. He gives the regular torch 
               to Satipo.

                                     SATIPO
                         There's plenty of light, amigo.

               Indy kneels and uses the unlit end of the torch to reach out 
               and tap a white tile. It is solid. He taps a black tile. 
               There is a whizzing sound and a tiny dark sticks in the torch. 
               Satipo points to the wall nearby: there is a recessed hole 
               there.

                                     SATIPO
                         From that hole!

               Indy nods, stands and looks around the sanctuary. The entire 
               room is honey-comed with the same kind of hole. Satipo sees 
               it too and is properly impressed.

                                     INDY
                         You wait here.

                                     SATIPO
                         If you insist, señor.

               Torch in hand, Indy begins his careful walk across the 
               sanctuary. Stepping only on the white tiles, he almost appears 
               to be doing a martial arts kata. Before each big move he 
               waves the torch in front of him head to toe, looking at the 
               flame. Halfway out, he sees something on the floor and kneels 
               to look at it.

               A dead bird lies on one of the white tiles. Its body is 
               riddled with little deadly darts. This has great significance 
               to Indy and he stands with even greater caution. He waves 
               the torch ahead of him and at waist height an air current 
               whips at the flame. Indy ducks under it and leaves a burn 
               mark on the white tile beneath it.

               Satipo watches, wide-eyed and mystified.

               Indy reaches the altar. The tiny idol looks both fierce and 
               beautiful. It rests on a pedestal of polished stone. Indy 
               looks the whole set-up over very carefully. From his jacket 
               he takes a small, canvas drawstring bad. He begins filling 
               it with dirt from around the case of the altar. When he has 
               created a weight that he thinks approximates the weight of 
               the idol, he bounces it a couple times in his palm 
               concentrating. It's clear he wants to replace the idol with 
               the bag as smoothly as possible. His hand seems ready to do 
               that once, when he stops, takes a breath and loosens his 
               shoulder muscles. Now he sets himself again. And makes the 
               switch! The idol is now in his hand, the bag on the pedestal. 
               For a long moment it sits there, then the polished stone 
               beneath the bag drops five inches. This sets off an AURAL 
               CHAIN REACTION of steadily increasing volume as some huge 
               mysterious mechanism rumbles into action deep in the temple.

               Indy spins and starts his kata back across the sanctuary at 
               four times the speed.

               Satipo's eyes widen in terror. He turns and runs.

               THE RETREAT - INTERCUTTING INDY AND SATIPO

               The sanctuary has begun to rumble and shake in response to 
               the mysterious mechanism. Just as Indy goes out the door, a 
               rock shakes loose from the wall and rolls onto the tiles 
               floor. Immediately, a noisy torrent of poison darts fills 
               the room.

               IN THE FOYER

               Satipo swings across the pit. He makes it just as the whip 
               comes undone from the beam, leaving Indy without an escape. 
               Satipo, extremely nervous, regards the whip a moment then 
               turns back to face Indy, who has run up to the far side of 
               the pit.

                                     SATIPO
                         No time to argue. Throw me the idol, 
                         I throw you the whip.

               Indy hesitates, eyeing the rumbling walls.

                                     SATIPO
                         You have no choice! Hurry!

               Indy concurs with that assessment. He tosses the idol across 
               the pit to Satipo. Satipo stuffs it in the front pocket of 
               his jacket, gives Indy a look, then drops the whip on the 
               floor and runs.

                                     SATIPO
                         Adios, amigo!

               Indy grimaces. He had a feeling this might happen. He looks 
               around.

               AT THE VINED LANDING

               Satipo flies through like a chubby ballet dancer and takes 
               the steps five at a time.

               IN THE FOYER

               Indy runs in full stride to the edge of the pit and broad 
               jumps into space. He doesn't make it. His body hits the far 
               side of the pit and he begins to slide out of view. Only 
               wild clawing with his fingers at the edge of the pit stops 
               his descent. With just the tips of his fingers over the edge, 
               he begins pulling himself up.

               AT THE CHAMBER OF LIGHT

               Satipo has slowed down. He begins to edge carefully around 
               the light shaft.

               AT THE VINED LANDING

               Indy sails through sideways and rolls to a stop at the bottom 
               of the steps. His whip is grasped in his hand. As he raises 
               himself, he hears, from above the giant spikes of the Chamber 
               of Light CLANG! and an abrupt, sickening rendition of SATIPO'S 
               LAST SCREAM. Indy runs up the steps. The rumbling sound grows 
               louder.

               AT THE CHAMBER OF LIGHT

               Indy slides to a stop. The spikes have retracted, taking 
               Satipo's body to one side. Indy edges into the chamber with 
               his back to the shaft of light. Soon he is face to face with 
               the dead Satipo; spikes protrude from several vital spots in 
               the Peruvian's body. Indy removes the idol from Satipo's 
               pocket and moves quickly out the other side.

                                     INDY
                         Adios.

               THE INCLINED PASSAGE

               Indy shoots out of a cut-off hallway and turns toward the 
               exit. The rumbling is very loud and now we see why: right 
               behind Indy a huge boulder comes roaring around a corner of 
               the passage, perfectly form-fitted to the passageway. It 
               obliterates everything before it, sending the stalactites 
               shooting ahead like missiles. Indy dashes for the light of 
               the exit. His hat flies off his head. Almost immediately it 
               is crushed by the boulder. Indy dives out the end of the 
               passage as the boulder slams to a perfect fit at the entrance, 
               sealing the Temple.

               EXT. FRONT OF THE TEMPLE - DAY

               Indy lies on the ground, gasping for air. A shadow falls 
               across him and he looks up.

               WHAT HE SEES

               Looming above him are three figures. Two are HOVITOS WARRIORS 
               in full battle paint and loin cloths. They carry long blow 
               guns. But the man in the center draws Indy's attention. He 
               is a tall, impressive white man, dressed in full safari outfit 
               including pith helmet. His name is EMILE BELLOQ. His face is 
               thin, powerful; his eyes hypnotic; his smile charming, yet 
               lethal. His heavily French-accented speech is deep, 
               mellifluous, wonderful. Back beyond Belloq and his two 
               escorts, thirty more Hovitos Warriors hover at the edge of 
               the trees.

                                     BELLOQ
                         Dr. Jones, you choose the wrong 
                         friends. This time it will cost you.

               Belloq extends his hand. Indy looks at it, then produces the 
               idol and hands it to Belloq. Belloq extends his other hand, 
               smiling. Indy hands over his gun. Belloq sticks it in his 
               jacket.

                                     BELLOQ
                         And you thought I'd given up.

                                     INDY
                              (eyeing the Hovitos)
                         Too bad they don't know you like I 
                         do, Belloq.

                                     BELLOQ
                              (smiles)
                         Yes, too bad. You could warn them... 
                         if only you spoke Hovitos.

               With that, Belloq turns dramatically and holds the idol high 
               for all the Hovitos to see and says something in Hovitos. 
               There is a murmur of recognition and all the Indians, 
               including Belloq's escorts, prostrate themselves upon the 
               ground, heads down.

               Indy is immediately up and running toward the edge of the 
               clearing.

                                     BELLOQ
                              (in Hovitos)
                         Kill him!

               AT THE EDGE OF THE CLEARING

               Indy disappears into the foliage. An instant later, the leaves 
               are peppered with a rain of poison darts and spears.

               EXT. THE JUNGLE - INDY'S RUN - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY

               Indy runs like hell through steadily falling terrain. And 
               always close behind, a swift gang of angry Hovitos. 
               Occasionally they get close enough to send a dart or spear 
               whizzing past Indy's head.

               EXT. THE URUBAMBA RIVER - DUSK

               An amphibian plane sits in the water beneath a green cliff. 
               Sitting on the wing is JOCK, the British pilot. Indy breaks 
               out of some distant brush and runs along the path at the top 
               of the cliff.

                                     INDY
                              (yelling)
                         Get it going! Get it going!

               Jock hops in and fires up the plane's engines. Indy reaches 
               a spot on the cliff above the place, glances back, them jumps 
               into the river. He comes up, swims to the plane and grabs a 
               strut.

                                     INDY
                         GO!

               Jock starts the plane moving across the water as Indy walks 
               across the wing and falls into the passenger compartment.

               INT. JOCK'S PLANE - DUSK

               Indy relaxes and lies across the seat, a big smile on his 
               face. One hand drops to the floor of the cabin and Indy jumps, 
               hitting his head. On the floor of the cabin is a huge boa 
               constrictor. Indy tries to get his whole body onto the seat. 
               Jock sees what's happening.

                                     JOCK
                         Don't mind him. That's Reggie. 
                         Wouldn't hurt a soul.

                                     INDY
                         I can't stand snakes.

                                     JOCK
                         The world's full of them, you know.

                                     INDY
                         I hate them.

                                     JOCK
                         Come on now, Sport, show a little of 
                         the old backbone.

               EXT. JOCK'S PLANE - TWILIGHT

               It soars off over the dark jungle.

               INT. INDY'S OFFICE, SMALL EASTERN COLLEGE - DAY

               It's autumn and the pretty, New England campus out Indy's 
               window reflects it in dazzling color. A few weeks before the 
               start of classes. Activity just picking up. Some students 
               about.

               Indy is at a bookcase near the window and he looks quite 
               different in this setting. His outfit is tweedy, slightly 
               rumpled in the professional style. Part of his attention is 
               focused in a book and he wears glasses to see the fine print. 
               The office is cramped, absolutely inundated with books, maps, 
               etchings and archeological artifacts. In fact, the only neat 
               spot in the room right now is Indy's desk, which has been 
               cleared off expressly for the benefit of -

               MARCUS BRODY

               The Curator of the National Museum in Washington, D.C. Brody 
               is examining the small artifacts Indy pocketed on his way 
               into the Peruvian Temple. He occasionally uses a jeweler's 
               eyepiece to get a closer look. But he is distracted, his 
               concerns elsewhere, and it is this that his old friend Indy 
               senses from across the room.

                                     BRODY
                         Do you think the idol will ever show 
                         up?

                                     INDY
                         I don't know. Just because Belloq 
                         had it doesn't mean he kept it.

               Indy snaps the book closed and puts it on the shelf. He takes 
               his glasses off and focuses on Brody. At the windowed door 
               to his office, two pretty Coeds pause for a moment, look in 
               at their sexy Archeology professor, giggle and disappear.

                                     INDY
                         Getting it away from those Indians 
                         would be a neat trick
                              (a hard look)
                         I hope they got him.

               A young male graduate student, Indy's TEACHING ASSISTANT, 
               taps on the door and then pushes his way in with an armload 
               of reference books. Indy helps him find a spot for them.

                                     TEACHING ASSISTANT
                         I couldn't get the McNabe, Professor. 
                         Someone's got it checked out 'til 
                         next month when classes start.

                                     INDY
                         That's all right, Phil. Thanks a 
                         lot.

                                     TEACHING ASSISTANT
                              (eager to please)
                         Will there be anything else?

                                     INDY
                         No. I'll see you Thursday.

               The Teaching Assistant leaves. Brody is scowling as he 
               examines the last of the artifacts.

                                     INDY
                         Hey, if you don't like them, I can 
                         always return them.

                                     BRODY
                         No, they're beautiful. The Museum 
                         will buy them as usual. No questions 
                         asked.

                                     INDY
                         Then what's wrong?

                                     BRODY
                         I brought along some people today.

                                     INDY
                         What kind of people?

                                     BRODY
                         Government.

                                     INDY
                              (concerned)
                         Government?

                                     BRODY
                         Don't worry, it's not about your 
                         business.
                              (indicates the 
                              artifacts)
                         They're from the Army.

                                     INDY
                         I've already served.

                                     BRODY
                         Army Intelligence. They're looking 
                         for Abner.

               INT. INDY'S LECTURE HALL / CLASSROOM - DAY

               Indy's course - a combination of archeology and anthropology - 
               is taught in this amphitheater-type lecture hall. His desk 
               and lectern hold large reference books; blackboards line the 
               wall. Bones, maps, charts festoon the walls.

               Indy leans against his desk talking with Brody and two 
               uniformed Army officers, COLONEL MUSGROVE and MAJOR EATON, 
               who are situated around the first seats in the classroom.

                                     MUSGROVE
                         But you did study under Professor 
                         Ravenwood at the University of 
                         Chicago?

                                     INDY
                              (nods)
                         We haven't spoken in ten years. I'm 
                         afraid we had a bit of a falling 
                         out.

                                     EATON
                         You know nothing of his whereabouts?

                                     INDY
                              (negative)
                         Just rumors. Somewhere in Asia, last 
                         I heard.

               Musgrove and Eaton exchange a look; they're disappointed.

                                     EATON
                              (to Musgrove)
                         Maybe Dr. Jones can make sense of 
                         it.

               Again the military men have a silent communication, deciding 
               what to reveal.

                                     MUSGROVE
                         Well... you must understand, Dr. 
                         Jones, this is all strictly 
                         confidential.

                                     INDY
                         I understand.

                                     MUSGROVE
                         Yesterday, one of our European 
                         sections intercepted a Nazi communiqué 
                         from Cairo to Berlin. We don't quite 
                         know what to make of it.

               Musgrove takes a sheet from his briefcase.

                                     MUSGROVE
                         Here it is - "Tanis development 
                         proceeding. Acquire headpiece, Staff 
                         of Ra, General Tengtu Hok, Shanghai. 
                         Locate Abner Ravenwood, U.S."

               Brody is excited. He looks at Indy.

                                     BRODY
                         Tanis. They must have discovered the 
                         lost ruins.

               Indy contemplates this big news; he's impressed.

                                     INDY
                              (to himself)
                         Tanis. Ain't that somethin'!

                                     EATON
                         Frankly, we're a little suspicious... 
                         An American being mentioned so 
                         prominently in a secret Nazi cable.

                                     INDY
                         Ah, Ravenwood's no Nazi.

                                     EATON
                         Then what do they want him for?

                                     INDY
                         They're looking for the headpiece to 
                         the Staff of Ra.

                                     MUSGROVE
                              (indicates his sheet)
                         But it says here that's in China.

                                     INDY
                         Only half of it. Ravenwood had the 
                         other half.

                                     EATON
                         What would the Nazis want with this - 
                         this Staff of Ra?

                                     BRODY
                         I can tell you that. Over the last 
                         two years the Nazis have had teams 
                         of archeologists running around the 
                         world looking for all kinds of 
                         religious artifacts.

                                     MUSGROVE
                         That's right. Hitler's a nut on the 
                         subject. Crazy. He's obsessed with 
                         the occult.

                                     EATON
                         What is this Staff of Ra, anyway?

                                     INDY
                         It all has to do with the Ark of the 
                         Covenant.
                              (the Army guys look 
                              mystified)
                         The chest the Hebrews used to carry 
                         around the Ten Commandments.

               Now it's the Army men who are impressed.

                                     INDY
                         An Egyptian pharaoh stole the Ark 
                         from Jerusalem and took it back to 
                         the city of Tanis. A short time later, 
                         Tanis was consumed by the desert in 
                         a sandstorm that lasted a year. But 
                         before that, the Pharaoh had had the 
                         Ark hidden away in a secret chamber 
                         called the Well of the Souls. Which 
                         is where the Staff of Ra comes in.

               Indy moves to the blackboard and makes a quick sketch to 
               give a rough idea of the system as he describes it. (and we 
               get a glimpse of what an interesting and enthusiastic teacher 
               he must be).

                                     INDY
                         Now this was rather clever. The Staff 
                         was really just a big stick - oh, I 
                         don't know, say like this -
                              (he indicates about 
                              six feet)
                         no one really knows for sure. Any 
                         way, it was capped by an elaborate 
                         headpiece with a carving of the sun 
                         at the top. What you had to do was 
                         take the Staff to a special map room 
                         in Tanis - it had the whole city 
                         laid out in miniature on the floor. 
                         When you placed the Staff in a certain 
                         spot in this room, at a certain time 
                         of day, the sun would shine through 
                         a hole here in the headpiece and 
                         then send a beam of light down here - 
                         to the map - giving you the location 
                         of the Well of the Souls...

                                     MUSGROVE
                         ...where the Ark of the Covenant was 
                         kept.

                                     INDY
                              (nods)
                         Which is probably what the Nazis are 
                         after.

                                     EATON
                         What's this Ark look like?

                                     INDY
                         Look like? Why, it's right here...

               Indy pulls a big format book from the stack on his lectern 
               and flips through the pages until he finds a large color 
               print. The other men gather to look.

               THE PRINT

               Fills the screen.

               It shows a Biblical battle. The Israelite Army is vanquishing 
               an opposition force. At the forefront of the Israelite ranks, 
               two men carry the Ark of the Covenant, a beautiful gold chest, 
               crowned by two sculptured gold angels. The men do not touch 
               the Ark itself; rather they carry it by use of two long wooden 
               poles which pass through rings in the corners of the Ark. 
               The painting is very dramatic, full of smoke, tumult and 
               sinewy dying men. But the most astounding thing in the picture 
               is the brilliant jet of white light and flame issuing from 
               the wings of the angels. It pierces deep into the ranks of 
               the retreating enemy, wreaking devastation and terror.

                                     EATON
                         Good God!

                                     INDY
                         Yes. That's what the Hebrews thought.

                                     MUSGROVE
                         What's that supposed to be coming 
                         out of there?

                                     INDY
                         Who knows... lightning... fire... 
                         the power of God.

                                     EATON
                         I'm beginning to understand Hitler's 
                         interest in this thing.

                                     INDY
                         Oh yes. The Bible tells of it leveling 
                         mountains and wasting entire regions. 
                         Moses promised that when the Ark was 
                         with you, "your enemies will be 
                         scattered and your foes fell before 
                         you".
                              (pause)
                         An army which carries the Ark before 
                         it is invincible.

               Eaton and Musgrove exchange worried looks.

                                     INDY
                         Oh, there's one other thing that 
                         Hitler undoubtably believes about 
                         the Ark...
                              (a long pregnant pause)
                         It's said that the Lost Ark will be 
                         recovered at the time of the coming 
                         of the True Messiah.

                         Dr. Jones, you've been very helpful. 
                         I hope we can call on you again if 
                         we have questions.

                                     INDY
                         Most certainly.

               Brody and Indy exchange a look as they all shake and Brody 
               starts to leave with the Army men.

               EXT. FRONT DOOR, INDY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               Indy's English Tudor, upper middle class home. Quite toney; 
               well beyond the financial reach of an honest college 
               professor. Marcus Brody has already rung the bell. Indy opens 
               the door. He is dressed in a tuxedo.

                                     BRODY
                         I've got to talk to you.

                                     INDY
                         This isn't really a good time.

                                     BRODY
                         Indy, it's important.

                                     INDY
                         All right. Come on in.

               INT. FOYER, INDY'S HOUSE

               The lush tone continues here in Art Deco and shiny marble. 
               Indy motions Brody toward the study to one side.

                                     INDY
                         I'll be in a minute.

               As Brody passes the entrance to the expansive living room, 
               he spots a beautiful, silk-gowned Harlow-type lounging on 
               the sofa in front of a roaring fire. She is sipping champagne.

               INT. STUDY, INDY'S HOUSE

               Brody enters the book-lined, dark-wooded study. He paces for 
               a moment before the fire which is dying in the fireplace, 
               then spots something and goes over to Indy's big desk. The 
               surface is covered with open books, monographs, maps and 
               drawings - all about the Ark of the Covenant. Brody smiles; 
               he knows his friend very well. Indy comes in, closing the 
               door behind him. Brody turns to him with a triumphant 
               expression.

                                     BRODY
                         They want you to go for it. And 
                         they'll pay.

                                     INDY
                              (smiles)
                         Good work, Marcus. I had a feeling 
                         this would happen. And, of course, 
                         the Museum gets the Ark when we're 
                         done.

                                     BRODY
                              (smiles)
                         Of course.

               Indy's manner is vigorous, aggressive.

                                     INDY
                         Okay, here's the way it's gonna be. 
                         First, I'll high-tail it to Shanghai 
                         and get the piece from General Hok. 
                         Then I think I know where I can find 
                         Ravenwood. If only I can get -

                                     BRODY
                         General Hok's a tough customer. They 
                         don't call him the Wild Boar for 
                         nothing. And he's tied in with the 
                         Japanese.

                                     INDY
                         I'll worry about that when the time 
                         comes. My only hope is to find the 
                         Well of the Souls before the Nazis 
                         do.

                                                                   WIPE TO:

               EXT. IN THE AIR - DAY / NIGHT

               A Pan Am Clipper flies west over the Pacific.

                                                                   WIPE TO:

               INT. KEHOE'S CAR (SHANGHAI AIRPORT) - DAY

               Indy is barely into the front seat of a dilapidated Ford as 
               the driver, BUZZ KEHOE, is peeling out into traffic. In the 
               back seat is a Chinese named BANG CHOW. Kehoe zigs crazily 
               through traffic with only his left hand as he reaches over 
               to shake with Indy.

                                     KEHOE
                         Buzz Kehoe, Army Intelligence. You've 
                         met Bang Chow.

                                     INDY
                         What's the hurry?

                                     KEHOE
                         Some German agents got here two hours 
                         ago. Luckily, Bang was able to have 
                         them detained at Customs. We'll have 
                         to hurry.

               EXT. HOK'S STREET - DAY

               Kehoe's car emerges from an alley. Down the block is Tengtu 
               Hok's modest, walled palace. Kehoe's car slows a bit and 
               Bang steps from the moving car with a small black suitcase 
               in his hand. While he heads down the street toward Hok's 
               place, Kehoe's car continues across the street and into an 
               alley on the other side.

               EXT. HOK'S STREET - IN FRONT OF PALACE - DAY

               A Mercedes limousine appears round a corner and squeals to a 
               stop at the front gate of the palace, which is manned by a 
               sturdy Chinese Gateman. There are three Germans inside, one 
               the driver.

               EXT. ALLEY BEHIND HOK'S MUSEUM - DAY

               Kehoe, alone now, pushes a trash container casually into 
               position to hide a newly created hole in the rear wall of 
               Hok's Museum where several stone blocks have been removed. 
               He looks around and ambles back to the car.

               INT. HOK'S PALACE - ENTRY HALL

               The three Germans wait impatiently in a magnificent foyer. A 
               chime sounds and huge double doors open to reveal TENGTU 
               HOK, flanked by two uniformed Japanese Soldiers and a robed 
               Chinese Advisor. He wears a fantastic gold ornamental robe. 
               Despite the majesty, however, nothing can disguise the fact 
               that Hok is basically a wild, fat barbarian; an animal. Hok 
               and his escort group bow in what is the beginning of a long 
               welcoming ceremony. The Germans exchange impatient glances 
               but decide they should play it as it comes. They bow.

               INT. HOK'S MUSEUM

               No person in sight. Instead, we see a magnificent display of 
               ancient artifacts. Glass cases hold the velvet-couched pieces 
               at random spots on the shining marble floor. We hear an odd 
               sound. Near the floor on the rear wall of the museum, a steel 
               ventilation grate moves. A hand slides it gently across the 
               marble. Indy sticks his head out and looks around.

               INT. HOK'S PALACE - TEA ROOM

               The three Germans are being served tea and exotic delicacies. 
               A pleased Tengtu Hok watches from a throne-cushion. When the 
               tray of tiny delicacies is presented to him, he takes a 
               massive handful, crushing them together on their way to his 
               smiling mouth.

               INT. HOK'S MUSEUM

               A huge golden gong, seven feet in diameter, is suspended 
               from the ceiling by a hook. An enormous hammer hangs poised 
               above it, from which emanate myriad tiny threads which run 
               up and across the ceiling, then down to the various display 
               cases. Indy looks up at the gong, then continues his quick, 
               quiet foray among the cases. Beyond him, a high window.

               INT. HOK'S PALACE - TEA ROOM

               Hok and his visitors stand to go. The German's pleased 
               expressions make it clear they're finally on their way to 
               the museum.

               INT. HOK'S MUSEUM

               Indy arrives at his destination. The lovely, carved gold 
               section of the headpiece is nested on purple velvet in a 
               glass case. At the bottom of the piece is a round hollow 
               where the staff would fit. There is a grunting sound behind 
               Indy and he spins, already reaching for his revolver.

               A fierce Japanese Samurai is running at Indy full speed down 
               an aisle of display cases. His sword is raised over his 
               shoulder ready to cut Indy in half. He's six feet away when 
               Indy's gun levels and fires twice, blasting him backwards. 
               Indy is still looking over his gun when another samurai sword 
               comes down from the side and knocks the pistol brutally out 
               of Indy's grip; his hand avoids amputation by a quarter of 
               an inch.

               An amazed Indy backs away from the crossing aisle as the 
               Second Samurai steps in to face him, sword raised. Indy backs 
               away into an open space and his bullwhip appears in his hand. 
               He gives it one savage CRACK! to announce its arrival and 
               the Samurai slows down, eyeing it curiously. The Samurai 
               does not look unhappy about this confrontation. How pure it 
               is - The Sword versus The Whip.

               EXT. HOK'S PALACE - SECOND FLOOR WALKWAY - DAY

               Tengtu Hok and the Germans have obviously heard something. 
               They are hurrying along the walkway at the side of the 
               building, Hok in the lead. Up ahead is the foot bridge which 
               crosses from the palace to the museum entrance over a moat.

               EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF THE PALACE - DAY

               The Lovely Mercedes limousine blows up.

               EXT. HOK'S PALACE - SECOND FLOOR WALKWAY - DAY

               The Germans spin toward the blast. Drawing weapons, they run 
               back to investigate. Hok follows them, confused.

               INT. HOK'S MUSEUM

               Indy and the Samurai face each other. They're both breathing 
               hard from previous, no-contact passes at each other. Now 
               Indy begins swinging the whip over his head again. It whizzes 
               out toward the Samurai's face. The Samurai takes two lightning-
               quick cuts at the leather, but misses. Indy swings for the 
               Samurai's feet; the Japanese jumps nimbly, slashing at the 
               whip. Indy does it again. The Samurai hops it. Once more. 
               The Samurai is concentrating on hopping it.

               Indy sees it. The split second he wants. The whip flashes up 
               from the floor and wraps solidly and irrevocably around the 
               Samurai's neck. Indy gives it a murderous pull and the Samurai 
               is dead on his feet.

               EXT. HOK'S PALACE - SECOND FLOOR WALKWAY - DAY

               Hok and the three Germans are looking down at the flaming 
               remains of the Mercedes. A look of concern crosses Hok's 
               face. He turns and runs back toward his beloved museum.

               INT. HOK'S MUSEUM

               Indy is at the case containing the headpiece. He smashes the 
               glass with a samurai sword, reaches in and grabs the piece. 
               Immediately, behind him, the huge hammer falls and the sound 
               of the gong thunders through the museum.

               EXT. HOK'S PALACE - SECOND FLOOR WALKWAY - DAY

               At the sound of the gong, the running Hok skids to a halt 
               with a crazed expression on his face. He disappears for two 
               seconds in an alcove and emerges holding a big, black Thompson 
               Submachine Gun. He runs across the foot bridge and is just 
               barely over it when it blows up. Hok, safe, looks behind him 
               in amazement and then turns to the museum.

               INT. HOK'S MUSEUM

               The double doors at the entrance slam open to reveal Hok. 
               Indy is halfway along an unprotected wall back to his 
               ventilation entry route. Hok opens up on him, cutting off 
               his retreat. Indy jumps behind a marble column, which is 
               promptly blasted with machine gun fire.

               Indy looks above him, sees the giant disk of the gong. 
               Reaching up, pushing with tremendous effort, he maneuvers it 
               off the hook. It bounces down to the floor on its side, 
               chipping the marble with its monstrous weight. Indy steadies 
               it and then puts his whole body into rolling it across the 
               room toward the window. As it starts to roll, Indy slips 
               behind it and runs across the room with it.

               Hok can see the rolling gong. He opens up on it. The vicious 
               cacophony of machine gun fire is joined by the musical reports 
               of bullets hitting the gong and ricocheting away. Very, very 
               noisy.

               Behind the gong, Indy gauges his move. As the gong is about 
               to be stopped by a marble bench, Indy talks a long stride 
               onto the bench and dives through the glass of the high window. 
               Hok's bullets hit the wall.

               EXT. ROOF - DAY

               Indy lands in a shower of glass on the jutting roof of the 
               museum's first floor. He rolls to a crouch and is immediately 
               being fired upon. The Germans, cut off from the museum, are 
               standing on the palace walkway firing at him. Indy takes off 
               fast for the rear of the museum.

               EXT. ALLEY BEHIND MUSEUM - DAY

               Kehoe, craning to locate Indy, has the Ford rolling slowly 
               along the back of the museum. Bang scouts from the back seat. 
               Indy appears on the roof at a run, gauges the movement of 
               the car and jumps from the roof of the museum to the roof of 
               the sedan. Unfortunately, the roof of the old car can't take 
               it and Indy's legs knife right on through to the interior, 
               where he scares the hell out of Kehoe.

               INT. KEHOE'S CAR - DAY

               Indy squirms his way down into the front seat.

                                     KEHOE
                         Jesus! Are you all right!

                                     INDY
                              (he's felt better)
                         Great. Got it.

               Kehoe guns it, throwing Indy back against the cushions.

                                     KEHOE
                         What now?

                                     INDY

               The plane flies west into the sunset.

               INT. DC-3 - NIGHT

               Under a meager seat light, Indy is pouring over a journal 
               article by Abner Ravenwood and related map of Nepal.

               A few rows back, across the aisle, a trenchcoated European 
               Spy eyes Indy.

                                                                   WIPE TO:

               INT. "THE RAVEN" SALOON - PATAN, NEPAL - NIGHT

               A huge stuffed raven, wings spread wide, is mounted behind 
               the long bar in the noisy, crowded saloon. A lively mix of 
               patrons is represented in the late hour tableau: Nepalese 
               natives, fierce Sherpa mountain guides, sleazy international 
               smugglers and fugitives, and, of course, mountain climbers 
               from every corner of the earth. A tall Nepalese, MAHDLO, is 
               the bartender.

               In a corner near the fireplace trouble breaks out suddenly 
               between the groups at two neighboring tables. Ferocious 
               representatives from each table - one a wild-looking SHERPA, 
               the other a muscular Australian CLIMBER - jump up to face 
               each other. As the two contenders stand poised for action, 
               their respective supporters shift in their places, fondling 
               lethal ice axes and clubs.

                                     SHERPA
                         Gmoiska! Shurga rintoik!

                                     CLIMBER
                         Aye! That'll be your last word.

               The bar has quieted ominously and so we hear with startling 
               clarity when - a door behind the bar slams open with a huge 
               BANG! and some Presence, too small to be seen as it moves 
               through the forest of towering patrons, makes a beeline for 
               the troubled corner of the bar. A path clears for it.

               The Sherpa and the Climber are about to kill each other when 
               the Presence arrives directly between them: she is MARION 
               RAVENWOOD, twenty-five years old, beautiful, if a bit hard-
               looking. At this moment, however, that look does not hurt. 
               She is not intimidated by the combatants; she jabs accusatory 
               fingers into their chests. She is angry as hell. The patrons 
               shrink under her gaze.

                                     MARION
                         That does it! I've been patient with 
                         you no-goods long enough. I'm not 
                         open at 2 o'clock for myself, you 
                         know. It's all for you. And how do 
                         you repay me: Trouble and noise and 
                         blood on my floor! I won't have it. 
                         Everybody out! Out! Out! We're closed. 
                         Closed! Do your killing outside! And 
                         don't leave any bodies on the porch!

               The place clears quickly. Stragglers and grumblers are given 
               special attention by Marion and Mahdlo, who has come from 
               behind the bar carrying a big axe handle. Mahdlo herds the 
               crows out the front door as Marion turns and walks behind 
               the bar.

               A scowl on her lovely face, she has just begun clearing the 
               bar of glasses when she notices one remaining Patron huddled 
               over a glass at the far end of the bar. Grimacing in 
               exasperation, she heads that way like a locomotive.

                                     MARION
                         Hey you, deaf one! I said out of my 
                         place. I don't mean next Easter, I 
                         mean now -

               She is almost on him when Indy looks up smiling. Marion stops, 
               stares, shocked.

                                     INDY
                         Hello, Marion.

               She hits him with a solid right to the jaw, knocking him off 
               the barstool on the floor. He rubs his jaw and smiles up at 
               her.

                                     INDY
                         Nice to see you, too.

                                     MARION
                         Get up and get out.

                                     INDY
                              (getting up)
                         Take it easy. I'm looking for your 
                         father.

                                     MARION
                              (bitterly)
                         Well you're two years too late.

               Indy's attitude changes instantly. This is sad news. He is 
               silent for a long time. Mahdlo comes in the front door and 
               hurries forward when he sees Indy with Marion. He looks to 
               her for guidance, but she stays him with a gesture.

                                     MARION
                         Go home, Mahdlo. I'll see you 
                         tomorrow.

               Mahdlo is hesitant, but lays the axe handle on the bar and 
               goes out. Indy has been barely aware of him. Now he settles 
               again on the barstool. Marion has a vindictive look. She'll 
               let him stay, but she wants to inflict as much pain as 
               possible.

                                     INDY
                         What happened?

                                     MARION
                         Avalanche. Up there. He was digging. 
                         What else? He spent his whole life 
                         digging. Dragging me all over this 
                         rotten earth. For what?

                                     INDY
                         Do you find him?

                                     MARION
                         Hell no. He's buried where he was 
                         working. Probably preserved real 
                         good, too. In the snow.

               Suddenly the hardness cracks. She is on the verge of tears 
               and does not want him to see them. She turns away and takes 
               a whiskey bottle from the shelf, then turns back to pout 
               herself a drink.

                                     INDY
                         Not a bad way to go. Doing what he 
                         loved.

                                     MARION
                              (vitriolic)
                         Don't give me that stuff! What do 
                         you know?
                              (she takes a drinks)
                         I'm the one that was left in a bad 
                         way. He didn't have a penny. Guess 
                         how I lived, Mister Jones. I worked 
                         here. And I wasn't the bartender.
                              (another swallow)
                         Finally the guy that owned the joint 
                         went crazy. Snow crazy. They took 
                         his away screaming. As they dragged 
                         him out, he said the place was all 
                         mine for life.

               She looks around the saloon.

                                     MARION
                         Can you imagine a more evil curse?
                              (pause)
                         So far, it's working.

                                     INDY
                         Why not leave? Go back to the States.

                                     MARION
                         I'll go back. I'll get there. Not 
                         that there's a soul there who knows 
                         my name or cares. But I'll go. And 
                         when I do, they'll know me. 'Cause 
                         I'm going to go back in style. With 
                         money. A goddamn lady!

                                     INDY
                         Where you gonna get it?

                                     MARION
                         If I knew that, you think I'd still 
                         be running this dive?

               Indy looks at her, thinking. Under his gaze, she blushes, 
               for reasons only she understands. She looks into her glass 
               and, for a moment, she softens.

                                     MARION
                         I'll tell you something Indy. I've 
                         learned to hate you in the last ten 
                         years. But somehow, no matter how 
                         much I hated you, I always knew that 
                         someday you'd come through that door. 
                         I never doubted that. Something made 
                         is inevitable.
                              (hopefully)
                         Why are you here... now... tonight?

               Indy takes a long time to answer.

                                     INDY
                         I need one of the pieces your father 
                         collected.

               Marion's eyes go icy. She swings at him again with her right, 
               but this time he catches her at the wrist. Then he stops her 
               left, which she has brought up to slap him.

                                     MARION
                         You son-of-a-bitch! You know what 
                         you did to me, to my life? This is 
                         your handiwork.

                                     INDY
                         I never meant to hurt you.

                                     MARION
                         I was a child!

                                     INDY
                         You knew what you were doing.

                                     MARION
                         I was in love.

                                     INDY
                         I guess that depends on your 
                         definition.

                                     MARION
                         It was wrong. You knew it.

               Indy releases her arms.

                                     INDY
                         Look, I did what I did. I don't expect 
                         you to be happy about it. But maybe 
                         we can do each other some good.

                                     MARION
                         Why start now?

                                     INDY
                         Shut up and listen for a second. I 
                         want that piece your father had. 
                         I've got money.

               This stops her.

                                     MARION
                         How much?

                                     INDY
                         Enough to get you back to the States. 
                         Where are his things?

                                     MARION
                         Gone. I sold it all. It was all junk. 
                         The junk he wasted his life on.

                                     INDY
                         Everything?

               Marion nods.

                                     INDY
                              (giving up)
                         That's too bad.

               Indy feels tired, defeated. Marion is pleased.

                                     MARION
                         You look disappointed. I like that. 
                         How's it feel?

               Indy has to smile at her glee.

                                     MARION
                              (nods at his empty 
                              glass)
                         What are you drinking?

                                     INDY
                         Seltzer.

                                     MARION
                              (refilling his glass)
                         Real man's drink. Me, I like scotch. 
                         And I like bourbon. And vodka and 
                         gin. I'm not much for brandy. I'm 
                         off that.

               She pours herself another as Indy watches, amused.

                                     INDY
                         You're a tough broad now, aren't 
                         you?

                                     MARION
                         It's no act, pal. This ain't 
                         Schenectady.

                                     INDY
                         I can only say I'm sorry so many 
                         times.

               Marion looks at him thoughtfully, takes a drink.

                                     MARION
                         You really have money? You don't 
                         look rich.
                              (Indy nods)
                         I may be able to locate some of his 
                         things. I know who's got them. What 
                         do you want?

                                     INDY
                         A bronze piece, about this size. In 
                         the shape of the sun. Probably broken 
                         off at the bottom. Has a little hole 
                         in it, off-center. Does that sound 
                         familiar?

               Marion thinks, nods slowly.

                                     INDY
                         Do you know where it is?

                                     MARION
                         Maybe. How much?

                                     INDY
                         Three thousand. American.

                                     MARION
                              (negative)
                         That'll get me back, but not in style. 
                         This doodad must be pretty important.

                                     INDY
                         Maybe.

               A huge smile lights up Marion's face.

                                     MARION
                         I knew it would happen eventually. I 
                         knew it. Something had to go my way.
                              (pours herself another 
                              drink)
                         I've got to think this out. I'm used 
                         to bargaining with yaks.

                                     INDY
                         Okay, five thousand. That's all I 
                         can give you now. I can get you more 
                         when you land in the States.

                                     MARION
                         You word, huh?
                              (Indy nods)
                         Just like you said you'd be back 
                         last time? That was your word too.

                                     INDY
                         I'm back, aren't I?

               Marion sneers and they smile together.

                                     INDY
                         You can trust me.

                                     MARION
                         Come back tomorrow.

                                     INDY
                         Why?

                                     MARION
                         Because I said so, that's why. It's 
                         about time I called the shots in 
                         this relationship.

               Indy nods, gets up to go.

                                     MARION
                         Wait a minute. Leave the five thousand 
                         here.
                              (Indy hesitates)
                         You want trust, give some. I want to 
                         smell your money.

               Indy thinks about this a moment, then reaches inside his 
               shirt and pulls cash from a money belt. He lays five grand 
               on the bar.

                                     INDY
                         I trust you.

                                     MARION
                         You're an idiot.

                                     INDY
                         I've heard that.

               Indy starts for the door. Marion takes another think. She is 
               getting high.

                                     MARION
                         Hold it. Come here.

                                     INDY
                              (moving back)
                         Bossy, aren't you?

                                     MARION
                         That's right. Give me a kiss.

               Indy looks into her eyes, then leans over the bar and kisses 
               her deeply. When the kiss ends, their faces are very close. 
               Marion is flushed. She liked it and would like more. She 
               raises her glass between them to discipline herself.

                                     MARION
                         Get out of my place.

               Indy smiles and walks to the front door. Then, without looking 
               back -

                                     INDY
                         Tomorrow.

               He's gone. Marion stares after him, thinking. She takes a 
               drink. Then slowly, her hand comes up to loosen the scarf 
               that is draped around her throat. It falls away, revealing 
               her graceful neck above the dipping top of her blouse. Hanging 
               there on a gold chain against her white skin is a sun-shaped 
               golden medallion. The bottom looks broken off. Marion lifts 
               the medallion so she can see it in her hand, then looks 
               thoughtfully after Indy.

               EXT. STREETS OUTSIDE "THE RAVEN" - NIGHT

               Indy sits thinking at the wheel of an old car. Finally, he 
               puts the car in gear and drives away.

               Across the street, the shadow in a doorway comes to life. A 
               dark form steps out to look at Indy's departing car; it is 
               the European Spy from the DC-3. He hurries off in the opposite 
               direction.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. "THE RAVEN" - NIGHT

               Marion stands before the fire that is shrinking in the 
               fireplace. She jabs at it abstractedly with a poker, thinking. 
               Suddenly tears well up in her eyes. She lets the poker slip 
               from her hand, wipes away the tears. She walks across the 
               room to the end of the bar, still cluttered with bottles and 
               glasses, and stops at the pile of American money Indy has 
               left. She takes the chain from around her neck and lets the 
               medallion slide off it into her hand. She places it on the 
               bar next to the pile of money, thinking. Then, having reached 
               some decision, she picks up the pile of bills, walks up the 
               back of the bar and pulls a small wooden box from under the 
               bar. She flips open the top, puts the cash inside and closes 
               the top. She leaves the box on the bar and starts back toward 
               the medallion. The front door of the saloon bursts open and 
               Four Bad Men come in. Marion, halfway between the valuable 
               possessions and not wishing to draw attention to either, 
               stops where she is.

               The Four Bad Men who advance on her are:

               1.) the obvious leader, a short, vile, sadistic German in 
               spectacles by the name of BELZIG.

               2.) a trenchcoated SECOND NAZI.

               3.) a ratty-looking NEPALESE and

               4.) a mean MONGOLIAN. The second NAZI and the MONGOLIAN both 
               carry submachine guns.

                                     BELZIG
                         Good evening, Fraulein.

                                     MARION
                         The bar's closed.

                                     BELZIG
                         We are not thirsty.

               The Mongolian and the Nepalese poke around, checking to make 
               sure there's no one else there.

               Down at the end of the bar, the medallion lies partially 
               hidden by surrounding glasses and bottles. The Second Nazi 
               stops very near it, but turns his back to it to face Belzig 
               and Marion.

                                     MARION
                         What do you want?

                                     BELZIG
                         The same thing your friend Dr. Jones 
                         wanted. Surely he told you there 
                         would be other interested parties.

               Marion shakes her head.

                                     BELZIG
                         Ah, the man is nefarious. I hope for 
                         your sake he has not yet acquired 
                         it.

                                     MARION
                         Why, are you willing to offer more?

                                     BELZIG
                         Almost certainly. Do you still have 
                         it?

                                     MARION
                         No. But I know where it is.

               Belzig's smile fades at this news. He's not a patient sort. 
               Marion is chilled by the look. She turns and moves to the 
               shelf of bottles behind her, reaching high for one, very 
               near the large stuffed raven. He hand lingers there a moment 
               and we see -

               From an angle behind the stuffed raven, that the left wing 
               spread hides a Baretta automatic pistol. Marion's hand is 
               very near it, but withdraws with only a whiskey bottle as 
               the Mongolian walks toward her behind the bar.

               Marion opens the bottle before Belzig, who watches her 
               intently.

                                     MARION
                         How 'bout a drink for you and your 
                         men?

               The Second Nazi lights up at this suggestion. Belzig gives 
               him a withering look.

                                     BELZIG
                         We will stick to the business at 
                         hand, Fraulein.

                                     MARION
                              (tough)
                         Fine. Why don't you come back tomorrow 
                         when Jones is here and we'll have an 
                         auction?

               Belzig gives her a cold look then turns and walks over toward 
               the fireplace. As soon as his back is turned, the Second 
               Nazi grabs the nearest whiskey bottle and takes a quick pull. 
               In so doing, he leaves the medallion completely exposed. 
               Marion is aware of this as she looks at him. But he quickly 
               puts the bottle down again, obscuring the medallion, when 
               Belzig speaks from the fireplace.

                                     BELZIG
                         I'm afraid an auction is not possible.
                              (pause)
                         Your fire is dying here, Fraulein.
                              (a beat, then 
                              threatening)
                         Why don't you tell us where the piece 
                         is right now?

                                     MARION
                         Listen, Herr Mac, I don't know who 
                         you're used to dealing with, but no 
                         one tells me what to do in my place.

               Belzig, still looking in the fire, sneers and shakes his 
               head.

                                     BELZIG
                         Americans! You're all alike. Fraulein 
                         Ravenwood. I'll show you want I'm 
                         used to.

               He motions with his hand. The Mongolian moves up behind Marion 
               and lifts her roughly over the top of the bar, knocking over 
               bottles and spilling liquor. He deposits her on the other 
               side, where the Nepalese and the Second Nazi flank her and 
               hold her cruelly, arms behind her back. Marion raises a 
               ruckus.

               Belzig turns from the fireplace. In his hand is the poker, 
               its end glowing orange. He advances on Marion. Marion stops 
               yelling, her eyes widen in terror.

                                     MARION
                         Wait! I can be reasonable -

                                     BELZIG
                         That time is passed.

               The glowing poker point moves inexorably across the room 
               toward Marion's face.

                                     MARION
                         You don't need that. I'll tell you 
                         everything!

                                     BELZIG
                         Yes, I know you will.

               Belzig has no intention of stopping now. The glowing tip is 
               approaching Marion's face. The Nepalese watches with savage 
               glee.

               The tip of the poker is five inches from Marion's nose when 
               there is a loud CRACK! and the fall of Indy's bullwhip wraps 
               around the middle of the poker and tears it out of Belzig's 
               hands. The poker sails high across the room, free of the 
               whip, and lands in the heavy curtains that cover one window. 
               The curtains immediately burst into flame.

               The four Bad Men look in surprise toward the front entrance. 
               Indy is poised there, the whip in his right hand, a .45 
               automatic raised toward them in his left.

                                     INDY
                         Hello.

               Now everything begins to happen very fast -

               The Mongolian had just come around the bar at the end opposite 
               the medallion. He dives back to crouch behind the end of the 
               bar, raising his submachine gun.

               Belzig and the Second German dive behind tables near the 
               bar. The Nepalese is slower to leave Marion, he draws a Luger. 
               Indy's .45 barks and the Nepalese dies spinning against the 
               bar. Indy fires in the direction of the Mongolian.

               Marion swings up over the top of her bar. Belzig fires at 
               her, but his bullets smash bottles behind the bar and thud 
               into the raven.

               Marion flattens out on the floor behind the bar as bullets 
               hit above her. She reaches up, snatches the axe handle from 
               where Mahdlo left it, and begins crawling down the length of 
               the bar toward -

               The Mongolian, who sticks his submachine gun out and fires 
               blindly in Indy's direction.

               Indy is in a crouch behind a table, trying to get a shot at 
               someone. He doesn't notice in the din and confusion when the 
               door bursts open. An incredible, fearsome GIANT SHERPA, almost 
               seven feet tall, soars in and tackles Indy from behind. The 
               whip flies from Indy's hand as he and the Giant Sherpa roll 
               across the floor, upsetting furniture.

               The Mongolian, seeing this, stands up confidently. Marion 
               rises behind him and bashes him over the head with the axe 
               handle. He goes down and out.

               Fire has completely engulfed the curtains and is working 
               across the ceiling on decorative yak skin bunting. A burning 
               fragment drops to the top of the bar, which immediately lights 
               up, fueled by the spilled alcohol. Full whiskey bottles 
               explode like Molotov cocktails.

               Rolling on the floor, Indy and the Giant Sherpa are fighting 
               for control of Indy's .45. Belzig sees this and shouts to 
               the Second Nazi, who is rising from cover with submachine 
               gun in hand.

                                     BELZIG
                         Shoot them both!

                                     SECOND NAZI
                         He's our man!

                                     BELZIG
                         Do as I say!

               Both the Giant Sherpa and Indy hear this. The Giant Sherpa 
               exchanges an alarmed look with Indy and together they swing 
               the .45 around toward the surprised Second Nazi. Two blasts 
               blow him away.

               That done, Indy brings a brass spittoon down on the Giant 
               Sherpa's wrist and the .45 slides away. Indy jumps up and 
               kicks the Giant Sherpa, who barely seems to feel it. He grabs 
               Indy and flips him effortlessly onto a table.

               Belzig now has a clear shot at Indy. He raises his luger.

               Marion, at the end of the bar, finally gets the hand of the 
               Mongolian's submachine gun. It roars to life in the general 
               direction of the ceiling.

               Belzig runs for cover as Marion gets control of the gun and 
               levels it. Belzig dives around the end of the bar opposite 
               Marion. When he has set himself, he peeks up over the edge 
               of the scorched bar. The alcohol fire has moved down the bar 
               and now, much to Belzig's surprise, he finds himself staring 
               at the fire-blackened sun-shaped medallion!

               His eyes widen. He cannot believe his good fortune. Without 
               hesitation he picks up the metal medallion, palming it. 
               Immediately there is a sickening searing sound and Belzig's 
               expression changes from joy to agony. He screams in pain and 
               tries to shake the red-hot medallion from his skin. Marion 
               opens up and the bar starts to splinter in front of Belzig. 
               The medallion comes free of Belzig's hand and rolls across 
               the floor.

               Belzig has had enough. In excruciating pain, he turns, sees 
               a window, runs and dives through the glass.

               An exhausted Indy uses his whole body to upend the Giant 
               Sherpa, who lands hard on his back. They are surrounded by 
               flames.

               EXT. "THE RAVEN" - SNOW BANK - NIGHT

               Belzig has his burned hand stuck deep in the snow. Now he 
               withdraws it, steaming, and scurries off into the night like 
               a wounded animal.

               INT. "THE RAVEN" - NIGHT

               Marion throws down the empty submachine gun and moves through 
               the flames to the center of the bar where she left the box 
               with the five grand. She finds the remains of the box and 
               its contents: a shapeless pile of ash and charred wood.

                                     MARION
                         Unbelievable!

               At the end of the bar, the Mongolian has come back to life. 
               He shakes out his head, then reaches inside his coat and 
               pulls out a Mauser pistol.

               Indy smashes a chair over the head of the Giant Sherpa and 
               the huge creature goes down.

               The Mongolian points his Mauser through the smoke and flame 
               at Indy. Suddenly, the Mongolian is shot dead.

               Marion stands beneath her stuffed raven with the Baretta.

               Indy moves quickly through the flames, his eyes scanning the 
               floor. He picks up his bullwhip and his crumpled felt hat. 
               He peers through the smoke till he spots Marion moving among 
               the burning furniture.

                                     INDY
                         Let's get out of here!

                                     MARION
                         Not without that piece you want!

                                     INDY
                         It's here?

               Marion nods, kicks aside a burning chair. Another burning 
               beam falls from the roof. Indy pulls Marion close to him 
               protectively.

                                     INDY
                         Forget it! I want you out of here. 
                         Now!

               He begins dragging her out.

                                     MARION
                              (pointing)
                         There!

               She breaks away from him, darts back and picks the hot 
               medallion up in the loose cloth of her blouse.

                                     INDY
                         Let's go!

                                     MARION
                              (looking around)
                         You burned down my place!

                                     INDY
                              (figuratively)
                         I owe you plenty!

                                     MARION
                              (literally)
                         You owe me plenty!

                                     INDY
                              (smiles)
                         You're something!

                                     MARION
                         I am something. And I'll tell you 
                         exactly what -

               She holds up the medallion possessively.

                                     MARION
                         I'm your partner!

               EXT. CAIRO - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY

               First we see the sprawl, the soaring minarets, the ancient 
               skyline. Then we're closer, in the narrow, exotic streets, 
               teeming with life: fierce-looking men in tattered galabiyas, 
               black-gowned women with veiled faces, ragged, barefoot 
               children.

               INT. DINING ROOM - SALLAH'S HOUSE (OLD CAIRO)

               Indy and Marion have been welcomed like family into the 
               crowded home of SALLAH, his wife FAYAH, and their NINE 
               CHILDREN (ages 4 - 18). Fayah, a huge, imposing woman, 
               appears, at first glance, to be the power in the house. 
               Sallah, a small, cheerful, energetic fellow in his forties 
               defers to his wife in all matters of little importance. 
               Suddenly the general liveliness at the children's table 
               escalates into pandemonium, attracting the attention of the 
               adults.

                                     FAYAH
                         Silence!
                              (there is silence)
                         Why do you forget yourselves?

               The gaggle of grinning off-spring parts to reveal in their 
               midst - a MONKEY. It is munching some flat Arab bread.

                                     FAYAH
                         What is this? Who brought this animal 
                         in?

               All the children chatter their innocence at once. The Monkey 
               chatters too; it's an entertainer. The Monkey jumps from the 
               children's table to the adults' and struts slowly up toward 
               Marion, who thinks it's the cutest thing she ever saw. When 
               it reaches her, it takes off its turban and does a deep, 
               grand bow to her. She is delighted and takes the Monkey into 
               her arms. The Monkey kisses her cheek. The children laugh.

                                     MARION
                         Why, thank you. I like you too.

                                     FAYAH
                         Then it shall be welcome in our house.

                                     MARION
                         Oh, no! You don't have to have it 
                         around if you don't want it -

                                     SALLAH
                              (cheerfully)
                         All of Allah's creatures are welcome 
                         here. You please us by letting us 
                         please you.

               EXT. COURTYARD - SALLAH'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               Indy and Sallah sit in the small, protected courtyard. Sallah 
               holds the two sections of the headpiece, the medallion and 
               the base, and has for the first time fitted them together. 
               They fit perfectly and complete the headpiece. He peruses 
               the markings on the headpiece quizzically. Indy is cleaning 
               and loading a .45 automatic.

                                     INDY
                         I knew the Germans would hire you, 
                         Sallah. They couldn't have an 
                         excavation in the desert without the 
                         best digger in Egypt.

                                     SALLAH
                         All Arabs look alike to them, Indy.

                                     INDY
                         Tell me about the map room at Tanis.

                                     SALLAH
                         We found it three days ago. I broke 
                         through myself.

                                     INDY
                         Those Nazis are moving awfully fast.

                                     SALLAH
                         The Frenchman is helping them.

               Indy reacts.

                                     INDY
                         Belloq. So he got away from the 
                         Indians. This is going to be more 
                         interesting that I thought.

                                     SALLAH
                         I'm afraid this has put the Germans 
                         close to finding the Well of the 
                         Souls.

                                     INDY
                              (indicates the 
                              headpiece)
                         Even Belloq won't be able to find it 
                         without that. Can you make anything 
                         of those markings? They're nothing 
                         I'm familiar with.

                                     SALLAH
                              (shakes his head "no")
                         But I know someone who might. You 
                         can go to see him tomorrow.
                              (a worried expression)
                         Indy... something bothers me.

                                     INDY
                         What is it, my friend?

               Sallah finds it hard to say. When he finally speaks, his 
               words are accompanied by a strange, eerie, foreboding rush 
               of wind through the courtyard. Just a coincidence we might 
               suppose.

                                     SALLAH
                         It is the Ark. If it is there, at 
                         Tanis... It is not something man was 
                         meant to disturb... Death has always 
                         surrounded it. It is not of this 
                         earth.

               The wind dies down. Indy shakes off a chill and stares 
               thoughtfully at his friend.

               EXT. HEAVILY TRAFFICKED CAIRO STREET - DAY

               Indy and Marion are briskly walking along one of Cairo's 
               busy bazaar streets. Vendors with fine cloth, pottery, 
               baskets, jewelry, etc line the street. Marion has the Monkey 
               from Sallah's house on her shoulder.

                                     INDY
                         Do you really need that monkey?

                                     MARION
                         I'm surprised at you, Indy. Talking 
                         that way about our baby. He's got 
                         your looks, too.

                                     INDY
                         And your brains.

               As Indy and Marion turn a corner, the Monkey seems to notice 
               something and immediately jumps from Marion's shoulder and 
               hurries off at a frantic pace down the street.

                                     MARION
                              (looking disappointed)
                         Hey! Hey!... where're you going?

                                     INDY
                              (dragging Marion on)
                         He'll be OK. Come on. Come on.

               EXT. ANOTHER CAIRO STREET - DAY

               The Monkey is seen running around another corner and jumps 
               into the waiting arms of MONKEY MAN, who appears to be like 
               a beggar with a dirty turban and an eye patch. Monkey Man 
               immediately hurries down the street and passes into a 
               building. In the building are two GERMAN AGENTS. Monkey Man 
               and the Monkey both give the Heil Hitler salute and engage 
               in quick talk.

               Monkey Man quickly leaves the two German Agents and gets 
               back to the street. He is obviously shadowing Indy and Marion. 
               Indy and Marion are just now passing by the Monkey Man ducks 
               back behind some baskets.

               EXT. ANOTHER BUSY CAIRO STREET - DAY

               Indy and Marion are passing under a balcony where a lone 
               GERMAN AGENT stands watch. After they pass, the Agent nods 
               to some BAD ARABS who are hiding in the shadows of the street. 
               In a moment, Indy and Marion pass by the break. Monkey Man 
               turns and looks up at a roof further down the alley. He waves 
               with his hand. Someone up there waves back.

               EXT. A SMALL BAZAAR - DAY

               Indy and Marion have reached a tiny square, made even more 
               cramped by its use as a small bazaar. They have started 
               working their way through the crowd when several Bad Arabs 
               and a German Agent begin to converge on them. Indy immediately 
               sees what's happening and pulls the bull whip from his jacket. 
               The first Bad Arab to reach them gets hit in the mouth by 
               the handle of the whip. Now all hell breaks loose, with Bad 
               Arabs, Innocent Shoppers, baskets of fruit and tables of 
               goods flying every which way in the constricted space.

                                     INDY
                              (to Marion)
                         Run! Get out of here!

               Indy catches a dagger-wielding Bad Arab around the legs with 
               the whip and flips him. Marion is reluctant to leave Indy.

                                     INDY
                         Go, dammit! Go!

               Marion goes. She runs off between two buildings. A Bad Arab 
               takes off after her. Monkey Man, now standing at the edge of 
               the square, points at Marion. The Monkey jumps off his 
               shoulder and follows Marion.

               EXT. BETWEEN THE BUILDINGS - DAY

               Marion runs along the narrow space and soon encounters a 
               five foot wall. She flops over it. The Bad Arab is right on 
               her heels. He reaches the wall and vaults over. On the other 
               side of the wall, the Bad Arab lands in a crouch, looks ahead 
               and doesn't see Marion. Immediately a heavy earthen pot 
               smashes over his head, putting him out. Marion steps from an 
               alcove and starts to run toward the street at the other end 
               of the walkway. Suddenly another Bad Arab and a new German 
               Agent appear in the street at that end. Before they can spot 
               her, Marion retreats to the alcove again. There is a huge 
               rattan basket sitting there. Marion climbs in and closes the 
               top above her.

               The only witness: The Monkey, who is now perched on the fire 
               foot wall.

               EXT. THE SMALL BAZAAR - DAY

               Chaos. An entire booth of pots and pans collapses on a Bad 
               Arab and a German Agent as Indy whips away a support.

               EXT. BETWEEN THE BUILDINGS - DAY

               The chattering Monkey leads a German Agent and two Bad Arabs 
               to Marion's hiding place, gesturing maniacally.

               EXT. THE SMALL BAZAAR - DAY

               Indy ducks under the swinging blade of a huge Arabian sword 
               and kicks the Bad Arab Swordsman in the groin.

               EXT. SIDE STREET - DAY

               The German Agent leads the way as the two Bad Arabs carry 
               the huge basket above their heads. The basket top has been 
               fastened closed, but Marion is making a fuss inside. At the 
               place where the street cuts across the far side of the bazaar, 
               Marion is able to wedge the top open one inch and screams -

                                     MARION
                         Indy-y-y-y!

               EXT. THE SMALL BAZAAR - DAY

               Indy has heard her. He looks across the square as the basket 
               and its escorts disappear beyond a building. One last Bad 
               Arab rises before him. Indy's whip flashes and the Bad Arab's 
               robe falls down to his ankles. Indy frantically pushes his 
               way through the panicked mass of humanity in the direction 
               the basket has gone.

               EXT. THE FOOT CHASE - INTERCUTTING INDY AND THE MOVING 
               BASKET - DAY

               The Bad Guys move the basket as fast as they can through 
               streets, alleys and passageways thick with people. Indy always 
               seems to round a corner just in time to catch a glimpse of 
               the basket before it disappears around a new corner. Indy 
               must fight a flow of humanity as powerful as an ocean riptide. 
               Finally, at the head of one particularly crowded alley, Indy 
               leaps up onto a wall for a clearer view. Whatever he sees 
               gives him an idea and he cuts between two buildings rather 
               than following the basket.

               EXT. DESERTED ALLEY - DAY

               Two Bad Arabs come running down the Alley with the basket 
               between them. Suddenly, Indy's whip flashes out sending both 
               Arabs and the basket tumbling. Indy steps into view, his .45 
               trained on the sprawled Arabs, and looks at the basket. The 
               top has come flying off and the contents have clattered onto 
               the cobblestone: inside is not Marion, but a load of 
               contraband pistols, rifles and ammo. Indy is advancing on 
               the trembling Bad Arabs with an ugly look when suddenly he 
               hears Marion scream around the corner.

               EXT. DESERTED SQUARE - DAY

               Indy rounds the corner and is immediately driven back by 
               machine gun fire. Taking cover, he gets quick, intermittent 
               glimpses of this scene: At the far corner of the large, 
               deserted square is a canvas-covered truck. Two Bad Arabs are 
               hurrying toward is with a large rattan basket between them, 
               Marion screaming inside. A German Agent is covering their 
               retreat with a machine gun from the cab of the truck. Indy 
               runs up to see the rattan basket being heaved into the back 
               of the truck.

               EXT. BACK OF THE TRUCK - DAY

               What Indy cannot see is that the basket lands among an ominous 
               load of German munitions, dynamite and firearms. The truck 
               immediately peels out.

               EXT. DESERTED SQUARE - DAY

               The German Agent has stopped firing in order to drive. He 
               floors it, aiming for a street at the corner of the square. 
               Indy uses the lull to take careful aim at the German Agent's 
               profile and fire off three careful shots. The German Agent 
               is hit, blasted dead against the steering wheel. The speeding 
               truck swerves, hits a wall, rolls over and explodes in an 
               enormous, multi-leveled eruption as its contents ignite. 
               Several surrounding buildings are leveled.

               Indy, blown back across the square, looks on, astounded and 
               horror-stricken.

                                     INDY
                         Marion.

               INT. ARAB BAR - NIGHT

               A dark, smoke-filled den on iniquity. The patrons, almost 
               all fearsome Arabs, sit in small shadowy groups around the 
               room. Indy stands at the bar finishing off a fifth of bourbon. 
               He is drunk. The ARAB BARTENDER places a new bottle of 
               expensive bourbon in front of him. Indy eyes is queerly.

                                     ARAB BARTENDER
                         The gentleman in the corner sent it. 
                         He would like you to join him.

                                     INDY
                              (doesn't even look)
                         Too bad. I'm drinking alone.

               The Arab Bartender does a take, looking at the three, tough 
               GERMAN HENCHMEN who have surrounded Indy from out of the 
               smoke, their hands stuffed in bulging trenchcoat pockets. 
               Indy notices them now with a bleary glance. He decides he's 
               in no shape to kill or be killed and moves with them across 
               the room, taking his bottle with him. The Arab patrons take 
               this in and mind their own business.

               The occupant of the smoke-shrouded corner table becomes 
               visible only as Indy reaches there: it is Emile Belloq. He 
               is drinking wine.

                                     INDY
                         Belloq.

                                     BELLOQ
                         Good evening, Dr. Jones.

                                     INDY
                         I ought to kill you right now.

                                     BELLOQ
                         It was not I who brought the girl 
                         into this dirty business.

               Indy knows its true; that's what's tearing him up.

                                     BELLOQ
                         Sit down, please, before you fall 
                         down. We can behave as civilized 
                         people. I'm afraid it will be your 
                         last opportunity.

               Indy sits, glancing at the German Henchmen, who settle nearby, 
               just out of earshot.

                                     INDY
                         Not a very private place for a murder.

                                     BELLOQ
                              (looking around)
                         These Arabs will not interfere in 
                         the white man's business. They do 
                         not care if we kill each other off.
                              (takes a sip of wine, 
                              refers to it)
                         Terribly difficult finding a decent 
                         vintage here. You were quite vigorous 
                         in Shanghai. Unfortunately, our friend 
                         the Wild Boar had taken the precaution 
                         of making several copies of the piece.

               Indy registers this as he takes a drink. Belloq watches him 
               with disdainful amusement.

                                     BELLOQ
                         How odd that is should end this way 
                         for us, after so many... stimulating 
                         encounters. I almost regret it. Where 
                         shall I find a new adversary so close 
                         to my own level?

                                     INDY
                         Try the local sewer.

                                     BELLOQ
                         I know you despise me. We always 
                         hate in others that which we most 
                         fear in ourselves. And you and I are 
                         very much alike.

                                     INDY
                         Now you're getting nasty.

                                     BELLOQ
                         We have always done the same kind of 
                         work. Our methods have not differed 
                         as much as you pretend. I am a shadowy 
                         reflection of you. But it would have 
                         taken only a nudge to make you the 
                         same as me, to push you out of the 
                         light.

               There's a certain amount of truth to this; the recognition 
               of it flickers across Indy's bleary eyes. Belloq sees it 
               there.

                                     BELLOQ
                         You know it to be true! How nice. 
                         And how ironic the timing.

               Belloq leans forward, eyes shining, voice suddenly different.

                                     BELLOQ
                         Do you realize what the Ark is?
                              (very intense)
                         It's a transmitter. A radio for 
                         talking to God! And now it is within 
                         my grasp.

                                     INDY
                         What about your boss, der Fuhrer? I 
                         thought he was waiting to take 
                         possession.

               Belloq glances into the gloom at the German Henchmen.

                                     BELLOQ
                              (quieter)
                         When the time is right. When I am 
                         finished with it.

                                     INDY
                         I hope your friends are patient. 
                         Dangerous work, Belloq.

                                     BELLOQ
                         Yes. Very. You may consider yourself 
                         fortunate that your involvement 
                         concludes here.

                                     INDY
                         Tell me, did you get away with the 
                         idol?

                                     BELLOQ
                              (negative)
                         I was lucky to get away with my life. 
                         The Hovitos proved quite narrow-minded 
                         about the whole matter.

               Indy takes a drink.

                                     INDY
                         You know, if it's God you want to 
                         talk to, maybe I can arrange it.

                                     BELLOQ
                              (smiles)
                         You have not changed. But, please, 
                         do not reach for your weapon until 
                         you are ready to die.

               The front door of the bar slams open and all nine of SALLAH'S 
               CHILDREN scamper in and over to a surprised Indy. Two of the 
               smallest hop into his lap.

                                     LITTLE SON
                         Uncle Indy, we have been looking for 
                         you.

                                     LITTLE DAUGHTER
                         Come home now, Uncle. Hurry!

               Suddenly the Arab patrons of the bar take an intense interest 
               in the situation, shifting their weapons.

                                     INDY
                         Yes. Yes, I'll come now.

               Indy stands up. The German Henchmen and poised. Belloq eyes 
               the Arab patrons and signals for the Henchmen to relax.

                                     BELLOQ
                         Next time, Indiana Jones, it will 
                         take more than children to save you.

               The children usher Indy out.

               INT. SALLAH'S TRUCK - IN FRONT OF ARAB BAR - NIGHT

               Indy climbs into the cab of Sallah's truck with a smiling 
               Sallah as the children pile into the back. Sallah pulls out.

                                     SALLAH
                         I thought we would find you there.
                              (indicating the kids)
                         Better than the United States Marines, 
                         eh?

                                     INDY
                              (nods)
                         Thanks you.
                              (grave)
                         Marion's dead.

                                     SALLAH
                         Yes, I know. I am sorry.
                              (pause)
                         More reason than ever to beat the 
                         bastards.
                              (he touches Indy)
                         Life goes on, Indy.
                              (indicates the kids 
                              again)
                         There is the proof.

               Indy looks back there, nods.

                                     SALLAH
                         I have much to tell you, Indy.

               INT. SALLAH'S HOUSE

               Fayah brings in a tray of food and puts it on the table. The 
               bowl of dates is in one corner. As Fayah leaves the room, 
               the Monkey slips out of Sallah's lap and disappears under 
               the table. Indy leans over the food tray, his hand hovering 
               over the dates. But he chooses some cheese and bread instead.

                                     INDY
                         And they made the calculation in the 
                         map room?

                                     SALLAH
                              (nods vigorously)
                         This morning. Belloq and the boss 
                         German, Shliemann. When they came 
                         out of the map room, we were given a 
                         new spot in which to dig... out away 
                         from the camp.

                                     INDY
                              (resigned)
                         The Well of the Souls.

               Sallah nods, moves to the food. He picks up a date, then 
               changes his mind and drops it, taking a bunch of grapes 
               instead. Indy picks up a chicken leg in one hand and a date 
               in the other, his mind distracted. Fayah enters the room 
               just in time to see Indy flip the date high into the air and 
               try to catch it in his mouth. It bounces off his chin and 
               falls to the floor. Indy looks sheepishly at Fayah. Fayah 
               picks up the fallen date and puts it in the dirty ash tray 
               she is now removing. Amir speaks in a slow, raspy voice 
               without looking up.

                                     AMIR
                         Come. Look.

               The two men go and huddle over the old man. The Monkey peeks 
               up over the edge of the table at the array of food. He picks 
               up a date and disappears below the table. Amir points to 
               some markings on the lower part of the headpiece.

                                     AMIR
                         This is a warning... not to disturb 
                         the Ark of the Covenant.

                                     INDY
                         Just want I need.

               The Monkey's paw comes up over the edge of the table and 
               grabs another date.

                                     INDY
                         How 'bout the height of the staff? 
                         Did Belloq get it off of there?

                                     AMIR
                         Yes... it is here.

               Indy, nervous, goes back to the food tray, picks up another 
               date. When he turns back to the men, the Monkey's paw grabs 
               another date.

               We see the headpiece in closeup on the table. Amir's crooked 
               fingers trace a line of markings along the bottom section to 
               the break in the piece.

                                     AMIR
                         It says it is... ten jamirs high...

                                     SALLAH
                         About seventy-five inches.

                                     AMIR
                         Wait! I am not finished...

               Amir's finger moves across the break as the markings continue 
               on the sun medallion.

                                     AMIR
                              (reading)
                         "And one jamir to honor the Hebrew 
                         God whose Ark this is."

               Indy, still holding the date, exchanges a long look with 
               Sallah.

                                     INDY
                         You said their top section was blank. 
                         Are you absolutely sure?

               Sallah nods.

                                     INDY
                         Belloq's staff is seven and a half 
                         inches short. They're digging in the 
                         wrong spot!

               Sallah and Indy begin to laugh. Amir gives them a glance and 
               returns to his wine. Sallah leans over and kisses the old 
               man.

                                     SALLAH
                              (to Amir)
                         A home run, my friend, grand slam!
                              (to Indy)
                         We have a saying - "A little luck is 
                         better than much smartness." Indy, 
                         pardner, you are very lucky fellow.

               Indy hoots. Then he takes the data in his hand and flips it 
               high in the air. He opens his mouth to catch it, but it 
               doesn't come down. He has inadvertently thrown it into a 
               bowl of a hanging lamp. This makes the men laugh even harder.

               Indy goes over and picks up another date. He turns laughing 
               to Sallah and doesn't see as the Monkey's paw comes up, 
               slowly, takes another date and begins to withdraw. Suddenly 
               the paw is stricken with palsy and the unseen Monkey goes 
               into its death throws. Sallah watches the paw as though 
               hypnotized. Finally the paw slips from sight and we hear a 
               solid THUMP! on the floor. Sallah walks around the table and 
               looks at the floor. The Monkey lies dead among a mess of 
               date pits.

               Indy is in a happy world of his own. He throws his date high 
               in the air. He positions himself under it and waits for it 
               to drop in. Here it comes. Right on target. As it's about to 
               disappear into Indy's mouth, Sallah's hand flashes in and 
               grabs it. Indy looks mystified and disappointed. Sallah 
               motions toward the dead Monkey.

                                     SALLAH
                         Bad dates.

               EXT. DESERT ROAD - MORNING

               Two old trucks come down a narrow mountain road and onto the 
               flat surface of the desert.

               Further out into the desert, the one in the lead, Sallah's 
               truck, stops and the second one, Omar's truck, pulls up beside 
               it. There are half dozen Arab Diggers in Omar's truck. Indy, 
               dressed as an Arab, gets out of the cab of Sallah's truck 
               and moves over to confer with OMAR, another old friend. They 
               point off into the desert and reach some conclusion. Indy 
               gives him a pat on the back; Omar turns off the road and 
               drives into the desert with his workers. Indy hops back in 
               the cab of Sallah's truck with Sallah. As they move down the 
               road we see that the back of the truck holds three other 
               Arab Diggers.

               EXT. RISE ABOVE THE TANIS DIGS - MORNING

               Indy and Sallah are lying in classic shouting fashion at the 
               top of the rise looking down on the Tanis Digs. Down behind 
               them, Sallah's truck is parked with the three Arab Diggers.

                                     INDY
                         My God! They aren't kidding!

               WHAT HE SEES

               The Tanis Digs are laid out below like a painting. Trucks, 
               bulldozers, Arab workers and German supervisors are 
               everywhere. The excavations themselves are extensive and 
               somewhat random-holes have been dug and then abandoned, 
               foundations and passageways unearthed and then deserted. 
               Beyond the main digs, a crude airstrip has been created. 
               Sallah points to what appears to be a mound of dirt with a 
               hole in it near the center of the activity.

                                     SALLAH
                         There! That is the map room!

                                     INDY
                         What time does the sun hit the map?

                                     SALLAH
                         Just after eight.

                                     INDY
                         We haven't got much time. Where are 
                         the Germans digging for the Well of 
                         the Souls?

               Sallah points out into the desert a short way beyond the 
               main area of activity. The desert turns to sand dunes out 
               there, the surface undulating into the distance. Several 
               trucks and men are out there and a bulldozer is lumbering 
               noisily toward it.

                                     INDY
                         Okay. Let's go.

               EXT. THE TANIS DIGS - MORNING

               Sallah's truck drives through the camp, one of the Arab 
               Diggers at the wheel. Indy and Sallah are in the back and 
               look just like the other two Arab Diggers. Sallah's truck 
               does behind a tent and when it appears on the other side, 
               Indy and Sallah are gone.

               EXT. AMONG THE TENTS - MORNING

               Indy and Sallah move stealthily among the tents. Indy carries 
               a smooth wooden staff almost seven feet tall. They stop 
               between two tents and look across a path at the entrance to 
               the map room. What appeared to be a mound of dirt is actually 
               the roof on the ancient building. The hole/entrance is a 
               five-foot square skylight. Indy looks around, then walks 
               casually to the edge of the hole and looks inside. Sallah 
               joins him, producing a length of rope from his robes. Indy 
               drops the staff into the unseen map room as Sallah ties the 
               rope around on oil drum. When it's secure, Indy wastes no 
               time disappearing down it into the map room.

               INT. MAP ROOM

               Indy is down the twenty feet to the floor of the room in 
               seconds. He tugs on the rope and it immediately gets pulled 
               up. Indy looks around with real wonder and excitement. The 
               room is lovely, with elaborate wall carvings and frescoes, 
               all lit by the bright stream of sunlight flooding in from 
               above. This beam of light leads Indy's eye to the far end, 
               and the room's truly remarkable feature: built into the floor 
               in meticulous relief is a miniature stone model of the ancient 
               city of Tanis. Already, the sunlight has worked its way down 
               the far wall and is edging onto the miniature of the city. 
               On the floor, to the skylight side of the miniature, is an 
               elaborate line created by embedded mosaic tiles. The evenly 
               spaced slots in the line, each accompanied by a symbol of a 
               time of year, are for the base of the staff. Indy pulls the 
               headpiece from his robes - it has been welded together - and 
               reaches for the staff.

               EXT. ABOVE THE MAP ROOM - DAY

               An extremely nervous Sallah has the gathered rope in his 
               hands and is trying to appear casual as he inches back toward 
               the oil drum. There is now a good bit of activity going on 
               up here.

                                     JEEP GERMAN (O.S.)
                         Hey! You, the skinny one!

               Sallah jumps about three feet. The JEEP GERMAN is standing 
               in an open space ten yards away looking at Sallah.

                                     JEEP GERMAN
                         Yes, you. What are you doing there?

               Sallah gestures his innocence.

                                     JEEP GERMAN
                         Well bring that rope over here, you 
                         cur.

               The Jeep German starts back toward his major concern: his 
               jeep is stuck in some sand beyond the next tent. Some Arab 
               Workers are trying in vain to budge it. Now another German 
               has backed his truck up to it. Sallah can think of nothing 
               to do expect obey. With a worried glance at the map room, be 
               begins untying the rope from the oil drum.

               INT. THE MAP ROOM

               Indy is examining the results of Belloq's work. Red paint 
               marks one of the miniature buildings in the layout and a 
               white calibrated tape has been strung from that building 
               back to a miniature of the map room. Now Indy begins examining 
               the mosaic base line for the staff. Sunlight has moves further 
               down across the miniature.

               EXT. IN THE CAMP - DAY

               Sallah watches nervously as his precious rope is pulled taut 
               between the pulling truck and the stuck jeep. He doesn't 
               notice that he has chosen to stand next to a large, steaming 
               kettle of food until -

                                     HUNGRY GERMAN (O.S.)
                         Bring us some of that!

               He points to the kettle. Sallah looks frantically from the 
               rope, back to the skylight of the map room, to the kettle of 
               food.

                                     HUNGRY GERMAN
                         Now, idiot!

               Sallah picks up some serving pieces and gets to work.

               INT. THE MAP ROOM

               The moment has arrived. Even the tension of the circumstances 
               cannot distract Indy from the purity of what he is about to 
               do. All his calculations are adjustments complete, Indy takes 
               the Staff of Ra and places it - CLINK! - in the right 
               depression on the base line. This is as active and exciting 
               a moment as any archeologist can dream of and, at heart, 
               that is exactly what Indy is. The sunlight catches the very 
               top of the headpiece and moves within a fraction of an inch 
               of the tiny hole in its sun.

               The edge of the sunlight moving across the miniature city is 
               still a good two feet beyond the spot Belloq has settled on. 
               And now that line of light is broken by the shadow of an 
               ornate sun at the top of the staff.

               Indy's face reflects his concentration. And then his immense 
               pleasure. He sees what he came for.

               Out of the miniature city, one small building is being lit 
               by a tiny beam of sunlight in the center of the shadow of 
               the metal sun. And by some trick of ancient artistry, this 
               one building responds to the sunlight like none of the others. 
               The golden light permeates it: it seems to glow. The building 
               is in a direct line with Belloq's - all the Frenchman's other 
               calculations were right - but it is a foot and a half beyond 
               it.

               EXT. IN THE CAMP - DAY

               Sallah, sweating profusely, has finished serving the line of 
               Breakfasting Germans and now heads back to replace the kettle 
               and get away.

                                     HUNGRY GERMAN
                         Water. Bring us water.

               INT. MAP ROOM

               Indy is on his knees at the miniature city, a special tape 
               measure in his hand. Indy has the tape strung from Belloq's 
               mistaken spot to his own correct spot. He gets his reading, 
               leaps up and crosses to the erect staff. He pulls the 
               headpiece off the staff and hides it in his robes. He quickly 
               breaks the wooden staff in two and throws the pieces behind 
               a pile of debris. Then he moves quickly to beneath the 
               skylight.

                                     INDY
                              (stage whisper)
                         Sallah.
                              (he waits, then louder)
                         Sallah!

               More waiting. Nothing. Indy looks around for some alternative 
               means of escape. The room doesn't offer any. He looks up at 
               the skylight again.

                                     INDY
                              (loudest)
                         Sallah!

               A long pause. Then something comes down. A makeshift rope. 
               Really just a bunch of clothing tied together - tunics, robes, 
               pants. But what we see first and most prominently, the first 
               section of Indy's escape rope, is a bright Nazi flag. Indy 
               beams and climbs.

               EXT. ABOVE THE MAP ROOM - DAY

               Indy sticks his head out the skylight, sees it clear and 
               flops his body out. Sallah, crouching behind the oil drum, 
               immediately starts pulling in the makeshift rope. Sallah 
               stuffs the rope in the oil drum and the two men begin waking 
               toward some tents.

                                     HUNGRY GERMAN (O.S.)
                         Hey, you! More water over here!

               Sallah glances at Indy, Then hurries back in that direction. 
               The Hungry German focuses on Indy.

                                     HUNGRY GERMAN
                         Why aren't you at the digs? Come 
                         here!

               Indy bows in wild subservience and hurries off in the opposite 
               direction.

                                     HUNGRY GERMAN
                              (yelling after him, 
                              irritated)
                         No, dummkopf, I said come!

               EXT. BETWEEN TWO TENTS - DAY

               Indy hustles between the tents. Up ahead, two German Officers 
               stop to talk, blocking his exit. He moves along the side of 
               one of the tents until he finds an opening and slips inside.

               INT. THE TENT

               Indy finds himself in a tent set up for rather comfortable 
               living. He has just started to cross it when he hears a loud, 
               excited grunting. He turns toward the sound. In the corner, 
               tied to a chair and gagged is Marion. Indy rushes to her, 
               snatches the gag from her mouth and embraces her. They kiss, 
               deep and long.

                                     INDY
                         I though you were dead.

                                     MARION
                         They were throwing me around like a 
                         rag doll.

                                     INDY
                         They must have switched baskets. 
                         Thank god for that! Bless those 
                         bastards. Have they hurt you?

                                     MARION
                         No. Not since I got here. They just 
                         asked about you - what you knew. The 
                         Frenchman's got the hot's for me. 
                         I've been playing that along. Oh, 
                         Indy, get me out of here.

               Indy pulls out a knife and then stops suddenly, thinking.

                                     MARION
                         What's wrong?

                                     INDY
                              (putting the knife 
                              away)
                         I have to leave you here for a little 
                         while. I know where the Ark is. If I 
                         take you out of here they'll start 
                         combing the place for us.

                                     MARION
                              (louder)
                         Cut me loose!

                                     INDY
                         Keep your voice down.

                                     MARION
                              (screaming)
                         I said get me out of -

               Indy pops the gag back in her mouth. Her eyes widen in fury 
               and she grunts obscenities at him.

                                     INDY
                         Look, you don't know how glad I am 
                         to see you. And I don't like doing 
                         this. But the whole thing will be 
                         shot if you don't just sit here 
                         quietly. They haven't hurt you in 
                         the last twenty-four hours, they 
                         aren't going to start now. I'll be 
                         back to get you in no time.

               He kisses her forehead, jumps up and hurries out of the tent.

               EXT. SAND DUNE OUTSIDE DIGS - DAY

               With the digs behind them, Indy and Sallah run up to the 
               ridge of the dune and over the top. At the bottom of the far 
               side, Omar's truck is parked. Omar and his men are waiting.

               EXT. DIFFERENT DUNE - DAY

               This new spot gives Indy a higher, better view of the whole 
               scene. Indy is using a surveyor's instrument to take a reading -

               WHAT HE SEES

               Looking through the instrument, Indy gets a line from the 
               map room through the site where the Nazis are digging in the 
               dunes to a spot several dunes over. We focus on that virgin 
               spot of well-hidden sand as -

                                     INDY
                         There!

               EXT. INDY'S DIG - DAY

               Omar's truck is parked at the spot just viewed from afar. 
               Dunes rise on either side. One of Omar's men has been posted 
               as a lookout up on a ridge. Everybody else - Indy, Sallah, 
               Omar, and his men - have begun digging for the Wells of the 
               Souls.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               SAME SCENE - NIGHT

               They continue to dig furiously, all of them drenched in sweat. 
               The hole has grown but this is slow, back-breaking work.

               INT. COMMAND TENT - TANIS DIGS - NIGHT

               Belloq, SHLIEMANN the ranking Nazi, and Shliemann's Aide, 
               GOBLER, come into the tent, which is full of charts and maps, 
               drawings of the Ark, radio equipment, liquor and food. The 
               men have been out digging for the Well all day. They are 
               tired, discouraged, testy. In all matters, Gobler shows his 
               alliance with Shliemann against Belloq with small looks and 
               body language. The Frenchman has disappointed them and he is 
               feeling the isolation of a scapegoat. Belloq gets himself a 
               drink as Shliemann towels off his face.

                                     BELLOQ
                         I cautioned you about being premature 
                         with that communiqué to Berlin. 
                         Archeology is not an exact science. 
                         If does not adhere to time schedules.

                                     SHLIEMANN
                         The Fuhrer is not a patient man. He 
                         demands constant reports and he 
                         expects progress. You led me to 
                         believe -

                                     BELLOQ
                         Nothing. I have made no promises. I 
                         said only that it looked very 
                         favorable. Perhaps the Ark will still 
                         be found in an adjoining chamber. 
                         Based on the information in our 
                         possession, my calculations were 
                         correct. Perhaps some bit of evidence 
                         still eludes us. Perhaps

                                     GOBLER
                         Perhaps the girl can help us.

               Belloq shoots him an angry look.

                                     SHLIEMANN
                         My feeling exactly. She was in 
                         possession of the original piece for 
                         years. She may know much.
                              (really evil)
                         If properly motivated...

                                     BELLOQ
                         I tell you, she knows nothing useful.

                                     SHLIEMANN
                         I'm surprised to find you squeamish. 
                         That is not your reputation. But it 
                         needn't concern you. I have the 
                         perfect man for this kind of work.

               Shliemann signals Gobler, who steps outside the tent a moment, 
               calls someone and then reappears. Belloq looks warily at the 
               entrance. After a moment Belzig enters, reeking villainy. 
               When his eyes find Shliemann, his superior, he snaps a crisp 
               "Heil, Hitler!" at him, holding his palm rigid a long time, 
               exposing a burned scar in the prefect shape of the sun 
               medallion.

               EXT. INDY'S DIG - NIGHT

               In the eerie conjunction of moonlight and torchlight, Indy 
               and the other men step back in awe of their discovery: there, 
               flush with the bottom of their pit, is a heavy stone entry 
               door to an underground chamber. Special prying tools are 
               produced. With two men assigned to each of the two long tools, 
               they work in unison to open the vault. They open it a foot 
               and the other men rush in to flop the heavy door completely 
               open. Down inside, only blackness.

               The men quickly prostrate themselves around the edge of the 
               entry to look inside. Indy and Sallah each take a torch and 
               hold them down the hole.

               WHAT THEY SEE

               The Well of the Souls is a spooky chamber thirty feet deep. 
               The walls are covered with hieroglyphics and carvings. The 
               roof is supported intermittently by stone pillars, the closest 
               of which hits the roof very near the entry hole. The Well is 
               quite large; as Indy and Sallah wave their torches, more and 
               more of the room is revealed. Now the far end of the chamber 
               comes into view. There is a stone altar down there and on 
               this elaborated carved platform is a stone chest, big enough 
               to enclose the Lost Ark and protect it from the ravages of 
               time. This altar appears to be the only place on the floor 
               of the Well that is not covered by a strange, dark carpet of 
               some kind.

                                     INDY
                         The Ark must be in that stone case. 
                         What's that gray stuff all over the 
                         floor -

               He breaks off realizing exactly what that carpet is. He 
               blanches. Indiana Jones blanches.

               Indy drops his torch to the floor of the Well. This is 
               answered by the most horrific HISSING imaginable.

               WHAT HE SEES

               That think dark carpet is moving. It's alive. It's thousands 
               and thousands of deadly poisonous snakes - Egyptian asps. 
               And the only thing that seems capable of avoiding this 
               venomous groundcover is the altar. The snakes ebb and flow 
               near it, but never encroach on it, as though repelled by 
               some invisible force.

               Indy shakes his head and talks to himself.

                                     INDY
                         Why snakes? Why did it have to be 
                         snakes? Anything else.

               After a moment of this, he stops. He gathers his energy and 
               resolve and gets back to the task.

                                     SALLAH
                         Asps. Very dangerous.

               Where Indy's torch had landed is a circle of snake-free floor. 
               The snakes hate the flame; they stay away.

                                     INDY
                         Lots of torches. And oil. I want a 
                         landing strip down there.

               INT. THE WELL OF THE SOULS

               Fifteen torches have been dropped to the floor of the chamber, 
               combining to make a good-sized clear zone. Smoke begins to 
               fill the room. Several canisters of oil have been lowered 
               into this space. Now, a large wooden crate is lowered slowly 
               by rope. Rope handles are attached to each end of the crate.

               Up at the hole, Indy gives Sallah a reassuring pat, takes a 
               breath, and swings carefully onto a rope hanging from the 
               hole. Despite his care, he swings a bit and his feet hit the 
               stone pillar which is so near the entry. Surprisingly, the 
               pillar actually moves a bit, showering a light rain of 
               crumbled stone to the floor below.

               Indy lands on the floor of the Well. He looks at the altar 
               over a sea of undulating death. He picks up an oil canister 
               and splashes two parallel lines of oil and lights them. A 
               path six feet wide begins to open to the altar. Behind Indy, 
               Sallah comes quickly down the rope.

               We begin to INTERCUT all the action in the Well from here on 
               with insert shots of the snakes outside the flames. Snakes 
               and snakes. We see: snakes piled and entwined six inches 
               deep; mother snakes laying snake eggs; snake eggs hatching 
               little snakes; snakes cannibalizing other snakes.

               INT. MARION'S TENT

               Belloq has been talking to the still-bound Marion. He has 
               removed her gag. He is impatient, angry, uncomfortable. Caught 
               between two forces.

                                     BELLOQ
                         Believe me, you made a mistake. If 
                         you would just give me something to 
                         placate them. Some bit of information.

                                     MARION
                         I swear to you, I know nothing more. 
                         I have no loyalty to Jones. He's 
                         brought me only trouble.

               He wants to believe her.

                                     BELLOQ
                         I cannot control them.

               Marion's frightened look shifts suddenly to the entrance of 
               the tent. There are new arrivals there - Shliemann, Gobler 
               and Belzig. Belzig carries a black leather case. He steps 
               forward and smiles at Marion.

                                     BELZIG
                         We meet again, Fraulein.

               EXT. INDY'S DIG - JUST BEFORE DAWN

               The sky is just beginning to lighten over the dunes to the 
               east, making dangerously obvious the thin column of smoke 
               rising from the entrance to the Well. Omar and his men are 
               peering through the smoke down into the Well.

               INT. THE WELL OF THE SOULS

               Indy and Sallah are on the altar. Pushing together with all 
               their strength, the heavy stone top of the protective chest 
               begins to slide away. Indy and Sallah exchange slightly wary 
               but very excited looks, then continue to push. As the Ark 
               begins to be exposed, the air seems to almost vibrate, to 
               become electrostatically charged. We hear what sounds like a 
               low HUM. The sea of snakes around the altar draws back further 
               from this presence.

               As the top of the stone chest is pushed completely off and 
               slams down beside it, we see THE LOST ARK OF THE COVENANT. 
               It is awesomely beautiful, breathtaking. 4 feet long, 2.5 
               feet wide and 2.5 feet high. It's height, however, is 
               increased by the two sculptured gold angels mounted facing 
               each other on the top. Though the body of the Ark is acacia 
               wood, it has been overlaid with gold. An elaborate gold crown 
               surrounds the top edge and gold carrying rings are attached 
               to each corner.

               Sallah is mesmerized by the sight. His hand starts to reach 
               out and touch one of the angels, but Indy grabs it.

                                     INDY
                         Don't touch it! Never touch it!

               The wooden crate stands open next to the stone chest. Now 
               Indy extracts the wooden poles from its rings and begins 
               fitting them through the rings in the Ark. This takes some 
               maneuvering by the two men, but soon they are able to lift 
               the Ark clear of the stone chest and into the wooden crate. 
               They extract the poles, fasten the top of the crate and stick 
               the poles through the rings of the wooden crate. They start 
               back toward the space under the hole.

               The fire strips have begun to dwindle, as have some of the 
               torches. The snakes move slowly in toward the clear spaces. 
               Indy and Sallah eye them nervously as they hurry along with 
               their heavy load. Under the hole, they hurriedly attach ropes 
               to the wooden crate and it is pulled up. Indy's concentration 
               is on the tide of snakes.

                                     INDY
                         Hurry up! Why did it have to be 
                         snakes?

               Sallah takes the next rope and climbs quickly out of the 
               Well. Indy has picked up a torch and now throws it at a pool 
               of snakes who are too close for his comfort. He turns and 
               takes hold of the exit rope. He gives it a first tug and it 
               falls down into the Well, landing partly beyond the ring of 
               fire where is instantly disappears in a tangle of angry, 
               hissing asps. Indy looks up at the hole.

                                     INDY
                         What the -

               Smiling down at him from the perimeter of the entry are 
               Belloq, Shliemann and Gobler.

                                     BELLOQ
                         Why, Dr. Jones, whatever are you 
                         doing in such a nasty place?

               Belloq and the Germans laugh.

                                     INDY
                         Why don't you fellows come down here? 
                         I'll show you.

                                     BELLOQ
                         No thank you, my friend.
                              (he glances around 
                              him)
                         I think we are all very comfortable 
                         up here.

               EXT. INDY'S DIG - DAWN

               Sunlight is flooding this tableau: Sallah, Omar and his men 
               are being held at bay by ten armed Nazis. The wooden crate 
               sits safely nearby. Belzig and another Nazi have the gagged 
               Marion held in their rough grasp.

                                     BELLOQ
                              (down to Indy)
                         After all these years, it is most 
                         considerate of you to aid me in this 
                         way.

               As Belloq speaks, Shliemann exchanges a look with Belzig. 
               Belzig smiles and takes the gag from Marion's mouth.

               INT. WELLS OF THE SOULS

               Shliemann smiles down at Indy.

                                     SHLIEMANN
                         I'm afraid we must be going now, Dr. 
                         Jones. Our prize is awaited in Berlin. 
                         But I do not wish to leave you down 
                         in that awful place...
                              (he give a sign)
                         ...all alone.

               Belzig and the Nazi move Marion to the hole and, to Belloq's 
               surprise, push her in. Marion falls thirty feet screaming. 
               Indy drops his torch, braces, and catches her! Her weight 
               knocks him to the ground, almost into the snakes. She looks 
               around at the snakes, clinging to him more desperately as he 
               struggles to his feet trying to unload her.

                                     MARION
                         Don't put me down!

               Up at the hole, there's plenty of dissension.

                                     BELLOQ
                         The girl was mine!

                                     SHLIEMANN
                         She is of no use to us. Only our 
                         mission for the Fuhrer matters.

               Shliemann glances meaningfully around at the other Nazis.

                                     SHLIEMANN
                         I wonder sometimes, Monsieur, if you 
                         have that clearly in mind.

               Belloq feels how much he is the outsider, his own 
               vulnerability. He backs down with the wisdom of survival. He 
               turns to look down at Indy and Marion. His manner is gallant.

                                     BELLOQ
                         Goodbye, mademoiselle.
                              (a pause, then with 
                              respect)
                         Indiana Jones... adieu!

               Belloq and the others step back from the hole and unseen 
               Nazis slam the heavy stone door into place. Marion screams. 
               Her scream is accompanied by -

               A huge WHOOSH! as air is sucked out and the chamber is sealed. 
               Half of the torches still burning go out with the sound. The 
               remaining torches continue to extinguish at punctuating 
               intervals throughout the following action and the snakes 
               immediately flood into the newly-darkened spaces. Indy puts 
               Marion down and snatches up two burning torches. He hands 
               one to Marion.

                                     INDY
                         Don't panic. There's plenty of time 
                         for that later. Wave that at anything 
                         that slithers.

               Indy holds his torch out like a lantern and begins a slow O-
               turn, his eyes peering into the gloom, examining every inch 
               of wall and ceiling.

                                     MARION
                         What are you doing?

                                     INDY
                         Just watch the floor.

               Reminded of the encroaching snakes, Marion waves her torch 
               at the nearest edge of their circle. She looks faint. Indy 
               continues his slow turn.

                                     MARION
                         Whatever you're doing, do it faster.

                                     INDY
                              (he spots something)
                         There!

               His head whips around, looking at the pillars around the 
               room. He sees what he wants. He grabs one of the oil 
               canisters, looks back to the spot on the wall he's chosen 
               and splashes oil on the floor in that direction, then lights 
               it. A path opens toward that wall.

                                     INDY
                         Come on!

               Marion is frozen in her spot. Indy drags her after him. He 
               splashes oil the rest of the way to the wall. It lights and 
               Indy pulls Marion over to the wall. He pours the remaining 
               oil in a circle around them, creating a safe zone there.

                                     INDY
                         Stay here!

                                     MARION
                              (grabbing him)
                         Where are you going?

                                     INDY
                         I'll be back in a minute. We're going 
                         through this wall.

               Marion looks at the wall, which looks like all the rest to 
               her. She thinks he's crazy.

                                     INDY
                         Just keep your eyes open and get 
                         ready to run. No matter what happens 
                         to me.

                                     MARION
                              (panicked)
                         What do you mean?

               Too late. Indy runs back through the path of flames to the 
               center of the room. Snakes strike as his flying heels. Indy 
               reaches the base of the pillar which he touched briefly on 
               his original descent. He uses his torch to clear away the 
               scattered snakes climbing on it, then pulls out his whip. He 
               draws it back, then wraps is solidly around the pillar 15 
               feet up. With the torch in his mouth, he begins climbing the 
               pillar. It moves ominously under his weight.

               The last two torches still burning on the floor go out. Now 
               the only light in the chamber is provided by the torches 
               held by Indy and Marion and the dwindling oil flames. Snakes 
               move in and surround the base of Indy's pillar. The path 
               between Marion and the center of the room is overrun. The 
               circle of flame around Marion is dying down. She looks beyond 
               it with terror-widened eyes, then up through the increasing 
               smoke at the distant Indy.

               Near the top of the pillar, Indy's hands strain along his 
               taut whip, which he has moves higher. A snake slithers into 
               view there, inches from Indy's straining face. Indy turns 
               his head so the torch in his mouth can burn it. The snake 
               falls from the pillar. Indy's torch is dwindling. Indy works 
               his body around so that he is on the side of the pillar away 
               from Marion. The pillar moves, showering dust. Indy looks at 
               the chamber wall five feet away, takes a breath and swings 
               his legs up against it. He is now braced between pillar and 
               wall.

                                     MARION (O.S.)
                              (screaming)
                         Where are you?!

               Snakes are moving in force up the pillar toward Indy's 
               dwindling torch. Indy grasps the pillar for dear life, 
               grimaces with exertion and pushes against the wall with all 
               he's got. The pillar begins to break loose of the ceiling, 
               then stops. Indy's eyes are on the torch. It is just a spot 
               of flame now. Snakes are sliding up toward his hands. Indy 
               again pushes against the wall and the torch falls out of his 
               mouth.

               The pillar goes! In the dim light, we see it fall like a 
               tree directly at Marion. Indy rides it down. The top hits 
               the wall three feet from a cringing Marion and smashes through 
               to a black chamber beyond. Indy flies off into the darkness. 
               Gone. Marion clutches her torch at the black hole.

                                     MARION
                         Indy! Where are you?! Please Lord!

               There is a moment that seems an eternity, then Indy appears 
               like an apparition out of the void.

                                     INDY
                         Come on!

               He grabs her and helps her over the remains of the wall into -

               INT. THE CATACOMBS

               The winding string of connected chambers is revealed to them 
               only a few feet at a time as their torch lights the way.

                                     MARION
                         The snakes... are they here?

                                     INDY
                         I guess not. I think I'd be dead.

                                     MARION
                         Do you know where you're going?

                                     INDY
                         Absolutely.

                                     MARION
                         Thank god. Where?

                                     INDY
                         Out.

               They round a corner and flush a covey of bats. Marion screams.

                                     INDY
                         Don't do that. It scares me.

               Marion gives him a look. They round a corner and begin a 
               walk through a maze of chambers that present for their 
               inspection: moldering mummies and stacked sarcophagi; a room 
               decorated with a thousand human skulls; a wall crawling with 
               huge scarabaeid beetles. Marion is quite naturally a nervous 
               wreck; she jumps when Indy grabs her suddenly and points.

                                     INDY
                         Look!

               WHAT THEY SEE

               There, coming through the crack in the corner of the next 
               chamber, is white blessed sunlight.

               EXT. THE TANIS DIGS - NEAR AIRSTRIP - DAY

               Indy and Marion peek out into the light from the shadows of 
               an abandoned excavation. Before them is the improvised 
               airstrip serving the digs: a crude runway, a tent supply 
               depot, two fuel tank trucks. Down by the fuel trucks a German 
               Mechanic is looking skyward. Now Indy and Marion look there 
               too, drawn by the roaring sound of -

               A Flying Wing, which is circling over the digs in preparation 
               to landing.

               Now a new figure approaches the German Mechanic. It is Gobler; 
               he yells to the mechanic, indicating the plane.

                                     GOBLER
                         Get is gassed immediately! It has an 
                         important cargo to take out!

               In the distance, the Flying Wing lands and rolls toward the 
               men. Gobler spins and heads back toward the main camp, which 
               is hidden from view by a rise. Indy and Marion watch him go.

                                     INDY
                         When the Ark gets loaded, we're 
                         already going to be on that plane.

               The Flying Wing rolls up into the space near the fuel trucks. 
               The German Mechanic puts blue blocks in front of the tires 
               as the engines continue to roar.

               Indy and Marion run in a crouch to a hiding spot closer to 
               the plane, near the supply tent. Suddenly, a Second German 
               Mechanic appears behind them. He is as surprised as they 
               are, but recovers quickly and swings a big monkey wrench at 
               Indy. Indy grabs the swinging arm and the two men tumble out 
               into the open, wrestling. Marion remains hidden, moving fast 
               among the crates.

               The first German Mechanic, who is just pulling the fuel hose 
               from the tank truck to the plane, sees the combatants and 
               runs to help his countryman. He is almost upon them when 
               Indy puts the Second German away with a devastating left - 
               right - left combination. He turns to find the first German 
               Mechanic flying at him. The roll toward the rear of the Flying 
               Wing and its lethally spinning reversed propellers.

               In the cockpit of the Flying Wing, the Pilot has been fiddling 
               with his gauges just prior to shutting off his engines. Now 
               he notices the fight going on outside.

               The fistfight between Indy and the German Mechanic has taken 
               on a new stomach-tightening dimension. The men are fighting 
               and flailing in and out between the spinning props at the 
               back of the plane's wings. Each man comes within inches of 
               becoming instant mincemeat.

               The Pilot slides away the top of his cockpit and stands up. 
               He pulls a Luger from his side and points it, waiting for a 
               clear shot at Indy. The German Mechanic kicks Indy away from 
               him and the Pilot aims his pistol. Suddenly, Marion appears 
               behind the Pilot, standing on the opposite wing, and bashes 
               him over the head with one of the blue blocks that was holding 
               the tires. The Pilot drops down into the cockpit, his body 
               falling on the throttle. The engines roar louder, revving 
               up. The plane begins to roll, rotating around its one still-
               blocked set of tires. Marion grabs onto the cockpit to keep 
               from slipping into the props. She bends into the cockpit, 
               trying to pull the Pilot's body off the throttle. No luck. 
               She grimaces and climbs inside. Her shoulder bumps the top 
               of the cockpit; it slides tightly shut above her.

               Under the moving wing, Indy delivers a knockout rightcross 
               to the German Mechanic which sends him staggering back toward 
               a roaring propeller. Indy's grimace registers the man's demise 
               and a fine mist of blood wafts toward him. Indy spins toward 
               the sound of crumpling metal and sees -

               The other prop of the Flying Wing slice into a tank truck. 
               The airplane fuel inside floods out onto the pavement, 
               surrounding the plane. Indy backpedals away from the plane, 
               his eyes searching the scene for Marion. Suddenly, he is 
               shocked to see her in the cockpit. He runs toward her, 
               skidding through the gasoline.

                                     INDY
                         Get out! Get out!

               Marion is struggling with the top of the cockpit. She can't 
               budge it. She's trapped.

               EXT. THE COMMAND TENT - DAY

               Three Armed Nazis stand guard around the wooden crate 
               containing the Ark. It is sitting near the flopped-open 
               entrance to the Command Tent and there is furious activity 
               going on here. Belloq, Shliemann, Gobler, Belzig and assorted 
               Aides are packing up all the papers and personal items in 
               preparation for a hasty departure.

               A large crowd of Arab Diggers is milling about among the 
               tents. They all want to get a look at the Ark. Sallah is 
               among them. All at once, there is a earthshaking explosion. 
               Al eyes turn toward the rise that hides the airstrip. A huge 
               fireball floats into view over there. Everyone starts running 
               toward it. Shliemann yells at Belzig and the Armed Nazis.

                                     SHLIEMANN
                         Stay with the Ark!

               EXT. THE RISE ABOVE AIRSTRIP - DAY

               Almost all the Arabs and Germans in the digs have congregated 
               here and are staring at the burning remains of the Flying 
               Wing. Belloq and Shliemann arrive just as the second fuel 
               truck blows up. The concussion knocks many of the observers 
               flat. Belloq, Shliemann and Gobler watch the scene in alarm.

                                     SHLIEMANN
                         Sabotage!

                                     BELLOQ
                         We must get the Ark away from this 
                         place immediately!

                                     SHLIEMANN
                              (to Gobler)
                         Have it put on the truck. We'll fly 
                         out of Cairo.

               Gobler snaps his heels, turns to go.

                                     SHLIEMANN
                         And Gobler -
                              (Gobler stops)
                         I want plenty of protection.

               Gobler nods and runs off. Shliemann heads back toward camp. 
               Belloq hesitates a long moment, studying the burning wreckage 
               with an odd, suspicious look. Finally, he turns and leaves, 
               passing a nearby stack of barrels. When he has passed, Sallah 
               appears from among the barrels. He searches the crowd for 
               his people and starts a broken field run along some tents to 
               avoid a group of Germans and is running flat-out when someone 
               sticks out a leg and sends him flipping. Sallah, dust all 
               over his face, looks angrily toward the concealed culprit. 
               At once, a flashing white grin splits his darkened face. 
               Indy and Marion, splotched with soot and oil, are hiding in 
               the flap of a tent. Sallah runs into their arms and the three 
               embrace warmly. When they break -

                                     SALLAH
                         Holy smoke, my friends! I am so 
                         pleased you are not dead.

                                     MARION
                         Us too.

                                     SALLAH
                              (suddenly remembering)
                         The Ark! They're taking it on a truck 
                         to Cairo.

                                     INDY
                         Where is it?

               Sallah gestures to follow and all three run off stealthily 
               through the mostly deserted camp.

               EXT. AMONG THE TENTS - DAY

               Sallah, Indy and Marion run into a hiding spot behind some 
               water barrels near the Command Tent. They peek out at this 
               activity -

               In the big space near the Command Tent is parked an open 
               German staff car; inside is a Blond Driver and an Armed Guard. 
               Directly behind it is a canvas-topped troop truck. At this 
               moment, Belloq and Shliemann are supervising the careful 
               placement of the crated Ark in the back of the truck. When 
               it is securely placed inside, we hear an ominous marching 
               sound and Nine Armed Nazis appear at a trot from between 
               some tents and climb into the back of the truck with the 
               Ark.

               Behind the water barrels, Sallah and Marion exchange hapless 
               looks, But Indy just concentrates on -

               The scene by the truck: Belloq and Shliemann are about to 
               climb into the front staff car when they pause to check out 
               the final component of the convoy. Rolling into place behind 
               the truck is another open staff car. But this one is special - 
               mounted in the back is a big, black machine gun, manned by a 
               Gunner. At the wheel of the car is Gobler and next to him 
               sits Belzig.

               Sallah and Marion look at Indy. Belloq and Shliemann climb 
               in the back seat of the front car and the caravan pulls out. 
               Indy watches it go, thinking hard.

                                     INDY
                         You two get back to Cairo quick and 
                         get us transportation to England - a 
                         plane, a ship, anything.

                                     MARION
                         What about you?

                                     INDY
                         I'm going to get that truck. I'll 
                         meet you at Omar's. Be ready for me.

               Sallah nods. Marion looks at him like he's nuts. Indy jumps 
               up, looks around desperately.

                                     MARION
                         How are you going to get that truck?

                                     INDY
                              (still searching)
                         I don't know. I'm making this up as 
                         I go.

               He runs away between two tents.

               EXT. AT THE EDGE OF THE DIGS - DAY

               From among the tents, Indy suddenly bursts into view, happily 
               astride a magnificent white Arabian stallion. He gallops off 
               across the desert.

               EXT. THE DESERT (VARIOUS SHOTS) - DAY

               Indy cuts cross-country avoiding the road the convoy has 
               taken. He leaps gullies, climbs dunes, slides down slopes. 
               Soon the convoy comes into view far below him. He tears along 
               a parallel ridge, like an Indian shadowing a wagon train.

               EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY

               The convoy is entering rougher country. The narrow mountain 
               road we've seen earlier ascends ahead. To the side of the 
               road are tall boulders. Suddenly, Indy shoots out from between 
               two rocks and rides directly for the truck. The Armed Nazis 
               in the back of the truck can see nothing because the canvas 
               hides their view. But Gobler, Belzig and the Gunner in the 
               rear staff car have a brief line on him. Belzig points and 
               the Gunner fires away and Indy, the bullets kicking up sand 
               near Indy's horse.

               The Armed Guard in the cab of the truck leans out to see 
               what's happening. Indy has been riding alongside. Now he 
               stands on the horse and leaps to the cab. In a second, he 
               has flipped the Armed Guard out of the truck. He slides into 
               the cab and begins grappling with the Truck Driver. The Truck 
               Driver tries to hit the brakes, but Indy kicks his foot away 
               and floors the gas pedal. The truck doubles its speed and 
               shoots onto the steep mountain road.

               EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

               The Blond Driver of the front staff car sees the truck move 
               up on him in the rearview mirror and speeds up. Belloq, 
               Shliemann and the Armed Guard in the car twist around to 
               look at the struggle in the truck. The Blond Driver begins 
               what will be a continuing preview of the twists in the road. 
               He turns his wheel sharply and takes the lead car around a 
               bend.

               In the cab of the truck, Indy and the Truck Driver stop their 
               fight temporarily and cooperate in turning the steering wheel. 
               The truck barely stays on the road.

               A full view reveals the incredible geography of this ride. 
               The convoy in tiny against the spectacular mountainside, the 
               cliffs drop hundreds of feet.

               At the wheel of the rear car, Gobler swerves to stay on the 
               road and accidentally sideswipes a boulder. The Gunner perched 
               in the back is flipped head over heels out of the car. Gobler 
               and Belzig are having trouble seeing the road through all 
               the dust the convoy is kicking up.

               The lead staff car reaches the summit of the road and barely 
               makes the hairpin turn there, delivering a destructive blow 
               to the guard rail that has been placed there. The guard rail 
               is now bent.

               In the cab of the truck, Indy and the Truck Driver again 
               stop trying to choke each other long enough to negotiate the 
               turn together. The bumper of the truck hits the broken guard 
               rail and sends it flying off the cliff. The truck, however, 
               holds the road.

               In the rear car, Gobler and Belzig are trying to see through 
               the thick clouds of dust. Suddenly is clears completely. 
               Unfortunately for them, this happens because their car has 
               shot out into space at the hairpin turn. They are flying to 
               their final reward. Belzig, eyes wide behind his evil 
               spectacles, screams as he goes.

               In the cab of the truck, the Truck Driver is distracted by 
               the sight of the flying staff car. Indy plasters him and he 
               tumbles out.

               Far, far below, Belzig's staff car explodes on the rocks.

               In the back of the truck, a TOUGH SERGEANT takes command of 
               the situation. He picks out six Armed Nazis and motions for 
               them to start climbing around the outside of the truck to 
               the cab. With some trepidation the lucky ones begin that 
               maneuver. The truck is swerving like crazy.

               In the front staff car, the Armed Guard aims his submachine 
               guns back at Indy, alone now in the truck's cab. Shliemann 
               knocks the barrel roughly away.

                                     SHLIEMANN
                              (yelling)
                         If anything happens to that Ark, 
                         we're all dead men ! The Fuhrer will 
                         see to it!

               Indy sees this from the cab and reacts by speeding up, putting 
               even more pressure on the Blond Driver.

               Along the back of the truck, Armed Nazis are edging up toward 
               the cab, three on each side. They hang on as the truck rounds 
               a corner and goes into a straightaway that leads through a 
               short tunnel.

               In the cab, Indy has been concentrating on the lead staff 
               car. Now, just before entering the tunnel, he looks in the 
               side view mirror and sees the Nazis on his side. A quick 
               glance to the other mirror reveals the others. As the truck 
               sweeps into the tunnel, we see Indy just start to turn his 
               steering wheel - he is going to sideswipe the walls of the 
               tunnel

               At the other end of the tunnel, we hear the roar of the two 
               engine and two long, screeching, scraping sounds. The lead 
               staff car shoots out of the tunnel, then the truck, its sides 
               cleaned of Nazis.

               In the rear of the truck, the Tough Sergeant is looking with 
               distaste back at the tunnel. There remains only him and two 
               Armed Nazis with the Ark. He sends these two climbing up 
               over the top of the truck.

               In the lead car, the Blond Driver is being pressed hard by 
               Indy, who now edges up to bump them from the rear. Suddenly 
               the Armed Guard next to the Driver sees the two Armed Nazis 
               appear on the top of the truck. Without thinking, he starts 
               to point them out to Shliemann, then realizes his stupidity.

               In the cab, Indy has seen this and is at first mystified. He 
               checks his sideview mirrors. Then he figures it out and slams 
               on his brakes. The brakes lock, the wheels burn and the truck 
               skids to a dusty halt. The two Armed Nazis fly off the truck, 
               over the cab to the road in front. Indy immediately hits the 
               gas again. The two Armed Nazis, just aiming their weapons, 
               get wiped out.

               In the rear of the truck, the crated Ark is bouncing all 
               alone, no one in sight, because -

               The Tough Sergeant is on the top of the truck, making his 
               way steadily forward. This guy clearly knows what he's doing. 
               A submachine gun is slung across his back.

               The truck and the staff car race through a series of S-curves. 
               In the staff car, Belloq and Shliemann spot the Tough Sergeant 
               as he reaches the front of the truck's top and begins to 
               lower his submachine gun barrel toward the cab. Indy is 
               unaware. Belloq and Shliemann exchange looks. Then Shliemann 
               yells to the Armed Guard in the front seat.

               The Tough Sergeant has a line on Indy. He points his gun. 
               The Armed Guard blasts away at the truck. The Tough Sergeant 
               dies in a hail of bullets and flies off.

               Indy, who has ducked at the gunfire, is confused. But when 
               he sees the Armed Guard up front lower his gun, Indy again 
               floors it and begins bumping the staff car in earnest.

               The road is almost down to a level now. In the distance - 
               Cairo. The road takes a little dogleg just before reaching 
               level ground again. Just as the staff car is about to make 
               the turn, Indy smashes them from behind. The staff car flies 
               off the road and down a twenty foot embankment. Indy takes 
               the truck speeding down the road and off toward Cairo.

               In the staff car, the occupants are bruised but safe. 
               Shliemann points at the departing truck and yells at the 
               Blond Driver. The staff car fishtails out of its sandy resting 
               place and takes off after the truck.

               EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF CAIRO (VARIOUS SHOTS) - DAY

               Indy has an ever-decreasing lead on the staff car as the 
               race thunders into the narrow streets. People and animals 
               leap out of the way; carts and barrels go flying helter 
               skelter. Indy takes the truck down a street so narrow there 
               are only inches to spare on each side. Pedestrians jump into 
               doorways.

               EXT. OMAR'S SQUARE - DAY

               When the truck clears the narrow street, it is in a small 
               square. Omar's garage is gaping open on the opposite side. 
               Indy hits the brakes and the truck skids across the square 
               and into the garage. The garage door slams shut and tenting 
               drops from the building to hide the door. Various Arabs, 
               friends of Omar, rush out with fruit carts and baskets and 
               set up a mini-bazaar in seconds. Two Arab Boys sweep the 
               tracks of the truck into oblivion. They throw aside their 
               brooms just as the staff car appears from the narrow street. 
               Belloq and Shliemann look around desperately as the Blond 
               Driver steers the car through the square and out the other 
               side.

               EXT. CAIRO DOCKS - NIGHT

               The waterfront is dark and misty. An old tramp steamer, the 
               BANTU WIND, sits by the pier. Several fierce Black African 
               Pirates, the crewmembers, are taking on final stores.

               A small light illuminates the top of the gangplank. In its 
               circle, Indy and Marion exchange long, warm embraces with 
               Sallah. A short distance away the ship's Captain, a handsome, 
               powerful black named SIMON KATANGA, watches from the rail, 
               smoking a pipe.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. OPEN SEA - THE MEDITERRANEAN - NIGHT

               The Bantu Wind is bathed in moonlight as it cuts across even 
               seas.

               INT. INDY'S CABIN - NIGHT

               Indy comes in, takes off his hat, jacket, whip and holster. 
               The door which connects this cabin to the next opens and 
               Marion appears. She is carrying a half-full glass of liquor, 
               but what you notice is the long, snow-white, high-necked 
               nightgown she is wearing. It is very prim. Very innocent. 
               And very sexy. Marion does a slightly embarrassed model's 
               turn for Indy.

                                     MARION
                         I have a feeling I'm not the first 
                         woman to travel with these pirates. 
                         There's a whole wardrobe in there.

                                     INDY
                         It's lovely.

               Indy sits on the cot, takes off his boots. He leans back 
               against the wall and rubs his eyes. Marion sits on the bed, 
               leans back against the wall with him and looks down at her 
               white nightgown. She chuckles.

                                     MARION
                         I feel like a virgin bride in this.

                                     INDY
                         That's what you look like.

                                     MARION
                              (takes a drink)
                         There are some things you can 
                         recapture in this life, but that 
                         isn't one of them.

                                     INDY
                         What would you like to recapture?

                                     MARION
                              (after a long pause)
                         Nothing. That is the way it is.

               He watches her closely as she drains her glass and puts it 
               down.

                                     INDY
                         Did I ever say I was sorry I burned 
                         down your tavern?

               She turns so their lips are very close.

                                     MARION
                         No. Then again, I burned up that 
                         plane.

                                     INDY
                         You saved my life.

                                     MARION
                         And you saved mine.

                                     INDY
                         Seems things have worked out kind of 
                         even.

                                     MARION
                         That's the way I like them.

                                     INDY
                         Maybe we should consider all past 
                         accounts closed.

               Marion thinks about this a long time.

                                     MARION
                         No. Not yet.

                                     INDY
                         What else?

               She looks into his eyes. A smile jumps from her lips to his. 
               He kisses her and they sink slowly to the cot.

               INT. IN THE HOLD

               The ship's rats are agitated. They tremble and chatter at 
               the edges of the compartment, darting about. Out in the center 
               of the hold, sitting all by itself, is the crated Ark. HUM-M-
               M-M.

               INT. INDY'S CABIN - DAY

               Marion awakes with a start, alone in the cot. Something's 
               wrong. The ship is quiet. Indy is strapping on his holster. 
               He pulls his ship and jacket from a hook.

                                     MARION
                         What is it?

                                     INDY
                         The engines have shut down.

                                     MARION
                         Why?

                                     INDY
                         I'm going to find out.

               EXT. LOWER DECK - DAY

               Indy runs toward the bow, then climbs some steps four at a 
               time. A MESSENGER PIRATE is hurrying to get him, but flies 
               by him on the steps. By the time the Pirate stops himself, 
               Indy is gone.

                                     MESSENGER PIRATE
                         Mister Jones! The Captain he say -

               EXT. THE BRIDGE - DAY

               Captain Katanga is looking with concern ahead of the ship. 
               Indy appears behind him.

                                     INDY
                         What's wrong?

                                     KATANGA
                         You have most important friends.

               Katanga turns quickly, pointing with a sweeping hand. Indy 
               looks. Arrayed in a rough semicircle around the ship are ten 
               German Wolf Submarines. All of their deck guns are manned 
               and trained on the Bantu Wind. Worse, at least five heavily-
               armed boarding parties in rafts are closing quickly on the 
               ship.

                                     INDY
                         Holy shit.

                                     KATANGA
                              (fast)
                         I sent my man for you. You and the 
                         girl must disappear. We have a place 
                         in the hold. Go, my friend!

               EXT. UPPER DECK - DAY

               Indy tears along the deck. He looks over the rail and sees 
               two Nazi rafts already next to the ship.

               EXT. LOWER DECK - DAY

               Indy flies down some stairs and starts to round a corner. 
               Suddenly he throws himself backwards, out of view. Three 
               uniformed Nazis are clustered near a cabin door holding the 
               Messenger Pirate. Now two more come out of the cabin trying 
               to maintain their grasp on a kicking, yelling Marion. She is 
               still wearing her white nightgown. More Nazis clamber onto 
               the deck and head toward Indy, slamming open doors, rousting 
               Pirates, spouting racial epithets. Indy steps backwards and 
               fades into the maze of the ship.

               EXT. / INT. THE BANTU WINDS (VARIOUS SHOTS) - DAY

               The ship is swarming with Nazis. The Black Pirates are herded 
               forward, subjected to rough physical and verbal abuse by the 
               Aryan Supermen. The Pirates are clearly under orders not to 
               resist, but not one of these strong men likes it. They'd 
               gladly give their lives to rip the throat out of a few Krauts. 
               In the hold, the door slams open and Nazis pour in; they 
               smile at the sight of the crated Ark.

               EXT. THE BRIDGE - DAY

               Captain Katanga watches as his crew is crowded into a circle 
               of Nazis on the wide deck below him. He is surrounded by 
               Belloq, Shliemann, and several Nazis, two of whom are holding 
               Marion. Now the Nazis from the hold appear on the lower deck 
               carrying the crated Ark by means of the long poles. Belloq's 
               eyes shine at the sight.

                                     SHLIEMANN
                         Take it aboard the Wurrfler!

                                     BELLOQ
                         And be very careful!

               The Ark is taken away.

                                     SHLIEMANN
                              (to a Sergeant below)
                         What about Jones?

                                     SERGEANT
                         Not a trace yet, sir!

                                     KATANGA
                         Jones is dead.

               Belloq and Shliemann regard him suspiciously.

                                     KATANGA
                         We killed him. He was of no use to 
                         us. The girl, however, has certain 
                         value where we are headed. She will 
                         bring a very good price. If that 
                         cargo you have taken was your goal, 
                         then go in peace with it. But leave 
                         us the girl. It will reduce our loss 
                         on this trip.

                                     SHLIEMANN
                         Savage. You are not in a position to 
                         ask for anything. We will take what 
                         we wish and then decide whether or 
                         not to blow your ship from the water.

               Belloq steps forward and puts a proprietary hand on Marion's 
               arm, fixing Shliemann with a steady look.

                                     BELLOQ
                         That girl goes with me. It will be 
                         part of my compensation. I'm sure 
                         the Fuhrer would approve.

               Shliemann considers.

                                     BELLOQ
                         If she fails to please me, you can 
                         do with her as you wish.

               This appeals to Shliemann's nature. He signals his agreement 
               with a gesture. Belloq ushers Marion away with her two 
               keepers.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. "THE WURRFLER" - CONNING TOWER - DAY

               The Nazis have returned to their subs. Shliemann is on the 
               bridge with the WURRFLER'S CAPTAIN and the Captain's Aides. 
               The Captain is an honorable career Navy man.

                                     THE WURRFLER'S CAPTAIN
                         Colonel Shliemann, all torpedoes are 
                         loaded.

               Shliemann nods and continues to stare at the Bantu Wind, as 
               does the Captain. The Pirate crew is all lined across the 
               bow. Towering above the others, standing on the rail, proud 
               and defiant, is Katanga. Shliemann looks at the Wurrfler's 
               Captain a moment.

                                     SHLIEMANN
                         What do you think, Captain?

                                     THE WURRFLER'S CAPTAIN
                              (earnestly)
                         I think not, Colonel. Nothing is to 
                         be gained. We are not at war.

               Shliemann mulls this, then turns to the hatch.

                                     SHLIEMANN
                         ...yet. Let the vermin live. We must 
                         be on our way.

               Shliemann disappears down the hatch. The Captain is very 
               pleased. A Radioman speaks into his headset, then follows 
               the other Aides down the hatch. In the distance the other 
               subs begin to move away from the ship. The Captain, alone on 
               the bridge, looks once more at Katanga.

               On the Bantu Wind, Katanga executes what might be taken for 
               a salute.

               The Wurrfler's Captain smiles, salutes crisply, then goes 
               below, pulling the hatch closed. Immediately, the Wurrfler 
               begins to move. And as it does, we see the rail at the aft 
               of the main deck. From nowhere, a wet sleeve appears and a 
               hand grabs the rail!

               Indy pulls his dripping body onto the sub's main deck. He 
               has lost his felt hat once and for all. Other than that, his 
               outfit is the same as always, just wetter. Suddenly, water 
               is washing over his feet; the Wurrfler is beginning to 
               submerge. Indy runs through quickly deepening water toward 
               the haven of the conning tower. Halfway there, he slips and 
               goes down. Only by grabbing the base of the aftmast light 
               does he keep from being swept away. He struggles to his feet 
               and sloshes through knee-deep water to the base of the conning 
               tower.

               Indy climbs the ladder to the bridge of the conning tower 
               and looks down. The water is rising toward his fast. Indy 
               climbs the ladder to the top of the turret and braces himself 
               between the two uprights there - the 7 foot radio mast and 
               the 20 foot periscope. Still the ocean comes up to meet him. 
               Soon the top of the turret is under water and the radio mast 
               is disappearing. Indy shifts his grip to the periscope, 
               working his way up it and hanging on for dear life as the 
               ocean whips at his body. The periscope is quickly going under. 
               Indy hangs on to the top three feet, all that remains above.

               The forward movement of the sub continues, but, to Indy's 
               slowly dawning delight, the dive stops. No more of the 
               periscope goes under. Indy smiles; it's a pretty good smile, 
               too, given the circumstances. Indy pulls out his bullwhip 
               and begins tying himself to the periscope.

               EXT. THE PERISCOPE - AFTERNOON

               The sun warms that part of his body Indy has contrived to 
               keep out of the water. The rest floats out behind. Indy isn't 
               comfortable, but all in all, it's not as terrible as he might 
               have feared.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. THE PERISCOPE - DUSK

               It's as terrible as Indy might have feared. He looks wasted. 
               Waterlogged and exhausted. The wet leather of the whip is 
               contracting and he must struggle constantly to keep it from 
               cutting into his skin.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. THE OCEAN - NIGHT

               Several shark fins cut the surface, appearing and disappearing 
               in the bright moonlight. They are shadowing -

               EXT. THE PERISCOPE - NIGHT

               Indy looks through barely open eyes at the sharks running 
               alongside. There is nothing to be done. His eyes close.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               FADE IN:

               EXT. THE PERISCOPE - NIGHT

               The submarine has stopped. The water is calm. The moon is 
               bright. A gentle swell splashes Indy awake. He blinks, tries 
               to regain his senses. He makes an inventory of his body. 
               Surprised to find himself intact, his spirits lift. Some 
               hidden reserve of energy flows through him. He frees his 
               aching arms from the wet leather of his whip, leaving only 
               one loop around his waist to hold him to the sub. He rubs 
               his hands and stretches. Once again, he has survived. To 
               fight again. He looks around.

               WHAT HE SEES

               A lovely island. No sign of man's presence. The sub has 
               stopped at the mouth of a wide cove completely ringed by 
               tall white rock cliffs. Suddenly the sub begins to move again. 
               It is headed directly toward the center of the cliffs. Indy 
               holds on, mystified, alert. When the cliffs are very close, 
               the sub begins to dive.

                                     INDY
                         Damn!

               He thinks hard. Inspiration hits just before the water. Indy 
               flips his leather jacket up over his head and holds the jacket 
               out in front of him. His head is hidden by the jacket as he 
               goes under water.

               INT. THE UNDERWATER TUNNEL - NIGHT

               The sub enters an underwater tunnel that penetrates into the 
               cliffs. Indy is held to the periscope by his crossed legs 
               and the whip. His impromptu air bubble is working, but it's 
               a struggle to maintain it.

               The sub begins to cut through think marine vegetation. Each 
               dangling growth pulls at Indy's body and slaps at his leather 
               bubble. Now a clump of entwined seaweed rips the leather out 
               of his hands and his bubble of air rises away. Indy hangs 
               on, holding his breath, but the vegetation gets denser. 
               Finally, it pulls him off the periscope. The sub moves on, 
               disappearing ahead.

               Indy rises desperately through the dark water, his hand 
               outstretched. Then, almost simultaneously, hand and head hit 
               solid rock. But no air. Indy feels along the ceiling of rock. 
               Nothing. It's all submerged.

               Indy dives, stroking deep into the tunnel. When he has 
               descended 15 feet, he grabs a vine and steadies himself. His 
               eyes search the dim roof of the tunnel. He sees his last 
               hope in the distance - a small blue circle, an air pocket. 
               He swims for it.

               In the air pocket, Indy's head breaks the surface and smashes 
               into rock again. The pocket is only six inches deep. No 
               matter. Indy loves it. He'd like to move in. He gulps air.

               INT. THE SUB BASE - DOCKING BAY

               The Wurrfler has arrived at an extraordinary base built in 
               the hollow interior of the island. This chamber, with the 
               docking bay, is almost all water. A huge natural cavern, it 
               has been reinforced and enlarged by the Germans.

               The Wurrfler sits surfaced at the dock. The Ark has been 
               unloaded and placed on a cart. Shliemann, Belloq and Marion 
               have just disembarked and been met by a Nazi contingent from 
               the base. Marion looks worse for the trip. Her white nightgown 
               is now ripped and smudged.

               One of the greeting Nazis, a TALL CAPTAIN, salutes Shliemann 
               and Belloq. As he speaks to them, we notice that right behind 
               this group, just above a great deal of sub unloading activity, 
               Indy's whip hangs from the periscope. Working Nazis pass 
               within feet of it unaware; the Tall Captain would see it in 
               a moment if he were not so focused on the new arrivals.

                                     TALL CAPTAIN
                              (to Belloq)
                         The tents have been arranged in 
                         accordance with your radioed 
                         instructions, sir.

                                     BELLOQ
                         Good. We must take the Ark there 
                         now.

               Shliemann looks a little unhappy about this exchange, but 
               says nothing. The group moves swiftly toward the end of a 
               mine train arrangement. The train, consisting of small, 
               separate, electric-powered cars, sits on a track which 
               disappears into a tunnel cut in the rock.

               On the turret of the Wurrfler, the Wurrfler's Captain lights 
               a cigarette as he watches the mine train disappear, then 
               returns his attention to the activity on the dock. He leans 
               idly against the periscope, his head two feet below Indy's 
               dangling whip. Something catches his eye, he yells an order 
               and climbs down from the turret to deal with the matter. We 
               hold on the whip for a long moment, until its owner's hand 
               appears and quickly reclaims it.

               INT. TRAIN TUNNEL

               The Ark and its entourage are moving slowly up the tight 
               dark tunnel, their way lit by intermittent lanterns. The 
               tunnel is irregular, but generally about 7 feet wide. It's 
               height varies from an average of about 7 feet to a low of 
               only about 4.5 feet at the points (every 40 feet) where 
               support beams cross the track. The result is that there is 
               only about a foot of clearance above the mine cars at those 
               points; passengers must duck to keep from being hit in the 
               head. Shliemann, looking worried, and Belloq, very excited, 
               are focused on the Ark in the car ahead.

                                     SHLIEMANN
                         I am uncomfortable with the thought 
                         of this -
                              (spitting it out)
                         Jewish ritual. Are you sure it's 
                         necessary?

                                     BELLOQ
                              (playing him)
                         Let me ask you this - Would you be 
                         more comfortable opening the Ark in 
                         Berlin - for the Fuhrer - and finding 
                         out only then if the sacred pieces 
                         of the Covenant are inside? Knowing, 
                         only then, whether you have 
                         accomplished your mission and obtained 
                         the one, true Ark?

               Shliemann doesn't like any of his alternatives. He looks at 
               Belloq with some suspicion as the train comes into bright 
               light.

               INT. COMMAND CENTER

               A second natural cavern, even bigger than the first, has 
               been worked over by the Germans into a rectangular, three-
               story high supply center around a huge, open, center court. 
               Uniformed Nazi Soldiers are everywhere, wrangling supplies 
               and ammunition, monitoring electronic equipment. At the far 
               end of the court, a second train tunnel disappears into the 
               rock.

               Across the open court, Belloq sees his destination: a large, 
               brilliant white silk tent has been erected in the midst of 
               all this hardware. It looks incongruous, and more than a 
               little eerie. It is the Tabernacle.

               INT. TRAIN TUNNEL

               Indy is making his way up the tunnel. He hears cars coming 
               from up ahead and steps into the shadows. A mine car passes 
               with several laughing Nazis. Indy continues on his way.

               INT. THE TABERNACLE

               The light in here is lovely, unearthly. Oil lamps burn. The 
               Tabernacle is really several concentric, silk tents, which 
               creates a flowing maze effect. The innermost tent has at its 
               center a 3-foot high, tapestry-covered altar. Belloq watches 
               with gleaming, obsessed eyes as two Nazis carefully lift the 
               actual Ark out of its crate by means of the long poles. The 
               Ark dazzles the eye, seeming to glow gold in this strange 
               light. The two Nazis place it carefully on the altar. 
               Shliemann and some Aides hang back. Marion is nowhere to be 
               seen.

               INT. COMMAND CENTER - END OF TUNNEL

               Indy makes a fast break from the shadows of the tunnel to 
               the protection of a high stack of supplies. He climbs the 
               back of the stack, peeks over and surveys the area.

               WHAT HE SEES

               In addition to the Tabernacle, the second train tunnel 
               entrance, and all the activity, Indy's glance rests 
               momentarily on a large, heavy metal door halfway down one 
               wall toward the Tabernacle. It bears the words, in German: 
               "DANGER - MUNITIONS"

               Indy continues to scan the scene.

               INT. THE TABERNACLE

               In the central area with the Ark, Shliemann and the other 
               Nazis wait impatiently, eyeing the Ark with some discomfort. 
               Belloq is not visible, because at the moment he is -

               In the folds of the Tabernacle, the silk of the tents 
               undulating around him. The light is even stranger, the scene 
               almost dreamlike. With the help of the Tall Captain, Belloq 
               lets an extraordinary, gold-embroidered, ceremonial robe 
               fall over his head and onto his body. Belloq looks 
               transported, possessed. The Tall Captain unlatches a wooden 
               case and takes from it a sturdy ivory rod about 5 feet long, 
               elaborately engraved. Belloq takes it from him, turns and 
               slips back through the silk. The Tall Captain stays in the 
               folds.

               Back in the central area, Shliemann and the other Nazis are 
               taken aback by Belloq's appearance in the robe. They exchange 
               looks. From one knot of men there is muttering about "Juden" 
               and such, but when Belloq turns a fiery gaze on them there 
               is immediate silence. Shliemann looks uncertain in this 
               presence.

               Belloq approaches the Ark. He stops a few feet from it and 
               begins murmuring an invocation in Hebrew. After a few moments 
               of this he advances a step and is about to place the ivory 
               rod in a notch under the lid of the Ark itself. The end of 
               the rod is an inch from the notch when -

               Indy steps into the Tabernacle. On his shoulder is a bazooka 
               and it is aimed directly at the Ark.

                                     INDY
                         Hold it.
                              (the Nazi react)
                         One move from anybody and I blow 
                         that box back to Moses.

               Shliemann makes it clear to the other Nazis that Indy is to 
               be obeyed.

                                     BELLOQ
                         Jones, your persistence surprises 
                         even me. You are going to give 
                         mercenaries a bad name.

                                     INDY
                         What about you? Talked to God yet?
                              (Belloq's eyes flash)
                         Where's the girl?

                                     SHLIEMANN
                         Doctor Jones, surely you don't think 
                         you can escape from this base.

                                     INDY
                         That depends on how reasonable we're 
                         all willing to be. All I want is the 
                         girl. We'll keep possession of the 
                         Ark only till we've got safe transport 
                         to England. Then it's all yours.

                                     SHLIEMANN
                         If we refuse?

                                     INDY
                         Then the Ark and some of us are going 
                         up in a big bang. I don't think Hitler 
                         would like that a bit. Now I don't 
                         want to talk about this anymore. 
                         Show me that girl in five seconds or -

               The Tall Captain flies out of the silk and takes Indy down 
               by the neck. The bazooka clatters across the cement floor as 
               two other Nazis help subdue Indy. The three Nazis take Indy's 
               pistol from his holster and raise him roughly in their grasp.

                                     SHLIEMANN
                         Jones, this is the second time I 
                         have seen you looking very foolish.

                                     INDY
                         It's a bad habit. I'm trying to break 
                         it.

               Shliemann draws his Luger.

                                     SHLIEMANN
                         I'll help you. This time I'll kill 
                         you myself.

               Shliemann raises the pistol.

                                     BELLOQ
                         No! Not in the presence of the Ark! 
                         Take him outside.

               Shliemann eyes Belloq, then the Ark. He lowers the pistol, 
               motions for the Nazis to take Indy out ahead of him. They 
               stop a moment only when Belloq speaks.

                                     BELLOQ
                         Indiana Jones, I salute you. I am 
                         even a little sorry you will miss 
                         this moment.

                                     INDY
                         Thanks. If you talk to Him, tell Him 
                         I'm on my way up.

               Shliemann motions them out and follows. Belloq turns back to 
               the Ark, raising the ivory rod.

               INT. COMMAND CENTER

               Shliemann, the Tall Captain, Indy and the two Nazis holding 
               him emerge from the Tabernacle. Shliemann points to a nearby 
               wall and the group starts that way with Shliemann and the 
               Tall Captain slightly ahead.

               INT. THE TABERNACLE

               Belloq has the ivory rod inserted in the notch under the lid 
               of the Ark. He utters a short phrase in Hebrew and begins to 
               press down on his end of the rod. The lid of the Ark begins 
               to lift. It's difficult work. Belloq puts his whole weight 
               into one big press on his end and the lid opens two feet.

               Inside the Ark of the Covenant is a preview of the end of 
               the world. A light so bright, a power so fearsome, a charge 
               so jolting, that there is nothing in our world to compare to 
               it. It's as though this magnificent golden box has been 
               gathering electric energy for three thousand years, waiting 
               for just this crack of the lid to release it all in one fast, 
               cleansing explosion of pure force.

               Blinding arcs of light shoot out across the Tabernacle 
               instantly killing all the Nazis inside and turning the white 
               silk to flame. But it is Belloq in his obsession who takes 
               the full blast. His whole body seems lit by a million volt 
               current and, for a moment, his complete form is white, then 
               blue, then maybe green, but it is hard to tell because our 
               eyes are blinded now too. Two aspects of this ghastly, 
               beautiful display are somehow communicated in the chaos, 
               although the communication is subliminal. First, that Belloq, 
               in the instant of his destruction, has experienced some kind 
               of sublime, transcendental knowledge. If a death's-head can 
               smile and look satisfied, that is how Belloq's incandescent 
               face would be described. Secondly, this event is accompanied 
               by a sound like no other. A sound so intense and so odd and 
               so haunting that the suggestible among us might imagine it 
               were the whisper of God.

               INT. COMMAND CENTER

               Chaos. Shliemann and the Tall Captain have been temporarily 
               blinded by the light from the Tabernacle. Indy makes short 
               work of his two escorts. He bashes their heads together. 
               When only one goes down at this, Indy uses the handle of his 
               bullwhip, which has appeared instantly in his hand, to put 
               the second one down.

               Shliemann, hand on his eyes, aims his Luger blindly at the 
               scuffle. Indy pushes the Tall Captain at Shliemann, who fires 
               on impact, killing the Tall Captain. Indy knocks out 
               Shliemann.

               Behind Indy, the brilliant light and weird noise of the Ark 
               have suddenly ceased, but the Tabernacle is ablaze and the 
               fire has quickly spread to stacks of supplies on either side. 
               Smoke is already starting to fill the cavern. Nazis are 
               running around, yelling for firefighting water. A burning 
               crate at the side of the Tabernacle is pushed over, only to 
               knock over a drum of heavy black oil. A river of flame shoots 
               across the cement.

               Indy grabs a rifle with bayonet from the prostrate body of 
               one of his former escorts and runs back into the flaming 
               Tabernacle.

               INT. THE TABERNACLE

               Indy jumps through the flames into what is now a tent of 
               fire. He looks around at the dead bodies, then at the Ark. 
               The lid has slammed down shut again and the Ark shines gold 
               in the flames. Before it, where Belloq once stood, is a pile 
               of ash and charred debris. Indy registers this, then continues 
               to scan the scene.

                                     INDY
                         Marion! Marion, can you hear me?

               Suddenly, Indy looks as -

               The far side of the Tabernacle burns completely away, 
               revealing Marion, tied spread-eagle between two upright posts. 
               Her nightgown is now in tatters, black with soot. She is 
               gagged, but her eyes are screaming, focused on the flaming 
               river of black oil which is about to engulf her feet.

               Indy rushes toward her, unaware of a uniformed Nazi who has 
               appeared from the flames. Marion looks up to see Indy and 
               the Nazi leveling his submachine gun at Indy. She motions 
               desperately with her eyes. Indy dives and rolls through the 
               flames just as the Nazi opens fire. From the floor, Indy 
               blasts the Nazi.

               The river of burning oil is only a foot from Marion.

               Indy jumps up and runs toward the bound Marion, his bayonet 
               aimed directly at her. Her wide eyes flash between the flames 
               and the shining blade. Expertly, Indy slashes down both sides 
               at Marion, cutting all four bindings. Marion falls backwards, 
               away from the flames, but before she hits the ground, Indy 
               is there, catching her in his arms.

               They embrace. They kiss. They break.

                                     INDY
                         Hi.

                                     MARION
                         Oh, Indy! Thank god you're here.

                                     INDY
                         Glad I could make it.

               Indy rises, pulling her up with him. The Tabernacle is burning 
               away so fast that soon Indy and Marion will be completely 
               exposed. Indy rushes over and grabs the submachine gun and a 
               Luger from the dead Nazi.

                                     INDY
                         Let's get out of here.

                                     MARION
                         What about the Ark?

               Indy stops, startled by her spunky attitude. He's considering 
               their changes.

                                     INDY
                         Are you game?

                                     MARION
                         Hell yes! We've made it this far.

                                     INDY
                              (grins at her)
                         Okay. Let's do it.

               They approach the altar through the dying flames, Indy 
               slinging the submachine gun over his back. The long carrying 
               poles are still in place.

                                     INDY
                         Whatever you do, don't touch it. 
                         Let's put it on the floor.

               Marion nods. Each taking an end with the poles, they lift 
               the Ark from the altar and lower it to the floor. Marion 
               grunts under the weight. Indy registers this, hands her the 
               submachine gun. He pulls out his whip, motions her back, and 
               sweeps the whip tightly around the body of the Ark. The whip 
               wraps snugly around the plaiting and Indy ties it off. The 
               Ark is now harnessed to the whip handle. Indy gives it an 
               experimental pull and the Ark slides across the smooth cement. 
               Indy indicates the direction of the second train tunnel.

                                     INDY
                         We'll go down that side. Shoot anyone 
                         who looks at us crosseyed.

               INT. COMMAND CENTER

               Two huge stacks of goods are ablaze and the Nazis are having 
               trouble getting water to them. The Nazis main concern at 
               this point is an enormous, neat stack of wooden cartridge 
               boxes which are piled down the wall from one of the already 
               blazing, and now teetering, stacks of general goods. Nervous 
               Nazis are moving the heavy cartridge boxes as fast as they 
               can, but it's slow work and the threatening fire is close.

               Indy and Marion make their way along the side of the center 
               court, Indy grimacing with the strain of pulling the Ark. 
               One Nazi stops directly in front of them, looking at them 
               queerly. Indy knocks him out with the butt of his Luger just 
               as Marion is about to fire.

               Out in the court, Shliemann has regained his eyesight. Now 
               he crouches, scanning the scene desperately for Indy. He 
               looks into the remains of the Tabernacle and spots the empty 
               altar. Beyond it, the unoccupied posts where Marion was bound.

               At the entrance to the second train tunnel, Indy and Marion 
               struggle to lift the Ark into a mine car. Marion has the 
               submachine gun slung over her back. The Ark drops heavily 
               into the bottom of the car. The noise attracts the attention 
               of five water-carrying Nazis. They see what's going on and 
               reach for their side-arms. Indy grabs Marion, pulls her in 
               front of him - as though to use her as a shield - and flips 
               the submachine gun, still on her back, toward the Nazis.

               He opens fire, turning Marion's body so he can mow all five 
               down.

               Shliemann spins around and looks at the tunnel entrance. He 
               points at Indy and Marion, who have just hopped into the 
               mine car with the Ark.

                                     SHLIEMANN
                         Stop them! Kill them!

               A dozen Nazis spin and look at the mine car. Marion is just 
               leveling the submachine gun. Indy pushes forward the throttle 
               and the mine car moves toward the tunnel, picking up speed. 
               As the Nazis raise their guns to fire, Marion and Indy both 
               open up, peppering the area with lead. As the mine car is 
               about to disappear into the tunnel -

                                     INDY
                              (to Marion)
                         Get down!

               As the car disappears, bullets pock the entrance of the 
               tunnel. Shliemann runs up with three Nazis. They jump into 
               the next mine car and take off, disappearing into the tunnel.

               Over at the burning stack of goods, some terrified fire-
               fighters scurry away as the burning pile of general goods 
               falls over onto the stack of cartridge boxes. The wooden 
               boxes immediately start burning. Many of the Nazis just want 
               to get out of there, but a couple of disciplined OFFICERS 
               are trying to salvage the situation. They point to the far 
               side of the court, the walls are lines with oil and gas drums.

                                     OFFICER
                         We must cover the drums! Protect 
                         them from the bullets!

               INTERCUTTING INDY AND MARION WITH SHLIEMANN AND THE NAZIS

               We see a most extraordinary pursuit. This tunnel is of 
               identical design to the first, except more twisty. This early 
               section goes slightly uphill, as though headed for the summit 
               of a rollercoaster. The low cross beams and the higher 
               sections in between are causing the Nazis to alternately 
               stand and duck in their efforts to get a clear shot at the 
               lead car. One German times it wrong and gets whacked. Indy 
               in unhappy with the speed of his car and he's right, the 
               Nazis are moving faster and gaining. When both cars are in 
               the same high section, the Nazis blast away at them. The 
               noise is deafening, with barking guns, splintering rock, and 
               twanging ricochets contributing to the din. As Marion fires 
               a return volley low over the Ark, Indy kicks at the throttle, 
               convinced it is jammed.

               INT. COMMAND CENTER

               The Officers are directing the placement of every moveable 
               item in front of the oil drums. Desks, crates, chairs, food, 
               all are heaped in front of the fuel. All the workers cast 
               frequent nervous glances back at the burning cartridge boxes 
               across the court. Suddenly the worst begins to happen at the 
               cartridge boxes. Hundreds of thousands of live cartridges 
               begin exploding, flying around the court like shrapnel. Hot 
               lead begins to zing off the exposed fuel drums, leaving big 
               dents.

               INT. TRAIN TUNNEL - LONG STRAIGHTAWAY

               The car with Indy and Marion looks almost sluggish compared 
               to the pursuing Nazi car as they both make their way into an 
               usually long straightaway. Marion discards her empty 
               submachine gun as Indy kicks at his throttle and casts a 
               worried look back at Shliemann.

               Shliemann, sensing victory, smiles evilly and carefully takes 
               aim. Indy and Marion will be easy targets until they reach 
               that approaching low cross beam, which is the crest of the 
               rising tunnel.

               INT. COMMAND CENTER - CLOSE ON FUEL DRUM

               A fuel drum, already pocked by bullets is finally penetrated 
               by high velocity hot lead. It explodes in a ball of flame. 
               And then its neighbor. Then all is exploding flame.

               INT. TRAIN TUNNEL - LONG STRAIGHTAWAY

               Shliemann and his cohorts hear the explosions behind them 
               and look back that way.

               Indy kicks the throttle one more time and it goes! Their car 
               doubles its speed and shoots under the low cross beam at the 
               same instant as -

               A huge dragon of all-consuming fire shoots up the tunnel 
               behind the Nazis, catches their car and incinerates Shliemann 
               and his men. The tunnel collapses in this section, burying 
               the fried Nazis forever.

               INT. TRAIN TUNNEL

               Indy and Marion look back at the low cross beam as the last 
               tongue of flame makes it there and then is doused by falling 
               rock and dirt. They look at each other, then turn their 
               attention back to their own predicament. Their mine car is 
               going incredible fast as it moves into a downward section of 
               wildly twisting tunnel.

                                     MARION
                         Slow it down!

               Indy is already pulling the throttle. It moves easily. 
               Unfortunately, it is no longer attached to the motor. The 
               mine car is out of control. After several moments, far ahead, 
               appears a circle of bright daylight - the end of the tunnel! 
               It approaches at a frightening rate. Indy reaches out and 
               grasps Marion's hand. They exchange looks and then turn to 
               look ahead.

               THEIR POV

               We're taking this last stretch with them. It's a familiar 
               nightmare. It has to do with a rollercoaster that ends 
               suddenly and disastrously. The shocking brightness of sunlight 
               rushes up to engulf us, blinding us in its glare.

               EXT. THE ISLAND - END OF TRACKS, DOCK

               High up on the slope of the island, Indy and Marion's mine 
               car shoots out of the black tunnel and roars down toward a 
               little dock at the end of the tracks.

               A small Nazi transport launch, carefully disguised as a Greek 
               fishing boat, sits bobbing by the dock. The only human: a 
               Nazi Sentry dressed as a Greek peasant. He is perched on a 
               pile of seed bags which are stacked at the very end of the 
               train tracks. As the mine car barrels noisily down toward 
               him, he throws away some burlap to reveal a mounted machine 
               gun which he spins quickly around toward the approaching 
               mine car. He opens fire.

               In the out-of-control mine car, Indy pulls Marion down with 
               him. They are squashed into the corner trying to avoid contact 
               with the bouncing Ark. Bullets clang against the outside of 
               the car and whiz inches overhead. Indy and Marion are forced 
               into a tighter and tighter embrace of life.

               At the machine gun post, the Nazi Sentry has been firing 
               like crazy, but now there is terror in his eyes. He realizes 
               the car is not going to stop. He lacks faith in his 
               stronghold. Too late.

               The mine car smashes into the seed bag bunker. And right on 
               through. The Nazi Sentry, his machine gun and a dozen bursting 
               seed bags are slammed into the ocean in a wild, hurtling 
               mass. The mine car jumps, bounces and spins around, then 
               slides to a stop in a cloud of seed at the edge of the water.

               INT. COMMAND CENTER

               Fire. Everywhere. No sign of life. A large gaping doorway, 
               flames ringing it, blazing into the room beyond. Hanging by 
               one hinge there, its metal blasted and jagged, is a heavy 
               door with the signed lettering, in German, "DANGER - 
               MUNITIONS".

               The first explosion happens. It's a baby compared to what's 
               coming yet it rocks the earth. It's terrible. And then, almost 
               immediately, another. The long, irregular, ever larger chain 
               of explosions begins.

               EXT. THE ISLAND - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY

               The island rumbles and shakes. From fissures and small natural 
               caves, dirt and rock shoot out like spraying water. Still 
               the explosion continue. A huge chunk of white cliff falls 
               away into the turbulent sea. Birds scream and soar, afraid 
               to land.

               Finally, we settle on a full shot of the island. We can 
               recognize that the small opening high on the slope from which 
               a cloud of smoke and dust is billowing is the end of the 
               mine tunnel. And there below it, quite small from this 
               distance is the dock. And the boat that looks like a Greek 
               fishing boat. There can be no mistake even from this far 
               away - the boat is chugging out to sea.

               INT. THE PENTAGON - DAY

               Indy, Brody, and Marion, looking very stylish, are seated in 
               Colonel Musgrove's huge office. Sun pours in a window, through 
               which Washington can be seen sparkling across the Potomac. 
               Everything is neat and clean and regular. Including the three 
               men who are arrayed around the office. Two we know - Col. 
               Musgrove and Maj. Eaton. The third is an unnamed Bureaucrat. 
               He hangs back, smiling and genial, his features obscured by 
               the glare of the window. He doesn't say anything, yet you 
               have a sense that the others defer to him in the matter at 
               hand. He is the essence of all that is Byzantine and 
               inscrutable in our scrubbed government machine.

               Indy and Brody are dissatisfied with the way the meeting has 
               gone. Marion, on the other hand, is very happy and eager to 
               get out of there. Eaton's manner is irritatingly cheery.

                                     MUSGROVE
                         You've done your country a great 
                         service.

                                     EATON
                         And we trust you found the settlement 
                         satisfactory?

                                     MARION
                         Quite.

                                     EATON
                         Good, good.
                              (glances around at 
                              the others)
                         Then I guess that about does it.

                                     BRODY
                         When can we have the Ark?

               Eaton's glance flicks over to the mysterious Bureaucrat, 
               then back to Brody.

                                     EATON
                         I thought we answered that. It's 
                         someplace very safe -

                                     INDY
                              (heated)
                         That's a powerful force. Research 
                         should be done -

                                     EATON
                         Oh, it will be, Dr. Jones, I assure 
                         you. We have top men working on it 
                         right now.

                                     INDY
                         Who?

                                     EATON
                         Top men.

               Indy exchanges a look with Brody.

                                     INDY
                         We may be able to help.

                                     EATON
                         We appreciate that. And we won't 
                         hesitate to call on you.

                                     MUSGROVE
                              (dismissing them)
                         Thank you all. Thank you again.

               Indy looks them over coldly. He gets up, sullen.

               EXT. PENTAGON STEPS - DAY

               Indy, Brody and Marion emerge from the building. Brody bids 
               them farewell and moves off in another direction. Marion 
               clings to Indy's arm in an energetic, very feminine way, 
               scolding him.

                                     MARION
                         Well they aren't going to tell you, 
                         so why don't you just forget it. I'd 
                         think you'd had enough of that damn 
                         Ark. Just put your mind on something 
                         else.

               Indy stops, looking across the river, his mind occupied.

                                     INDY
                         Yeah, like what?

               Marion makes a face, then puts her arms around his neck and 
               plants a humdinger of a kiss on his mouth. It goes on a while. 
               Finally they break.

                                     INDY
                         It's not the Ark... but it'll have 
                         to do.

               They move down the steps, smiling.

               INT. GOVERNMENT WAREHOUSE

               The Ark of the Covenant sits in a wooden crate. A wooden lid 
               comes down and hides it from view. The lid is solidly nailed 
               to the crate as we read the stenciled message on top -

                                        TOP SECRET
                                   ARMY INTEL. #9906753
                                       DO NOT OPEN!

               The hammering is completed and hands shift the heavy crate 
               onto a dolly.

               THE END CREDITS ROLL AS WE SEE -

               A Little Old Government Warehouseman begins pushing the crated 
               Ark down as aisle. Soon we see that the aisle is formed by 
               huge stacks or crates. They come in many shapes and sizes, 
               but when it comes right down to it, they all look like the 
               one that holds the Ark. All have markings like the message 
               we've just seen. Pretty soon we're far enough and high enough 
               away from the Little Old Government Warehouseman to see that 
               this is one of the biggest rooms in the world. And it is 
               full. Crates and crates. All looking alike. All gathering 
               dust.

               And then we notice that the Little Old Government 
               Warehouseman, pushing his new crate ahead of him, has turned 
               into another aisle and disappeared from view.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                --------------

       FADE IN:

1.     INT.  "THE DRAGON" NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT                            1.

       A Chinese GONG SOUNDS and the glittering doors of an art Deco pa-
       poda slide open to reveal a mammoth silver stairway down which
       rows of beautiful women start descending   (BEGIN MAIN TITLES)

       The lovely ladies are a mix of races and they sing a strange,
       haunting melody -- one might think them a heavenly choir, if it
       weren't for their sexy, clinging lame gowns.

2.     INT.  CLUB ENTRANCE                                             2.

       From the ethereal beauties, we cut to a street urchin's dirty
       face: SHORT ROUND is a ten-year-old Chinese kis wearing a beat-
       up American baseball cap.

       Sneaking into the club, Short Round weaves past the fancy gowns
       and silk suits, heading toward the music in the main ballroom.

3.     INT.  THE BALLROOM                                              3.

       Short Round enters and stares across the smoky nightclub.  On the
       stage, he sees a giant paper-mache dragon laying curled around
       the pagoda.

       Now, the dragon's eyes light up, its nostrils exhale smoke and
       its enormous jaws open.  Out of the dragon's mouth walks the star
       of the stage show:

       WILLIE SCOTT, a dreamy beauty singing a sultry solo white the or-
       chestra wails the accompaniment.

       But Short Round's not here to ogle crooning dames.  He surveys
       the rich Chinese, American and European revelers.  Jewels flash
       and champagne flows.  Short Round finally spots a table of
       somber-looking Chinese men in suits.

       Short Round chews gum and stares at the men.  Then he turns to
       go.  WU HAN, a waiter with a scar across his cheek, watches Short
       Round leave.

4.     INT.  CLUB ENTRANCE                                            4.

       As Short Round hurries toward the exit, he bumps into a man in a
       tuxedo entering the club.  Short Round looks up at the man, but
       we don't see his face.

       Then Short Round is grabbed by the scruff of his neck and a door-
       man hustles him out the door, Short Round yelling insults all the
       way.

       A maitre d' apologizes to the man in the tuxedo and two hat-check
       girls smile at him familiarly as he continues into the ballroom.
       We notice something incongruous:  the man in the tuxedo is wear-
       ing work boots caked with mud.

5.     INT.  THE BALLROOM                                             5.

       The man in the tuxedo stops to watch Willie Scott singing sexily
       on the stage.  Then he looks around and sees the table of somber
       Chinese men that Short Round spotted earlier.

       As the man in the tuxedo walks toward the table, he removes a
       cigarette from a silver case.  He arrives at the table just as
       the chorus and orchestra reach a crescendo --

       And on the stage, a glistening, muscular slave swings a huge ham-
       mer toward an enormous brass gong --

       The man in the tuxedo leans to receive a light from a cigarette-
       girl and, as the GONG BOOMS, the match flares to reveal his face
       for the first time:

       It's INDIANA JONES.  Elegant in a tuxedo -- dressed to kill.  The
       TITLES END and over this a legend appears on the screen:

                                SHANGHAI - 1935

       At the table, the four Chinese man in suits stare coldly at Indi-
       ana.

                                   LAO
                       Dr. Jones.

                                   INDIANA
                       Lao She.

                                   LAO
                       Nee chin lie how ma?

       Lao's men laugh and assume that Indy doesn't understand his joke.

                                   INDIANA
                       Wah hung how, nee nah?  Wah hwey
                       hung jing chee jah loo nee kao
                       soo wah shu shu.

       LAO SHE looks angry and his men's smiles fade.

                                   LAO
                       You never told me you spoke my
                       language, Dr. Jones.

                                   INDIANA
                       I don't like to show off.

       Indiana takes a seat across the table from Shanghai's notorious
       crime-lord.  Lao is fifty, wealthy enough to now display some
       fat, but still muscular from his fight to the top of the garbage
       heap.

                                   LAO
                       For this special occasion, I
                       ordered champagne and caviar.

       Indiana looks at the pile of caviar on the plate in front of him
       -- and stubs his cigarette out in it.  The cigarette sizzles and
       Lao's smiles dies with it.

       There's applause as Wille Scott finishes her song.  At the
       table, Lao stares at Indiana with a strange intensity.

                                   LAO
                       So, it is true, Dr. Jones?  you
                       found Nurhachi?

                                   INDIANA
                       Sure, I found him.  Then last
                       night I had a little trouble.
                       Somebody tried to slit my throat.

       Indiana looks across the table at Lao's son, CHEN, who resembles
       a bulldog and snarls like one now.

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       It was dark, but I think one of
                       your sons tried to get Nurhachi
                       without paying for him.

       Indy stares pointedly at Chen's recently bandaged hand.  Chen
       mutters and stands angrily -- Lao barks a command in Chinese and
       Chen sits down again.

                                   LAO
                       You have insulted my son.

                                   INDIANA
                       Next time I'll cut off more than
                       his finger.

                                   LAO
                       Dr. Jones -- I want Nurhachi.

       Lao pulls a wad of cash out of his pocket and puts it on the
       table.  Indiana glances at it.

                                   INDIANA
                       As I recall the deal was consid-
                       erably more.

       Now a pretty hand slips onto Lao's shoulder and he looks up to
       see Willie Scott.  Lao kisses her hand.  Willie is unaware of the
       explosive mood at the table and she smiles flirtaciously at Indi-
       ana.

                                   WILLIE
                                   (to Lao)
                       Aren't you going to introduce
                       us?

                                   LAO
                       This is Willie Scott.
                             (watching Indy)
                       And this is Indiana Jones, the
                       famous archaeologist.

       Willie sits down between Lao and Indy.  She takes out a small
       mirror to check her make-up.

                                   LAO (Cont'd)
                       Dr. Jones found Nurhachi for me
                       and is about to deliver him --
                       now.

       Lao nods across the table and Indy sees KAO KAN, Lao's second
       son, open his coat and remove a silver-plated pistol.  Indiana
       looks worried.  Willie doesn't notice as she fixes her make-up
       and coyly teases Indiana.

                                   WILLIE
                       Well -- I thought archaeologists
                       were always funny little men
                       searching for their mummies --
                                  (yelping)
                       Aaahhh!

       She looks down terrified at the knife Indy is poking against her
       ribs.

                                   WILLE (Cont'd)
                       I was only kidding, can't you
                       take a joke -- ?
                                  (to Lao)
                       Lao, he's got a knife!

                                   INDIANA
                       Put the gun away, sonny.

       Kao Kan glances at his father.  Lao finally nods to his son and
       he slips the pistol back into his pocket.

                                   INDIANA
                       Now I suggest you pay me what you
                       promised -- or your girlfriend
                       here is going to be squealing a
                       new tune.

       The ritzy patrons at the tables nearby are unaware of the tawdry
       drama quietly unfolding at this table.

       Willie eyes the blade and whimpers.  She looks imploringly at Lao
       and he slowly reaches into his pocket.  He puts ten gold coins
       next to the cash on the table.

       Indy leans forward to look at the gold coins -- so intently that
       he fails to notice Kao Kan spilling some powder into Indy's cham-
       pagne glass!

                                   INDIANA
                       Try again Lao -- the deal was
                       more.

       The knife pokes Willie and she whimpers again.  Lao reaches into
       another pocket and brings out a folded piece of rice paper -- he
       opens it and a large diamond and ruby spill out onto the table.

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       Bingo...you see, Lao, with a
                       but of persuasion, even you can
                       be an honest fellow.

       Indy smiles and jabs the knife into the middle of the table.
       Then he lifts his champagne glass in a toast to Lao -- who
       watches expectantly as Indiana moves the glass toward his lips --

       Suddenly Willie stands angrily, jostling Indy's arm so that he
       doesn't drink his champagne.

                                   WILLIE
                       Look at this!  He put a hole
                       in my dress from Paris!

       Lao sees Indy put his champagne glass down and he snarls at Wil-
       lie --

                                   LAO
                       Sit down!

       Willie quickly obeys.  Lao forces a smile at Indy and lifts his
       glass to seal the deal --

                                   LAO (Cont'd)
                       To your health, Dr. Jones.

       Lao sips hs champagne and watches hopefully as Indy picks up his
       glass and this time Indy does drink the champagne. Then he
       reaches for the cash --

       But Chen grins and puts a silver snuff bottle next to the cash,
       gold and jewels -- he tips the little bottle over and some white
       powder spills out of it --

                                   INDIANA
                       What's that?

                                   LAO
                       A bonus, Dr. Jones.  That is
                       poison.  You just drank the
                       rest of it.

       Indiana examines his champagne glass and sees a residue at the
       bottom of it.  He swallows and feels sick, wondering it it's fear
       or the poison already taking effect.

                                   LAO (Cont'd)
                       There is an antidote for this
                       poison.  You give me Nurhachi --
                       I give you the antidote.

       Indiana is sweating.  Willie looks at him and sees Indy's hand
       shaking.

                                   LAO (Cont'd)
                       The poison works fast, Dr. Jones.
                       Where is Nurhachi?

       Indiana finally reaches into his pocket.  Next to the cash, gold,
       jewels and poison, Indiana sets down a beautiful small box.  Lao
       and his men stare hypnotically at the exquisite gold and enamel
       box.

                                   WILLIE
                                (nervously)
                       This Nurhachi's a very small guy.

       Nobody pays any attention to her as Lao reaches for the box.

                                   INDIANA
                       Inside are the remains of Nur-
                       hachi -- the first Emperor of the
                       Manchu Dynasty.

       Lao opens the box carefully and stares reverently at the grey
       powder inside.

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       Now what about the antidote,
                       Lao.

                                   LAO
                             (holding the box)
                       At last I have the ashes of my
                       sacred ancestor!

                                   WILLIE
                       So, what's the big deal?  Let
                       me see it --

       Qillie grabs Lao's arm and some of the precious ashes spill out
       of the gold box.  Stunned by this desecration of his ancestor,
       Lao grabs Willie by the wrist and twists her arm --

                                   LAO
                       You fool!

                                   WILLIE
                       Ow, you're hurting me, you miser-
                       able little hood!

                                   INDIANA
                       Let go of her, Lao.  And give me
                       the antidote.

       Lao just laughs evilly -- until a waiter moves up behind Lao and
       the crimelord suddenly stiffens.  He lets go of Willie's wrist
       and raises his hands off the table.  Chen stops collecting the
       money and jewels.

       Kao Kan tenses and Indy smiles at Wu Han, the Chinese waiter with
       the scar, who is standing behind Lao.  Wu Han has a towel over
       his hand  --  under it, he has a pistol pressed against Lao's
       spine.

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                              (smiling at Wu Han)
                       I like the service here.

                                   WILLIE
                                  (puzzled)
                       Hey, he's not a waiter...

                                   INDIANA
                       No, Wu Han's an old friend I
                       brought along.
                                   (to Lao)
                       So, the game's not over. Put
                       the antidote on the table, Lao.

       Lao carefully reaches into his pocket and puts a small glass vial
       of liquid next to the cash, gold, jewels, poison and sacred box.
       Indy looks relieved as he reaches for the vial of antidote --
       then he hears a muffled report!  And another!

       Wu Han groans and sways.  Indy starts to stand but Chen immedi-
       ately turns the smoking pistol with the silencer that he used to
       kill Wu Han -- Indy sees it pointed at him now and he remains in
       his seat.

       Kao Kan stands and grabs Wu Han, easing the phoney waiter into
       the chair he just vacated.  The muffled shooting hasn't attracted
       any attention.  The nightclub activity continues an Indy speaks
       emotionally to his dying friend.

                                   INDIANA
                       Wu Han  --  listen to me  --  I'm
                       going to get you out of here.

       In pain, Wu Han looks at Indy and struggles to speak --

                                   WU HAN
                       Not this time, my friend...
                             (smiling bravely)
                       I followed you on many adventures --
                       but into the great Unknown Mystery,
                       I go first, Indy...

       Wu Han dies and slumps forward.  Indiana is shattered by the
       death of his old friend.

                                   LAO
                       Don't be sad, Dr. Jones -- you
                       will soon join him.

       Indy's gaze shifts from his dead friend to Lao's sneering face.
       Then Indy sees the murderous Chen giggling perversely.  Indy's
       anger is compounded by the poison burning in his gut and his vis-
       ion of Chen's ugly face blurs into a double image --

       Indy stands up unsteadily.  Chen assumes he's about to keel over
       from the poison -- but Indy suddenly turns and grabs a real wai-
       ter at another table.  The waiter holds a long skewer of roasted
       pigeons that he's just set afire --

       Indy grabs the skewer of pigeons flambee and hurls is across the
       table!  Chen fires and misses -- and screams as the skewer stabs
       into his chest and the burning pigeons flame in front of his hor-
       rified face!

       This the other tables definitely notice.  There are screams and
       all hell breaks loose.  Indiana shoves past Willie and reaches
       for the vial on the table --

                                   INDIANA
                       The antidote -- !

       But he's grabbed from behind by Kao Kan.  Indy elbows the punk,
       reaches back and grabs his head -- and somersaults Kao Kan onto
       the table!

       As nubmer two son crashes into the table, the impact sends the
       Emperor Nurhachi's ashes billowing into Lao's stricken face!

       Indiana yells as he sees the vial of antidote rolling across the
       table -- and falling!

       Indiana dives and catches the antidote just before it hits the
       floor -- then Indy's hand is brutally stomped on by one of Lao's
       henchmen and the vial rolls away.

       Indiana angrily raises his head, smashing it up into the hench-
       man's groin -- the man howls like a banshee and hobbles away.
       
       Meanwhile, Willie watches Lao grabbing for cash from the table.
       Willie lunges past the pigeon-skewered Chen to snatch the jewels,
       but unfortunately Kao Kan knocks them off the table as he leaps
       to attack Indy.

       Indiana scrambles on his hands and knees after the rolling vial.
       People keep kicking it -- he almost has it when Willie runs into
       him, trips and lands on her back.

                                   INDIANA
                       Look out, damn it, I need that
                       antidote!

                                   WILLIE
                       Who cares?  Where's that diamond!

       Gunfire explodes and they both scramble in different directions.
       Indy dives through the fleeing nightclub patrons and slides be-
       hind a water-spewing fountain.  Water kicks up as Indy is shot at
       by Lao and his henchmen.

       Indy sees the vial of antidote kicked again and it spins across
       the marble floor -- feeling the poison, Indy shakes his head
       groddily and splashes water on his face.

       Meanwhile, Willie is chasing her diamond, shoving through the
       panicked crowd.  She spots the diamond!  Another elegantly
       dresses soman is bending to pick it up --

                                   WILLIE
                              (acidly polite)
                       Excuse me, but I believe that's
                       my diamond!

       Willie smiles and suddenly kicks the woman in the butt!  Willie
       reaches to get the diamond but not before the other woman tackles
       her.

       Behind the fountain, Indiana makes a break -- he runs and dives
       on top of a serving cart.  The wheeled cart hurtles toward an un-
       suspecting gunman, crashes into him from behind and sends him
       flying head first into a row of ice buckets.

       Nearby, Willie slugs the other lady in the jaw and grabs for the
       elusive diamond just as the ice buckets showers ice across the
       floor -- which camouflages the diamond!

                                   WILLIE
                       Aw nuts!

       Searching desperately for the jewel, Willie sees the vial of
       antidote spinning across the floor --as it slides by, she grabs
       it.

                                   INDIANA (O.S.)
                       Hey,doll!  Don't move!

       She sees Indy speeding by atop the serving cart.  Lao and his
       gunmen rush out to block the way.  Indy rolls off the cart and
       slides behind a potted palm as Lao's men open fire again.

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                           (shouting to Willie)
                       Hey, don't go away!  I need that!

       Willie smiles meanly as she slips the vial down the front of her
       dress, thumbs her nose at Indiana and walks away.

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       If I wasn't dying, I'd kill her...

       Hiding behind the palm tree, Indiana looks around and spots a gi-
       ant statue at the side of the stage.  Indy makes a break for it.

       As the gunmen open fire, Indy springs onto a chair -- jumps onto
       a table -- and leaps onto the stage.  He grabs the golden broad-
       sword from the Chinese warrior statue!

       As bullets smash into the statue, Indiana hides behind it.  Then
       he jumps out and swings the large sword toward the enormous brass
       gong.

       The crimson cord holding the gong is SLASHED!  Indy slings the
       sword at his assailants and gives the three-meter-high gong a
       helpful shove --

       The giant gong rolls and echoes as it crashes down the marble
       steps.  Indiana ducks behind it as it gains momentum and rolls
       across the dance floor.

       Using the gong as an enormous shield, Indy evades the gunfire ex-
       ploding -- bullets ricochet off the rolling brass gong as Indy
       runs behind it.

       Ahead, Willie hurries toward an exit -- she hears something and
       turns -- her eyes go wide as she sees the mammoth gong bearing
       down on her!

       Willie yells as Indiana grabs her arm and pulls her behind the
       gong with him --

       Lao watches amazed as he and his gunmen dodge tables trying to
       get better firing positions -- and more henchmen come into the
       club now and start firing machine guns!

       As bullets clang against the gong, Indiana and Willie run behind
       it.  Willie hollers as they head directly for a towering, floor-
       to-ceiling window!

       Indiana grabs Willie around the waist and, after the huge gong
       crashes through the stained-glass window, they both fly after it!

6.     EXT.  "THE DRAGON" NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT                           6.

       In a shower of sparkling glass, the enormous gong sails out and
       crashes down a sloping green-tiled roof.  Indiana Jones and Wil-
       lie Scott hurtle into the night air after it!

       The gong rolls down the roof and they hit the tiles behind it,
       Indiana holding onto Willie as they roll one-over-the-other
       toward the edge -- Willie screams as they fall into thin air!

       Their entwined bodies plummet three stories:  ripping through a
       third-floor awning, crashing through an old man's mattress on a
       second-floor balcony --

       Finally they smash through the convertible top of a parked Duesen-
       berg and fall into the back seat!

7.     INT.  THE DUESENBERG                                           7.

       Willie sits up wide-eyed, speechless and amazed to be alive.
       Then she sees an equally astonished Short Round looking at them
       from the front seat.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Wow!  Holy smoke!  Crash landing!

                                   INDIANA
                       Step on it, Short Round!

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Okey doke, Indy!  Hold onto your
                       potatoes!

       The twelve-year-old Chinese kid turns his baseball cap bill-
       backwards and steps on the gas!  The tires squeal as the car
       roars off --

                                   WILLIE
                       For crying out loud, a kid's driv-
                       ing the car?!

                                   INDIANA
                       Relax, I've been giving him lessons.

8.     EXT.  THE NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT                                    8.

       The Duesenberg races past the entrace to the nightclub as Lao
       and his man rush out and jump into two black sedans.  The sedans
       screech off in pursuit of the Duesenberg.

9.     INT.  THE DUESENBERG                                           9.

       As Short Round eagerly swerves around a corner, Willie holds on
       for dear life.  Indiana suddenly puts his hand down the front of
       Willie's dress --

                                   WILLIE
                       Listen, we just met for crissake!
                       I'm not that kind of gril!

                                   INDIANA
                       Don't get your hopes up -- where's
                       the antidote?

       Indiana withdraws his hand, having finally found the vial.  He
       opens is quickly, tips the vial to his lips and grimaces as he
       swallows the stuff.

                                   WILLIE
                       You don't look very good.

                                   INDIANA
                       Poison never agrees with me.
                              (shouting forward)
                       Pull a right, Short Round, and
                       head for the Wang Poo bridge!

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Check!  Gotcha!

       As the car accelerates, Indy peers out the back window at their
       pursuers.  Willie notices her reflection in the side window --

                                   WILLIE
                       Look at what you've done to me!
                       I'm a mess!  My lipstick's smeared,
                       I broke two nails, I've got an aw-
                       ful run in my stocking -- !

       Gunfire suddenly explodes, bullets whizz through the canvas top
       and the rear window shatters and sprays glass!  Willie ducks and
       cringes terrified in the corner --

                                   INDIANA
                       Somehow I think you've got bigger
                       problems.

       Indy grabs his shoulder bag and pulls a pistol out of it.  He
       pokes the gun through the broken window and starts firing back at
       their pursuers -- then he turns and looks ahead.

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       There, Shorty!  Through the
                       tunnel!

       Through the windows we see the car racing into a tunnel.  Lights
       from the pursuing cars flash through the rear window and gunfire
       echoes in the tunnel.

                                   WILLIE
                       What're we going to do?!  Where're
                       we going?!

                                   INDIANA
                       The airport...No, look out,
                       Short Round!  Left, left!

       Indy reaches over the front seat and helps Short Round navigate.

10.    EXT.  A SHANGHAI SQUARE - NIGHT                                10.

       The Duesenberg tears around the square, followed by Lao's two se-
       dans.  People on the street dive for cover -- coolies pulling
       rickshaws go into hyper-jov --lanterns spanning the street crash
       down and are dragged behind the Duesenberg.  Bullets exlode and
       amazed prostitutes watch the cars zoom past.

11.    INT.  THE DUESENBERG - NIGHT                                   11.

       The chaotic chase continues -- bullets whine past and the shred-
       ded convertible top whips in the wind.

                                   INDIANA
                                 (shouting)
                       You got the tickets, Short Round?

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Sure, Indy -- three tickets!
                       You, me and Wu Han --

       Shorty throws an envelope back and Indy looks at the three
       tickets.

                                   INDIANA
                                   (sadly)
                       Wu Han's not coming, Shorty.

       Unaware of what happened at the club, Short Round thinks a mo-
       ment.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Don't worry, Indy.  Short Round
                       number one bodyguard now!

       Willie reaches for the extra ticket.

                                   WILLIE
                       I'll take the extra ticket.
                              (grabbing it
                                 from Indy)
                       Where's this plane going anyway?

                                   INDIANA
                       Siam.

                                   WILLIE
                       Siam?  But I'm not dressed for
                       Siam...

12.    EXT. COUNTRY HIGHWAY - NIGHT                                   12.

       Leaving behind the squalid port, the Duesenberg flies along the
       highway through the trees.  In a moment, Lao's two sedans race
       by.

13.    EXT.  NANG TAO AIRFIELD - NIGHT                                13.

       The Duesenberg swings around a curve and skids through gravel to-
       ward the airfield.  In the distance there is a small terminal but
       Short Round wheels the car toward the cargo area --

       A two-engine passenger plane is revving its motors and the last
       passengers are boarding.  The Duesenberg squeals to a stop and
       Indy jumps out with Willie and Short Round right on his heels.

       A contingent of airport Military Police move to bar their way
       until WEBER, a heavy-set Englishman, runs up pufffing and shout-
       ing.

                                   WEBER
                       No, no, they're all right!
                       Let them through please.

                                   INDIANA
                       Thanks, Weber.

                                   WEBER
                       Dr. Jones, this is positively the
                       last time our airline can hold a
                       plane for you.  Now you must hurry!

       While Short Round grabs a small bag out of the car, Weber and a
       stewardess take their tickets and rush them all toward the air-
       plane.

       Meanwhile, the two sedans skid to a stop and Lao and his son Kao
       Kan jumpsout with their henchmen.  The puzzled military police
       advance on them usspiciously  --

       Realizing he's outnumbered, Lao instructs his men to stay back
       and to put away their weapons.

14.    EXT.  THE AIRPLANE                                             14.

       Willie and Short Round charge up the ladder and onto the plane.
       Indy pauses at the top of the steps to give Lao a cocky farewell
       salute.  Indy boards the plane and the co-pilot slams the door.

15.    EXT.  THE AIRFIELD                                             15.

       The plane starts taxiing.  By the cars, Lao is buffeted by the
       prop wash as he angrily watches the plane roll away.  Behind Lao,
       his son, Kao Kan, stares at the plane taking off  -- a look on Kao
       Kan's face indicates that he hasn't given up yet...

       The plane lifts off the airfield, silhouetted against the clouds
       and the first light of dawn.

                                                               CUT TO:

16.    EXT.  THE DKY - MORNING                                        16.

       The sun flashes above the horizon and the plane banks through
       white billowing clouds at it heads west.

17.    INT.  THE PLANE                                                17.

       A door opens at the rear of the plane and Indiana Jones exits
       wearing more familiar attire:  a beat-up leather jacket over a
       khaki shirt and a snap-brim hat.  He passes a dozen passengers as
       he moves up the aisle carrying his rolled-up tuzedo.

       In the first row, Willie is busy fixing her make-up.  Shorty sits
       in the seat across the aisle from her.  Indy comes up and drops
       his tuxedo onto the floor.

       Willie sees him hook his coiled bullwhip over a coat-peg.

                                   WILLIE
                       So, what're you supposed to be,
                       a lion tamer?

                                   INDIANA
                       Since I was nice enough to let
                       you tag along, why don't you give
                       your mouth a rest?  Okay, doll?

       Indy pats her leg -- she removes his hand and reaches down and
       picks up his tuxedo coat.  She slips it on.

                                   WILLIE
                       I'm freezing.  What do you mean,
                       tag along?  From the minute you
                       walked into that nightclub, you
                       haven't been able to keep your
                       eyes off me.

                                   INDIANA
                       Oh yeah?

       He smiles and tips his hat down over his eyes to go to sleep...

18.    INT.  THE COCKPIT                                              18.

       At the same moment, the Chinese co-pilot tips his hat up off his
       eyes -- and looks scared to death!  He exclaims in Chinese --

                                   CO-PILOT (*subtitled*)
                       Good lord!

       He and the pilot see two biplanes materialize out of the clouds
       and dive directly toward them!  Suddenly, machine gunfire erupts!

                                   PILOT (*subtitled)
                       Dive for the clouds!  Dive!

19.    EXT.  THE SKY - DAY                                            19.

       The DC-3 banks into the clouds as the two biplanes attack.  In
       the back seat of the first biplane, we see Kao Kan watching the
       DC-3 like a hawk about to bring down a sparrow.

20.    INT.  THE COCKPIT                                              20.

       The biplanes swoop past both sides of the plane and bursts of
       gunfire rip along the fuselage.

                                   CO-PILOT (*subtitled)
                       They hit a fuel line!

                                   PILOT (*subtitled*)
                       Reduce speed -- get everyone out
                       of the plane!

21     INT.  THE PASSENGER CABIN                                      21.

       As the air battle rages, the passengers are tossed about and some
       start screaming.  Short Round peers out a window.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Lao send planes to kill Indy!

       Willie shakes Indy's arm but he continues snoring under his hat.

                                   WILLIE
                       Wake up!  It's the drug he drank
                       to stop the poison --

       The cockpit door bursts open and the Chinese co-pilot exits to
       make an announcement -- he smiles and speaks in CHINESE, then he
       smiles and speaks in FRENCH --

       Willie looks lost until the Chinese co-pilot smiles again and
       speaks in ENGLISH --

                                   CO-PILOT
                       Please to remain calm.  We start
                       passing out parachutes now --

       The co-pilot hurries toward the rear.  Willie looks petrified as
       a stewardess rushes up and hands her a parachute.

                                   WILLIE
                       You got to be kidding!  No!  No,
                       I can't!

       The pilot hurries out of the cockpit and grabs his parachute as
       he heads toward the back.

                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)
                       Wait -- who's flying the plane?!

       She opens the door to the cockpit --

                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)
                       Nobody's flying the plane ...

22.    EXT.  THE SKY - DAY                                            22.

       The DC-3 smokes through the clouds.  Passengers are bailing out
       -- parachutes billowing.  As one of the fighters swoops through
       the parachutes, Kao Kan searches the faces -- then he points at
       the DC-3.

                                   KAO KAN
                               (into the radio)
                       Jones!  Indiana Jones!

       The two planes roar off and start strafing the DC-3 again.

23.    INT.  THE PASSENGER CABIN                                      23.

       The co-pilot has a parachute on and is trying to get Short Round
       into one.

                                   CO-PILOT
                       Put it on!  What's wrong with
                       you?  You've got to jump!

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       No, can't leave Indy!

       Short Round suddenly butts the co-pilot in the stomach with his
       head.  The co-pilot yells and falls out the door.  Short Round
       sees the co-pilot's parachute billow.  Then Willie rushes up.

                                   WILLIE
                       Give me that parachute, I
                       changed my mind --

       She grabs the parachute and starts to fight Shorty over it--

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       No, this last one!  It's for Indy!

       They scuffle until the parachute skids across the floor.  Short
       Round jumps for it -- the parachute falls out the door and Short
       Round starts to fall out after it!

       Willie grabs him by the seat of his pants and hauls him back from
       the abyss!

24.    EXT.  THE SKY - DAY                                            24.

       The fighters peel off toward the DC-3 with their guns flaming in
       another attack.

25.    INT.  THE PASSENGER CABIN                                      25.

       Short Round tries to wake Indy again.  Finally, Shorty grabs
       Indy's bag, pulls his holster out of it and runs toward the back.

       Indy continues to sleep -- until bullets smash the window by his
       head and a fire extinguisher is hit and starts spraying into
       Indy's face.

       He finally awakens and jumps up.  He looks around is disbelief at
       the battle-torn, nearly-empty airplane.

                                   INDIANA
                                  (groggily)
                       We there yet?

       Indiana sees Shorty shooting his pistol out the side door as the
       planes swoop by again.  Out of ammo, Shorty throws the gun
       angrily at the passing plane.

       Indiana picks up his whip and attaches it to his belt as Willie
       runs over to him.

                                   WILLIE
                       There's nobody flying the plane!

26.    INT.  THE COCKPIT                                              26.

       The door flies open and Indy rushes in with Willie behind him.
       Indy appraises the situation quickly and jumps into the pilot's
       seat with total confidence --

                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)
                       You know how to fly?

       Indy surveys the control panels, the myraid of dials and switches --

                                   INDIANA
                       No.
                                  (hopefully)
                       Do you?

27.    INT.  THE PASSENGER CABIN                                      27.

       Willie runs screaming out of the cockpit, her last hope shatter-
       ed.  Shorty is pulling something out of the cargo compartment --
       he's found a machine gun and sets it up on a short tripod.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Come here, lady, hold this and
                       shut up please!

       He pulls Willie down to the floor and shoves her the ammunition
       belt that's draped toward the gun.  Then Shorty jumps behind the
       machine gun --

       As the first fighter appears off their side, Short Round blasts
       out the open door!  The machine gun explodes to life, chewing
       bullets, smoking and spitting shells at Willie --

       Willie hollers terrified by manages to feed the ammo belt as
       Short Round sights the blazing machine gun -- suddenly he shoops!

       Willie sees the fighter hit -- it smokes and veers away -- and
       then EXPLODES!

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       I get it!

                                   WILLIE
                       You got it!

       The second plane swoops down and Short Round blasts away.  This
       time as he swivels the gun, he misses and hits one of the DC-3's
       own engines and it explodes!

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Oh oh -- big mistake!

28.    INT.  THE COCKPIT                                              28.

       Trying to figure out the controls, Indy looks up to see their en-
       gine explose into flames --

                                   INDIANA
                                  (angrily)
                       Short Round, what in the hell
                       are you doing?

       Suddenly the DC-3 emerges out of a cloud and Indy sees they are
       headed directly for a mountain!  He pulls back hard on the con-
       trols as a rocky peak looms lethally in front of them.

29.    EXT.  THE SKY - DAY                                            29.

       The DC-3 lifts at the last second and smashes some snow off the
       uppermost pinnacle as it clears the mountain by inches!

       Kao Kan's fighter is glued to the DC-3's tail and continues to
       strafe -- but the fighter pilot pulls up too late -- and the
       fighter explodes as it hits the peak of the mountain!

30.    INT.  THE PASSENGER CABIN                                      30.

       Indy rushes out of the smoking cockpit to find Willie and Short
       Round crawling out from under the debris that's fallen on them.
       Then Indy spots something in the wreckage --

       He pulls at some yellow canvas and Willie sees as sign: EMERGENCY
       LIFE RAFT.  Indy drags the folded canvas over to the open door.

                                   WILLIE
                       Are you crazy, a lift raft?!  We're
                       not sinking, we're crashing!

                                   INDIANA
                       Get over here, damn it!  Short Round,
                       come on, grab onto me tight!

       Willie sees Short Round rush over to Indiana and grab him around
       the waist from behind.  Willie finally jumps up and runs over --

                                   WILLIE
                       Wait for me!

       She throws her arms around Indy's neck so that she and Shorty are
       both hugging him from behind.  Indy clutches the folded lift raft
       in front of him and surveys the mountainside rushing close be-
       neath the skinking airplane --

       Finally, an instant before the plane will hit, Indy dives and
       pulls the inflation cord!

31.    EXT.  THE SKY                                                  31.

       As the smoking DC-3 screams out of control toward the mountain,
       skimming the rocky snow-covered slopes, we see the lift raft
       spilling out the open door --

       The raft pops into its full shape, acting now as a spoiler, soar-
       ing against the rushing wind and finally crashing and bouncing
       against the snowy mountainside.

       In the distance, we see the DC-3 finally kiss the earth and ex-
       plode in a cloud of flame against a rocky escarpment -- metal and
       earth mushrooming in a million directions!

32.    EXT.  THE MOUNTAINSIDE                                         32.

       As the raft rockets down the snow, Indiana clutches the front and
       Willie and Short Round hold on for dear life on either side of
       him.

       The raft plummets down the mountain, crossing the timber-line and
       entering a forest.  Bouncing over a snow-hidden log, the raft
       shoots directly for a tree --

       Indiana pulls on the perimeter rope, rolls on his side and man-
       ages to swerve the raft so it caroms offthe snow-drifted side of
       the tree trunk.

       Continuing its downhill run, the raft smashes across a small
       steam, sending silvery water spraying.

       As the raft skids below the snow-level, it starts bouncing over
       rocky ground and its three passengers' teeth start chattering.

33.    EXT.  A BLUFF                                                  33.

       The yellow raft crashes through a tangle of bushes and then plum-
       mets toward a bluff!  The raft goes airborne over a small bluff
       and lands with a splash in a slow-moving river.

34.    EXT.  THE RIVER                                                34.

       The life raft drifts down the river and Indy looks around and
       smiles cockily at Willie and Short Round --

       Their faces don't show gratitude, but horror -- Indy hears some-
       thing and turns to see:

35.    EXT.  WHITE WATER RAPIDS                                       35.

       The raft is heading directly toward a surging stretch of treach-
       erous rapids.  Indiana looks less cocky as he and Willie and
       Short Round hold on again for dear life!

       The raft plunges into the roaring torrent, bouncing over rock-
       swollen waves, twisting and spinning through narrow gaps.  The
       three helpless passengers are drenched in the thundering cascades
       of white water.

       Willie is hallering, Short Round hangs on wide-eyed and even Indy
       looks terrified as the raft crashes down the rapids.  Finally,
       after one heart-stopping bounce, the raft seems to slow.

36.    EXT.  RIVER CLEARING                                           36.

       The raft drifts out of the main part of the river and glides to-
       ward a clearing.  Its three soaked and bedraggled passengers lie
       motionless in the bottom.

       Indy's hand drags alongside the raft, his fingers leaving a trail
       in the almost still water.  Battered and exhausted, but always
       Indy's "bodyguard", Shorty looks over at him worriedly --

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Indy?

                                   INDIANA
                       Okay, Shorty.

       Indy looks over at Willie who is moaning.

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       You all right?

                                   WILLIE
                       No... I'm not cut out for the
                       kind of life you lead.
                                  (moaning)
                       Oh no...I ripped my dress.  Where
                       are we anyway?

       The raft floats to a gentle stop -- we see it nudge against a
       pair of dark feet.  Indy squints up into the sun and sees some-
       thing.

                                   INDIANA
                       India...

                                   WILLIE
                       Holy cow -- India?  How do you
                       know we're in --

       She rolls over and yelps as she looks up at the bizarre, painted
       face of a SHAMAN.  Silhoutted against the blazing sun, the skin-
       ny little old man in a loincoloth stares down at them in the raft.

       An eerie wind rises and howls.  The old man places his palms to-
       gether and moves his hands up to touch his forehead.  Willie and
       Short Round watch mystified as Indiana returns the old shaman's
       silent greeting.

                                                               CUT TO:

37.    EXT.  THE MAYAPORE HILLS - DAY                                 37.

       Indya and Short Round follow the shaman and four peasants down a
       gutted path through barren rolling hills.  Willie is out of her
       milieu, stumbling along this forlorn landscape in high heels,
       tuxedo jacket and disheveled lame gown.

       She hears the old shaman talking to Indy and catches up with them
       to find out what's going on.

                                   WILLIE
                                (to Indiana)
                       What'd he say?

                                   INDIANA
                       He told me they knew I was coming
                       here.

                                   WILLIE
                       What do you mean -- how?

                                   INDIANA
                       The old man saw it in a dream.

                                   WILLIE
                       Dream -- nightmare is more like it.

                                   INDIANA
                       He said that's whey they were at
                       river -- they were waiting for
                       the plane to fall down.

       He looks at her bewildered face and smiles faintly.  As they
       walk, a hot wind swirls dust around them,  a wind slowly ravaging
       what soil is left in this terribly blighted region.

                                                               CUT TO:

38.    EXT.  MAYAPORE - DAY                                           38.

       At the base of the hills, Mayapore village does nothing to re-
       lieve the awful sense of devastation.  A desolate road runs
       through the village, along which groups of ptiifully poor vil-
       lagers stare at the strangers being brought in.

       Hopeless women lift buckets from a dry well -- finding only sand.
       Skinny miserable dogs skulk between the decrepit village huts,
       eyed by the patient vultures lurling in scraggly trees.

       Indiana notices the wretched peasants staring at Short Round,
       some of them pointing at him, a few haggard women shedding tears
       down their wrinkled faces as the little Chinese boy passes.

       There is no sign of children in the village and Short Round grows
       frightened by the odd attention.  He moves closer to Indy as they
       pass the devastated population.

                                                               CUT TO:

39.    RXT.  MAYAPORE VILLAGE - AFTER SUNSET                          39.

       Black clouds clot across the blood-red sky as darkness falls.
       Indiana, Willie and Short Round sit tensely on a shabby rug.
       Above their heads, there is a thatched roof, but there are no
       walls.

       The dying sunset silhouettes them and the half-dozen elders seat-
       ed in the dirt around them.  A grey-haired man, the village
       CHIEFTAIN, gives quiet commands to the women who scuttle in and
       set wooden plates in front of the three visitors.  No plates are
       places in front of the elders.

                                   WILLIE
                               (quietly to Indy)
                       I hope this means we're going to
                       get some dinner.

       Indiana sees the painted shaman, who sits next to the chieftain,
       watching Willie.  The women bring in a bowl from which they scoop
       tiny portions of grey gruel onto three plates.

       To this the women add a few grains of yellowed rice and a with-
       ered ,molding piece of fruit.  Willie looks aghast at the unappe-
       tizing combination.

                                   WILLIE
                                  (quietly)
                       God, I am starving, but I can't
                       eat this...
                                   INDIANA
                       That's more food than these people
                       eat in a week.
                                  (pointedly) 
                       They're starving, too...

       Willie looks around at the emaciated faces and feels like crawl-
       ing into a hole.

                                   WILLIE
                       I'm sorry, I -- here, please.

       She picks up her plate and gently hands it back to the women.
       The chieftain finally speaks to them --

                                   CHIEFTAIN
                       You will rest here before you go
                       on.

                                   INDIANA
                       We'd appreciate that.  This was an
                       unexpected detour.  We'll have to go
                       to Delhi now and find a flight west.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                                   (smiling)
                       Indy is taking me to America.

       All eyes are on Short Round.  Puzzled by this strange attention,
       Shorty's smile fades nervously.

                                   INDIANA
                       I'm a professor.  I have to re-
                       turn to the university.  Can you
                       give us a guide to take us to Delhi?

       The chieftain indicates a young villager sitting near them.

                                   CHIEFTAIN
                       Sanju will guide you.

                                   INDIANA
                       Thank you.

       The old shaman speaks now for the first time.

                                   SHAMAN
                       On the way to Delhi, you will
                       stop at Pankot.

                                   INDIANA
                                  (puzzled)
                       Pankot isn't on the way to Delhi.

                                   SHAMAN
                       You will go to palace there.

                                   INDIANA
                       Hasn't the Pankot palace been de-
                       serted since the Mutiny of 1857?

                                   SHAMAN
                                  (darkly)
                       No. Now there is new Maharajah --
                       and palace is powerful again.

       The shaman looks around at his unfortunate people.

                                   SHAMAN (Cont'd)
                       It is Pankot Palace that kills my
                       village.

                                   INDIANA
                       I don't understand.  What's hap-
                       pened here?

                                   SHAMAN
                       The evil starts in Pankot.  Then
                       like monsoon, it moves darkness
                       over all country.

                                   INDIANA
                       What evil?

                                   SHAMAN
                       They came from Palace and took
                       sivalinga from out village.

       Willie looks over at Indiana --

                                   WILLIE
                       Took what?

                                   INDIANA
                       It's a sacred stone in a shine
                       that's supposed to protect a
                       village.

                                   SHAMAN
                       It is why Krishna brought you here.

                                   INDIANA
                               (politely firm)
                       Nobody brought us here.  Our plane
                       crashed.  We were shot down by --

                                   SHAMAN
                              (interrupting)
                       No.  We pray to Krishna to help us
                       find the stone.  It was Krishna who
                       made you fall from sky -- so you can
                       got to Pankot Palace.  To find siva-
                       linga -- and bring back to us.

       Indy's about to object -- then he looks at the sad chieftain, the
       elders and peasants who are watching him helplessly.  And he sees
       again the dark steady eyes of the old shaman.

                                                               CUT TO:

40.    EXT.  MAYAPORE VILLAGE - NIGHT                                 40.

       Torches falre eerily and dogs howl as the peasants accompany the
       shaman, elders and three visitors out ot the edge of the dark
       village.  Short Round walks beside Indy.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Indy, they make out plane crash?
                       To get you here?

                                   INDIANA
                       It's just superstition, Shorty.
                       Like a ghost story.

       Short Round looks plenty scared as they all stop walking.  The
       shaman motions and the men with torches circle around a pile of
       rocks to illuminate them.  The shaman makes a gesture of devotion
       to the primitive shrine and Indy speaks to the village chieftain.

                                   CHIEFTAIN
                       Yes.

       Indiana seems skeptical as he kneels to study the shrine.  On top
       of the pile of rocks, there is a carved niche.  The niche is
       empty but an indentation indicates the conical shape of the stone
       that was stolen.

                                   INDIANA
                       Was the stone very smooth?
                                 (he sees the
                                 chieftain nod)
                       It was probably brought here from
                       a sacred river.

                                   SHAMAN
                              (joining Indy and
                               the chieftain)
                       Long ago -- before my father's
                       father.

                                   INDIANA
                       And it had three lines painted
                       across it?
                                  (seeing the
                                   shaman nod)
                       The lines represent the three
                       levels of the universe.  I've seen
                       stones like the one you lost.

       Indy stands slowly.  Willie is beside him looking at the shrine.

                                   WILLIE
                       I don't understand how losing one
                       rock could destroy this village.
                             (whispering to Indy)
                       Is it really powerful?

       Indy gives a doubtful smile.  He turns again to the old shaman.

                                   INDIANA
                       But why would the Maharajah take
                       this sacred stone?

                                   SHAMAN
                       They say we must pray to their
                       evil god.  We say we will not.

       The old shaman looks off and fights the tears in his eyes as he
       starts speaking in Hindi.

                                   INDIANA
                                 (translating)
                       He says that when the sacred stone
                       was taken the village wells dried
                       up first and then the river stopped.

       Indy turns and asks the shaman a question in Hindi.  The shaman
       answers in Hindi.

                                   INDIANA
                                   (translating)
                       He says their crops dies and then
                       the animals died.

       The shaman walks to the edge of the torchlight and looks out into
       the darkness as he continues speaking emotionally in Hindi --

                                   INDIANA
                                   (translating)
                       And then they took their children.

                                   WILLIE
                       Their children?

       She looks at Short Round and finally understands the sorrowful
       faces always watching him.  Indy asks another question in Hindi
       and the shaman continues his story --

                                   INDIANA
                                   (translating)
                       He says one night there was a fire
                       in the fields.  The men went to
                       fight it.  When they came back,
                       they heard the women crying in the
                       darkness.  And the children were
                       gone.

       The shaman walks slowly toward Indiana.

                                   SHAMAN
                       You will find them when you find
                       sivlalinga.

                                   INDIANA
                       I'm sorry, I don't know how I can
                       help you here.

       The shaman and the chieftain stare and Indiana, refusing to accept
       that.

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       The English authorities who con-
                       trol this area are the only ones
                       who can help you.

                                   CHIEFTAIN
                       They do not listen.

                                   INDIANA
                       I have friends in Delhi and I will
                       make sure they investigate this...

                                   SHAMAN
                       No, you will got to Pankot...

       The old man speaks again in his own tongue and Indy looks dis-
       turbed.

                                   WILLIE
                       What'd he say now?

                                   INDIANA
                       It was destined that I came here --
                       and the future cannot be changed...

       Indy looks ath the shaman and the torchlight reflected in his
       eyes.

                                                               CUT TO:

41.    EXT.  MAYAPORE - NIGHT                                         41.

       Suddenly we're rushing headlong down a dark dirt path seen from
       the POV of somebody running in terror.  We hear heavy breathing
       -- above we see the scraggly trees blowing against the full moon
       as an eerie wind rises and howls.  We continue crashing through
       the dying fields tward the dark village...

42.    INT.  INDIANA'S HUT - NIGHT                                    42.

       The wind swirls into the hut and Indiana's eyes open.  He lies
       still a moment and then sits up slowly.  He sees Short Round
       sleeping nearby.

       Sensing something strange, Indy gets to his feet.  He steps
       around Short Round and goes to the door of the hut.

43.    EXT.  THE HUT - NIGHT                                          43.

       Indy walks against the rising wind and looks around.  The village
       is asleep and seems deserted.  Then he turns and sees something.

       We follow small bare feet stumbling through the dust...

       Indy sees an emaciated child in rag running out of the darkness.
       Indiana moves forward and the child runs toward him.  Indy grabs
       the little boy as he falls into his arms.

                                                               CUT TO:

44.    INT.  THE SHAMAN'S HUT - NIGHT                                 44.

       A few minutes later, the little boy is lying unconscious on a
       blanket.  Elders crouch around him.  Indy is kneeling and watches
       the shaman wet the boy's forehead with a rag and drip water onto
       his lips.

       The little boy's eyes open and he begins to revive.  Shrot Round
       And Willie watch from a corner as the little boy looks at all the
       faces peering down at him.

       The little boy's arm moves and he reaches out to Indy rather than
       any of the others.  Indy takes his small hand and sees that the
       boy's fingers are cut and bruised -- his fingers open and drop
       something into Indy's hand.

       The little boy tries to whisper.  Indy has to lean close to hear
       as the little boy's lips move again --

                                   LITTLE BOY
                       Sankara...

       A mother rushes into the hut now and kneels and hugs her little
       boy.  His skinny arms go around her as they are reunited.  Indy
       stands slowly and looks at what the little boy gave him --

       It is a small tattered piece of cloth:  an old fragment of a mini-
       ature painting.  Indiana looks at it with an expression of recog-
       nition and apprehension...

                                   INDIANA
                       Sankara...

45.    EXT.  THE VILLAGE - MORNING                                    45.

       The camera follows Indiana -- he's walking fast and determinded-
       ly.  Villagers trot alongside of him, trying to keep up with is
       pace as he questions thm in Hindi.

       Indy approaches two large elephants and sees their guide Sajnu
       trying to politely drag Willie toward one of them.

                                   INDIANA
                       Damn it , Willie, get on -- we've
                       got to move out!

       Willie's head comes up over the back of the elephant as she's
       helped from below -- there is a look of sheer terror on her face.

                                   WILLIE
                       Whoa!  Easy now -- nice elephant...

       Waiting by the second elephant, Short Round sees Indy coming and
       runs up to him --

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       I ride with you, Indy?

                                   INDIANA
                       Nope, you got a little surprise
                       over there, Shorty.

       Short Round runs around the big elephant and sees a baby elephant
       being brought out.  He can't believe his luck --

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Oh boy!

       Meanwhile Sajnu goads Willie's elephant over.  The villagers look
       grief stricken and many are crying as they watch the three stran-
       gers' departure.

                                   WILLIE
                               (to Short Round)
                       This is the first time anybody
                       ever cried when I left.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       They don't cry about you.  They
                       cry about the elephants leaving.

                                   WILLIE
                       Figures...

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       They got no food to feed them.  So
                       they taking the elephants away to
                       sell them.

       Indy lumbers over on his elephant.

                                   INDIANA
                       All right, let's go.  I want to get
                       to Pankot before tomorrow night.

       She looks at Indiana as he rides past.

                                   WILLIE
                       Pankot?!  I thought we were going
                       to Delhi!  Hey, wait a minute!
                                (looking at
                                 the villagers)
                       Can't somebody take me to Delhi?!
                       I don't want to go to Pankot!

       Sajnu guides her elephant and Willie lurches forward --

                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)
                                  (yelling) 
                       Indiana!  Damn it!  Why'd you
                       change your mind?  What did that
                       kid tell you last night?!

       Indy ignores her hollering.  The elephants move off through the
       crowds of pitiful villagers.  Indy sees the elders, chieftain and
       the old shaman who brings his hands up to his forehead as Indy
       rides past.

                                                               CUT TO:

46.    EXT.  THE COUNTRYSIDE - DAY                                    46.

       The elephants move across the desolate countryside toward the
       distant hills.

47.    EXT.  THE TRAIL                                                47.

       Indiana rides the lead elephant.  Sajnu passes on foot guiding
       Willie's elephant.  With the tuxedo jacket wrapped around her
       waist, Willie is dabbing perfume behind her ears.

                                   WILLIE
                             (to her elephant)
                       I think you need this more than
                       me.

       Willie leans forward and puts perfume behind the elephant's ears.
       Grimacing at the animal's smell she simply dumps the rest of the
       perfume on the elephant's back.

       Willie yelps when the elephant's trunk comes back, sniffs the
       foriegn fragrance and suddenly trumpets in disgust.

                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)
                       What're you complaining about,
                       this is expensive stuff!

                                                               CUT TO:

48.    EXT.  LOWER JUNGLES - DAY                                      48.

       From a cliff, we see the elephants below passing into the lower
       jungles.

       Spotting something on an overhanging tree branck, Short Round
       stands up precariously on the baby elephant's back.  He pulls a
       vine from the tree as they pass under it.  Plopping down onto the
       baby elephant's back, he picks the wild fruit from the vine --

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Here you go, lunch time!

       The baby elephant's trunk comes back and takes the fruit.  Shorty
       looks up in the sky.

                                   SHORT ROUND (Cont'd)
                       Indy, look!

       Indiana and Willie look up and see hundreds of enormous winged
       creatures flapping across the afternoon sky.

                                   WILLIE
                       Those are very big bird.

       Sajnu says something and Indiana nods.

                                   INDIANA
                       Those aren't birds -- those are
                       giant bats.

       Willie shudders as she watches the bats.

                                                               CUT TO:

49.    EXT.  THE HILLS - AFTERNOON                                    49.

       An enormous sun silhouettes the three elephants trekking west-
       ward.

                                                               CUT TO:

50.    EXT.  A RIVER - LATER AFTERNOON                                50.

       The three elephants stand sucking up river water with their
       trunks.  Seated on the huge beasts, Willie, Short Round and Indi-
       ana watch the thirsty animals.

                                   WILLIE
                       They must be pretty dumb to drink
                       that awful-looking water.

       In response, Willie's elephant calmly lifts its trunk and sprays
       her in the face.  Short Round and Indy laugh as Willie sits
       soaked and shocked.

                                   INDIANA
                       I think maybe we'll camp here.

                                                               CUT TO:

51.    EXT.  THE RIVER - SUNSET                                       51.

       A plume of water sprays.  The three elephants submerge in a deep,
       wide spot in the river.  Indy wades in the current with his shirt
       off.  He and the guide splash water on the weary animals.

       Short Round laughs and plays with the baby elephant.  Wrapped in
       its trunk, he's swung in the air and lands on the elephant's
       back.  Shorty makes a swan dive back into the water and the baby
       elephant gives him a shower when he surfaces.

52.    EXT.  UPRIVER                                                  52.

       Thirty yards upstream, birds and monkeys chatter in a tree.  In
       the shady river beneath, Willie surfaces cooly and wipes hair
       from her eyes.  She hums contendedly.

       Indiana wanders up the riverbank in his dripping trousers.  He
       notices Willie's wet clothes spread over a tree limb hanging low
       over the water and then he sees Willie paddling around.

                                   INDIANA
                       Hey, Willie -- I think you better
                       get out now.

                                   WILLIE
                       Stark naked?  You wish... If you're
                       trying to seduce me, Dr. Jones,
                       this is a very primitive approach.

                                   INDIANA
                       Me seduce you?  Honey, you're the
                       one who took your clothes off.
                                  (shrugging)
                       I just came over to remind you
                       that you never know what else
                       might be in the water.

                                   WILLIE
                       Somehow I feel safer in here.

       As Indy turns and starts off, Willie reaches up to the tree
       branch above her head and grabs her underwear.  At this moment we
       notice something awful:

       A BOA CONSTRICTOR is moving out along the branch, the enormous
       snake slithering over Willie's clothes.

       Willie watches Indiana walk away as she reaches up for her dress
       -- her hands feel something strange -- not the dress and not the
       tree limb --

       Willie looks up and sees that she's pulling on a snake! She
       SCREAMS as the boa constrictor falls off the t-ee on top of her!

       Indy hears the scream and hears Willie calling to him.  He runs
       back toward the river.  Stopping on the riverbank, he sees Willie
       backing away in the water -- Indiana's already starting to pull
       his boots off --

                                   WILLIE
                       Indy!  Help me!

                                   INDIANA
                       Don't worry, I'm coming in!  What
                       is it?

                                   WILLIE
                       A snake!

       Suddenly Indiana freezes and a strange look corsses his face --

                                   INDIANA
                       A what...?

                                   WILLIE
                       A SNAKE!!

       He finally sees the boa constrictor thrashing in the water close
       to Willie.  He leaves his boots on.

                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)
                       Hurry, help me out of here!
                       What're you waiting for?!

                                   INDIANA
                       Uh, listen -- Willie -- I got a
                       better idea.

                                   WILLIE
                       What?!

                                   INDIANA
                       First of all -- don't panic!

       Willie suddenly screams as the boa constrictor wraps around her
       arm --

                                   WILLIE
                       It's got me !  Indy, help me!

       Indy runs along the riverbank, trying to get closer to her, but
       not about to jump into the river (due to his aversion to snakes
       -- see Episode One:  "Raiders of the Lost Ark").

                                   INDIANA
                       Don't let it pull you deeper!

                                   WILLIE
                       It's pulling me deeper!

                                   INDIANA
                       Don't let it curl around you!

                                   WILLIE
                       It's curling around me!  Damn it,
                       stop talking and do something!

       The snake is wrapping around her body and neck -- her head is
       barely above water --

       On the riverbank, Indy reaches down and grabs a piece of wood.
       But as he watches the repulsive reptile, he starts to sweat and
       his fear and loathing overpower him --

                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)
                       What's wrong?!  Indy please help
                       me!

       Indy groans and bolsters his courage -- he takes two steps into
       the water -- but the complex is to strong and he can't go any
       further.  He drops the piece of wood...

                                   INDIANA
                       Listen, Willie.  Do exactly what
                       I tell you now.

                                   WILLIE
                       What?!

                                   INDIANA
                       Can you move your arm?

                                   WILLIE
                       Just one arm!

                                   INDIANA
                       Okay, I want you to lift your hand --
                       and pet the snake.

                                   WILLIE
                       PET IT??!!

                                   INDIANA
                       Yes, stroke it right along the
                       maxillary and precaudal verte-
                       brae.

                                   WILLIE
                       THE WHAT?!

                                   INDIANA
                       Pet it on the head!  Go on, pet
                       it!

       In the water, Willie is whimpering as she lifts her hand and
       starts petting the snake  coiling around her pale body.

                                   WILLIE
                       Oh -- my -- god -- it's going to
                       crush me!

                                   INDIANA
                       Keep stroking it!

       Willie keeps rubbing her hand along the snakes head and back and
       it slowly stops thrashing in the water.

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       What's happening?

                                   WILLIE
                       It's starting to let go!

                                   INDIANA
                       That's good  -- you're doing fine.

       Grimacing as she stares at the ugly serpent's head, Willie keeps
       stroking it.

                                   WILLIE
                       It's letting fo.  I think it's --
                       I think it's going to sleep!

       Indiana looks relieved.  He sees the snake starting to drift away
       from Willie and she starts paddling back to shore, collecting her
       floating clothes along the way.

       Holding her dripping dress against herself, she walks out of the
       water toward Indy who smiles at her weakly.

                                   INDIANA
                       See -- I got you out...

       She slows and hauls off and punches him in the mouth.  Indy holds
       his jaw as she walks away infuriates.

                                   WILLIE
                       Thanks for nothing!  I hate snakes!

                                   INDIANA
                                  (looking at
                                   the water)
                       I know the feeling...

                                                               CUT TO:

53.    EXT.  THE CAMPSITE - NIGHT                                     53.

       By firelight, we see Sajnu feeding the big elephants while Short
       Round feeds and talks to the baby elephant --

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       You come to America with me, and
                       we can get job in the circus --
                       you like that?

       The baby elephant trumpets affirmitively.

       A ways off, Willie stands wrapped in a blanket watching Shorty
       and the elephant as she dries her hair by a campfire.  Now Indy
       comes up and drops an armload of wood for yet another fire.

                                   WILLIE
                       Where'd you find your little body-
                       guard?

                                   INDIANA
                       I met Short Round when he tried
                       to pick my pocket.

       Indiana kneels and arranges the wood.

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       Shorty's family was killed when
                       they bombed Shanghai.  He was
                       living on the streets.

                                   WILLIE
                                  (smiling)
                       He'll be okay.  He's a good kid.

       Indy strikes a match and lights the new fire.

                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)
                       All these fires -- you expecting
                       more snakes, Dr. Jones?

       She smiles snidely and continues drying her hair.

                                   INDIANA
                       By the way, how'd you end up in
                       Shanghai?

                                   WILLIE
                       Well, when my nightclub career was
                       run over by the Depression, some
                       pinhead convinced me that "a girl
                       could go places in the Orient..."
                       So, look where I got.

       Indy picks up a blanket and spreads it on the ground.

                                   INDIANA
                       What about the future?

                                   WILLIE
                       Oh, that's easy -- I'm going to
                       latch onto a good-looking, in-
                       credibly rich prince.

       Indy lies down on the blanket.

                                   INDIANA
                       I'd like to find one of those
                       myself.

                                   WILLIE
                           (raising an eyebrow)
                       Oh really?

                                   INDIANA
                       Yeah, but he's got to be dead and
                       buried for a couple of thousand years.
                                  (smiling)
                       Fortune and glory...

                                   WILLIE
                       Is that what you're hoping to find
                       at this palace, Dr. Jones?

                                   INDIANA
                       Maybe...

       Indy reaches into his pocket and removes the old piece of cloth.

                                   WILLIE
                       What's that?

       She walks over to where he's lying down and sits on a boulder.
       He hands her the cloth and she looks at it by the firelight.

                                   INDIANA
                       Something that kid gave me last
                       night.  It's a piece of an old
                       manuscript.

       Willie sees a crude drawing in reds, blue and gold.

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       The drawing shows a priest named
                       Sankara who lived centuries ago.

                                   WILLIE
                       What does the writing say?

                                   INDIANA
                       It's Sanskrit.  It tells the story
                       of Sankara climbing Mt. Kalisa
                       where he met the Hindu god Shiva.

                                   WILLIE
                               (examining it)
                       That's Shiva?  What's he giving
                       the Priest?

                                   INDIANA
                       Legend says he told Sankara to go
                       forth and combat evil.  To do that
                       he gave him five sacred stones that
                       had magical powers.

                                   WILLIE
                               (looking at Indy)
                       You mean magical like the rock that
                       was stolen from that village?

       Indy looks at her meaningfully.

                                   INDIANA
                       It could be.

       Willie seems frightened.  She hands him the piece of cloth and
       stands up.

                                   WILLIE
                                   (quietly)
                       Fortune and glory...sweet dreams,
                       Dr. Jones.

       She picks up a blanket and starts off.

                                   INDIANA
                       I think you should sleep closer.
                                (seeing her sus-
                                 picious look)
                       I meant for safety.

                                   WILLIE
                                  (smiling)
                       I'd be safer sleeping with
                       that snake.

       She steps over to a tree by the fire where her clothes are dry-
       ing.  Indy watches her pull her dried clothes from the lower
       branches.

       She reaches up to remove another piece of her clothing -- it's
       stuck to the tree and she looks up and yanks it.  Suddenly the
       piece of clothing moves!

       Two enormous winds open and the hideous face of a GIANT BAT
       screeches and hisses at Willie!  She screams hysterically as the
       bat flaps against her, biting and scratching at her before it fi-
       nally takes off.

       The bat flies off into the darkness and Indy chuckles as he
       watches Willie shanking as she backs slowly toward the fire --

                                   WILLIE
                       Did you see it?!  It was one
                       of those bats!
                                   (staring into
                                    the darkness)
                       God, what else is out there...?!

       She quickly picks up her blanket and lays it out very close to
       Indy.

                                   INDIANA
                       Couldn't keep away, huh?

                                   WILLIE
                       Just try and control yourself.

       Indiana watches her lie down and wrap herself in her blanket.
       then he rolls over and tips his hat down over his eyes to get
       some well-deserved shut-eye.

       In a moment, however, we see something grotesque and snake-like
       slide into frame and move towards Indy -- finally, we realize
       it's an elephant's trunk.  The trunk nudges Indy's shoulder.

                                   INDIANA
                              (without looking)
                       Still scared?  Okay, Willie, you
                       can get closer if you want...

       The elephant's trunk moves closer and nuzzles Indy's neck.

                                   INDIANA
                       Honey, I knew you'd be the first
                       one to give in...

       Now, we see that Short Round is guiding the baby elephant's trunk
       with a prod.  Willie watches, stifling a laugh as the elephant's
       trunk sniffs Indiana's ear --

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       You're going to start something
                       I'm going to have to finish.
                                  (moaning)
                       Okay, doll, you asked for it.

       Indiana rolls over, lifts his hat and hollers!  He nearly jumps
       out of his pants as he stares into the elephant's trunk.  Willie
       and Short Round dissolve into laughter.

                                                               CUT TO:

54.    EXT.  THE JUNGLE - DAY                                         54.

       Tall, vine-covered trees sway in the wind.  Beneath them, the el-
       ephants plough through the dense tropical forest.  The sounds of
       the teeming jungle multiply as Short Round surveys the distant
       hills.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Indy, look!

                                   INDIANA
                       That's it.  Pankot Palace.

       Willie looks off at the resplendent while Moghul-style palace ri-
       sing in the distance above the jungle.

                                                               CUT TO:

55.    EXT.  A JUNGLE CLEARING - LATER                                55.

       Their Mayapore guide walks toward the camera and suddenly looks
       frightened.  He barks commands and the elephants stop.  Indiana
       jumps down an joins the fearful guide.

       They stare at a small statue of a malevolent goddess with eight
       arms.  Around the goddess's neck, a carved necklace displays
       small human heads -- her eight hands hold other heads by their
       hair.

       Indiana moves closer to the statue as the terrified guide backs
       away.  Indy is fascinated by the ritual objects adorning it:
       leaves, dead birds, rodents and turtles.  Indiana grimaces as he
       lifts a necklace of real pierced human fingers...

                                   WILLIE (O.S.)
                       Why are we stopping here?

       Indiana goes back and joins the scared, jabbering guide who is
       helping Willie down from the elephant.  Short Round jumps down.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       What you look at, Indy?

                                   INDIANA
                       Just a statue.

                                   WILLIE
                       What's the guide talking about?
                       He hasn't said a word the whole
                       trip.

       Indy listens to the agitated guide and then speaks a few words in
       Hindi back to him.  They watch the distressed guide trun the ele-
       phants and start away with them as fast as possible.

                                   WILLIE
                       He's afraid of something.

                                   INDIANA
                       He said he couldn't take us any
                       farther.  He has to go sell the
                       elephants.

                                   WILLIE
                       You mean we have to walk the rest
                       of the way?

       Willie moans and follows Indy.  Short Round watches the elephants
       trudging away.  The little elephant turns and looks back.  Short
       Round quickly wipes a tear from his face.

                                                               CUT TO:

56.    EXT.  A PALACE APPROACH - AFTERNOON                            56.

       Indiana and Short Round hike up a rock-paved road beside a high
       wall.  Exhausted, carrying her high heels, Willie trudges along
       behind them.

                                   WILLIE
                       -- shot at, fallen out of a plane,
                       nearly drowned, squashed by a snake,
                       attacked by a bat -- I smell like
                       an elephant!
                                 (yelling)
                       I tell you I'm not going to make it!

       Indiana finally stops.  He walks back to Willie, suddenly picks
       her us in his arms and starts carrying her the remaining way.
       Willie is surprised and puzzled.

                                   INDIANA
                       Any more complaints?

                                   WILLIE
                              (smiling faintly)
                       Yeah, I wish you'd thought of this
                       sooner...

       She doesn't seem to mind being carried by Indy.  He arrives at
       the entrance to the palace and puts her down -- she stands close
       to him and he gently smoothes the collar of her dress.

                                   INDIANA
                       It doesn't feel like there's been
                       any permanent damage.

       She smiles at him again and then turns around -- and whistles as
       she sees Pankot Palace:  a sprawling, monumental mixture of Mo-
       ghul and Rajput styles, the palace is an extravaganza of Princely
       architecture.

57.    EXT.  A BRIDGE                                                 57.

       The three travelers start across a marble bridge toward the main
       entrance.  Lined along the bridge, palace guards stand with
       lances.

       As the threesome passes, the first Rajput guard snaps noisily to
       attention and Willie jumps.  As Willie continues across the
       bridge, the other guards snap to attention in sequence and she
       grins, enjoying the attention.

58.    INT.  THE OUTER COURTYARD                                      58.

       Short Round and Willie follow Indiana through a dark archway into
       a glittering courtyard.  The palace seems deserted and forebod-
       ing.

                                   INDIANA
                       Hello?...(hello?)...(hello?)

       Indy's voice echoes off the marble facades -- three enormous Raj-
       put guards with curved swords in their sashes appear silently at
       opposite sides of the courtyard.

                                   WILLIE
                               (frightened)
                       Hi...(hi)...(hi)...

       Then, a tall severe-looking Indian in an English suit material-
       izes out of the shadows and comes forward slowly.  CHATTAR LAL
       appraises the intruders suspiciously:

       He sees a whoozy beauty in a weary evening gown;  a dirty Chinese
       kid with a baseball cap; a rugged-looking American carrying a
       bullwhip...

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       I would say you look rather lost.
                                  (disdainfullt)
                       But then I cannot imagine where
                       in the world the three of you
                       would look at home...

                                   INDIANA
                                (smiling evenly)
                       Lost?  No, we're not lost.  We're
                       on our way to Delhi.  This is Miss
                       Scott -- and Mr. Round.  My name's
                       Indiana Jones.

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                                  (surprised)
                       Dr. Jones?  The eminent archae-
                       ologist?

                                   WILLIE
                       Hard to believe, isn't it...?

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       I remember first hearing your name
                       when I was studying at Oxford.  I
                       Am Chattar Lal, Prime Minister for
                       His Highness the Maharajah of Pankot.

       He bows and Willie sort of curtsies.

                                   CHATTAR LAL (Cont'd)
                       Welcome to Pankot Palace.

59.    INT.  PANKOT PALACE - AFTERNOON                                59.

       They walk along the marble halls, past dazzling walls inlaid with
       pieces of mirror and semi-precious stones.  Fountains spray in
       ivory countyards and they gaze in awe at the ornate splendour.

       As Willie walks with Shorty she appraises the chronolgoical
       portraits of the Pankot Prices that line the hall.  Dissipated 
       faces, elegant faces, evil faces -- she reacts to them.

                                   WILLIE
                               (to Short Round)
                       How'd you like to run into him in
                       a dark alley...that one's kind of
                       cute...I could see myself married
                       to a prince like that...

       Ahead of them Chattar Lal  walks with Indy and questions him
       suspiciously --

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       The plane crash and your journey
                       here sound -- most incredible.

                                   WILLIE
                       You should have been there...

                                   INDIANA
                       We'd appreciate it if the Mahara-
                       jah would let us stay tonight.
                       We'll be on out way in the morn-
                       ing.

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       I am only his humble servant, but
                       the Maharajah usually listens to
                       my advice.

                                   WILLIE
                       Is that him?

       They've come to the last in the row of Princes portraits.  Wil-
       lie stops and looks up disappointedly at a picture of an aged,
       immensely corpulent Rajput prince.

                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)
                                (politely)
                       He's not exactly what we call
                       "a spring chicken".

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       No, no, that is Uhmed Singh, the
                       present Maharajah's late father.

                                   WILLIE
                       Oh -- good.  And maybe the pres-
                       ent Marahajah is a little younger?
                       And thinner?

       Two female servants approach silently and bow.

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       They will escort you to your rooms
                       now.  You will be provided with
                       fresh clothes.  Tonight you will
                       be dining with His Highness.

                                   WILLIE
                       Dinner?  And with a prince?!  My
                       luck is changing.  But look at
                       me -- my god, I've to to get
                       ready!

       She hurried off with one of the servants toward her room.  Chat-
       tar Lal smiles cooly at Indiana --

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       Eight o'clock in the Pleasure
                       Pavilion.

                                                               CUT TO:

60.    EXT.  THE PLEASURE PALIVION - NIGHT                            60.

       An extraordinary gold dome rises in the middle of the eleaborate
       gardens.  The Pleasure Pavilion is ablaze with torch lights,
       flickering candles and exotic music.

       Indiana comes out of the palace with Short Round.  Indy has on a
       tweed jacket and a nectie -- his university professor's outfit.
       Short Round has been cleaned up, but still sports his baseball
       cap.

       Willie joins them, looking stunning is a silk Western-styled
       gown.  She's also been loaned some Moghul jewelry which sparkles
       on her neck and arms.

                                   INDIANA
                       You look like a princess.

       Willie's flattered by the first nice thing Indy's said to her.

                                   WILLIE
                       It's sort of like being in heaven.

       They cross the garden toward the pavilion and Willie's eyes are
       like a kid's at Christmas.

61.    INT.  THE PLEASURE PAVILION                                    61.

       As they enter, Indiana gives a half-dressed dancing girl the
       once-over as she spins to the music of drums and "vinhas".

                                   INDIANA
                                  (smiling)
                       I've always had a weakness for
                       folk dancing.

                                   WILLIE
                                  (snidely)
                       She might get away with that act
                       here, but she'd never make it in
                       a real nightclub.

       They walk among the rich court ministers and Indian merchants.
       Chattar Lal approaches with a British cavalry captain in unifrom.

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       We are fortunate tonight to have
                       some many unexpected guests.  his
                       is Captain Phillip Blumburtt.

       Blumburtt bows to Willie and Indiana.

                                   CHATTAR LAL (Cont'd)
                       Captain Blumburtt and his troops
                       are here to check up on the
                       "natives".

                                   CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                                  (politely)
                       Just a routine inspection tour.

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       The British worry so about their
                       Emprie -- it makes us feel like
                       well-cared-for children.

                                   WILLIE
                       Listen, Mr. Lal, what do you call
                       the Maharajah's  wife?

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       His Highness has not yet taken a
                       wife.

                                   WILLIE
                                  (happily)
                       No?  Well, I guess he just hasn't
                       met the right woman...

       As Willie chatters on with the Prime Minister, Indiana wanders
       off.  He moves to a wall where bronze statues and strange devo-
       tional objects are displayed.

                                   CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                                  (joining Indy)
                       Interested in local curios?

                                   INDIANA
                       No.  But I am interested in the
                       occult.  And this is a krtya.

       Indiana picks up a small clay figurine and examines it.

                                   CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                                   (grimacing)
                       Charming.

                                   INDIANA
                       It's like the voodoo dolls of West
                       Africa.  The kryta represents your
                       enemy -- and gives you complete
                       power over him.

                                   CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                       That God all that mumbo jumbo
                       rubbish is disappearing.

                                   INDIANA
                       You think so?

                                   CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                       Of course.  Admittedly, it's taken
                       time.  Britian's controlled India
                       for almost two hundred eyars now.

       Indiana smiles at the somewhat pompous bureaucrat.

                                   INDIANA
                       You're hanging on better here
                       than you did in America.

                                   CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                                  (smiling sourly)
                       This is a different situation, Dr.
                       Jones.  These people are like
                       children.  We have to lead them
                       slowly into the twentieth century.

       Indiana puts the doll down and looks over at Chattar Lal and
       Willie.

                                   INDIANA
                       The Prime Minister doesn't seem
                       that naive.

                                   CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                       No, he's a very shrewd old boy.
                       Power behind the throne and all
                       that.  He actually runs this whole
                       province.

       Indy and the Prime Minister exchange distant looks as Willie
       comes back over to Indiana.  She talks to him conspiratorially --

                                   WILLIE
                       I think this Maharajah is swim-
                       ming in money.  Maybe coming here
                       wasn't such a bad idea.

       Blumburtt finds these Americans quite suspect and seems relieved
       when he hears a drum.

                                   CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                       I believe we're being called to
                       dinner.

                                   WILLIE
                       Finally!

       As the drum beats the assembled guests move toward a long, low
       table surrounded by colorful pillows.  Short Round follows with a
       little monkey he's found perched on his arm.

       As everyone stands around the table, Chattar Lal makes an an-
       nouncement in Hindi and then in English --

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       His Supremem Highness, guardian of
                       Rajput tradition -- the Maharajah
                       of Pankot -- Zalim Singh.

       All eyes are on two solid silver doors which open -- and through
       which now walks the MAHARAJAH ZALIM SINGH.  Everyone is bowing,
       including Indiana and Willie, who looks amazed --

                                   WILLIE
                       That's the Maharajah -- that kid?!

                                   INDIANA
                       Maybe he likes older women.

       Indeed, Zalim Singh is only thirteen.  Outfitted in silver and
       gold brocade, festooned with enormous jewels, the litlle Mahara-
       jah gazes imperiously at the bowing crowd -- and then glares at
       Short Round.

       Indy sees Short Round chewing gum, staring antagonistically at
       the Maharajah.  Indy pushes SHort Round into a bowing position.

       The Maharajah finally sits down on golden pillows.  He nods and
       his guests take their seats.  Indiana sees Willie's dreams of
       queendom have vanished.

                                   INDIANA
                       Cheer up, you lost your prince,
                       but dinner's on the way.

                                   WILLIE
                       I've never been so hungry in my
                       life...

       Servants appear with silver platters of steaming food.  They
       place a platter in front of Willie and she stares at it in amaze-
       ment:

       It's a whole raosted boar, replete with a decorative arrow pierc-
       ing its bloated stomach and tiny broiled baby bores placed around
       it as if they were suckling on their well-cooked mother.

                                   WILLIE
                                 (grimacing)
                       My god, sort of grusome, isn't
                       it...?

       Seeing the meat being served, Indiana looks across the table at
       Blumburtt who seems equally puzzled.  Meanwhile, the little Maha-
       rajah whispers to his Prime Minsiter.  Then Chattar Lal speaks to
       the table --

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       His Highness wants me to welcome
                       his visitors.  Especially the
                       renowned Dr. Jones from America.

       Indy bows slightly toward the Maharajah.

                                   INDIANA
                       We are honored to be here.

       Servants put down another platter.  Willie stares at an enormous
       steaming boa constrictor on the platter.  With a flash of a
       knife, a servant slits the huge snake and exposes a mass of
       squirming, live baby eels inside...

                                   WILLIE
                       Suddenly I'm not so hungry...

       Meanwhile, Indiana is chatting poleitely with the Prime Minister.

                                   INDIANA
                       I had a question, Mr. Prime Mini-
                       ster.  I was examining some of the
                       Maharajah's artifacts.

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       A very fine collection of very old
                       pieces, don't you think?

                                   INDIANA
                       Yes, very fine.  But not all of the
                       pieces look old.  Some were carved
                       recently and look like images used
                       by the Thuggees to worship the god-
                       des Kali.

       At the emntion of the Thuggees, the Indians at the table quiet,
       as it a taboo has been broken.  Chattar Lal glares at Indiana.

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       Dr. Jones, you know very well that
                       the Thuggee cult has been dead for
                       nearly a century.

                                   CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                       Of course.  The Thuggees were an
                       obscenity that worshipped Kali
                       with human sacrifices.  The Brit-
                       ish Army wiped them out about the
                       time of the Mutiny of 1857.

       Short Round avoids the dinner by feeding it to his little monkey
       as he listens to the scary conversation.

       The talk is bad enough, but Willie finds the food unbelievable!
       A servant leans overher shoulder and places a six-inch long BUG
       on her plate!

       Willie whimpers quietly as she watches the fat merchant next to
       her lift one of the black, shiny baked-beetles -- and crack it in
       two!  The man proceeds to enthusiastically suck the gooey innards
       out.

                                   MERCHANT
                              (looking at Willie)
                       But you're not eating!

                                   WILLIE
                                  (weakly)
                       I uh -- had bugs for lunch.

       Meanwhile, Indiana continues to politely needle Chattar Lal.

                                   INDIANA
                       I suppose stories of the Thuggees
                       die hard.

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       There are no stories anymore.

                                   INDIANA
                       Well, I don't know... we came here
                       from a small village and the peas-
                       ants there told us that the Pankot
                       Palace was growing powerful again
                       -- becuase of some ancient evil.

       Indiana smiles and shrugs.

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                                  (sneeringly)
                       Their stories are just fear and
                       folklore.

                                   INDIANA
                                   (cooly) 
                       Maybe.. but how do you explain
                       The Thuggee shrine I saw right
                       below the palace?

       Indy catches a glance between the little Maharajah and the prime
       minister, who answers slowly --

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       The local peasants are just as
                       superstitious.  You're very ob-
                       servant, Dr. Jones.  But you're
                       beginning to worry Capt. Blum-
                       burtt.

       Blumburtt's phlegmatic attitude has changed to curiosity.

                                   CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                       I'm not worried, Prime Minister,
                       just interested.

       During their conversation, Willie listens to beetles SNAPPING and
       she watches revolted as the other dinner guests suck the gooey
       insides out of the bugs.

                                   WILLIE
                             (to Short Round)
                       Give me your hat...

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       What for?

                                   WILLIE
                       I'm going to puke in it...

       Meanwhile, Indy continues ingenously with Chattar Lal.

                                   INDIANA
                       You know the villagers also
                       claimed that this palace stole
                       something from them.

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       Dr. Jones, it our country a guest
                       does not usually insult his host.

                                   INDIANA
                       Sorry, I thought we were just talking
                       about folklore.

                                   CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                           (trying to make peace)
                       I'm sure it's nothing.  Just ru-
                       mors.
                                  (but interested)
                       What was it they claimed was
                       stolen?

                                   INDIANA
                       Something magical.  A sacred rock.

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                                 (condescendingly)
                       There, you see, Captain.  A rock!

                                   INDIANA
                       When they lost this rock their
                       fields and animals dies.  They
                       also said their children were
                       taken from them.

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       I think that's enough  of this
                       nonsense, Dr. Jones...

       Indiana smiles faintly at Chattar Lal's anger.  Across the table,
       Willie looks pale and motions to the waiter.

                                   WILLIE
                       So you have something, you know,
                       simple -- like soup or something?

       The servant goes off and returns with a covered bowl.  He uncov-
       ers it and Willie looks at a soup with a dozen eyeballs floating
       in it.

                                   MERCHANT
                       Looks delicious!

                                   WILLIE
                       I wanna go home...

       Willie whimpers and tears start down her cheeks.

                                   INDIANA
                               (to Chattar Lal)
                       I was dubious muself at first.
                       Then something connected -- the
                       village's rock and the old legend
                       of the Sankara Stones...

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                            (controlling himself)
                       Dr. Jones, we are all vulnerable
                       to vicious rumors.  I seem to re-
                       member that in Honduras you were
                       accused of being a grave robber
                       rather than a scientist.

                                   INDIANA
                                 (shrugging)
                       The newspapers exaggerated the
                       incident

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       And didn't the Sultan of Madagas-
                       car threaten to cut your head off
                       if you ever returned to his coun-
                       try?

                                   INDIANA
                       That was a misunderstanding.

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                                   (smiling)
                       Exactly what we have here, Dr.
                       Jones.

                                   MAHARAJAH
                       I have heard the terrible stories
                       of the evil Thuggee cult...

       When the little Marahajah speaks it surprises everyone and there
       is silence.

                                   MAHARAJAH (Cont'd)
                       I thought the stories were told
                       to frighten children.  Later, I
                       learned that the Thuggee cult was
                       once real and did unspeakable
                       things.

       The Marahajah looks at Indiana.

                                   MAHARAJAH (Cont'd)
                       I am ashamed of what happened here
                       so many years ago.  We keep these
                       objects -- to remind us that this
                       will never again happen in my
                       kingdom!

                                   INDIANA
                              (after a moment)
                       I'm sorry if I've offended you.

       Now, more trays are whisked in by servants.

                                   MERCHANT
                       Ah, dessert!

       Short Round's monkey suddenly screeches and takes off.  Willie
       closed here eyes in dread - but curiosity gets the best of her
       and she looks -- it's worse than she could imagine:

       Plates full of small, dead monkey heads!  (*Production note: be-
       cause of his extremely sensitive nature, the director has reque-
       ted that these monkey heads be simulated).

       The tops of the monkey's skulls have been cut off and sit loose
       like little covers.  Willie watches in utter dismay as the Maha-
       rajah and his guests remove the skull-tops and start dipping
       spoons into what's inside --

                                   MERCHANT (Cont'd)
                       Chilled monkey brains!

       Willie keels over, crashing backwards in a dead faint!

                                                               CUT TO:

62.    INT.  A PALACE HALL - LATER                                    62.

       Women servants help a woobly-kneed Willie toward her room.

63.    EXT.  THE PELASURE GARDEN - NIGHT                              63.

       Hundreds of lanters illuminate the garden where after dinner
       drinks are served, cigars lighted and hookah pipes puffed on.

       Indiana comes out of the pavilion into the garden with Capt.
       Blumburtt and they talk quietly.

                                   CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                       Rather bizarre menu, woundn't you
                       say?

                                   INDIANA
                       Even if they were trying to scare
                       us away, a devout Hindu would
                       never touch meat.
                                (looking around)
                       Makes you wonder what these people
                       are...

       Now, the little Maharajah comes over with his retinue and he
       reaches for Indy's whip which Short Round is carrying.

                                   MAHARAJAH
                       I have seen this thing.  What is
                       it, Dr. Jones?

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Hey, nobody touches Indy's whip!

       Short Round grabs for it, but Indiana restrains him.

                                   INDIANA
                       We're guests here, Shorty.

       The Maharajah glares are Short Round and five the whip to Indy.

                                   MAHARAJAH
                       You will show me how it works
                       please.

       Indy bows to the little prince and smiles ironically --

                                   INDIANA
                       You wish is my command, your
                       Highness.

       While Short Round watches angrily, Indiana walks across the gar-
       den and unfurls the whip.  Indy sees a servant lighting a candle.

       Suddenly the whip flies and CRACKS like a pistol shot.  The
       candle disappears!  Indiana whirls and CRACKS the whip again,
       snagging a flower out of a dancing girl's hair.

       The Maharajah reacts like any kid -- he shoops happily.

                                   MAHARAJAH
                       That is wonderful!  Please teach
                       me how!

       Short Round sulks as he listens to Indiana instructing the Maha-
       rajah on how to hold the whip.  As the young prince practises the
       grip, Indy notices Chattar Lal slip behind a fountain to talk to
       a dark figure in robes who appears.

       Indiana sees Chattar Lal bow to the dark figure -- and Indy
       catches a glimpse of the stranger's pale face and dark hollow
       eyes.  Then the robled apparition seems to disappear.

       Meanwhile everyone watches respectfully as the Maharajah unfurls
       the whip for his first attempt.  He flings the whip but it flies
       back and snaps  -- biting his own  cheek.

       There's a stunned silence -- then Short Round laughs  at the
       little prince who is holding his wounded cheek.  The incensed Ma-
       rahajah suddenly flashes the whip as Short Round.

       Short Round grabs the end of it and pulls hard -- the whip is
       tugged taut between the two hostile boys.  As they draw near each
       other, Short Round sees something weird:

       The little Maharajah's eyes begin glowing yelloe and he hisses
       softly in a strange voice.  Nobody else sees or hears the bizarre
       transformation...

       Indiana finally intercedes -- he grabs Short Round by the neck.

                                   INDIANA
                       Okay, Short Round, let go of it.

       Short Round lets go and Indy gently takes the whip back from the
       little prince.

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       The Turks say that a whip can be
                       an enemy even to its owner.  If
                       you get some rope, it'll be easier
                       to learn with, your Highness.
                       Now, I think we'll say goodnight.

       The Maharajah and Short Round stare hostiley at each other as
       Indy recoils his whip.

                                                               CUT TO:

64.    INT.  A PALACE HALL - NIGHT                                    64.

       Short Round walks beside Indiana down the shadowy hall toward
       their room.  Short Round has Indy's whip curled around his shoul-
       der.  The little fellow yawns and shakes his head.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       That little Maharajah think he
                       big stuff.

                                   INDIANA
                       You don't like him do you?

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Next time I flatten him!  Did you
                       see his eyes?

                                   INDIANA
                       No.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Indy, they glow like fire and get
                       real crazy!  Then he talk in this
                       real scary voice!

       Indy tousles Short Round's hair.

                                   INDIANA
                       He was afraid of you.  He knows a
                       tough  guy when he sees one.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                                  (not so shure)
                       Yeah, that's what happened...

       They reach their room and Short Round opens the door.

                                   INDIANA
                       I better see how Willie is.

       Short Round shakes his head scornfully as Indy crosses the hall
       and knocks on another door.  After a moment, the door opens and
       Willie is standing there in a tempting nightgown.

                                   INDIANA
                       I brought you something.

       He holds up something wrapped in a piece of silk.

                                   WILLIE
                                (disgusted)
                       Not leftovers?

                                   INDIANA
                       No -- real food.

       Willie opens the bundle suspiciously -- then her hace lights up
       as she examines the breads and fruits inside.

                                   WILLIE
                       Oh, it is real food...it's
                       beautiful.

       She bites happily into a piece of fruit -- its juice runs down
       her chin and Indy wipes it off gently with his hand.  The mouth
       deliberately seductive and Willie is not displeased.

                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)
                       You're nice.  Listen, I'm taking
                       applications -- how'd you like to
                       be my palace slave?

                                   INDIANA
                                  (smiling)
                       Wearing your jewels to be, prin-
                       cess?

       Indy touches her necklace -- then his hand caresses her neck and
       ear.  She shivers slightly and speaks softly.

                                   WILLIE
                       Yeah -- and nothing else.
                                  (smiling)
                       That shock you?

                                   INDIANA
                              (shaking his head)
                       I'm a scientist.  I like doing
                       research on certain "nocturnal
                       activities" --

       She smiles and puts a grape to his lips.  He opens his mouth
       takes it and chews it.

                                   WILLIE
                       You mean like love rituals...

       He swallows the grape and they move toward each other slowly to
       kiss, revealing the passion that's simmering.

                                   INDIANA
                       And mating customs...

       They kiss again more heatedly.

                                   WILLIE
                       Primitive sexual practices?

                                   INDIANA
                       You're taling to an authority
                       in that area.

       They kiss again hungrily --

                                   WILLIE
                       You're dying to come into my room,
                       aren't you?

                                   INDIANA
                       You want me so bad, why don't you
                       invite me?

                                   WILLIE
                       Too proud to admit you're crazy
                       about me, Dr. Jones?

                                   INDIANA
                       I think you're too used to get-
                       ting you own way, Willie...

       They kiss yet again -- and Indy breaks it off, just to show he's
       still in control.  He backs away toward his room.

                                   WILLIE
                              (watching him)
                       We'll see who gives in first --
                       I'll leave my door open.

                                   INDIANA
                       Don't catch cold.

                                   WILLIE
                       Dr. Jones -- ?

       Indy stops by his door and sees Willie smiling as she holds up
       five fingers --

                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)
                       Five minutes... you'll be back
                       over here in five minutes...

                                   INDIANA
                       You're dreaming, Willie.  You want
                       to make it real, just knock on my
                       door.

       He winks.  She waves.  But neither one will surrender first.
       Willie does into her room, leaving the door ajar.  Indy opens his
       door.

65.    INT.  INDIANA'S SUITE                                          65.

       Indy comes in and closes the door -- leaving it open a crack.  He
       stands and listens, waiting for her to come over.

66.    INT.  WILLIE'S SUITE                                           66.

       Willie stands likewise by her door, waiting to hear Indy come
       back over.

67.    INT.  INDIANA'S SUITE                                           67.

       Indiana shrugs and walks over to a couch and starts taking off
       his tweed jacket and necktie --

                                   INDIANA
                       Five minutes... fat chance.

68.    INT.  WILLIE SUIT                                              68.

       Willie moves around her lavish suite, turning down lights, creating
       a romantic effect, checking herself in a mirror --

                                   WILLIE
                                (confidently)
                       Five minutes, Dr. Jones...

69.    INT.  INDIANA'S SUITE                                          69.

       Indy undresses in the magnificently decorated room:  wall paint-
       ings show palace scenes and landscapes; life-size figures
       dance and there are full-scale portraits or Rajput princes and
       prancing horses.  But Indy's more concerned with lust than with
       art.

                                   INDIANA
                                 (muttering)
                       ...want me to be her palace slave!

       He picks up his whip and smiles, considering using it on her.
       Then he just grubles and tosses the bullwhip onto the couch.

70.    INT.  WILLIE'S SUITE                                           70.

       Lying in bed in a seductive pose, Willie waits for Indy to show
       up and she starts to look worried.  She grabs a clock and shakes
       it to see if it's working.  She taps her fingers irritably won-
       dering in her charm has failed...

71.    INT.  INDIANA'S SUITE                                          71.

       We see another clock ticking.  Looking annoyed, Indy tosses a
       boot at it and the clock falls on its face, setting of the
       alarm.

       On the chaise lounge in front of Indy's bed, Short Round moves
       groggily and sees Indy turning off the alarm.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                                  (half asleep)
                       Get to sleep Indy -- I stay up
                       and keep eye on things...

                                   INDIANA
                       Okay, Shorty ... see you in the
                       morning...I'm going to have a
                       little -- word with Willie.

       Indy finally shakes his head and gives in to his animal
       instincts.  He buttons his shirt, puts his boots back on and
       grabs his leather jacket.

       As he puts on his jacket he walks past the life-sized paintings of
       armed gaurds standing in silent vigil.  Suddenly we see something
       frightening behind him:  one of the wall paintings sees to come
       to life!

       A large figure in robes and a turban looms out from the wall and
       lifts a silk cord -- the figure wraps the cord suddenly around
       Indiana's neck!

       The huge assassin stands behind Indy, twisting the cord even
       tighter around his neck.  As Indy attempts to break free he
       sees the assassin's face is a mirror -- and a strange yellow
       light glowing in the killer's eyes.

72.    INT.  WILLIE'S SUITE                                           72.

       Willie's finally had enough waiting and she gets out of beg petu-
       lantly.

                                   WILLIE
                       He's not coming...I can't be-
                       lieve it...

       She walks across the room and opens the door.  She looks out
       the empty hall -- and her resolve starts to weaken --

                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)
                       Well...
                               (bracing herself)
                       No!  I'm not going over there...

       She comes back into her room and kicks the door closed.

                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)
                       Sleep tight, Dr. Jones!
                               (suddenly melancholy)
                       I could've been your greatest ad-
                       venture...

73.    INT.  INDIANA'S SUITE                                          73.

       Indy shoves the assassin backwards, ramming the big man into the
       wall.  The assassin maintains his deathgrip -- while on the
       chaise, Short Round sleeps through it all!

       Gasping futilely for air, Indy sinks slowly to his knees  - his
       eyes bulge and he stares at the tiny, smiling skulls at the ends
       of the death-cord wrapped around the assassin's fists.

       Indiana sinks lower and then feels something -- desperately he
       grabs a brass pot on the floor by the handle and swings it with
       his last strength, smashing it up into the assassin's head with
       a skull-crushing clang!

       The assassin is stunned and Indiana curls forward pulling him
       into a somersault and sening him flying over his back.  The ass-
       assin crashes on his sping next to the chaise.  Short Round still
       doesn't wake up.

       Indiana rips the cord from around his neck and gasps for breath.
       He sees the assassin pulling a knife.  Indiana dives as the knife
       flies through the air and slams into the wall.

       Indiana grabs his whip, rolls and lands on his feet.  As the ass-
       assin tries to retreat, Indy unleashes his whip -- it CRACKS and
       wraps around the killer's neck.

       The big man struggles, pulling on the whip, trying to release it
       from his throat -- and Indiana holds fast, watching the killer
       gasping for air now as his face turns red.

       Suddenly the assassin does a full-blown backward sommersault
       which rips the whip out of Indy's hand.  The assassin has an in-
       stant to grin victoriously --

       Until he sees that the whip handle is arching toward the ceiling
       where is gets caught on the revolving fan!  The surprised assass-
       in it tugged upwards -- and the whip twists around the ceiling
       fan like fishing-line around a fishing-reel--

       And like a doomed flounder, the assassin is slowly reeled up and
       dragged toward the ceiling, his toes lifting off the floor.
       The assassin screams as he is hanged!  His legs twitch in
       his death throes -- and below him, Short Round finally wakes up.

       Always Indiana's protector, Shorty instictively leaps off the
       couch and draws a small dagger --

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Don't worry, Indy!  Where are
                       they?!

       Short Round spins a 360 , then looks up and does a double-take
       seeing the dead assassin twisting slowly around the ceiling fan.
       Indy takes Short Rund by the shoulders and turns him away from
       the grisly sight.

                                   INDIANA
                       It's okay, it's over -- go turn
                       off the fan.

       Short goes over and turns off the fan -- the assassin's body
       drops and Indy recoils his whip.  Suddenly they hear a hideous
       scream -- Willie!

74.    INT.  WILLIE'S SUITE                                           74.

       In a tight close-up:  Willie screams again.  She's lying in bed
       looking down at something --

       Moving up her shapely leg, a green and black, monstrous-looking
       insect crawls onto her stomach and Willie stops breather.  Immo-
       bilized by fear, Willie watches in silent agony as the hideous
       insect climbs slowly up her breast and slithers toward her neck.

       Across the suite, the doors burst open and Indiana rushes in.
       Shorty is behind him, carrying Indy's whip.  Indiana leaps on a
       stools and slides up to the bed to save WIllie --

       Then he spots the giant insect crawling on her and decides to
       have some fun.

                                   INDIANA
                       This a cheap trick to get me over
                       here?

       Willie speaks with desperate, fearful precision --

                                   WILLIE
                       No -- don't you see -- crawling --

                                   INDIANA
                       What -- the bug?

       Willie is petrified and shaking.

                                   WILLIE
                       Get -- the -- bug -- off!

                                   INDIANA
                       Gee, I wouldn't want to touch an
                       ugly critter like that!

                                   SHORT ROUND
                                   (grinning)
                       Uh uh -- me neither!

       Willie looks at the man-of-action like he's insane.  Then she
       feels the bug crawling onto her cheek --

                                   WILLIE
                       Oh no -- oh no!!

                                   INDIANA
                               (studying the bug)
                       You know, Willie, I'll bet he's
                       mad because they were eating his
                       friends for dinner.

                                   WILLIE
                       Please -- oh please, I'm going to
                       die!  Get it off!

       Indiana shrugs and leans over and casually swats the horrible bug
       off her face.  He and Short Round watch the insect skid across
       the floor -- and suddenly disappear as if by magic!

       Puzzled, they wander toward the wall, leaving Willie behind,
       bathed in sweat, staring at the ceiling --

                                   WILLIE
                       What did I do to deserve this
                       trip?!

       Kneeling by the wall, Short Round examines the baseboard --

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       It went under.  Hey, I feel
                       wind, Indy.

       Indiana knocks on the wall and considers the hollow sound.  He
       moves back and looks at the whole wall.  Behind him, Willie moves
       past --

                                   WILLIE
                       I'm packing!  I'm getting out of
                       here right now tonight!

       She dashes behind a screen to start getting dressed.  Meanwhile
       Indy feels the marble walls.  He moves to a niche in which there
       is a small statue of Ganesha, the friendly elephant god.

       Indiana lifts the statue -- and a panel in the wall opens slow-
       ly.  Short Round looks amazed.  Indy watches the light fall
       across the far wall of a tunnel as the door opens slowly.

       Indy peers into the tunnel at an old wall painting.  Spiderly San-
       skrit calligraphy runs under a flanking illustration of a prince
       bowing before a god.

                                   INDIANA
                       *(He reads aloud an inscription
                       in Sanskrit).

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       What does it mean, Indy?

                                   INDIANA
                                 (translating)
                       "Follow in the footsteps of
                       Shiva.  Do not betray his truth."

       Indy takes out the piece of cloth the boy gave him in Mayapore,
       the similarities are striking.  It is also a picture of Shiva
       Sankara.

                                   INDIANA
                       *(He repeats aloud the inscrip-
                       tion also written on the cloth)

       Over behind the screen, Willie's getting into some silk pants with
       an Indian-style brocade bodice top --

                                   WILLIE
                       I don't care if I have to walk to
                       Delhi, I'm -- hey!

       She notices Indy and Short Round bending to enter the dark tunnel
       behind the wall.

                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)
                       Wait a minute!  What're you --
                       where're you going?!

       Indy pokes his head back into the room --

                                   INDIANA
                       Lock your door and don't leave
                       until we get back.

       He disappears behind the wall and Willie looks worried.

75.    INT.  A PALACE TUNNEL - NIGHT                                  75.

       Indy and Short Round enter the secret passage and move forward
       slowly into the inky darkness.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       I don't think we suppose to be in
                       here, Indy...

       They creep slowly down the dark tunnel.  It grows smaller and Indy
       ducks his head.

                                   SHORT ROUND (Cont'd)
                       I step on something.

       Their footsteps crunch on the tunnel floor.

                                   INDIANA
                       You're right, there's something
                       all over the floor...

       Even Short Round has to duck and Indy finally kneels to his
       hands and knees.

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       We'll have to crawl.

       As they crawl, their hands and knees continue to crunch on what-
       ever it is littering the ground.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Indy, the floor -- there is some-
                       thing alive!

       Indiana gets a match out of his pocket.  He snaps it with his
       thumb and the match flares -- a hideous insectarium: a living
       collection of the world's ugliest antropods, hexapods and arch-
       nids.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Holy smoke -- I'm scared, Indy!

       Indiana turns and sees something else --

                                   INDIANA
                       There's a chamber here.  Come on --

       Indy finds an oil lamp on the wall and lights it.  Short Round
       happily scampers into the chamber and Indy follows him.  Suddenly
       the door slides shut -- trapping them inside!

76.    INT.  THE CHAMBER                                              76.

       Indiana lights a match and finds another oil lamp.  He and Short
       Round look for a way to open the door that closed behind them,
       but they have no luck.

                                   INDIANA
                       Damn!

       Then they hear Willie's voice echoing down the short tunnel.

                                   WILLIE (O.S.)
                       Hey -- where are you?!

77.    INT.  WILLIE'S SUITE                                           77.

       Back in the suite, Willie stands by the entrance to the secret
       passage, peering into the dark tunnel --

                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)
                       Indiana Jones?!  Are you in there?!

78.    INT.  THE CHAMBER                                              78.

       Indy mutters irritably to himself --

                                   INDIANA
                       Yes, we're in here...

       He looks everywhere for something to open the door.  Short
       Round spots a loose brick and moves it --

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Indy, I found a --

       Suddenly they hear a rumble and Indy turns to see the opposite
       wall moving -- the spikes start appearing!  Their lethal points
       protrude from the wall as it starts closing in toward Indy and
       Short Round.

                                   SHORT ROUND (Cont'd)
                       Indy -- !

       Shorty points up and Indiana sees more spikes descending from the
       ceiling!  Indy turns toward the door and shouts --

                                   INDIANA
                       Uh -- Willie?!
                                   (louder)
                       Willie, you better get down here!

79.    INT.  WILLIE'S SUITE                                           79.

       Willie listens and looks scared --

                                   WILLIE
                                (shouting back)
                       What?!

                                   INDIANA (O.S.)
                       Willie, come here!  Hurry up,
                       we're in trouble!!

                                   SHORT ROUND (O.S.)
                       Willie, help!!

       Willie is frightened, confused and jumping around --

80.    INT.  THE SPIKE CHAMBER                                        80.

       The deadly spikes inch slowly toward them from the wall and ceil-
       ing.  They start pounding on the door and shout --

                                   INDIANA
                       Willie, damn it!  Get down here,
                       NOW

81.    INT.  WILLIE'S SUITE                                           81.

       Willie finds the courage to finally whimper and step into the
       dark passage --

                                   WILLIE
                       Oh hell -- I bet I get all dirty
                       again!

82.    INT.  THE TUNNEL                                               82.

       Willie starts down the dark tunnel toward the chamber.

                                   INDIANA (O.S.)
                       WILLIE?!

                                   WILLIE
                       I'm coming, what's the rush?!
                       Ohh!  What's that?!  There's
                       stuff all over the floor!  I
                       can't see a thing!

83.    INT.  THE SPIKE CHAMBER                                        83.

       They hear her coming and Indy watches nervously as the spikes
       draw even closer --

                                   INDIANA
                       Move, Willie!  Faster!

84.    INT.  THE TUNNEL                                               84.

       Willie crawls and crunches on the littered floor --

                                   WILLIE
                       It's all wet and icky!  Aaahh --
                       things are moving!!

       She sees the low lamp by the door to the chamber.

                                   SHORT ROUND (O.S.)
                       Please, Willie!

       She grabs the lamp and turns it up so it burns brighter.  She
       looks around -- and SCREAMS!!  She sees the sickening, swarming
       mass of glistening insects crawling toward her, attracted by the
       light --

                                   WILLIE
                               (hysterical)
                       There's bugs!  Bugs all over!
                       Help!  Help me!

                                   INDIANA (O.S.)
                       Willie, open the door!  GET US
                       OUT OF HERE!

       Willie pounds on the door --

                                   WILLIE
                       OPEN THE DOOR!  LET ME IN!!

85.    INT.  THE SPIKE ROOM                                           85.

       The spikes close in --

                                   INDIANA
                       GET US OUT!  Willie, shut up and
                       listen!  There's got to be a ful-
                       crum release!  Look around!

                                   WILLIE (O.S.)
                       A what?!

86.    INT.  THE TUNNEL                                               86.

       Willie whines and frantically searches the wall.  Insects are
       crawling and jumping on her and she kicks at them!

                                   INDIANA (O.S.)
                       A fulcrum release lever!

                                   WILLIE
                       I can't find any lever!  Help me
                       Indy!

87.    INT.  THE SPIKE CHAMBER                                        87.

       Indiana and Short Round are backed against the wall and the
       spikes are a foot away and moving in --

                                   INDIANA
                       Look around, Willie!  There's got to
                       be a liever hidden somewhere!  Come
                       on, you can do it!

88.    INT.  THE TUNNEL                                               88.

       Insects drop onto Willie from the ceiling and fly at her as she
       flattens against the wall.  Then her elbow hits something -- a
       loose stone.  She claws at it and it falls out of the wall
       leaving a hole.

                                   WILLIE
                       There's a hole!  I found a square
                       hole!

                                   INDIANA (O.S.)
                       That's it -- the release lever --
                       look inside!

                                   WILLIE
                       I am -- it looks horrible!

       The hole is revolting :  covered with squirming insects, it also
       oozes some kind of glistening mucus.

                                   INDIANA (O.S.)
                       Reach inside!

       Willie moves her hand toward the nauseating hole then pulls back.

                                   WILLIE
                       I can't, Indy!  I can't!

89.    INT.  THE SPIKE TUNNEL                                         89.

       Indiana turns his head sideways and sucks in his breath, but the
       deadly spikes are poking into his leater jacket now --

                                   INDIANA
                       The lever!  Willie, do it!  NOW!

90.    INT.  THE TUNNEL                                               90.

       Willie screams and jams her hand into the gross hole --

                                   WILLIE
                       Oh God, it's soft -- it's moving!

                                   INDIANA (O.S.)
                       Willie!

91.    INT.  THE SPIKE CHAMBER                                        91.

       Short Round is frightened to death and crying --

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Willie, help us!  Hurry!

92.    INT.  THE TUNNEL                                               92.

       She hears Short Round crying and twists her hand in the disgust-
       ing hole.  Suddenly the door springs open!  Willie pulls her hand
       out and stares in horror -- her hand and arm are covered with
       greenish slimey mung!

93.    INT.  THE SPIKE CHAMBER                                        93.

       The spikes suddenly retract, disappearing into the wall and clos-
       ing.  Indy pulls Willie inside the chamber and the door slams
       shut again.  Willie dances around, yelling about the hideous slime
       on her arm.

                                   WILLIE
                       Get is off me -- get it off!

       Indy helps her wipe it off.  Willie falls back against the door.

                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)
                       You left me out there!  What in
                       the hell were you doing in here?!
                       I want to leave this place right
                       now!!

       She sees the same lever that Short Round pulled earlier and grabs
       for it.  Indiana dives and manages to stop her from activating
       the spikes agian.

                                   INDIANA
                       Not that one!  We had enought of
                       that one, thank you...

       He looks around and spots a small rock protruding from the wall.
       Cautiously, praying htat it won't activate another booby trap,
       Indy pushes the rock.

       A large door opens on the other side of the chamber -- a soft
       wind howls past outside the chamber.

94.    INT.  THE WIND TUNNEL                                          94.

       Indiana, Short Round and Willie exit the spike chamber and head
       down a larger tunnel through which a roaring wind intermittantly
       blows, howling eerily like a note of gloomy music.

       Indiana follows a curve in the tunnel and they see light approaching.
       The wind holws another dramatic note which gales past them as
       they reach the mouth of the tunnel.

       Indiana is joined by Willie and Short Round.  They all stop in
       astonishment at the sight below them:

95.    INT.  THE TEMPLE OF DEATH                                      95.

       As the camera pulls back,  the mouth of the wind tunnel in which
       they are standing becomes just a small hole overlooking the stag-
       gering vastness of the incredible TEMPLE OF DEATH.

       The colossal subterranean temple has been carved out of a solid
       mass of rock.  A vaulting cathedral-like ceiling is supported by
       rows of carved stone columns.

       Balconies overlook the temple floor.  Pillared halls leading to
       dark side chambers.  Moving out of these chambers, hundreds of
       faithful worshippers chant as they enter the temple.

       Mammoth stone statues of elephants, lions and demi-gods (half/man,
       half/animal monstrosities) loom above the swelling crowds or wor-
       shippers.

       As the wind howls out of the tunnel high above the temple, the
       worshippers chant in response to the strange tunnel music.

96.    INT.  THE TUNNEL                                               96.

       The moaning wind rushes past Indiana, Willie and Short Round as
       they watch the mystery cult below bowing toward an enormous altar
       at the far end of the temple.

       This altar is a platform jutting out from the stone wall of the
       cavern.  Separating the worshippers from this altar is a wide
       crevasse out of which wisps of smoke rise occasionally.

97.    INT.  THE ALTAR                                                97.

       On the other side of the crevasse, evil-looking priests
       materialize out of clouds of swirling smoke.  The priests carry
       smoke-billowing urns to a giant stone statue.

       Now, we see the hideous protectress of the temple, the obscenely
       malevolent ombect of the cult's devotion:  the bloodthirsty god-
       dess KALI!

       The red-eyed priests bow at the base of the statue and gaze
       reverently at their KALI MA.  Skulls surround her stone feet
       carved serpents twist up her legs, while around her waist there
       is a guresome belt of human hands.

       Naked to the hips, Kali's hair falls about her four arms.  In her
       hand, she holds a sword, in the second the severed head of a
       giant.With her other hands she encourages her worshipers, who
       are chanting louder and louder!

       Kali's face is loathsome:  her earrings are two corpses.  Her
       evil tongue extends out of her twisted mouth and what looks like
       read blood flows over her long fangs and down her naked breasts.

98.    INT.  THE WIND TUNNEL                                          98.

       Watching from the high opening, Willie looks disgusted.

                                   WILLIE
                       What is it...?

                                   INDIANA
                       It's a Thuggee ceremony.  They're
                       whorshipping Kali, the goddess of
                       Death and Destruction.

99.    INT.  THE TEMPLE OF DEATH                                      99.

       A huge drum sounds three times and the chanting stops.  The
       silence is chilling as another robed figure appears out of the
       some on the altar.

       This is MOLA RAM, the High Priest of the Thugge cult.  Mola
       Ram's red-rimmed eyes glare from the sunken sockets in his
       sinister face.  Here is a man who looks as vile and diabolic
       as the unholy goddess rising behind him.

       Up in the wind tunnel, Indy stares down at the High Priest and
       realizes that is was Mola Ram he saw conferring with Chattar Lal
       in the palace garden.

       As the drum booms three times more, Mola Ram lifts one arm
       up from his emaciated body and suddenly there is a scream!

       All heads turn toward an unfortunate, struggling Indian begin
       dragged out by priests.  The man's face and body are wildly
       painted.  He screams again as he's tied onto a square iron frame
       laying atop a large flat stone.

       Mola Ram steps forward to the stretched-out victim and the Indian
       looks up into the High Priest's grotesque face --

       Suddenly Mola Ram's hand shoots out toward the man's chest -- and
       pierces it!  The High Priests hand sinks into the victim's
       writing body and rips out his living heart!

100.   INT. THE WIND TUNNEL                                           100.

       Willie covers her mouth --

                                   WILLIE
                       Oh my God!  He ripped out his --
                       he killed him!

                                   INDIANA
                       No...the heart's still beating!

101.   INT.  THE ALTAR                                                101.

       Indeed, the bloody heart is still beating in Mola Ram's hand!
       He lifts the heart into the air and the worhippers begin the chant.

                                   THE MULTITUDE
                       Jai ma Kali, jai ma Kali!

       Stranger still, the sacrificial victim is still alive -- there is
       no evidence of a gash on his chest, only a reddish mark  The
       priests add chains to the iron frame and carry the victim over
       toward a hoist hanging over the crevasse.

       The man thrashes about helplessly on the iron frame as it is up
       ended and then lowered with the victim hanging face down --

       As the sacrificial victim looks down into the crevasse below --
       he screams -- and we see the molten lava bubbling crimson at the
       bottom of the chasm!

102.   INT.  THE WIND TUNNEL                                          102.

       Willie closes her eyes but Indy and Short Round watch horrified
       as the iron frame is lowered -- and the bloody heart continues to
       beat in Mola Ram's hand -- and the molten lava burns and flickers
       as the screaming victim is lowered deeper into the crevasse.

103.   INT.  THE TEMPLE                                               103.

       The weird paint on the victim's face starts to smoke and sizzle --
       the man's skin blisters as he's lowered within feet of the
       lava.  His flesh smokes and he screams one last time as his body
       bursts into flame.

       The iron frame sinks and submerges into the boiling fiery lava.

104.   INT.  THE ALTAR                                                104.

       Above the crevasse, Mola Ram continues to hold the heart in
       his hand -- the heart is smoking and bursts into flames - and
       disappears!

105.   INT.  THE TEMPLE                                               105.

       The iron frame is raised out of the lava -- the metal glows
       like a branding iron, but there is no trace of the sacrificed
       victim.

106.   INT.  THE WIND TUNNEL                                          106.

       As the wind howls again, Willie and Short Round look sickened and
       appalled by the ceremony.  Even Indy seems shaken by what they
       are witnessing.

                                   THE MULTITUDE
                       Jai ma Kali,  jai ma Kali!

107.   INT.  THE ALTAR                                                107.

       Moal Ram raises both hands and his voice echoes strange incanta-
       tions.  Behind him, three priests carry cloth-wrapped objects to-
       ward the altar.

108.   INT.  THE WIND TUNNEL                                          108.

       Willie is crying and her voice is shoking as she turns awa from
       the hideous ritual --

                                   WILLIE
                       Let's go!  Let's get out of here!

                                   INDIANA
                       Quiet!

109.   INT.  THE ALTAR                                                109.

       The priests reverently unwrap three conical pieces of
       crystallized quartz.  The place the three stones below the sta-
       tue of Kali and slowly the smoke around the altar swirls --

       The smoke is drawn to the three stones and they actually start in-
       haling the piraling smoke.  The smoke disappears into the stones
       and the air clears.  Then the three stones start to glow a
       haunting incandescent white.

110.   INT.  THE WIND TUNNEL                                          110.

       Short Round looks scared.  Willie is still crying -- Indy waits,
       horrified but fascinated.

                                   INDIANA
                       The village knew their rock was
                       magic -- but they didn't know it
                       was one of the lost Sankara Stones...

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Why they glow like that?

                                   INDIANA
                       Legend says that when the stones
                       are brought together the diamonds
                       inside of them will glow.

       Willie wipes her eyes and becomes more interested --

                                   WILLIE
                       Diamonds...?

111.   INT.  THE ALTAR                                                111.

       The Sankara Stones shimmer brightly, and inside the crystallized
       quartz, the enormous sparkling diamonds of legend are now re-
       vealed.

       Mola Ram stands facing Kali with his arms outstretched and
       kneels and bows and then walks off the altar and disappears.

112.   INT.  THE WIND TUNNEL                                          112.

       Indiana sees the woshippers below start to leave the temple.  He
       looks at Willie and Short Round.

                                   INDIANA
                       Okay -- now listen -- you wait here
                       and keep quiet.  Shorty, keep an
                       eye on her.

       Short Round nods and hands Indy his bullwhip and shoulder bag.
       Willie sees Indiana peering down at the sheer drop below the
       mouth of the wind tunnel.

                                   WILLIE
                       Wait -- what're you doing?

                                   INDIANA
                       I'm going down.

                                   WILLIE
                       Down?  Down there?!  Are you
                       crazy --!

                                   INDIANA
                       I'm not leaving without those
                       stones.

                                   WILLIE
                       You're gonna get killed chasing
                       after your damn fortune and
                       glory!

                                   INDIANA
                                (looking at her)
                       Maybe...someday.
                                 (smiling)
                       Not today.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       I keep my eye peeled, Indy.

       Indiana nods and looks down at the now empty temple.  Then he
       slips down from the mouth of the wind tunnel.

113.   INT.  THE TEMPLE WALL                                          113.

       Indiana skillfully clumbs down an enormous tmeple column -- find-
       ing footholds on stone cobras, carved lions and the stone breasts
       of dancing girls.  Slowly, he makes his way down and swings across
       a balcony.

114.   INT.  THE BALCONY                                              114.

       Indiana walks quietly along the balcony overlooking the temple.
       He stops -- between him and the altar is the crevasse with the
       lava bubbling fire at the bottom.

       Indiana looks across the gulf and sees another column near the
       altar at the top of which stone elephants are perched.  Indy
       curls his whip and suddenly lets it fly --

       The whip cracks and its end wraps tightly around the tusk of one
       of the stone elephants.  From the balcony, Indy tugs the whip
       taut, takes a breath and runs --

115.   INT.  THE CREVASSE                                             115.

       Indiana leaps and swings out on the whip, arching down and up,
       over the chasm of fiery lava in a spectacular curving jump!

116.   INT.  THE LATAR                                                116.

       Indy lands on his feet and turns to release the whip.  Short
       Round waves to Indy that the coast is clear.  Indy snaps the whip
       -- it releases from the elephant tusk and drops.

       Recurling the whip, Indy attaches it to his belt and moves to-
       ward the towering statue of Kali.  The three Sankara stones start
       to glow and Indiana approaches them cautiously.

       Reaching the stones, Indy's face is lighted by them.  He notices
       that one of them (sthe stone from Mayapore village) has strange
       lines painted across it.

       Suspiciously, Indy touches the stone, but it doesn't burn.  He
       lifts it carefully and peers into it.  The enormous diamond
       sparkles inside.  He places the stone in his shoulder bag and
       reaches for the others.

117.   INT.  THE WIND TUNNEL                                          117.

       Short Round and Willie watch apprehensively as Indiana bags the
       three stones.

118.   INT.  THE ALTAR                                                118.

       Indiana backs away and looks up at the horrific statue of Kali.
       It seems to be watching him.  He turns and is about to go when he
       hears something --

       It sounds like a voice and Indy is afraid to turn -- could it be
       Kali?  The he hears other noises echoing and turns slowly.  Real-
       alizing the sounds are coming from behind the altar, Indy moves
       around it toward the back.

119.   INT.  THE WIND TUNNEL                                          119.

       Short Round and Willie are mystified as they see Indiana dissap-
       pear behind the altar.

                                   WILLIE
                       Oh hell, where's he going?

       Short Round looks worried.  Then the wind rushes past them quickly
       and howls its somber musical note.  However, the wind sounds dif-
       ferent this time, its tone quavering slightly.

       Short Round is puzzled and looks around.  He  feeezes when he sees
       two shadowy figures coming down the tunnel toward them -- the
       bodies causing the tone of the wind to shift eerily --

       Willie notices Short Round pulling a dagger from his belt -

                                   WILLIE
                       What're you -- ?

       Suddenly she turns and screams as two huge Thuggee guards rush
       at them!  One grabs at Short Round but the kid slashes the
       guard's hand with his dagger.

       Willie tries to get past the other guard, but he snatches her by
       the arm and pulls her toward him -- from her training at the Col-
       lege of Hard Knocks, Willie successfully knees the big man in the
       balls.

                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)
                       Keep your paws off, letch!

       The man groans and sinks to his knees.  Willie sees that Short
       Round is in trouble.  She runs over, leaps onto the back of the
       other guard and starts ripping his hair out.

       Short Round picks up his fallen dagger.  The big guard lurches
       backwards and smashes Willie into the rocky wall of the tunnel.
       Willie falls to the floor.

       Short Round approaches, holding the man at bay with his dagger.
       Willie turns as the other guard, the one she kneed, crawls toward
       her -- Willie scoops up some dirt and throws it.  The man claws
       at his eyes and Willie jumps up.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Run Willie!

       Willie starts to run and Short Round backs away, keeping the
       guard at a distance with his dagger.  Suddenly the guard cries out
       in Hindi and dives at Short Round.

       Panicking, Shorty tries to run after Willie -- but he's tripped.
       The guard has Short Round by the foot and drags him back.  Willie
       looks around and stops running.  She sees Short Round is caught.

                                   SHORT ROUND (Cont'd)
                       No!  Run!  Go get help!

       Willie hesitates, then runs down the tunnel.  Meanwhile, a mam-
       moth hand clutches Short Round's throat -- the giant guard lifts
       Shorty completely off the ground and the kid looks terrified and
       helpless as he dangles in the air...

120.   INT.  CHAMBER BEHIND ALTAR                                     120.

       Indiana enters the dark chamber behind the altar.  The only il-
       lumination is the back-light streaming around the silhouetted
       statue of Kali.

       Indy slowly crosses a narrow stone bridge and moves toward a cy-
       lindrical shaft of light rising up from what appears to be an
       enormous hole.

       Indy hears voices and the clink of metal against rock as he con-
       tinues forward.  The ground is dark in front of the large hole.
       He edges toward the precipice and the light rising up illuminates
       the look of shock on his face as he peers down into Hell...

121.   INT.  THE THUGGEE MINES                                        121.

       Indy looks into a deep pit around which concentric paths leads off
       into numerous narrow tunnels.  Crawling out of these burrows,
       scrawny children drag sacks of dirt and rock.  Other hollow-eyed
       children pull these sacks to mine cars waiting on rails.

       Straining to lift the rocks into the mine cars, several of the
       children slip and fall.  Bare-chested Thuggee guards shout at the
       enslaves children and kick those who've fallen.

       For these children there would seem to be only one hope -- death
       -- an end to their travail.

       Indiana edges around the hole, looking into the ghastly mine and
       feeling as if he's discovered an inferno of misery as grotesque
       as Dante's.

       Indy shifts the bag of stones on his shoulder.  He hesitates and
       considers his choice:  he has the Sankara Stones and can leave
       with them now...

       But Indy hears the pleading cries of one child and peers down to
       see a burly Thuggee guard beating the pitiful little slave.  Indy
       gets angrier and angrier as he watches.

       He finally steps over the grabs a boulder.  He lifts it and
       flings it down into the mine --

122.   INT.  THE MINE                                                 122.

       We see Indiana above and the boulder hurtling down -- it crashes
       onto the head of the Thuggee guard who hits the ground like a
       sack of cement!

12.    INT.  THE CHAMBER                                              123.

       Indy sees the startled slave children looking up at him in shock.
       He smiles victoriously at the Thuggees below who've run over to
       see what happened.

       Indy's smile seems to fade as his anger turns to surprise as he
       feels something unnerving:

       Dirt is crumbling away from the rim of the hole, a small
       landslide starting beneath his feet.  Suddenly the floor gives
       way and Indy slips!

       The entire rim of the hole shears off and Indy topples with it
       and plunges down into the mine toward the assembled guards who
       scatter -- Indy yells as he falls and it echoes...

                                                               CUT TO:

124.   INT.  A CELL - NIGHT                                           124.

       Indiana's yell continues to echo -- his head jerks suddenly --
       Indy jolts awake as if coming out of a nightmare, awakened by his
       own reverberating shout.

       Indy is lying on the rocky floor of a dark cave/cell.  He lifts
       his hands and discovers that they are chained.  In the murky
       light, he sees Short Round sitting in chains across the cell.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Indy -- you knocked out when you
                       fall.  You okay?

       Indiana nods groggily.  He sees a young slave worker in rags sit-
       ting near Short Round.  Through the iron bars of the cell, Indy
       sees the children slaving in the mine tunnels.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                              (indicating the kid)
                       This is Nainsukh -- from the vil-
                       lage.  They bring him here to dig
                       in the mines.

                                   INDIANA
                       Why?

                                   NAINSUKH
                       Children are small -- we can work
                       in tunnels.  Now I am too old.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       What they do to you now?

                                   NAINSUKH
                       I pray to Shiva -- let me die.
                       But I do not.  Now -- now the
                       evil of Kali take me.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       How?

                                   NAINSUKH
                       They will make me drink blood of
                       Kali.  Then I fall into black
                       sleep of Kali Ma...

                                   INDIANA
                       What is that?

                                   NAINSUKH
                       I become like them.  I be  alive --
                       nut like in nightmare.  You drink
                       the blood, you not wake up from
                       nightmare of Kali Ma.

       There's a noise and they see two guards and a priest outside the
       cell.  Nainsukh cowers in the darkness at the back of the cell,
       like a trapped animal awaiting the inevitable.

                                                               CUT TO:

125.   INT.  A MINE TUNNEL - NIGHT                                    125.

       Indiana and Short Round are pushed down a tunnel by guards.  They
       are stopped at a door and shoved inside.

126.   INT.  MOLA RAM'S CHAMBER                                       126.

       Indiana and Short Round stumble into the chamber.  It is a terri-
       fying gallery of occult yantras, ritualistic statues and grisly
       icons of the evil Thuggee sect.

       Grotesque statues of Kali's baleful minions line the walls.  In a
       corner, there is another statue of Kali herself, draped with
       flowers, necklaces of real human skills and slithering belts of
       live snakes.

       Fresh blood has been splashed over the statue and at its base are
       the three Sankara Stones recovered from Indiana.  Mola Ram sits
       in a yoga position near the statue of Kali.

       Mola Ram opens his eyes and he sees Indiana and Short Round
       standing in chains before him.

                                   MOLA RAM
                       You were caught trying to steal
                       the Sankara Stones.

                                   INDIANA
                                 (shrugging)
                       Nobody's perfect.  The way I
                       heard it, you stole one of them
                       from a small village.

       Mola Ram stands and gazes transfixed at the stones glowing on the
       altar.

                                   MOLA RAM
                       There were five stones in the
                       beginning.  Over the centuries
                       they were dispersed by wars,
                       sold off by thieves like you...

                                   INDIANA
                       Two are still missing.

                                   MOLA RAM
                       No.  They are here -- somewhere.
                       A century ago when the British
                       raided this temple and butchered
                       my people, a loyal priest his the
                       last two stones down here in the
                       catacombs.

                                   INDIANA
                       That's what you've got these chil-
                       dren -- these slaves digging for?

                                   MOLA RAM
                       They dig for the gems to support
                       our cause.  They also search for
                       the last two stones.  Soon we will
                       have all five Sankara Stones and
                       the Thuggees will be all powerful!

                                   INDIANA
                       Nobody can say you don't have a
                       vivid imagination.

                                   MOLA RAM
                       You do not believe me?  You will,
                       Dr. Jones.  You will become a true
                       believer.

       The door opens and Mola Ram bows slightly as the little Maharajah
       enters.  Indy looks surprised and Short Round tenses.

                                   MOLA RAM (Cont'd)
                       Your Highness will witness the
                       thief's conversion.

       Mola Ram nods and two guards grab Indy.  They drag him struggling
       to a rock and chain him to it.  Short Round scuffles as he's
       pulled aside to watch.

       Remembering the High Priest's earlier open-heart surgery, Indi-
       ana looks worried as Mola Ram approaches him --

                                   MAHARAJAH
                       You will not suffer.  I recently
                       became of age and tasted the blood
                       of Kali.

       Now the young initiate comes forward and Indiana looks startled --
       it's Nainsukh.  He is wearing robes and his eyes are glowing
       strangely.  Nainsukh hands Mola Ram a hollow human skull full of
       blood!

       The guards hold Indiana's head back and force his mouth open.
       Mola Ram tips the skull and blood spills out of its death-
       grinning jaws and flows into Indiana's mouth.  Indy gags --

       Suddenly he spits the blood, spraying Mola Ram and the little
       Maharajah.  Looking at his blood-splattered clothes, the Mahara-
       jah is furious.

                                   MOLA RAM
                       Hold him!

       The little prince's eyes glow angrily and he hisses at Indy --

                                   MAHARAJAH
                       You will learn to obey because
                       you are powerless!

       The little Maharajah pulls a small krtya from his robes -- Indy
       sees that the doll has been crudely fashioned to resemble him.

                                   MAHARAJAH (Cont'd)
                       I control you now!

       The Maharajah turns and sticks the doll into a flaming urn.  In-
       diana suddenly cries out and twists in pain as he is burned!  The
       little prince smiles evilly and puts the doll back into his
       robes.

       Then he goes over to where Indy's whip and bag have been laid.
       He grabs the bullwhip.

                                   MAHARAJAH (Cont'd)
                       You told me that a whip could be
                       an enemy to its owner.  We shall
                       see!  Turn him over!

       As the guards turn Indy face down, they rip off his jacket and
       chain his ahnds to the rock.  The Maharajah uncurls the whip -- he
       notices Short Round smiling snidely --

       Suddenly the Maharajah cracks the whip -- it lashes out and cuts
       into Short Round's shoulder.  Blood appears and Short Round looks
       stunned by the lash and by the fact the Marahajah knows who to
       use the whip.

                                   MAHARAJAH (Cont'd)
                       As Dr. Jones suggested, I have
                       been practicing.

       The little Maharajah whirls and lashes the whip again.  Indiana
       jerks as the bullwhip rips through his shirt and tears open his
       flesh.  The Maharajah lashes again and again -- blood spurts
       across Indy's tattered shirt.

       As the whipping continues- Short Round jumps as if he is also be-
       ing beaten.  His eyes fill with tears as he watches Indy suffer.

       Finally, the little Maharajah lets the whip fall limp.  As the
       Maharajah approaches Indy, Short Round lunges as him angrily but
       the guards restrain him.

       Indiana groans as he's turned over.  Blood trickles from his
       mouth and he stares up hatefully at Mola Ram.

                                   MOLA RAM
                       The British in India will be
                       slaughtered.  Then we will over-
                       run the Moslems and force their
                       "Allah" to bow to Kali.

       Mola Ram is once again given the human skull by a priest and he
       lifts it toward Indy's face --

                                   MOLA RAM (Cont'd)
                       And then the Hebrew God will fall
                       and finally the Christian God will
                       be cast down and forgotten.

       Indy's head is held back and Mola Ram spills the blood -- it
       flows out of the mouth of the skull into Indy's mouth.

                                   MOLA RAM (Cont'd)
                       Soon Kali Ma will rule the world!

       Indy's eyes look horrified as the blood flows from the skull down
       his choking throat -- some of the blood spills and falls to the
       floor --

       We see the very earth trembling as the evil spreads -- a fissure
       appears beneath Indy's feet and a small line of crimson lava
       oozes out and smiles evilly across the floor...

                                                               CUT TO:

127.   INT.  WILLIE'S SUITE - NIGHT                                   127.

       Diaphanous curtains billow silently into the moonlighted room.
       Two exotic birds sit on a golden perch, their eyes clicking
       watchfully.  Suddenly the brids shriek and flap away --

       Willie stumbles through the secret door and falls into the room.
       Insects cover her and she shimpers as she knocks them off.  She
       manages to stagger to her feet and she heads for the door.

128.   INT.  THE PALACE - NIGHT                                       128.

       Willie rushes out of her room and runs through the deserted pal-
       ace looking for help.  She flies down the moonlit corridors, past
       the huge wall paintings.

       She stops by a courtyard and calls out desperately, but there is
       no one around.  She backs away down a hallway and then jumps --
       seeing something in a mirror:  a face looms behind her and she
       screams!

       Willie whirls and sees Chattar Lal, the Prime Minister, approach-
       ing her.

                                   WILLIE
                       Oh my God, you scared me!  Listen,
                       you've got to help.  We found this
                       tunnel --

       Captain Blumburtt comes around a corner and interrupts --

                                   CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                                   (to Chattar Lal)
                       Jones isn't in his room.  Miss
                       Scott -- my troops are leaving at
                       dawn if you want us to escort you
                       to Delhi --

                                   WILLIE
                       No -- you can't go!  Something aw-
                       ful's happened.  They've got Short
                       Round and I think Indy's been --

                                   CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                       What?

                                   WILLIE
                       We found a tennel that leads to a
                       temple below the palace!  Please,
                       come with me, I'll show you!

       The two men exchange dubious looks.  Willie grabs Blumburtt by
       the arm and they start down the hall.

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       Miss Scott, you're not making any
                       sense.

                                   WILLIE
                       I'm afraid they'll kill them!  We
                       saw horrible things down there --
                       they had a human sacrifice and they
                       ripped a man's heart out!

                                   CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                       Who?

                                   WILLIE
                       It's some kind of cult!  And they've
                       got the sacred stones that Indy was
                       searching for.

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       I sense the fumes of opium in all
                       this.  Prehaps Miss Scott picked
                       up the habit in Shanghai.

                                   WILLIE
                       What're you talking about -- I'm
                       not a dope fiend!  I saw it!  I'll
                       show you!

129.   INT.  WILLIE'S SUITE                                           129.

       She leads them into her suite.  Willie points to the dark opening
       in the wall.  Blumburtt picks up an oil lamp and holds it toward
       the opening -- suddenly he jumps back as Indiana emerges!

                                   INDIANA
                              (smiling faintly)
                       What're we playing, hid and seek?

       They're all startled.  Willie looks relieved and rushes over to
       Indy and puts her arms around him.

                                   WILLIE
                       Oh, Indy, you got away!  Tell them
                       what happened, they won't believe
                       me --

       He puts his arms around her and feels her trembling from fear and
       anger.  He walks her to the bed and helps her sit down --

                                   INDIANA
                       It's okay.  You're all right now.

                                   WILLIE
                       They think I'm insane.  Tell them
                       I'm not, Indy.  Please -- help me ...

       The awful events have taken their toll and Willie covers her face
       and cries like a scared kid.  Indy gets her to lie down on the
       bed.  He sits beside her and smiles and touches her hair --

                                   INDIANA
                       Hey, I thought you were supposed
                       to be a real tropper.  Willie?

       He wipes the tears from her face and she holds his hand --

                                   WILLIE
                                 (quietly)
                       What?

                                   INDIANA
                       You've got to go to sleep now.

                                   WILLIE
                                  (softly)
                       I want to go home...

                                   INDIANA
                       I don't blame you... this hasn't
                       been what you'd call a fun vaca-
                       tion...

       She smiles a little despite herself and he touches her cheek.
       He eyes are already closing and he stands up.

       A servant is entering the suite to take care of Willie.  She cov-
       sers her with a blanket and start dropping the mosquito netting
       as Indy walks off toward the verandah with Blumburtt and Chattar
       Lal.

130.   EXT.  THE VERANDAH - DAWN                                      130.

       The first light is breaking over the mountain peaks.  Coming out
       onto the verandah, Indy and the other two men see the cavalry
       troops breaking camp below and readying their horses and trucks.

                                   INDIANA
                       I've spent by life crawling around
                       in caves and tunnels -- I shouldn't
                       have let somebody like Willie go
                       in there with me.

                                   CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                       Miss Scott panicked?

                                   INDIANA
                       When she saw the insects she passed
                       out cold.  I carried her back to
                       her room.  She was sleeping when I
                       re-entered the tunnel to look
                       around.

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       As she slept, she undoubtedly had
                       nightmares.

       Indiana looks at him and nods.

                                   INDIANA
                       Then she must have run out of the
                       room and you found her.

                                   CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                       Did you discover anything in that
                       tunnel, Dr. Jones?

       Indiana stares into the rising sun.

                                   INDIANA
                       Nothing.  Just a dead end.  That
                       tunnel's been deserted for years.

       A sergeant-major shouts up to Blumburtt that the troops are
       ready.

                                   CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                       Well, Mr. Prime Minister, my re-
                       port will duly note that we
                       found nothing unusual here in
                       Pankot.

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       I'm sure that will please the
                       Maharajah, Captain.

                                   CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                                   (to Indiana)
                       As I said before, we'd be happy to
                       escort you to Delhi.

                                   INDIANA
                       Thanks, but I don't think Willie is
                       ready to travel yet.

                                                               CUT TO:

131.   EXT.  THE PALACE ROAD - MORNING                                131.

       Dust swirls as the British cavalry moves off with their Highland
       Pipers at the head playing a military bagpipe tune.  Capt. Blum-
       burtt comes out of the palace and gets into an open car.

       Blumburtt's car moves off behind the cavalry and then the supply
       trucks follow.

132.   INT.  WILLIE'S SUITE                                           132.

       The whine of the bagpipes is eerily muted in the dark room.
       Through the gently swaying mosquito netting, we see Willie asleep
       on the bed.

       Then through her side of the gauzy netting, we see the door
       opening across the room.  Indiana enters quietly and moves toward
       the bed, his eyes fixed on Willie's sleeping body.

       Indy sits down on the bed slowly.  Willie turns in her sleep and
       opens her eyes.  Through the mosquito netting she sees Indy sit-
       ting with his back to her.

                                   WILLIE
                       Indy?  Did you walk to them?

                                   INDIANA
                       Yes.

                                   WILLIE
                       So now they believe me.

                                   INDIANA
                       Yes, they believe you.

       Indiana speaks in a strange monotone.

                                   WILLIE
                       Then they'll send the soldiers
                       down into the temple...

       Willie looks at Indiana's back and continues quietly.

                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)
                       I was scared to death last night
                       when I thought they were going to
                       kill you.

                                   INDIANA
                       No... they won't kill me.

                                   WILLIE
                                (smiling faintly)
                       You know you've been nothing but
                       trouble since I hooked up with
                       you -- but I have to admit I'd
                       miss you if I lost you...

       Now Indiana starts to turn slowly.

                                   INDIANA
                       You won't lose me, Willie...

       She sees him turn and his face slowly comes toward the mosquito
       netting -- his face pushes into the netting and Willie looks
       stunned as Indy's mouth opens --

       He starts hissing grotesquely, smoke billows out of his mouth and
       the mosquito netting BURNS OPEN to expose his terrifying face
       moving toward Willie --

       She is forzen with fear and unable to utter a sound as Indy's
       malevolent face looms at her -- and then she notices his eyes --
       his eyes glowing a hellish luminscent yellow!

       Willie SCREAMS!!

       She suddenly bolts from the bed and tries to run -- Indiana goes
       into a rage, ripping the mosquito netting from the bed as he fol-
       lows her.

                                   INDIANA
                       No!  I've found it -- you can't --
                       Kali knows!

       Willie tries the door but it's locked.  She sees Indiana moving
       toward her ranting incoherently as he smashes a vase out of his
       way --

                                   INDIANA
                       -- been too many lies -- there's no
                       god's heaven -- just -- the horror!
                       I've seen it -- life preying on
                       life!

       Willie cowers in a corner, horrified by the transformation she
       sees in Indiana.  Shouting and pacing Indy holds his head against
       the pain of his terrible thoughts --

                                   INDIANA
                       -- rivers -- destroying mountains --
                       a comet in space -- exploding!
                                 (holding his head)  
                       Aaahh! -- the screams -- pitiful
                       people -- their pain -- the hate --
                       and greed -- always greed!

       The light throws his shadow over Willie -- a giant shadow float-
       ing back and forth over her as she cries in the corner, unable to
       fight the evil devouring Indiana.

                                   INDIANA
                       -- but I've found -- Kali's touch!
                       Death -- no more lies -- the death
                       I've been searching for!
                                  (shouting)
                       Quit crying!  She can hear you --
                       Kali knows fear -- don't you under-
                       stand -- Kali is freedom!

       Indiana stops pacing and Willie freezes in terror.  Now a bizarre
       yellow light wipes across the room.  Indiana turns and watches
       silently as two Thuggee guards emerge from a secret doorway
       that's opened --

       The shadows of the Thuggee guards loom over Willie and she
       SCREAMS again!

                                                               CUT TO:

133.   INT.  THE TEMPLE OF DEATH - DAY                                133.

       A sea of frightening faces once again intones the horrible sacri-
       ficial chant.  Among the shorshippers, the little Maharajah sits
       on a riased platform.  Like the other believers, he stares across
       the crevasse at the altar of Kali Ma.

       The wailing wind howls out of the high tunnel and the terrifying
       chanting reaches a fever pitch.

134.   INT.  THE TMEPLE ALTAR                                         134.

       And once again the three sacred Sankara Stones glow magically.
       Mola Ram materializes evilly amidst the swirling smoke and he
       begins chanting in Sanskrit.

       Beside the altar, half-clad female acolytes pass in front of the
       robed priests -- with their fingers the women paint two white
       lines across the priests' foreheads.

       An acolyte moves in front of Chattar Lal -- the Prime Minister is
       now dressed in robes.  As the devotional markings are painted on
       his forehead, Chattar Lal translates the High Priest's speech to
       Indiana who stands next to him.

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       Mola Ram is telling the faithful
                       of out victory.  He says the
                       British have left the palace,
                       which proves Kali Ma's new power.

                                   INDIANA
                       Yes, I understand.

       Indiana bows his head to receive the mystical markings.  He lis-
       tens to Mola Ram's rantings -- Indy's eyes are ominously vacant
       as he stares up at the hideous statue of Kali.

135.   INT.  MINE TUNNELS - DAY                                       135.

       Beneath the temple, down in the bowels of the mountain, the piti-
       ful children dig at the earth with their fingers.  A FAT GUARD
       slouches down the tunnel, flogging malingerers with a aleather
       strap.

       Short Round sweats next to the others, clawing at the rocks,
       doomed to work with them now in their search for the last wo
       Sankara Stones.

       The leather strap suddenly flays Short Round's back and he barely
       manages not to scream out in pain.  The fat guard passes -- Short
       Round and the other kids pull a large rock which suddenly comes
       loose out of the wall -- !

       They fall back and see they've exposed a vein of molten lava!
       Hearing their shouts, the fat guard returns -- yelling at their
       stupidity, he whips them and shoves them aside brutally.

       Short Round see the fat guard's eyes glowing fiercely in anger.
       Suddenly the fissure shoots out steam and spews some molten lava
       over the guard's legs.

       The guard screams and falls to the ground, thrashing about, try-
       ing to kick the searing lava off his smoking flesh.

       As the other kids cower, Short Round's humane instincts cause him
       to jump forward to help the guard who moments earlier was beating
       him --

       Short Round tosses dirt on the guard's legs and grabs a gunny
       sack and starts rubbing the lava off.  Shorty notices something
       strange:

       The guard's eyes, which were glowing yellow before, are now dim-
       ming and returning to normal.  The moaning guard looks at Shorty
       thankfully and then looks around as if waking from a nightmare --

                                   SHORT ROUND
                              (to another slave kid)
                       His eyes -- they go out.

       Other guards appear and lift the guard -- suddenly he starts
       struggling against the guards not wanting to return to the night-
       mare of Kali --

                                   FAT GUARD
                            (as he's dragged away)
                       No!  NO!

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       The pain -- the pain makes him wake up!
                                  (thinking quickly)
                       Indy!  I can make Indy wake up!

       But the other guards push and beat the children back to work.
       Short Round is shoved against a wall and groans -- he reaches over
       and grabs a large rock, lifting it defiantly --

       But rather than heaving it at the guard, Short Round smashes the
       rock down on the leg chains binding him to the other children.
       Shorty beats at the chain with the rock, determined to escape.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Indy!

136.   INT.  THE TEMPLE OF DEATH                                      136.

       The wind moans and joins Mola Ram's voice echoing maniacally over
       the multitude gathered in the enormous temple.  On his throne,
       the little Maharajah listens transfixed.

137.   INT.  THE ALTAR                                                137.

       Chattar Lal watches Indiana staring hypnotically at the High
       Priest as he speaks --

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       You understand what he tells us?

                                   INDIANA
                       Kali Ma protects us now and for-
                       ever, and we must pledge our
                       devotion by worshipping her with
                       an offering of flesh and blood!

       Suddenly htere is a heart-rending scream of terror and the
       priests draf forward the next sacrificial victim --

       Indiana's glowing eyes watch emotionlessly as Willie is brought
       out. Dressed in a Rajput maiden's outfit, Willie has been jewel-
       ed and draped with flowers -- a strange contrast as she struggles
       desperately.

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       Your friend has seen and she has
                       heard -- now she will not talk.

       As Willie is dragged past she sees Indy and calls to him --

                                   WILLIE
                       Indy!  Help me!  Indy?!

       Willie is shocked seeing that Indiana remains impassive and un-
       caring as she's dragged to her death.

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                                   (to Indy)
                       This will prove your devotion to
                       Kali.

       Indiana looks away from Willie's terrified face and stares up
       adoringly at the monstrous statue of his goddess Kali.

138.   INT.  THE MINE                                                 138.

       In the dark tunnel, a rock smashes down onto a chain -- and
       breaks it!  Short Round is exhausted.  He looks around furtively
       and sees a guard approaching.
       
       Short Round takes a chance -- he dives and rolls across the
       tunnel.  He ducks behind a mine car full of rocks being pushed
       out by two chained children.

       The guard lumbers past unsuspectingly as Short Round makes his
       escape using the moving mine car as cover.

139.   INT.  THE ALTAR                                                139.

       Up in the temple, Willie continues to struggle as her legs are
       strapped to the iron sacrifical frame.  Chattar Lal grabs her
       hand and ties it down.  Willie's free hand reaches out imploring-
       ly toward Indiana --

                                   WILLIE
                                (hoarsely)
                       Please, God, don't let them do
                       this to me -- help me, Indy!

       He reaches out slowly and Willie grabs his hand tightly.  Indy
       looks into her eyes and then stares at her hand -- and slowly
       lifts it and starts tying it to the iron frame.

                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)
                       No -- no!

       Willie cries is disbelief as Indiana calmly betrays her.

140.   INT.  THE MINES BELOW                                          140.

       Short Round races up a tunnel and then flattens himself behind a
       corner.  He peers anxiously into a large carven and sees two
       guards walking away.

       When the coast is clear, Short Round darts across the cavern to a
       long wooden ladder tilted up against a wall.  Short Round looks
       up the high ladder and sees a kid with a sack of rocks descending
       from a burrow-hole half-way up the wall.

       The exhausted kid nearly collapses at the bottom -- then jumps
       seeing Short Round.  Shorty motions for him to keep quiet.
       Amaxed, the kid watches Short Round scramble up the ladder.
       Shorty continues until he is high above the floor.

       Dirty faces stare out of the high burrow as Short Round stops
       climbing.  The kids are astonished as Short Round suddenly grunts
       and kicks the ladder away from the wall!

       The high ladder falls in an arc and what seem like sure suicide
       slowly resembles a mini-Indiana Junes stunt as Short Round swings
       to the other side of the falling ladder --

       Short Round holds on for dear life as the ladder crashes against
       the opposite cavern wall -- giving Short Round access to the
       roof-hole that leads up to the temple!

       Short Round scurries up the ladder and pulls himself up into the
       chamber behind the altar.  He looks at the light flaring around
       the statue of Kali --

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Indy -- !

141.   INT.  THE TEMPLE OF DEATH                                      141.

       Chains clank and gears grind as the sacrificial frame is raised
       over the crevasse.  Stretched out on it, Willie looks horrified
       as she hangs suspended face down above the boiling lava!

       The frame and victim descend slowly into the crevasse and the
       crowd around the little Maharajah changs louder.

142.   INT.  THE REAR CHAMBER                                         142.

       Short Round dashes across the dark chamber behind the altar.  He
       peers out and sees Willie disappearing into the crewasse!  He
       sees Indiana watching impassively --

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       No -- Indy -- wake up!

       Then Shorty sees a flaming torch hanging on a wall bracket and he
       has an idea.

143.   INT.  THE ALTAR                                                143.

       Short Round suddenly darts out onto the altar and Mola Ram sees
       him and yells.  Several priests grab for Shorty.  He eludes the
       first priest, smashes the second in the stomach with his head,
       and runs like a little quarterback toward the fiery torch --

       Short Round snatches the torch from the wall and charges toward
       Indiana.  Seeing him coming, Indy's eyes start glowing yellow and
       when Short Round runs up to him, Indiana suddenly swings and
       backhands the little guy brutally across the face!

       The torch flies out of Shorty's hand as he's knocked against at
       wall by Indy's vicious blow -- Short Round wipes a little blood
       from his chin and stares at his hero in wounded disbelief.

       Chattar Lal watches approvingly -- a priest moves toward Shorty.
       Chattar Lal looks back toward the crevasse --

       Willie hangs on the lowering frame, heat waves rising up now to
       scald her skin and she chokes as the sulphuric air burns her
       lungs!

       Meanwhile Short Round is crawling backwards across the floor with
       a look of terror on his face -- Indiana stalks him, hissing,
       snarling, his eyes lgowing --

       Short Round springs to his feet and tries to run -- Indy grabs
       him and pulls him -- Shorty's hand grabs for another wall torch
       and just manages to yank it free!

       Indiana spins Short Round and clutches his throat.  As Indy
       strangles him, Short Round struggles and finally jams the torch
       into Indy's side.  The fiery torch burns Indy, smoking as it
       sears his flesh, and he yells in pain.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Wake up!  It's just a nightmare,
                       Indy!  Wake up, please Indy!

       Indiana writhes in pain and Short Round sees the evil yellow glow
       in Indy's eyes getting dimmer and finally going out.  Now it
       seems like theold Indiana staring at him --

                                   SHORT ROUND (Cont'd)
                       Indy, you back?

       Suddenly a priest grabs Short Round and pulls him off Indiana.

                                   INDIANA
                       No!  Give him to me!

       Short Round is firghtened as Indy grabs him from the priest.
       Indy lifts Short Round into the air --

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       No, Indy, no!

       He sets Short Round down on the brink of the crevasse an inch
       from doom.  Shorty looks down at the lava and is terrified.
       Indiana finally flahses him a quick smile and winks!

       Then Indiana whirls and punches the priest in the face!  Short
       Round cheers, realizing that Indiana is back.

                                   SHORT ROUND (Cont'd)
                       We got to help Willie!

       Indiana springs into action, stopping another priest with a quick
       punch in the stomach.  Then he rushes over to the crankwheel and
       pulley platform.  Indy jumps onto it, yanking one priest off who
       spills onto the floor.

       A second priest, who works the controls lowering the sacrificial
       frame, sees Indy and releases the crankwheel --

       Down in the crevasse, Willie screams as the iron frame suddenly
       plummets toward the fulminating lava!

       On the platform, the priest lunges at Indiana -- Indy uses the
       man's own momentum to throw him over his head.  Indy then dives
       for the crankwheel and manages to stop it --

       Down in the crevasse, the fram jolts to a stop only yards above
       the spumes of fiery lava.  The heat is so intense now that Wil-
       lie's clothes start smoking and she passes out...
       On the platform above, Indiana cranks furiously, raising the sa-
       crificial frame.

144.   INT.  THE TEMPLE                                               144.

       The chanting stops at the Kali worshippers notice the battle on
       the altar.  The little Maharajah looks concerned and leaves,
       shoving through the crowd behind his bodyguards.

145.   INT.  THE ALTAR                                                145.

       Mola Ram shouts at his priests and another one of them runs to-
       ward Indy on the platform.  Short Round dives and tackles the
       priest.

       Chattar Lal finally leaps onto the crankwheel platform and Indy
       sees him pull a dagger.  He slashes at Indiana and Indy has to
       let go of the crankwheel -- the gears scream and the chains
       screech!

       Below in the crevasse, the iron frame plunges again toward the
       crimson lava!

       On the platform, Indy hears the frame lowering and looks pan-
       icked.  Chattar Lal slahses again with the dagger -- keeping Indy
       away from the cogwheel mechanism --

       Indy suddenly kicks the dagger from Chattar Lal's hand slugs him
       in the stomach and dives toward the cogwheel mechanism.  He grabs
       a iron rod and throws it into the gears --

       the gears mangle the iron rod but finally grind to a stop.  Indi-
       ana grabs the crankwheel and starts winding it up furiously.

       Meanwhile, Short Round jumps onto the platform with Indy and
       grabs a long wrench.  He starts swinging the wrench, keeping the
       last priests off the platfrom.

       The sacrificial frame finally rises up into view and Indiana
       grabs it and swings it over onto the platform.  He looks at Wil-
       lie anxiously as he releases her bindings --

       Willie moans and moves her head.  Indy pulls her off the frame
       and she starts coughing.  Gasping for breath, Willie ervives as
       fresh air flows into her lungs.

       Finally Willie opens her eyes and she sees Indiana.  Then she
       notices something else and manages to cry out hoarsely --

                                   WILLIE
                       Look out -- !

       Chattar Lal grabs a pistol from an unconscious guard and Indiana
       whirls to see him pointing it -- Indy kicks the gun from his hand
       and suddenly Chattar Lal starts shouting in a terrifying voice --

       Chattar Lal's eyes glow as he lunges suicidally at Indiana, at-
       tempting to take Indy with him as he dives from the platform!

       Crashing into Indy, Chattar Lal knocks both of them back onto the
       sacrificial frame which swings out over the crevasse --

       Indy manages to dive off the frame just in time.  He grabs hold
       of the platform as the crankwheel screams and the frame falls!

       Looking up from the depths of the crevasse, we see the frame with
       Chattar Lal on it plummeting downward into the sulphurous smoke!
       The frame finally crashes, splashing into the molten lava.

       Chattar Lal's body explodes inot flame friefly -- his flesh is
       broiled off in an instant -- we glimpse a skeleton momentarily --
       and then all is consumed and obliterated by the blazing lava.

      scramble over to Short Round who jumps off the platform and they
       follow him across the altar.

       Indy sees Mola Ram quickly collecting the sacred Sankara Stones.
       Indiana rushes over and spins Mola Ram around --

       He slugs the High Priest in the face and Mola Ram keels over
       backwards against the statue of Kali.  Short Round helps stuff
       the Sankara Stones into Indiana's shoulder bag.

146.   INT.  THE REAR CHAMBER                                         146.

       Short Round, Willie and Indiana rush across the chamber behind
       the altar.  They run over to the ladder and start climbing down
       into the mines.

147.   INT.  THE MINES

       Willie follows Short Round.  Indiana jumps down last and pulls
       the ladder away, letting it crash to the floor so they won't be
       followed.

       They draw the attention of the slave children working in the tun-
       nels around the cavern.  But it's the sight of the approaching
       guard that worries Indy --

                                   INDIANA
                       Come on, quick!

       They duck into one of the tunnels.  As they hide, Indy watches
       the guard passing.

                                   WILLIE
                       What're we going to do?

       Indiana looks around at the silent, frightened children who've
       stopped working in the tunnel and his anger darkens --

                                   INDIANA
                       We're going to get them out
                       of here -- !

       Then he looks at the bag holding the Sankara Stones and grows
       still more determined --

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       And then we're going to get these
                       out of here -- !
                                  (seething)
                       And somehow I'm going to see this
                       place destroyed.

148.   INT.  THE CAVERN - MOMENTS LATER                               148.

       A gaurd passing hears a voice and stops --

                                   INDIANA (O.S.)
                       Ah, sir?  Excuse me --

       The guard turns and looks amazed to see Indy smiling at him from
       the mouth of the tunnel.

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       Listen, I'm from the union and I'd
                       like to talk about the working
                       conditions here.  Could you step
                       inside a minute?

       Indy smiles again and disappears into the tunnel.  In astonished
       rage, the guard draws his sword and goes after Indy into the tun-
       nel -- there's a pause and then we hear the guard yell!

149.   INT.  THE TUNNEL                                               149.

       Willie flattens against the wall as Indiana catapaults the big
       guard past her back into the mine where he's set upon bu a horde
       of rebellious slave children.

       The kids swarm over the guard like jackalas and we see Short Round
       pull a key from the struggling guard's robe.

                                                               CUT TO:

150.   MONTAGE - THE MINES                                            150.

       A key is twisted and the chains are pulled from kids' legs...

       Elsewhere, more chains are unlocked and rattle free.  Liberated
       kids spill out of the tunnels...

       A guard is tripped and attacked by a horde of ex-slaves...

       In another location, kids wrap captured guards in layers of
       chains...

       High up on a ledge, a fleeing gaurd skids to a stop when he sees
       kids charging at him.  He sees more kids rushing from behind him.
       The guard scrams as he dives off the ledge...

                                                        (END MONTAGE)

151.   INT.  BEHIND THE ALTAR - DAY                                   151.

       Freed children scramble up numerous ladders to escape the mines
       below.  They follow the mass of children moving toward the front
       altar.

152.   INT.  THE ALTAR                                                152.

       On the altar, under the statue of Kali, Willie and Short Round
       are helping Indy and some of the bigger children rip down a
       long wooden panel decorated with hideous Kali figures.

       The childrens' escape is blocked by the chasm separating the
       altar from the deserted sorshippers' area of the temple.  The
       swelling crowds of children push and teeter dangerously on the
       edge of the fire pit.

       Indiana and the others carry the wooden panel through the crowd
       toward the chasm.  They stand it up and when Indy gives thw word
       they drop it --

       The panel crashes across the chasm forming a plank across which
       the children now begin running to safety.

153.   INT.  BEHIND THE ALTAR                                         153.

     The last of the children scramble up the ladders and run toward
       the front of the altar.

154.   INT.  THE ALTAR                                                154.

       The childrens' bare feet stomp across the wooden plank -- below
       them the lava of the fire pit bubbles and shows outbursts of
       flame.

       Indy stares at the plank and sees that it's starting to smoke
       from the intese heat rising up.

       On the far side of the plank, the children safely across scatter
       through the deserted temple toward freedom.

       Willie and Short Round help the last kids out onto the plank --
       Indy sees one child's foot break though the smoldering wood --
       the kid in front pulls the child to safety.

       Willie and Short Round start to go out onto the plank but Indy
       shouts at them --

                                   INDIANA
                       No, wait!

       He runs over and pulls them aside -- he steps out onto the plank
       and takes a few steps to test it -- suddenly the plank bursts
       into flame in the middle.

       Indy takes one more step -- and then the plank breaks!  Indy
       dives back to the ledge of the altar and Willie and Short Round
       grab him and pull him up and the wooden plank plummets into the
       fiery chasm.

                                   WILLIE
                       What're we going to do?!

                                   INDIANA
                       There's got to be another way out.

                                                               CUT TO:

155.   INT.  A TUNNEL                                                 155.

       Indiana, Willie and Short Round run through the deserted mine
       tunnels.  They hear a rumbling noise and Indy leads them down a
       side tunnel.  They stop and peer into a quarry.

156.   INT.  THE QUARRY CAVERN                                        156.

       A large cavern is the depository for the mine cars rolling in
       with loads of rock.  Emaciated children (still unaware of the re-
       volt and the other childrens' escape) break their backs shoving
       the heavily-loaded mine cars.

       Thuggee guards supervise the deadening work, while others oper-
       ate the pulley-and-hoist system used to drag  the cars up the
       sloped dump ramp.

       Behind this operation, a thunderous waterfall cascades into a
       huge cistern.  From there, chutes deply the rushing water to
       power the large conveyor belt below it.

       As the cars rise up the ramp, they tip and spill rocks onto the
       conveyor belt which carries them toward an awesome stone cylinder
       that rolls relentlessly , crushing the rocks into sand.

       From the side tunnel, Indiana watches the noisy operation.

                                   INDIANA
                       Those empty cars have got to go
                       out of the mines.

       Willie and Short Round watch the children push the empty mine
       cars.  The cars gain momentum and roll away down two dark tun-
       nels.

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       Come on, let's see if we can
                       catch a ride...

       Tey duck out of the tunnel and run for cover behind a slag heap.
       Loaded mine cars roaring down from the mines hurtle past them and
       crash to a stop against the cars in front.

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       Okay, Shorty -- go!

       He pushes Short Round who darts out after a mine car roars past
       and dodges across the tracks before the next one descends.  Indy
       pushes Willie  into  position and holds her ready --

                                   WILLIE
                       I can't!

                                   INDIANA
                       Go!

       After another car crashes past, Indy shoves her.  Willie runs out
       -- her shoe gets stuck and she freezes in the tracks!  Willie
       sees a rock-filled car blasting down out of a tunnel directly
       toward her!

       Indiana dives, knocking Willie safely to the ground on the other
       side of the tracks -- the heavy car hurtles past and crashes into
       the cars in front.

       Indy pulls Willie behind a massive wooden post holding up the
       dump ramp and they hide from a passing gaurd.

                                   INDIANA
                       We've got to get across to the
                       empty cars.  Wait here until I
                       signal you.

       They watch him run and hurdle a pile of lumber, bound up three
       steps and duck behind a tool shack on the platform.  Indy reaches
       out and grabs one of the passing slave children.

       They see Indy put his hand over the kid's mouth and whisper to
       him.  He releases the kid who sneaks away, alerting the other
       children who start making their escapes into side tunnels.

       Now Indy motions to Short Rounds and Willie to follow.  As they
       start to move out they freeze dead in their tracks and Indy
       motions again angrily --

                                   INDIANA
                       Come on!

       Willie and Short Round see a guard coming up the steps on the
       other side of the platform.  As the man rises he gets taller and
       taller -- until they see it's a Thuggee giant coming up behind
       Indiana.

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       Come one, what's wrong?

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Behind you!

       Indiana turns and looks into the bare chest of the seven-foot
       tall guard.  Indy has to look up to see the man's mean-looking
       face.

                                   INDIANA
                       I see the problem...

       Indiana suddenly punches the giant in the stomach -- the giant
       does not flinch, he just belches rudely.

       Indiana growls and winds up to take a killer swing -- he steps
       back, cocks his arm -- and suddenly turns and runs away.

       No dummy, Indy dashes over and picks up a piece of wood.  The
       giant starts toward him.  Indy drops the wood and looks around
       for a much larger piece of wood.

       As the giant stalks toward him, Indiana raises the large piece of
       lumber -- Indy suddenly groans, drops the wood and clutches his
       stomach.  Willie and Short Round looks startled --

                                   WILLIE
                       What happened?

       Short Round shakes his head.  They see Indy recover from the
       spasm as the giant rushes him.  Indy jumps aside, landing on a
       loaded mine car that is passing by.

       The car is being dragged up the dump ramp and the giant jumps out
       onto it after Indiana.  Indy quickly grabs a rock and, as the
       giant rushes him, Indy smashes the rock against the big man's
       skull!

       Unfortunately, it's the rock that shatters and not the skull.
       Indy dives to the other end of the mine car and lifts a large
       boulder.

       Suddenly Indy drops the boulder and grabs him arm, feeling a
       shooting pain again.  Then he yells as he feels yet another stab-
       bing pain in his left leg.

                                   WILLIE
                       What's wrong with him?

       Shorty is convused and worried -- and then he sees something!  He
       looks up and there on a rock-cut balcony over the cavern is the
       little Maharajah!

       The little prince clutches the clay krtya doll that represents
       Indy.  He jabs it in the leg with a long sapphire-tipped turban
       pin.

       On the mine car, Indy yells and grabs his right leg, which
       collapses beneath him.  Short Round takes off.  He dashes under
       the platform toward a bucket-chain carrying spent water back up
       to the cistern.

       Short Round leaps over the pool of water and grabs onto a bucket.
       He rises up on this make-shift elevator toward the rock balcony
       and the malicious little Maharajah.

       Meanwhile, Indy is on the brink of unconsciousness as the giant's
       massive hands throttle his neck.  Indy's head hangs over the end
       of the mine car and suddenly his eyes widen --

       The car with Indy and the giant reaches the peak of the dump ramp
       and its upended -- spilling both of them and a shower of rocks
       down the conveyor belt!

       Down below, Willie dodges wooden pillars and weaves around
       quarry equipment, trying to follow Indy's battle with the giant.
       She trips and swears angrily --

       Willie pushes and empty mine car out of her way -- an empty mine
       car!  She runs back and starts shoving the mine car along the
       rails toward the conveyor belt.

                                   WILLIE
                       I got one!  Indy, I got one!

       Near the waterfall, Short Round ascends on the rising bucket
       chain.  Up on the balcony, the little Maharajah chuckles evilly as
       he watches Indiana on the conveyor belt --

       The Maharajah lifts the clay doll and viciously jabs the pin in
       the back of it!

       On te conveyor, Indiana gets to his feet and then yells as a
       stabbing pain lacerates his back!  He falls and writhed helpless-
       ly as the giant staggers up the rocky conveyor belt toward him.

       Willie shoves the mine car forward.  She sees Indy's desperate
       situation as he's pulled along the conveyor toward the rock
       crusher!

                                   WILLIE
                       Indy, look out!

       She looks up and sees Short Round leap from the bucket-chain onto
       the balcony.  The little Maharajah's eyes glow fiendishly as he
       lifts the clay doll -- and jabs the pin into the doll's face.

       On the conveyor belt, Indy yells agonizingly and clutches his
       stabbed face!  Behind him, rocks explode as they're crushed and
       pulverized by the mammoth roller.

       In front of Indy, the Thuggee giant grabs a pick-axe as the con-
       veyor slides past a tool bin.  The giant approaches Indy with it.

       Short Round dashes across the balcny and tackles the Maharajah.
       They fall and fight like mortal enemies.  Short Round sees the
       little Maharajah's eyes glowing as he punches him in the face.

       Only a few feet away from the rock-smashing roller, Indy is still
       on his back on the conveyor belt, thrashing in pain, feeling the
       Maharajah's pin piercing his face.  The giant raises the pick-axe
       above his head and it about to split Indiana in two!

       On the balcony, the Maharajah drops the doll and Short Round
       dives for it -- he grabs the clay doll and pulls out the pin!

       On the conveyor belt, Indiana is suddenly released from the
       and looks up to see the giant swinging the pick-axe.  Indy rolls
       aside at the last minute!

       The pick-axe cleaves into the conveyor belt and the giant lurches
       forward -- Indy gives him a helpful kick, sending the giant
       flying toward the rock-crusher as Indy jumps off the conveyor
       belt!

       Seeing the huge roller looming in front of him, the giant crawls
       desperately against the movement of the conveyor belt -- but he
       gets snagged!

       The sash around his waist gets caught under the rolling cursher
       and he's dragged back under it feet first.  The Thuggee giant
       screams hideously as his body is rolled over and squashed by the
       enormous stone wheel!

       On the balcony, Short Round is jabbing the pin into the squirming
       little Maharajah.  The little pricne's eyes still glow yellow as
       he hollers --

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       How you like bing pin cushion,
                       Mr. Rajah-ha-ha?

       The little prince rolls on the ground and tries to fight off
       Short Round who keeps jabbing him -- suddenly the Maharajah
       swings and the pin is accidentally rammed clear through his hand!

       Shorty sees the pin sticking through both sides of the kid's
       hand.  The Maharajah stares at his pierced hand, gasping in
       astonishment.

       Short Round notices the yellow glow dying out of the Maharajah's
       eyes -- just as Indy's eyes cleared after he was released from
       Kali's trance.

                                   MAHARAJAH
                       Please -- pull it out!

       Short Round yanks the pin out of the little prince's hand.  The
       Maharajah looks like he's jsut awakened from a bag dream.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       It was the black sleep of Kali...

                                   MAHARAJAH
                       They made me do evil things...
                       may lord Krishna forgive me.

       Meanwhile, Indy runs along the catwalk above the conveyor belt.
       He jumps and grabs onto a cross-bard -- he kicks out with his feet
       and knocks a quarry guard off the catwalk.

       The guard flies through the air and topples into the sand pit
       where he thrashes around blindly under the sand falling from the
       crusher.

       Across the cavern, Willie shoves the rolling mine car toward the
       balcony.

                                   WILLIE
                       Get down here, Shorty!  I got us
                       a ride!

       Willie shirls as another quarry guard rushes toward her.  She
       yanks the iron brake-handle off the mine car and holds it threat-
       eningly like a baseball bat --

                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)
                       Come on, let's see hoe hand your
                       head is!

       Up on the rock balcony, Short Round lowers himself over the edge.
       The little Maharajah grabs his arm --

                                   MAHARAJAH
                       Please -- listen -- to go out
                       you must take the left tunnel.

       Shorty looks at him and he knows he's telling the truth.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Thanks pal.

                                   MAHARAJAH
                       I'm going to try to find the
                       English soldiers.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Good luck.

       Short Round slips over the edge and slides down a wet stalactite
       to the floor of the cavern.

       There he finds Willie swinging the brake-handle and smashing the
       guard in the gut.  The man doubles in pain -- Willie kicks his
       putt and he splashes into the pool of water.

                                   WILLIE
                       I don't appreciate being cooked
                       like a french fry!

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Willie, come on!

       Willie starts pushing the empty mine car with Short Round.

                                   SHORT ROUND (Cont'd)
                       You do pretty good for a girl!

       Across the quarry, Mola Ram and six temple guards run out onto a
       high platform next to the waterfall.  Mola Ram sees Willie and
       Short Round pushing the mine cat.

       Mola Ram shouts to his men -- two of them pull pistols and open
       fire!

       Bullets ricochet off the mine car and Short Round shoves Willie
       to the far side of the car where they both take cover.

       Meanwhile, up on a catwalk, a guard slices a sword through the
       air and Indiana ducks!  The sword slashes into a wooden railing
       and the guard tries frantically to pull it out --

       Indiana slams kis knee up into the guard's stomach and then
       smashes his fist down on his neck -- the man collapses.  Indy
       hears more gunfire.

       Indiana rushes along the catwalk toward the platform above.  He
       edges against the wall below the platform, staying out of sight
       as he unfurls his whip.

       One of Mola Ram's guards fires again from the high platform and
       Indiana lashes the whip -- the whip wraps around the gunman's
       arm and Indy yanks on it --

       The gunman topples through the air and crashes down onto the cat-
       walk.  Indy grabs the gun.  He kicks the guard off the catwalk
       and the man falls into the waterfall pool.

       As the other guards fire down at him, Indiana dodges along the
       catwalk and fires back at them.  A bullet explodes near Mola Ram
       and he ducks back --

       Meanwhile, Short Round and Willie have the mine car rolling and
       they jump into it --

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Indy!  Hurry!

       Indiana spots the rolling mine car racing across the quarry.  Indy
       takes off and runs along the catwalk -- bullets explode around
       him, splintering wood.  Indy reaches the end of the catwalk --

       Suddenly he dives into the air and catches hold of a block and
       tacke!  Indy skids along the pulley system, sliding down a cable
       toward the mine car in which Short Round and Willie are riding.

       Bullets whiz past as Indiana sails in the air above the speeding
       mine car - when they are in sync, Indy lets go and drops into the
       mine car next to Willie and Short Round!

       Mola Ram rushes forward and watches the speeding mine car rolling
       down the track toward the tunnels --

                                   MOLA RAM
                       They've stolen the Sankara
                       Stones -- they must be stopped!

       In the speeding  mine car, Indy sees the tracks separating in two
       directions -- one back into the quarry, the other toward two tun-
       nels that lead out of the mines.

       Indiana lifts a shovel from the floor of the car and swings it
       just in time -- he hits a switch which CLANGS as they speed by
       and the car is shunted tipsy-turvy onto the track toward the two
       tunnels.

       Willie hangs on as the car tears down the track toward the tunnel
       on the right -- and Short Round looks worried --

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       No, Indy, it's left tunnel.

       But it's too late and they all hold on as the mine car shoots
       donw into the darkness of the echoing tunnel.

157.   INT.  THE TUNNEL                                               157.

       The wind rushes past Indiana as the car descends into the tunnel
       and picks up speed.  Willie hangs on with Short Round -- the mine
       car roars around a curve and flies fater along the rails.

158.   INT.  THE QUARRY                                               158.

       Back in the quarry, Mola Ram supervises the guards as they shove
       empty cars toward the tunnel.  Carrying long Khyber rifles, they
       jump aboard the cars.  The first one rolls into the dark tunnel
       and the second car speeds after it.

159.   INT.  THE TUNNEL ENTRANCE                                      159.

       The two Thuggee cars shoot past, descending into the darkness in
       pursuit of the infidels who stole the Sankara Stones.

160.   INT.  THE TUNNEL                                               160.

       The mine car hurtles past.  Indy sits in front, pulling back on
       the brake-lever to control their speed and keep them from careen-
       ing off the tracks.

       Expecting trouble, Short Round peers over the back end of the
       car.  Willie ducks low, watching the heavy beams flashing danger-
       ously close above their heads.

       Then Willie's eyes go wide and she groans in terror like a girl
       on a roller coaster as the mine car suddenly plunges downward,
       taking their stomachs with it.

       A gunshot rings out and Short Round sees the first Thuggee car
       appear around a curve behind them.  Mola Ram's gunmen start
       blasting.  Bullets ricochet off the mine car and Indy yells back
       to Short Round.

                                   INDIANA
                       Come here and take the brake!

       Short ROund scurries forward and grabs the brake from Indy.

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       Slow on the curves or we'll fly
                       off the tracks!

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Read you loud and clear, Indy!

       Short Round grins as he holds the brake -- Willie realized that
       this is Shorty's idea of a good time!

161.   INT.  THE CAVERN                                               161.

       Up in the quarry, gunmen push a third car toward the tunnel, but
       Mola Ram stops them.  He shouts and they turn and look instead
       toward the waterfall and huge cistern....

162.   INT.  THE TUNNEL                                               162.

       Indiana is crouched in the back of the zooming mine bar blasting
       away with the pistol he captured in the quarry.

       A gunman in the car behind returns his fire, the explosions
       lighting up the tunnle walls.

       Indy aims and fires again -- the gunman is hit and knocked back
       in the car.  Another guard with a Khyber rifle moves up to the
       front and starts firing.

       Meanwhile, as the car goes into a hard turn, Short Round rides
       the brake -- beneath the car we see the brake-pad scraping on the
       metal wheel.

       The tunnel gets lower and Indy has to duck under each beam flying
       over and can only pop up to fire between the low beams.

       The rifleman in the car behind is relading.  Then he lifts his
       rifle -- Indy pops up simultaneously and shoots!

       The gunman is hit, his rifle flies up and his head smashes
       against the beam hurtling above!  Screaming horribly, the gunman
       is knocked from the speeding car like a broken doll.

163.   INT.  THE CAVERN                                               163.

       Up in the quarry, Mola Ram's men swing sledge hammers, bashing
       away at the rock supports under the huge water-filled cistern.

164.   INT.  THE TUNNEL                                               164.

       Indiana runs out of bullets.  He sees the car behind getting
       closer.  He tosses the pistol and hits a Thuggee in the head.
       Another Thuggee retrieves Indy's pistol and starts reloading it.

       Suddenly Indy is being shot at by his own gun and he yells to
       Short Round
                                   INDIANA
                       Let up on the brake!

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       What?!

       Indy shoves past Willie and takes the brake level from Shorty.

                                   INDIANA
                       Let her go!  Our only chance is
                       outrunning them!

                                   WILLIE
                       What above the curves?!

       Short Round looks scared as Indy released the brake and the car
       hurtles toward a curve.  They grab the sides of the car as it tips
       precariously.  Behind them, the curve throws the gunmen from side
       to side in the car following.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Indy, look out!

       A sharper curve looms ahead and Indy shoves the brake completely
       off!

                                   WILLIE
                       What're you doing?!  We're going
                       too fast!!

       Willie closes her eyes as they rocket toward the curve.  In the
       car behind, the Thugge guard at the brake also shoves the brake
       off -- and looks extremely worried.

       Indy's car hits the curve and the centrifugal force lifts the in-
       side wheels off the rails!

                                   INDIANA
                       Get over on the other side!

       Willie and Short Round jumps over to his side as the car whips
       around the curve!  Indy looks back and sees the car pursuing them
       is also taking the curve at full speed --

       Suddenly the Thuggee car swereves dangerously, the weight shifts
       too much to the outside -- and the car derails!

       The car bounces off the tracks and flies through the air into a
       siding where is CRASHES against a stone wall in an EXPLOSION of
       rock and metal!

       Pieces of debris pommel the drive of the second Thuggee car and
       he quickly grabs for the brake to slow down and avoid the same
       fate!

       In the lead car, Indy smiles smugly as Willie opens her eyes.

                                   INDIANA
                       One down, one to go!

165.   INT.  THE CAVERN ABOVE                                         165.

       Mola Ram's guards continue to bash away with sledge hammers at
       the rock supports under the mammoth cistern.  One of the supports
       starts to crumble --

       From above, we see the cistern list to one side and water laps
       dangerously over the edge as the huge tank creaks and sawsy.

166.   INT.  THE TUNNEL                                               166.

       Indiana and Short Round heft a railroad tie out of th bottom of
       the car and Willie watches them lift it onto the back --

       As gunfire continues to explode from the car behind them, Indiana
       and Short ROund shove the railroad tie off the back of the car --

       The wooden railroad tie falls and bounces back across the tracks.
       The gunmen in the car behind spit it and yell in panic --

       Indy and Willie watch the car behind crash into the railroad tie
       -- but the tie just skids, catches and bounces up and out of the
       way like a huge tumbling matchstick!

                                   WILLIE
                       Anymore ideas...?

                                   INDIANA
                       Yeah -- this time you're gonna
                       help!

167.   INT.  THE CAVERN                                               167.

       The sledgehammers continue -- until two of the rock supports give
       way!  There are shouts as the guards run for cover.

       Mola Ram stands on a platform watching the huge cistern slowly
       keel over -- the noise is incredible as the colossal tank crashes
       to the ground!

       Suddenly a half-million gallons of water explode across the cav-
       cern and surge in a tidal wave toward the tunnels!

168.   INT.  THE TUNNEL                                               168.

       The walls of the tunnel flash past and curves appear suddenly out
       of the darkness as the hair-raising chase continues --

       Short Round and Willie struggle to help Indy lift a large boulder
       from the bottom of the speeding mine car.

       The cars descend again into a stretch of much lower tunnel where
       the beams flash past inches above them.  Indy judges the beams --

                                   INDIANA
                       Okay  -- one -- two -- NOW!

       All three of them groan as they raise the boulder and shove it
       off the back of the car -- ducking instantly to avoid being de-
       capitated by the next beam!

       Looking back, they see the gunmen pop up between the beams -- and
       they see the looks of terror on the gunmen's faces as they see
       the boulder in front of them!

       The Thuggee car hits the boulder and upends!  The guards scream
       horribly as the car tumbles end over end, slamming against the
       tunnel walls, getting ripped to shreds so that finally only
       pieces of metal, wheels and debris fly like a meteorite shower
       down the tunnel!

       Willie whoops for joy and hugs Indy who smiles modestly --

                                   INDIANA
                       Okay, Shorty, hit the brakes!

       Short Round dives for the front of the car and ahppily pulls the
       brake lever -- it doesn't work!  Short Round yanks on it harder
       -- the brake level suddenly breaks off!

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Indy!!

       Indy sees Short Round holding up the broken brake lever!  Indy
       crawls quickly toward Shorty while Willie holds on for dear life!

       Completely out of control, the car hurtles down a decline into a
       section where the tunnel if larger again --

       Indiana bends over the front of the car and looks underneath.  He
       sees the brake tension hanging loose from the brake-pad.  Indiana
       pulls himself back up and looks at Willie and Short Round.

                                   INDIANA
                       Grab onto me -- I'm going to try
                       and slow us down from underneath!

       Willie looks terrified but helps Short Round grab onto Indy's arm
       and the back of his jacket.  He skips over the front of the car
       and swings a leg underneath --

       Indy is inches above the rails and the rocky ground blurring be-
       neath the car as he tries to kick at the brake-pad.  His feet
       fall and he bumps along, dragged dangerously for a moment --

       Indy manages to find a foothold on the undercarriage of the car.
       As they hold onto him, Indy kicks again and his foot hits the
       brake-pad.  He shoves it and slowly the pad closes against the
       spinning wheel...

                                   WILLIE
                       Oh no!

       Willie and Short Round look up and see that the tunnel is ending
       ahead and the track dead-ends into a stone wall!

                                   INDIANA
                       What's wrong?

       He looks around -- and sees the car rocketing directly toward the
       stone wall!

       Indy's foot starts kicking in high-gear underneath the car -- he
       slams at the brake-pad with all his strength -- the pad screeches
       against the spinning wheeel and starts sparking!

       The car seems to slow as it shoots toward the end of the tunnel.
       Indy groans and pushes hard against the smoking brake-pad.

       The car slows more and more until it runs down the last few yards
       to the dead-end and rolls gently to a stop, just nudgeing Indy's
       back against the wall....

                                   INDIANA
                       Ouch...

       Willie looks faint as Indiana gets to his feet and Shorty jumps
       out of the car.  They help Willie out and she stands shakily --

                                   WILLIE
                       I'm okay -- I'm fine -- I love to
                       flirt with death...

       Indiana sees that the tunnel ahead continues without any more
       tracks.  Then they hear something --

       A strange rumbling sound echoing down the tunnel from behind
       them.  The walls seem to reverberate.  Looking worried, they
       start walking away down the tunnel.

       They walk faster as the noise behind them becomes louder and they
       keep glancing over their shoulders --

                                   WILLIE
                       What's that?...Indy?!

       Indiana isn't sure and he pulls Willie by the arm and all three of
       them start jogging.

       The rumbling behind them sounds increasingly ominous and finally
       they start running full tilt.  They rush down the tunnel and the
       awful noise becomes defening!  Willie looks around again and
       slows suddenly --

       Willie stops dead in her tracks -- paralyzed -- awestruck --
       DOOMED!

       Willie sees a monster wall of water (released from the quarry) as
       it thunders around a curver -- a mammoth tidal wave crashing spec-
       tacularly against the opposite tunnel wall!

       A veritable "tsunami" caroming off the tunnel wall and spewing
       furiously forward like a hydrous Juggernaut!

                                   WILLIE
                                 (frozen in
                                  her tracks)
                       Oh... shit...

       Indiana and Short Round notice that Willie's sloed and they stop
       running -- they also see the cataclysm of water crashing down the
       tunnel toward them.

       Indy runs back and grabs Willie.  All three of them take off,
       running faster than they've ever run in their lives!

       The tidal wave smashes forward, booming behind them and Indiana
       realizes quickly that they're going to lose this race.  Suddenly
       he sees a small side-tunnel in a bend ahead --

                                   INDIANA
                       There!  Dive!

       They lunge toward the hole and Short Round dives in it first.
       Indiana shoves Willie into the hole and jumps in after her just
       as the colossal tidal wave explodes  past!

169.   INT.  THE CHUTE                                                169.

       The small tunnel drops precipitously and they slide down, shower-
       ed by the small side-current of water that's broken off from the
       main force.

170.   INT.  A LARGE TUNNEL                                           170.

       They rolls and tumble out of the small chute into a larger tunnel.
       The roar of the tidal wave sounds distant and receding as they
       catch their breath.

                                   INDIANA
                       Lucky I found a short cut.  Look,
                       there's a light at the end of the
                       tunnel...

       Suddenly an EXPLOSION!  They turn and see the thundering tidal
       wave crashing around a curve and cascading down the tunnel behind
       them again!

                                   WILLIE
                       Some short cut!

       They all holler in unison and start running like bats out of hell
       toward the daylight.  The towering wall of water surges relent-
       lessley after them --

       The tidal wave looms up to annihilate them as they race to the
       mouth of the tunnel -- and Willie SCREAMS!  Indy grabs her and
       all three of the flail their arms to keep from losing their bal-
       ance!

171.   EXT.  THE TUNNEL EXIT - DAY                                    171.

       The tunnel exits midway up a cliff and the three totter precari-
       ously on the brink looking down at a 300 foot sheer drop to
       a gorge below!

       Indiana swings Willie onto a narrow ledge on one side and pushes
       Short Round after her -- he jumps himself to the other side just
       as the tidal wave crashes past them!

       The water bursts out of the tunnel -- the gusher spews forth from
       the cliffside into the air as if Hoover Dam just broke lose!

       Short Round and Willie balance on the narrow ledge on one side of
       the geyser -- Indy is perches on the ledge on the other side of
       the incredible eruption of water.

       Willie gets vertigo looking down into the gorge where the water
       crashes at the bottom.  There crocodiles are disturbed and
       slither angrily.

       Indy looks up and sees a rope bridge swinging about twenty feet
       above Willie and Short Round.  Indy shouts across the blasting
       water --

                                   INDIANA
                       Willie -- the bridge!  Climb up
                       to the bridge!

       Willie looks frightened.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Nothing to it -- follow me!

       He edges along the narrow ledge toward the bridge and Willie
       follows him.  Once under the bridge, they start climbing up the
       rocks to it.

       Meanwhile, Indiana is scaling the cliff face to get over the
       water geyser to the other side.  He grabs at scrub brush and
       finds a few perilous footholds as he makes his way to the bridge.

172.   EXT.  THE ROPE BRIDGE                                          172.

       Willie and Short Round pull themselves up at the end of the
       bridge.  Behind them a dark tunnel runs back into the mines.
       What's in front of them is hardly more reassuring --

       The rope bridge across the gorge is a century old and defintely
       wasn't built by army engineers.  Laying across the two bottom
       rope-spans, worm-eaten and moldy boards offer risky footings.

       Vertical side ropes connect the bottom rope-spans to the two up-
       per ropes that constitute the dangerous hand-railings.

       Short Round steps tentatively out onto the bridge.  It holds him
       and he turns and smiles at Willie --

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Easy like pie!  Kid's stuff!

       Suddenly the board under him breaks! Willie grabs Short Round
       before he falls into the abyss!  Looking pale and less cocky,
       Short Round starts out again and Willie follows his carefully.

       They continue stepping across the bridge cautiously, a feat made
       more difficult by the bridge's constant swaying and the hear-
       stopping up and down movement.

       Behind them, Indy finally pulls himself up from under the bridge.
       He stands up and sees Willie and Short Round halfway across
       already.  Then he hears something and turns quickly -- he takes
       his whip out and ducks to the side of the tunnel as two Thuggee
       guards rush out.

       Indy cracks the whip, catching the first guard around the neck --
       the guard spills forward and trips the second guard.  The first
       man tries to stand but Indiana kicks him in the head.

       The second guard gets to his feet and seings his sword -- Indy
       ducks, slams him in the stomach and dives for the first guard's
       sword.  He grabs it and rolls aside quickly as the second gaurd
       attempts to slice him in two!

       Indy gets to his feet and immediately finds himself about to en-
       gage in a sword duel with the enraged Thuggee guard.  Indy looks
       at the unfamiliar sword, hefts it, and tries to quickly decide
       the best way to use it --

       Suddenly the guard shouts and charges.  Indy decides shouting
       must be the "de rigueur" technique and shouts back loudly -- the
       two swords CLANG and spark as the duel erupts.

       Indy flails and feints and the Thuggee guard lunges and slashes.
       Indy finally gains the upper hand and dispatches the Thuggee
       guard who slumps defeated into the dirt.

       Keeping the sword, Indy starts out onto the bridge, walking as
       quickly as possible across the rickety span.  He hears shouting
       ahead and looks worried then temple guards appear at the far end
       of the bridge.

       The guards suprise Willie and Shorty as they finally get across
       the bridge.  Struggling   futilely with the guards, Willie shouts
       at Indiana --

                                   WILLIE
                       Indy -- looks out behind you!

       Indy sees more Thuggee guards rushing out of the tunnel behind
       him.  He turns and sees two of the tmeple guards who captured
       Willie and Short Round coming across the bridge in front of him.

       Indy stands helpless in the middle of the swaying bridge with
       guards approaching from both sides, and nothing but heaven above
       and the rocky gorge hundreds of feet below!

       A wind comes up and the High Priest, Mola Ram, appears on the far
       end of the bridge.  He stands with the guards who hold Willie and
       Short Round.

       The wind whips around Indy and he staggers unsteadily on the
       swaying bridge as he watches Mola Ram --

                                   INDIANA
                       Let my friends go!

       Mola Ram shouts in Hindi and the guards start to move toward Indy
       from both sides of the bridge.

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       That's far enough!

                                   MOLA RAM
                       You are in no position to give
                       orders, Dr. Jones.

       Indiana indicates the bag over his shoulder --

                                   INDIANA
                       You want the stones, let them go
                       and call off your guards!

       Mola Ram motions and the guards move farther out on both sides of
       the bridge -- suddenly Indiana swings the sword and it cuts into
       one of the bottom rope-spans!

       The rope is half-severed and frays slowly under the tension!

                                   MOLA RAM
                       Impressive, Dr. Jones. But I
                       don't believe you would kill
                       yourself!

       Mola Ram motions again the his guards (looking more nervous now)
       step farther out onto the bridge, mvoing closer to Indy from both
       sides.

       Indy swings the sword again, cutting into the other rope-span!
       It, too, is now partially severed and frays slowly.  The bridge
       jolts and Indy and the guards sway precariously!

       Suddenly Mola Ram shoves Short Round out onto the bridge.  The
       High Priest draws a dagger and pushes Willie onto the swaying
       span, holding the knife behind them both.

                                   MOLA RAM (Cont'd)
                       Your friends will die with you!

       In different times this would be called a Mexican stand-off
       Indiana looks at the guards in front and behind him.  He sees
       Willie and Short Round out on the bridge now with Mola Ram at
       their backs.

                                   INDIANA
                       Then I guess we're all going to
                       take a big dive!

       Indy and Short Round's eyes meet -- and the kid realizes that his
       hero isn't kidding.  Willie looks at Shout Round anxiously -- she
       notices that Shorty is surreptitiously wrapping his foot around a
       rope support.

       Petrified, Willie also secretly wraps her foot around a rope and
       does likewise with her arm --

                                   MOLA RAM
                       Give me the stones!

                                   INDIANA
                       Mola Ram -- you're about to meet
                       Kali -- in Hell!

       Indiana swings the sword with all his might -- it whooshes
       through the air and slashes clear through the top and bottom
       ropes --!

       Immediately Mola Ram's guards start to flee in panic -- too late!
       Indiana swings the sword again and the two ropes on the other
       side are severed --

       The rope bridge is sheared in two!  It breaks in the middle and
       both halves fall apart!  The guards scream horribly in the air as
       they plunge down into the rocky gorge!

       Willie and Short Round cling to their established footholds and
       fall with the bridge toward the wall of the gorge.  Mola Ram
       spills forward, clutching desperately at the ropes and slats --

       Below them, Indiana has latched onto a rope and swings with the
       bridge as it hits the gorge wall and hangs vertically now, dang-
       ling from its moorings at the top.

       There's an instant of suspended animation as all who remain alive
       realize they are alive.  Short Round and Willie cling near the
       top of the now vertical bridge.

       Below them, Mola Ram clutches onto one of the main ropes while
       directly above him the last of his guards holds on for dear life.

       Short Round and Willie struggle upwards, clutching ropes and
       stepping on slats.  Finally, Short Round heaves himself up onto
       solid ground and turns to help Willie up.

       Meanwhile, dangling below on the bridge, Indy reaches up and
       grabs Mola Ram's leg.  The High Priest kicks and tries to break
       Indy's grip.  He kicks again and smashes Indy in the face.

       Indy won't let go.  Suddenly the High Priest reaches up and grabs
       his own Thuggee guard and yanks his down by the front of his
       shirt --

       Mola Ram shoves the luckless guard down onto Indy, trying to
       dislodge him by sacrificing the screaming Thuggee.  Indy manages
       to hang on.  The Thuggee is less fortunate and falls screaming to
       his death.

       Then Mola Ram looks across the gorge and yells.  Indy sees a dozen
       of the last Thuggee guards streaming out of the tunnel -- only
       to be stranded on the far side of the now bridgeless gorge.

       Indy starts climbing up after Mola Ram again.  He grabs at the
       back of Mola Ram's robe and pull him down.  Slipping, Mola Ram
       turns and it's Indy's chance to punch Mola Ram in the face.

       Mola Ram's eyes are glowing yellow and he's shouting incoherent-
       ly.  He grabs the strap of Indy's shoulder bag and stamps on In-
       dy's hand -- Indy falls!

       Indiana slips downward, scrambling to catch hols of something --
       meanwhile, Mola Ram now has the bag with the Sankara Stones.

       Indy finally stops his downward slide and dangles dangerously
       near the bottom of the bridge.

       Across the gorge, the Thuggee guards run up a path to a small
       gove of trees growing on a plateau above the gorge.  The guards
       have bows and arrows and take firing positions --

       At the top of the bridge, Mola Ram keeps climbing until rocks
       start poundinghim from above -- Willie and Short Round pely him
       with rocks which he tries to block with his arm.

       Indiana starts to climb again, using all his strength.  He
       reaches for a wooden slat -- suddenly a flaming arrow smashes
       into the wood!

       Indy turns in amazement and sees more flaming arrows rocketing
       across the chasm directy for him!

       Across the gorge, by the grove of trees, a Thuggee priest yells
       orders to the archers who continue to launch the flaming arrows.

       Indiana crawls up as the bridge starts to burn from the continu-
       ing bursts of fiery arrows.  At the top, Mola Ram reaches up des-
       perately for a hand old -- Willie smashes his hand with a rock!

       The High Priest yells in pain and slips down to where Indy slugs
       him again in the face!  They struggle as the fire burns up from
       beneath them.

       On the cliff above the fallen bridge, Willie watches the fire
       rising toward Indy and Mola Ram as they fight.  Short Round turns
       and sees something --

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Willie, look!

       They see horses galloping through a narrow pass -- the British
       cavalry is returning.  Captain Blumburtt and the first troops draw
       up their forses and dismount quickly.

       A fussilade of flaming arrows force the British to take cover --
       they quickly start firing back at the Thuggees with rifles.

       As the battle above the gorge continues, Indy and Mola Ram fight
       below on the dangling bridge --

       Indiana sees the High Priest's eyes begin glowing and he hisses
       insanely.  Mola Ram's hand thrusts out toward Indiana's chest and
       Indy yells in pain --

       Indy looks down and writhes terrified as he sees Mola Ram's hand
       starting to enter his chest (as it entered the victim's chest
       during the temple sacrifice)!

       Mola Ram's finger are inching into Indy's body --  Indy clutches
       at Mola Ram's piercing hand, trying to keep the deadly fingers
       away from his heart.

       Slowly, Indy is able to push Mola Ram's hand away and his fingers
       withdraw from Indy's chest.  Indiana suddenly slugs the High
       Priest in the face and grabs for the bag of Sankara Stones --

                                   MOLA RAM
                       No, the stones are mine!

                                   INDIANA
                       You're betrayed Shiva. *(He re-
                       peats in Sanskrit Sankara's warn-
                       ing)

       As Indy pronounces the magical words, the bag begins glowing and
       starts to burn Mola Ram as he clutches it -- the stones begin to
       spill out of the bag and the High Priest grabs from them.

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       *(He repeats Sankara's warning
                        in Sanskrit)

       The blazing stones sear Mola Ram's flesh and he screams in pain.
       The light suddenly dies in his eyes and for one instant he looks
       at Indy as if awakened from a nightmare --

       Mola Ram loses his balance and Indy grabs for the stones.  He
       manages to clutch only one of them as Mola Ram screams and falls!

       Indy sees the stone in his hand suddenly cool.  He watches Mola
       Ram plummeting downward into the chasm and finally crashing into
       the jagged rocks at the bottom.

       The irritated crocodiles are disturbed once more -- but soon wel-
       come the meal that just dropped in.  Jaws flash and teeth rip at
       the High Priest's likeless corpse.

       And Indy's bag with the Sankara Stones sinks into the murkly cur-
       rent and disappears down the river ...

173.   EXT.  THE CLIFF                                                173.

       Indiana crawls up the burning bridge and Willie and Short Round
       reach for him at the top.  They pull him up onto the cliff and
       they all look around exhausted --

       Across the gorge, more British troops emerge from the mine tun-
       nels to subdue the remaining Thuggee guards on that side.

       Finally the little Maharajah comes out of the dark mine tunnel.
       He sees Short Round across the gorge -- and bows to thank him for
       his help.  On the other side, Short Round waves his cap, saluting
       him back.

       Willie stands at the edge of the gorge looking down into the riv-
       er far below.

                                   WILLIE
                       I guess Mola Ram got what he
                       wanted.

                                   INDIANA
                       Not quite.

       She sees Indy reach into his pocket.  He pulls something out
       slowly -- as she watches he reveals a crystal stone --

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       The last Sankara Stone.

       Short Round watches Willie take it carefully from Indiana.  She
       gazes at it and looks delighted --

                                   WILLIE
                       And the diamond hidden inside...

       Willie holds the stone up to the sun and it sparkles and flashes

                                                               CUT TO

174.   EXT.  THE MAYAPORE HILLS - DAY                                 174.

       The sun flares and silhouettes three figures coming over a
       hilltop.  Behinf them we see more smaller silhouettes appearing
       over the rise.

       Indiana, Willie and Short Round walk back down the dirt road into
       Mayapore -- followed by a multitude of children returning to
       their homeland.

       Willie looks at the changed landscape and seems astonished:  the
       barren countryside has been reborn.  They see streams flowing
       beneath green trees, flowers blooming and peasants harvesting
       golden grain in the fields.

175.   EXT.  MAYAPORE VILLAGE                                         175.

       Indiana, Willie and Short Round lead the children down the
       village road.   Ahead they see villagers rebuilding their primi-
       tive dwellings.

       Now they hear shouts of joy from the peasants.  The children
       returning home start running to meet their parents who are rush-
       ing out to greet them.

       There is laughter and tears as families are reunited.  Indiana
       sees the old shaman approaching with the chieftain and the
       village elders.

       The shaman touches his fingers to his forehead and bows.  The
       three travelers return his greeting and the shaman is quite moved
       as he speaks to Indiana --

                                   SHAMAN
                       We know you are coming back --
                                (indicating the
                                 countryside)
                       -- when life returns to our village.

                                   WILLIE
                       It's a real miracle.

                                   SHAMAN
                       Now you see the magic of the
                       "rock" you bring back.

       The old shaman smiles wisely at Indiana.  Indy takes the stone
       out of his bag and unwraps it.

                                   INDIANA
                       Yes, I've seen its power

       Willie watches the shaman take it reverently and bow to them.
       The shaman joins the elders and they walk to the village's small
       sacred mound.  Indy and Willie stay back.  They see him kneel and
       replace the stone in its niche.

                                   INDIANA
                       The last Sankara Stone.

                                   WILLIE
                       And they don't even know what
                       it really is.

                                   INDIANA
                                (smiling at her)
                       Well, you didn't get your prince,
                       and there goes your diamond.

                                   WILLIE
                       You didn't do so well yourself.
                       Finding that stone could've got-
                       ten you all the fortune and
                       glory you were talking about.

                                   INDIANA
                       It's still a long way to Delhi.
                       Who knows what might happen.

       She looks at him like he's crazy.

                                   WILLIE
                       Oh no, I'm finding a native guide
                       who knows the way.  No more de- 
                       tours for me, thank you Dr. Jones.

       She turns and starts walking away continuing to complain --

                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)
                       If you think I'm going to Delhi
                       or anyplace else with you, after
                       all the trouble you've gotten me
                       into...

       Suddenly the bullwhip CRACKS and wraps around her waist.  Star-
       tled Willie looks angry as Indiana reels her in, pulling her to-
       ward him and into his arms.  But when he finally kisses her, she
       doesn't seem to mind at all...

       Short Round shakes his head, but looks sort of pleased.  When he
       turns away, his face lights up!

       Short Round runs toward the sunset, toward the three elephants
       being brought back to the village.  The baby elephant starts
       walking faster, as if he recognizes Short Round running out to
       meet him...

          EXT - DAIRY FARM- DAY
          The modest dairy farm in the countryside of Nancy, France (what the
          French call cow country).
          We Read a SUBTITLE in the sky above the farm house;

          CHAPTER ONE

          "ONCE UPON A TIME IN...

          NAZI OCCUPIED FRANCE"
          This SUBTITLE disappears, and is replaced by another one;

          "1941
          One year into the German
          occupation of France".
          The farm consists of a house, small barn, and twelve cows spread
          about.
          The owner of the property, a bull of a man FRENCH FARMER, brings a axe
          up and down on A tree stump blemishing his property. However simply by
          sight, you'd never know if he's been beating at this stump for the last
          year, or just started today.

          JULIE
          One of his three pretty teenage daughters, is hanging up laundry on
          the clothes line. As she hangs up a white bed sheet, she hears a
          noise, moving the sheet aside she see's;

          JULIE'S POV:
          A Nazi town car convertible, with two little nazi flags attached to
          the hood, a NAZI SOLDIER behind the wheel, a NAZI OFFICER alone in the
          back seat, following TWO OTHER NAZI SOLDIERS on motorcycles, coming up
          over the hill on the country road leading to their farm.

          JULIE
          Pappa.
          The French Farmer sinks his axe in the stump, looks over his shoulder,
          and see's the Germans approaching.
          The FARMERS WIFE, CHARLOTTE comes to the doorway of their home,
          followed by her TWO OTHER TEENAGE DAUGHTERS, and see the Germans
          approaching.
          The Farmer yells to his family in FRENCH, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH;

          FARMER
          Go back inside and shut the door.

          

          

          

          

          IL

          FARMER
          (to Julie)
          Julie, get me some water from the pump
          to wash up with, then get inside with
          your mother.
          The young lady runs to the water pump by the house. She picks up a
          basin, and begins pumping, after a few pumps, water comes out
          splashing into the basin.
          The French Farmer sits down on the stump he was previously chopping
          away at, pulls a handkerchief from his pocket, wipes sweat from off
          his face, and waits for the Nazi convoy to arrive. After living for
          a year with the sword of Damocles suspended over his head, this may
          very well be the end.
          Julie finishes filling the water basin, and places it on the window
          sill.

          JULIE
          Ready Pappa.

          FARMER
          Thank you darling, now go inside and
          take care of your mother. Don't run.
          Julie walks inside the farm house and closes the door behind her.
          As her father stands up from his stump, and moves over to the window
          sill with the water basin...
          .The SOUND of the ENGINES of the two motorcycles and car get LOUDER.
          The Farmer SPLASHES water from the basin on his face and down his
          front. He takes a towel off a nail, and wipes the excess water from
          his face and chest, as he watches the two motorcycles, the one
          automobile, and the four representatives of the National Socialist
          Party come to a halt on his property.
          We don't move into them, but keep observing them from a distance, like
          the Farmer.
          The TWO NAZI MOTORCYCLIST are off their bikes, and standing at
          attention next to them.
          The NAZI DRIVER has walked around the automobile, and opened the door
          for his superior.
          The NAZI OFFICER says to The Driver in UNSUBTITLED GERMAN;

          NAZI OFFICER
          This is the property of Perrier LaPadite?

          

          

          

          

          3

          NAZI DRIVER
          Yes heer Colonel.
          The Nazi officer climbs out of the back the vehicle, carrying
          in his left hand
           n d

          OFFICER
          Herman, until I summon you, I am to be
          left alone.

          NAZI DRIVER
          As you wish Heer Col.
          The S.S. COLONEL yells to The Farmer in FRENCH, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH;

          NAZI OFFICER
          Is this the property of Perrier LaPadite?

          FARMER
          I am Perrier LaPadite.
          The S.S. Colonel crosses the distance between them with long strides,
          and says in French with a smile on his face;

          NAZI OFFICER
          It is a pleasure to meet you Monsieur
          LaPadite, I am Colonel Hans Landa of
          the S.S.
          COLONEL.HANS LANDA offers the French Farmer PERRIER LAPADITE his hand.
          The Frenchman takes the German hand in his and shakes it.

          PERRIER
          How may I help you?

          COL LANDA
          I was hoping you could invite me inside
          your home and we may have a discussion.

          INT - LAPADITE FARM HOUSE - DAY
          The door to the farm house swings open, andtheaFarmer gesturestfor
          the S.S. COL to enter. Removing his grey S.S. cap,
          inside the Frenchman's home.
          Col Landa is immediately greeted with the sight of the Farmers wife,
          and three pretty daughters standing together in the kitchen, smiling
          in his direction.
          The Farmer enters behind him, closing the door.

          

          

          

          

          VA

          PERRIER
          Colonel Landa, this is my family.
          The S.S. COL clicks his heels together, and takes the hand of the
          French Farmers Wife...

          COL LANDA
          Col Hans Landa of the S.S. madame,
          at your service.
          He kisses her hand, then continues without letting go of his hostess
          hand...

          COL LANDA
          please excuse my rude intrusion on your
          routine.

          FARMERS WIFE
          Don't be ridiculous, heer Col.
          While still holding the French Woman's hand, and looking into her
          eyes, The S.S. Colonel says;

          COL LANDA
          Monsieur LaPadite, the rumors I have
          heard in the village about your family
          are all true. Your wife is a beautiful
          woman.
          His eyes leave the mother, and move to the three daughters.

          COL.LANDA

          (CON' T )
          And each of your daughters is more lovely
          then the last.

          PERRIER
          Merci. Please have a seat.
          The Farmer offers The S.S. Colonel a seat at the families wooden
          dinner table. The Nazi officer excepts the French Farmers offer,
          and lowers himself into the chair. Placing his grey S.S. cap on
          the table, and keeping his black attache case on the floor by his
          feet.
          The Farmer (perfect host) turns to his Wife and says;

           PERRIER
          Charlotte, would you be so good as to get
          The Colonel some wine?

          

          

          

          

          COL LANDA
          Merci be coupe Monsieur LaPadite, but no
          wine. This being a dairy farm one would
          be safe in assuming you have milk?

          CHARLOTTE
          Oui.

          COL LANDA
          Then milk is what I prefer.

          CHARLOTTE
          Very Well.
          The mother of three, takes a craft of milk out of the ice box,
          and pours a tall glass of the fresh white liquid for The Colonel.
          The S.S. Colonel takes a long drink from the glass, then puts it down
          LOUDLY on the wooden table.

          COL LANDA
          Monsieur, to both your family, and your
          cows, I say; Bravo.

          PERRIER
          Merci.

          COL LANDA
          Please, join me at your
          table.

          PERRIER
          Very well.
          The French Farmer sit's at his wooden dinner table across from
          The Nazi.
          The Women remain standing.
          Col Landa leans forward, and says to the Farmer in a low tone of

          CONFIDENTIALLY;

          COL LANDA
          Monsieur LaPadite, what we have to
          discuss,' would be better discussed in
          private. You'll notice, I left my men
          outdoors- if it wouldn't offend them,
          could you ask your lovely ladies to step
          outside.

          PERRIER
          You are right.

          

          

          

          

          G.

          PERRIER
          (to his women)
          Charlotte, would you take the girls
          outside. The Colonel and I need to have
          a few words.
          The Farmers wife follows her husbands orders, and gathers her
          daughter's taking them outside, closing the door behind them.
          The Two Men are alone, at the farmers dinner table, in the Farmers
          humble home.

          COL LANDA
          Monsieur LaPadite, I regret to inform
          you I've exhausted the extent of my
          French. To continue to speak it so
          inadequately, would only serve to
          embarrass me. However, I've been lead
          to believe you speak English quite well?

          PERRIER
          Oui.

          COL LANDA
          Well, it just so happens, I do as well.
          This being your house, I ask your
          permission to switch to English, for the
          remainder of the conversation?

          PERRIER
          By all means.
          They now speak ENGLISH;

          COL LANDA
          Monsieur LaPadite, while I'm very
          familiar with you, and your family.
          I have no way of knowing if you are
          familiar with who I am. Are you aware
          of my existence?
          The Farmer answers;

          PERRIER
          Yes.

          COL LANDA
          This is good. Are you aware of the job
          I've been ordered to carry out in France?

          

          

          

          

          I

          PERRIER
          Yes.
          The Colonel drinks more milk.

          COL LANDA
          Please tell me what you've heard?

          PERRIER
          I've heard, the fuhrer has put you in
          charge of rounding up the Jews left in
          France who are ether hiding, or passing
          for Gentile.
          The S.S.Colonel smiles.

          COL LANDA
          The Fuhrer couldn't of said it better
          himself.

          PERRIER
          But the meaning of your visit, pleasant
          though it is, is mysterious to me.
          The Germans looked through my house nine
          months ago for hiding Jews, and found
          nothing.

          COL LANDA
          I'm aware of that, I read the report on
          this area. But like any enterprise,
          when under new management, there's
          always a slight duplication of efforts.
          Most of it being a complete waste of time,
          but needs to be done nevertheless.
          I just have A few questions Monsieur
          LaPadite, if you can assist me with
          answers, my department can close the
          file on your family.
          Taking his black leather attache case, and placing it on the table, he
          takes out a folder from inside. He also extracts a expensive black
          fountain pen from his uniform front pocket. Opening the folder, and
          referring to it;

          COL LANDA
          Now before the occupation there were
          four Jewish families in this area, all
          dairy farmers like yourself.
          The Loveitts, The Doleracs, The Rollins,
          and The Dreyfus's, is that correct?

          

          

          

          

          8,

          PERRIER
          To my knowledge those were the Jewish
          families among the dairy farmers.
          - Heer Colonel, would it disturb you if
          I smoked my pipe?
          Looking up from his papers.

          COL LANDA
          Please, Monsieur LaPadite, it is your
          house, make yourself comfortable.
          The Farmer gets up from the table, goes to his shelf over the
          fireplace, and removes from it a WOODEN BOX that contains all the
          fixins to his pipe. He sits back down at the table with his Nazi
          guest.
          As The Farmer loads the bowel of his pipe with tobacco, sets a match
          to it, and begins slowly puffing, making it red hot, the S.S. Colonel
          studies the papers in front of him.

          COL LANDA
          Now according to these papers, all
          the Jewish families in this area have
          been accounted for - except, The Dreyfusis.
          Somewhere in the last year it would appear
          they have vanished.
          Which leads me to the conclusion that
          they've ether made good their escape,
          or someone is very successfully hiding
          them.
          (looking up from
          his papers, across
          the table at The

          FARMER)
          What have you heard about The Dreyfusis
          Monsieur LaPadite?

          PERRIER
          Only rumors -

          COL LANDA
          - I love rumors! Facts can be so
          misleading, where rumors, true or false
          are often reveling. So Monsieur LaPadite,
          what rumors have you heard regarding
          The Dreyfusis?
          The Farmerlooks at Landa.

          

          

          

          

          I.

          COL LANDA
          Speak freely Monsieur LaPadite, I want
          to hear what the rumors are, not who told
          them to you.
          The Farmer puffs thoughtfully on his pipe.

          PERRIER
          Again, this is just a rumor - but we
          heard the Dreyfusis had made there way
          into Spain.

          COL LANDA
          So the rumors you've heard have been of
          escape?

          PERRIER
          Yes.

          COL LANDA
          Were the LaPadites and the Dreyfusis
          friendly?
          As the Farmer answers this question, the CAMERA LOWERS behind his
          chair, to the floor, past the floor, to a small area underneath the
          floorboards revealing;

          FIVE HUMAN BEINGS
          lying vertically underneath the farmers floorboards. These human
          beings are The DREYFUSIS, who have lived lying down underneath the
          dairy farmers house for the past year. But one couldn't call what The
          Dreyfusis have done for the last year living. This family has done the
          only thing they could, hidden from a occupying army that wishes to
          exterminate them.

          PERRIER
          We were families in the same community,
          in the same bussiness. I wouldn't say
          we were friends, but members of the same
          community, we had common interest.
          The S.S. Colonel takes in this answer, seems to except it, then moves
          to the next question.

          COL LANDA
          Having never met the Dreyfusis, would
          you confirm for me the exact members of
          the household and their names?

          

          

          

          

          10.

          PERRIER
          There were five of them.
          The father, Jacob... .wife, Miram...
          her brother, Bob ...

          COL LANDA
          - How old is Bob?

          PERRIER
          Thirty - thirty one?

          COL LANDA
          Continue.

          PERRIER
          And the children... Amos... and Shoshanna.

          COL LANDA
          Ages of the children?

          PERRIER
          Amos - six - I believe. And Shosanna,
          was fifteen or sixteen, I'm not really
          sure.

          CUT TO

          UXT - DAIRY FARM - DAY
          The Mother and her three Daughters finish taking the laundry off the
          clothes line.
          They can't hear anything going on inside.
          e three Nazi Soldiers watch the three Daughters.

          SACK TO LANDA AND PERRIER

          COL LANDA
          Well I guess that should do it.
          Be begins gathering up his papers, and putting them back into his
           ttache case.
          the Farmer, cool as a cucumber, puffs on his pipe.

          COL LANDA
          However, before I go, could I have another
          glass of your delicious milk?

          

          

          

          
          it.

          PERRIER
          But of course.
          Farmer stands up, goes over to the ice box, and takes out the
          aft of milk. As he walks over and fills the Nazi Colonel's glass,
          German Officer talks.

          COL LANDA
          Monsieur LaPadite, are you aware of the
          nickname the people of France have given
          me?

          PERRIER
          I have no interest in such things.

          COL LANDA
          But you are aware of what they call me?

          PERRIER
          I'm aware.

          COL LANDA
          What are you aware of?

          PERRIER
          That they call you, "The Jew Hunter".

          COL LANDA
          Precisely! Now I understand your
          trepidation in repeating it.
          Before he was assassinated, Heydrich
          apparently hated the moniker the good
          people of Prague bestowed on him.
          Actually why he would hate the name,
          "The Hangman", is baffling to me
          It would appear he did everything in
          his power to earn it. But I, on the
          other hand, love my unofficial title,
          precisely because I've earned it.
          As "The Jew Hunter" enjoys his fresh milk, he continues to theorize
          with the french farmer.

          COL LANDA
          The feature that makes me such a effective
          hunter of the Jews, is, as opposed to most
          German soldiers, I can think like a jew.
          where they can only think like a German,
          or more precisely, a German soldier.
          Now if one were to determine what attribute
          the German people share with a beast, it
          would be the cunning and predatory instinct
          of a hawk.

          

          

          

          

          COL LANDA

          (CON'T)
          Negro's - gorilla's - brain - lips -
          smell - physical strength - penis size.
          But, if one were to determine what attributes
          the jews share with a beast, it would be
          that of the rat.
          Now the Fuhrer and Gobbles propaganda
          have said pretty much the same thing.
          Where our conclusions differ, is I don't
          consider the comparison a insult.
          Consider for a moment, the world a rat
          lives in. It's a hostile world indeed.
          If a rat were to scamper through your
          front door right now, would you greet it
          with hostility?

          PERRIER
          I suppose I would.

          COL LANDA
          Has a rat ever done anything to you to
          create this animosity you feel toward
          them?

          PERRIER
          Rat's spread disease, they bite people -

          COL LANDA
          - Unless some fool is stupid enough to
          try and handle a live one, rats don't
          make it a practise of biting human beings.
          Rats were the cause of the bubonic plague,
          but that was some time ago. In all your
          born days, has a rat ever caused you to
          be sick a day in your life? I purpose to
          you, any disease a rat could spread,
          a squirrel could equally carry.
          Yet I assume you don't share the same
          animosity with squirrels that you do with
          rats, do you?

          PERRIER
          No.

          COL LANDA
          Yet, they are both rodent's, are they
          not? And except for the fact that one
          has a big bushy tail, while the other
          has a long repugnt tail of rodent skin,
          they even rather look alike, don't they?

          

          

          

          

          13.6

          PERRIER
          It is a interesting thought,
          beer Colonel.

          COL LANDA
          However, interesting as the thought may
          be, it makes not one bit of difference
          to how you feel. If a rat were to scamper
          through your door, this very minute,
          would you offer it a saucer of your
          delicious milk?

          PERRIER
          Probably not.

          COL LANDA
          I didn't think so. You don't like them.
          You don't really know why you don't like
          them. All you know is, you find them
          repulsive.
          (let's the

          METAPHOR
          sink in)
          What a tremendously hostile world a rat
          must endure. Yet, not only does he
          survive, he thrives. And the reason for
          this, is because our little foe has a
          instinct for survival and presavation
          second to none. And that Monsieur, is
          what a jew shares with a rat.
          Consequently, a German soldier, conducts
          a search of a house suspected of hiding
          jews. Where does the hawk look? He looks
          in the barn, he looks in the attic,
          he looks in the cellar - he looks
          everywhere, he would hide. But there are
          many places it would never occur to a
          hawk to hide. However the reason the
          Fuhrer brought me off my Alps in Austria,
          and placed me in French cow country today,
          is because it does occur to me. Because
          I'm aware what tremendous feats human
          beings are capable of once they abandon
          dignity.
          (Changing tone)
          May I smoke my pipe as well?
          Th e Farmer's cool facade is little by little eroding.

          PERRIER
          Please, Cononel, make yourself at home.

          

          

          

          

          13.
          The Jew Hunter, removes both a pipe and a bag of tobacco fixings.
          The pipe, strangely enough, is a Calabash, made from a "S" shaped goard
          kith a yellow skin, made famous by Sherlock Holmes.
          A the Nazi Colonel, busies himself with his smoking life, he
          ontinues to hold court at the Frenchmans table.

          COL LANDA
          The other mistake the German soldier
          make is their severe handling of the
          citizens who give shelter and aid to
          the Jews. These citizens are not enemies
          of the state. They are simply confused
          people, trying to make some sense out of
          the madness war creates.
          These citizens do not need punishing.
          They simply need to be reminded of their
          duty in war time.
          Let's use you as a example Monsieur
          LaPadite. In this war, you have found
          yourself in the middle of a conflict
          that has nothing to do with yourself,
          your lovely ladies, or your cows - yet,
          here you are.
          So Monsieur LaPadite, let me purpose
          a question. In this time of war, what is
          your number one duty? Is it to fight the
          Germans in the name of France to your
          last breath? Or, is it to harass the
          occupying army to the best of your
          ability? Or, is it to protect the poor
          unfortunate victims of warfare who can
          not protect themselfs?
          Or, is your number one duty in this time
          of bloodshed, to protect those very
          beautiful women who constitute your
          family?
          The Colonel lets the last statement stand.

          COL LANDA
          That was a question Monsieur LaPadite.
          In this time of war, What do you consider
          your number one duty?

          PERRIER
          To protect my family.

          COL LANDA
          Now, my job dictates, that I must have
          my men enter your home, and conduct a
          thorough search, before I can officially
          cross your families name off my list.

          

          

          

          

          COL LANDA

          (CON'T)
          And if there are any irregularities to be
          found, rest assured, they will be.
          That is unless, you have something to tell
          me that will make the conducting of a
          search unnecessary.

          (PAUSE)
          I might add also, that any information
          that makes the preforming of My duty
          easier, will not be met with punishment.
          Actually quite the contrary, it will be
          met with reward.
          And that reward will be, your family
          will cease to be harassed in anyway,
          by the German military during the rest
          of our occupation of your country.
          The Farmer, pipe in mouth, stares across the table at his German
          opponent.

          COL LANDA
          You are sheltering enemies of the state,
          are you not?

          PERRIER
          Yes.

          COL LANDA
          Your sheltering them underneath your
          floorboards aren't you?

          PERRIER
          Yes.

          COL LANDA
          Point out to me the area's where their
          hiding.
          The Farmer points out the area's on the floor with the Dreyfusis are
          underneath.

          COL LANDA
          Since I haven't heard any disturbance,
          I assume that while their listening,
          they don't speak english?

          PERRIER
          Yes .

          COL LANDA
          I'm going to switch back to french now,
          and I want you to follow my masquerade
          - is that clear?

          

          

          

          

          PERRIER
          Yes.
          Colonel Landa stands up from the table, and switching to FRENCH says

          SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH;

          COL LANDA
          Monsieur LaPadite, I thank you for milk,
          and your hospitably. I do believe our
          business here is done.
          The Nazi Officer opens the front door, and silently motions for his
          son to approach the house.

          COL LANDA
          Mademoiselle LaPadite, I thank you for
          your time, we shant be bothering your
          family any longer.
          Yet the LaPadite women watch the Nazi soldiers, machine guns at ready,
          approach the house.
          The Soldiers enter the doorway, Col Landa, silently points out area of
          the floor the Jews are hiding under.

          COL LANDA
          So, Monsieur and Madame LaPadite
          I bid you adieu.
          otions to the Soldiers with his index finger.
          wy TEAR UP the wood floor with MACHINE GUN FIRE.
          The little farm house is filled with SMOKE, DUST, SPLINTERS, SCREAMS,

          Herman, I sense` a question on your lips?
          Out with it?

          DRIVER
          Why did yoy allow a enemy of the state
          to escape?

          COL LANDA
          Oh, I don't think the state is in too
          much danger, do you?

          DRIVER
          I suppose not.

          COL LANDA
          I'm glad you see it my way. Besides,
          not putting a bullet in the back of a
          fifteen year old girl, and allowing
          her to escape, our not nessessarlly
          the same thing. She's a young girl, no food,
          no shelter, no shoes, who's just witnessed
          the massacre of her entire family.
          She may not survive the night. And after
          word spreads about what happened today,
          it's highly unlikely she will find any
          willing farmers to extend her aid.
          If I had to guess her fate, I'd say she'll
          probably be turned in by some neighbour.
          Or, she'll be spotted by some German
          soldier. Or, we'll find her body in the
          woods, dead from starvation or exposure.
          Or, perhaps-she'll survive. She will
          elude capture. She will escape to America.
          She will move to New York city.
          Where she will be elected, President of
          the United States.
          The S.S. Colonel chuckles at his little funny.

          A bunch of SOLDIERS are lined up at attention.
          LIEUTENANT ALDO.RAINE, a hillbilly from the mountains of
          Tennessee, walks down the line. He recruits the men, the
          Germans will later call; "The Basterds". Lt.Aldo has one
          defining physical characteristic, a ROPE BURN around his
          neck. As if once upon a time,. he survived a LYNCHING.
          The scar will never once be mentioned.

          LT.ALDO
          My name is Lt.Aldo Raine, and I'm
          puttin together a special team.
          And I need me eight soldiers.
          Eight - Jewish - American - soldiers.
          Now y'all might of heard rumors
          about the armada happening soon.
          Well, we'll be leavin a little
          earlier. We're gonna be dropped
          into France, dressed as civilians.
          And once we're in enemy territory, as
          a bushwackin, guerrilla army, we're
          gonna be doin one thing, and thing
          only, Killin Nazi's.
          The Members of the National Socialist
          Party, have conquered Europe through
          murder, torture, intimidation, and
          terror. And that's exactly what we're
          gonna do to them. Now I don't know
          bout y'all? But I sure as hell, didnt
          come down from the goddamn Smoky
          mountains, cross five thousand miles
          of water, fight my way through half
          Sicily, and then jump out of a fuckin
          air-o-plane, to teach the Nazi's
          lessons in humanity. Nazi ain't got
          no humanity. There the foot soldiers
          of a Jew hatin, mass murderin manic,
          and they need to be destroyed.
          That's why any and every son-of-a--bitch
          we find wearin a Nazi uniform, there
          gonna die.

          We will be cruel to the Germans,
          and through our cruelty, they will
          know who we are. They will find the
          evidence of our cruelty, in the
          disembowed, dismembered, and
          disfigured bodies of their brothers
          we leave behind us. And the German
          will not be able to help themselves
          from imagining the cruelty their
          brothers endured at our hands, and
          our boot heels, and the edge of our
          knives.
          And the Germans, will be sickened by us.
          And the Germans, will talk about us.
          And the Germans, will fear us.
          And when the Germans close their eyes
          at night, and their sub conscious
          tortures them for the evil they've done,
          it will be with thoughts of us,
          that it tortures them with.
          He stops pacing, and looks at everybody.

          They all say;

          ALL
          Yes, sir!

          LT.ALDO
          That's what I like to hear. But I
          got a word of warning to all would-be
          warriors. When you join my command,
          you take on debit. A debit you owe
          me, personally. Every man under my
          command, owes me, one hundred nazi scalps.
          And I want my scalps.
          And all y'all will git me, one hundred
          Nazi scalps, taken from the heads of
          one hundred dead Nazi's...
          .or you will die trying.

          In a huge room, ADOLPH HITLER, pounds on a big table with

          They speak GERMAN SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;

          How much more of these jew swine
          must I endure? They butcher my men
          like they were fish bait! This pack
          of filthy degenerates, are doing what
          the Russian army didn't, and Patton's
          army couldn't. Turning soldiers of
          The Third Reich, into superstitious
          old women!

          GERMAN GENERAL
          Just the cowards among them mine

          Hitler pounds furiously on the desk with his fist.

          HITLER
          No, no, no, no, no, no! I have heard
          the rumors myself! Solders of The Third
          Reich, who have brought the world to
          there knee`s, now pecking and clucking
          like chickens. Do you know the latest
          rumor they've conjured up, in their fear
          induced delirium? The one that beats
          my boys with a bat. The one they call
          "The Bear Jew"...is a Golem.
          A avenging jew angel, conjured up by
          a vengeful rabbi, to smite the Aryans!

          GENERAL
          Mine Fuhrer, this is just soldiers
          gossip, no one really believes The
          Bear Jew is a golem.

          Why not? They seem to be able to elude

          They seem to be able to appear and
          disappear at will.

          wipe his greasy black hair out of his face.

          German soldiers stationed in France.
          The Jew degenerate known as The Bear
          Jew, hence forth, is never to be
          referred to as The Bear Jew again.
          We will cease to aid the Americans

          by Lt.Raines Jews. He was it's only
          survivor.

          FRAME, KNOCKS aside the dead German patriots helmet, and
          grabs a handful of the cadavers blonde hair. A LARGE KNIFE
          ENTERS FRAME, and begins SLICING ALONG THE HAIRLINE.
          This process is called SCALPING.
          After SLICING is complete, the SCALP easily peels off like a

          The Basterds, took their lives, their

          and finally their dignity in death.
          True that. The sight of the dead soldiers with bare feet
          does rob the tableaux of a certain dignity, that is normally
          felt in battlefield shots.

          PFC.HIRSCHBERG
          You! Go!
          Sgt.Rachtman is a little slow to respond. So Hirschberg
          grabs him by the hair, YANKS him to his feet, and KICKS him
          in the ass, sending him on his way.
          Most of The Bastreds sit in a circle, Indian style, with
          Aldo in the middle.
          As Sgt.Rachtman walks towards this circle of Basterds,
          A OFF SCREEN LITERARY NARRATOR (not Pvt.Butz) speaks over
          the SOUNDTRACK in ENGLISH;

          NARRATOR(VO)
          Sgt.Werner Rachtman has seen many
          interrogations since Germany decided
          it should rule Europe. But this is
          the first time he's ever been on the
          wrong end of the exchange.
          It's always been his belief, only a
          weakling, in mind, body, and spirt
          complies with the enemy under threat
          of consequence.
          As Werner watched men cry like women,
          pleadingly offer their knowledge, in
          exchange for their worthless lives,
          he made a vow to himself.
          If his role is to die in this conflict.
          When they put him under the earth, his
          dignity would be buried with him.
          For in the other world, the gods only
          respect the ones they test first.
          Well Sgt, this is your test.
          And the gods are watching.
          The captured German Sgt, enters the circle of Basterds,
          stands straight before the sitting southern Lieutenant, and
          salutes his captor.

          SGT.RACHTMAN

          (ENGLISH)
          Sgt.Werner Rachtman.
          Aldo returns the salute, looking up at him.

          LT.ALDO
          Lt.Aldo Raine, pleased to meet cha.
          You know what sit down means Werner?

          SGT.RACHTMAN
          Yes.

          LT.ALDO
          Then sit down.

          

          

          

          

          2.5.
          The German Sgt does.

          LT.ALDO
          Hows your English Werner? Cause if
          need be, we gotta a couple fellas
          can translate.
          Aldo points at one of The Basterds in the circle,

          CPL.WILHELM WICKI.

          LT.ALDO
          Wicki there, a Austrian Jew, got the
          fuck outta Saltzberg, while the
          gettin was good. Became American,
          got drafted, and came back to give
          y'all what for.
          Then Aldo points to another Basterd. A big scary looking
          Basterd, in a German Sgt's uniform, named, SGT.HUGO STIGLITZ

          LT.ALDO
          And another one over there, you
          might be familiar with, Sgt.Hugo
          Stiglitz. Heard of 'em.
          The two German Sgt's look at each other.

          SGT.RACHTMAN
          Everybody in the German army's heard
          of Hugo Stiglitz.
          The Basterds laugh, a couple pat Hugo on the back.
          The NARRATOR comes back on the SOUNDTRACK.

          NARRATOR(VO)
          The reason for Hugo Stiglitz's
          celebrity among German soldiers
          is simple.
          WE SEE A PHOTO OF HUGO on the front page of the Nazi version
          of Stars and Stripes (the military newspaper).

          NARRATOR(VO)
          As a German enlisted man, he killed
          thirteen Gestapo officers, mostly
          Majors.

          WE SEE THE MILITARY PHOTOS OF ALL THIRTEEN GESTAPO OFFICERS.

          NARRATOR(VO)
          Instead of putting him up against a
          wall, the High Command decided to
          send him back to Berlin, to be made
          a example of.
          Hugo in chains, being put in a lone troop truck, part of a
          prison convoy, enroute to Berlin.

          NARRATOR(VO)
          Needless to say, once The Basterds
          heard about him, he never got there.

          EXT- FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY
          The Basterds AMBUSH the prison convoy, killing everybody.
          They walk to the back of the troop truck, inside Hugo in
          chains, stares back at them.

          LT.ALDO
          Sgt.Hugo Stiglitz?
          Hugo nods.

          LT. ALDO
          I'm Lt.Aldo Raine, and these are
          The Basterds. Ever heard of us?
          Hugo nods his head, yes.

          LT.ALDO
          We just wanna say, we're a big fan
          of your work. When it comes to killin
          Nazi's, I think you show great talent,
          and I pride myself on havin a eye for
          that kind of talent. But your status
          as a Nazi killer, is still amateur.
          We all came here to see, if you wanna go pro?

          BACK TO THEBASTERD CIRCLE.

          LT.ALDO
          Now Werner, I'm gonna assume you know
          who we are?

          SGT.RACHTMAN
          Aldo the Apache.
          The circle of Basterds giggle.

          

          

          

          

          Z7.

          LT.ALDO
          Well Werner, if you heard of us, you
          probably heard, we ain't in the
          prisoner takin business. We in the
          killin Nazi business. And cousin,
          business is boomin.
          The Basterds laugh.

          LT. ALDO
          Now that leaves two ways we can play
          this out. Either kill ya, or let ya
          go. Now weather or not you gonna
          leave this circle alive, depends
          entirely on you.
          Aldo takes out a map of the area, and lays it out in front
          of his prisoner.

          LT.ALDO
          Up the road a piece, there's a
          orchard. 'sides you, we know there's
          another kraut patrol fuckin around
          here somewhere. Now if that patrol
          were to have any crackshots, that
          orchard, would be a goddamn snipers
          delight. Now if you ever wanna eat
          a sauerkraut sandwich again, you
          gotta show me on this map, where
          they are, you gotta tell me how many
          they are, and you gotta tell me,
          what kinda artillery they carrying
          with 'em?

          SGT.RACHTMAN
          You can't expect me to divulge
          information that would put German
          lives in danger?

          LT.ALDO
          well, Werner that's where your wrong.
          Because that's exactly what I expect.
          I need to know about Germans hidin
          in trees? And you need to tell me?
          And you need to tell me, right now?
          Now take your finger, and point out
          on this map, where this partys bein
          held, how manys comin, and what they
          brought to play with?
          Werner site, head held high, back straight, chin up, every
          inch the German hero facing death.

          

          

          

          

          2S.

          SGT.WERNER
          F I respectfully refuse, sir.
          Aldo jerks his thumb behind him.

          LT.ALDO
          You see that ole boy battin rocks?
          WE RACK FOCUS to a one of The Basterds not in the circle.
          He's wearing a wife beater, and power hitting stones
          with a baseball bat.
          Werners eyes go to the ballplayer.

          LT.ALDO
          That's Sgt.Donny Donowitz. But you
          might know him better by his nickname,
          The Bear Jew. Now if you heard of
          Aldo the Apache, you gotta heard about
          The Bear Jew?

          SGT.RACHTMAN
          I heard.

          LT.ALDO
          What did you hear?

          SGT.RACHTMAN
          He beats German soldiers with a club.

          LT.ALDO
          He bashes their brains in with a
          baseball bat, what he does.

          SGT.DONOWITZ
          back to us, still haven't seen his face. He Babe Ruths a
          rock soaring into the atmosphere.

          LT. ALDO
          Now Werner, I'm gonna ask you one
          last-goddamn-time, and if you still,
          "respectfully refuse", I'm callin The
          Bear Jew over here, and he's gonna take
          that big bat of his, and he's gonna
          beat your ass to death with it.
          Now take your wennersitnitzel lickin
          finger, and point out on this map
          what I want to know.

          SGT.RACHTMAN
          Fuck you and your jew dogs.

           Instead of getting mad, The Basterds burst out LAUGHING.
          I k
          Aldo says to Werner, with a giggle in his voice;

          LT.ALDO
          Actually Werner, we're all tickled
          ya said that. Frankly, watchin Donny
          beat Nazi's,to death, is the closest
          we ever get to goin to the movies.

          (YELLING)

          DONNY!

          SGT.DONOWITZ
          he turns to CAMERA, and yells;

          SGT.DONOWITZ
          Yeah?

          LT.ALDO
          Got a German here wants to die for

          Europe, and I'm suppose to fly to the

          If we just go in this against the Japs,

          HEAD
          You know they got a word for what your
          sayin Donny, it's called treason.

          DONNY
          Hey, stick your treason up your poop
          hole. If I'm gonna kill my fellow man
          in the name of liberty, that fellow
          man, will be German.

          INT - SPORTING GOODS STORE- DAY
          MR.GOOROWITZ'S sporting goods shop in Donny's Jewish Bostin
          neighbourhood. Donny walks in.

          MR.GOOROWITZ
          Hello Donny, how are you?

          DONNY
          Ah, just dandy, Mr.Goorowitz.

          MR.GOOROWITZ
          Your mother, your father - everything
          good there?

          DONNY
          There just fine. I'm shippin off next
          week.
          The store proprietor, extends his hand to the young man.

          MR.GOOROWITZ
          Good for you son. Kill one of those
          Nazi basterds for me, will ya?

          DONNY
          That's the idea, Mr.Goorowitz.

          MR.GOOROWITZ
          What can I do you for, Donny?

          DONNY
          I need a baseball bat.
          The store owner leads him to a basket with eight bats init.
          Donny starts going through them without saying anything.

          MR.GOOROWITZ
          You gettin your little brother a
          present before you ship out?
          Donny, concentrating on the bats, not looking up;

          DONNY
          No.
          Donny's "no", silences the gabby Goorowitz. He seems to
          settle on one, feeling it's weight in his hands.

          DONNY
          Can I try this one on for size, outside?

          

          

          

          

          31.
          Extending his arm;

          MR.GOOROWITZ
          Be my guest.
          The phone rings.

          MR.GOOROWITZ
          I'll get that, you go right ahead.
          The proprietor answers the phone, and gets into a
          conversation with his OFF SCREEN Mother.
          Donny walks outside, WE STAY IN STORE, but can see him
          clearly through the stores big picture window.
          However, Mr.Goorowitz instinctively, turns his back to Donny
          to speak with his mother.
          Donny starts swinging the bat. It's pretty obvious he's
          pantomiming beating somebody to death with it. Then the
          he starts yelling;

          DONNY
          Take that ya Nazi basterd! You like fuckin
          with the Jews? Wanna Fuck with the Jews?
          The American jews are gonna FUCK with
          you... ..!
          Mr.Goorowitz, see's none of this, as he speaks to his
          mother. He hangs up the phone, just as Donny walks back into
          the store. Store owner turns to store customer.

          DONNY
          Is this the heaviest ya got?

          Donny, dressed nice, in a apartment building in his Jewish
          Bastin neighbourhood. He knocks on a door.
          A VERY OLD JEWISH WOMAN opens the door, only a little,
          peering out at the young man.

          OLD WOMAN
          How can I help you?

          DONNY
          Mrs.Himmelstein?

          MRS.HIMMELSTEIN

          my father Sy Donowitz, owns the barber
          shop on Greeny Ave, "Sy's Barber Shop".

          MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
          I've seen it. Do you live in the
          neighbourhood?

          DONNY
          All my life.

          MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
          Again, state your business?

          DONNY
          May I have a word with you?

          MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
          What about?

          DONNY
          Our people in Europe.
          She thinks for a beat, then holds the door open for the
          young man.

          MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
          Come in. Would you like some tea?

          INT - MRS.HIMMELSTEIN'S APARTMENT - DAY
          Donny sits on a overstuffed sofa, holding a tea cup and
          saucer in his hand. Mrs.Himmelstein sits on a overstuffed
          chair, holding her tea, looking across at her visitor.

          DONNY
          (Sipping tea)
          Very good.

          MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
          If you like tea.
          Donny chuckles at her little joke. The old woman remains
          stone. She wasn't joking. He places his saucer on the coffee
          table and begins;

          DONNY
          Mrs.Himmelstein, do you have any love
          ones over in Europe who your concerned
          for?

          

          

          

          

          33.

          MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
          What compels you young man, to ask a
          stranger such a personal question?

          DONNY
          Because I'm going to Europe. And I'm
          gonna make it right.

          MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
          And just how do intend to do that, Joshua?

          DONNY

          MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
          And what exactly do you intend to do
          with that toy?

          DONNY
          I'm gonna beat every Nazi I find to
          death with it.

          MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
          I thought we were having tea together?

          MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
          And in this pursuit, how is it that I
          can be of service?

          DONNY
          I'm going through the neighbourhood.
          If you have any love ones in Europe,
          who's safety you fear for, I'd like
          you to write their name on my bat.

          BACK TO BASTERDS
          Donny takes a long walk to Werner...
          As WE CUT BACK and FORTH BETWEEN DONNY WALKING and WERNER
          WAITING, WE ALSO CUT BACK and FORTE BETWEEN DONNY and

          MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
          Good. A Basterds work is never done.
          Specially in Germany.
          Donny steps up to the plate, looking down at the Nazi;

          DONNY
          Gimmie your papers.
          Werner hands Donny up his papers.
          Donny RIPS the identity page out, and sticks it in his
          pocket.

          MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
          Hand me your sword Gideon. I do believe
          I will join you on this journey.

          Donny BEATS Werner TO DEATH WITH THE BAT, to the cheers of

          Aldo points a finger at Butzsr and crooks it toward him.

          That means you, cup cake.
          A crying, visibly shaken, Butz site down in front of Aldo.

          Yes, sir.

          LT.ALDO

          His arm shoots out like a rocket, and points out the
          positions.

          pointing north.

          HITLER
          How did you survived this ordel?
          WE SEE Pvt.Butz in The Fuhrer's room for the first time.
          He wears a Nazi cap, which is unusual in the presence of The
          Fuhrer, but he seems okay with it.

          PRVT.BUTZ
          They let me go.

          FROM HERE ON WE GO BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN ALDO AND HITLER.

          LT.ALDO
          Now when you report what happened here,
          you can't tell 'em, you told us, what you
          told us. They'll shoot ya. But there gonna
          wanna know, why you so special, we let you
          live? So tell 'em, we let ya live, so you
          could spread the word through the ranks,
          what's gonna happen to every Nazi we find.

          HITLER
          You are not to tell anybody anything!
          Not one word of detail! Your outfit
          was ambushed, and you got a away.
          Not one word more.

          PVT.BUTZ
          Yes mine Fuhrer.

          HITLER
          Did they mark you like they did the
          other survivors?

          PVT.BUTZ
          Yes mine Fuhrer.

          HITLER
          Remove your hat and show me.

          LT.ALDO
          Now say we let ya go, and say you
          survive the'war? When you get back
          home, what'eha gonna do?

          PVT.BUTZ
          I will hug my mother like I've never
          hugged her before.

          LT.ALDO
          Well, ain't that's a real nice boy. Are you
          going to take off your uniform?

          PVT.BUTZ
          Not only shall I remove it, but I intend
          to burn it!
          The young German is telling Aldo, what he thinks, Aldo wants
          to hear. But the last answer didn't go down as well as he
          thought it would, evident by the frown on Aldo's face.

          LT. ALDO
          Yeah, that's what we thought. We don't
          like that. You see, we like our Nazi's
          in uniforms. That way, you can spot 'em,

          CHAPTER THREE

          "GERMAN NIGHT IN PARIS"
          NOTE: This whole Chapter will be filmed in French New Wave
          Black and White.

          INT - CINEMA AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
          We're in the auditorium of a cinema in Paris. However the
          CAMERA is pointed in the direction of the audience, not the
          screen. We start CLOSE on the projector beam, emanating from
          the little glass window in the back of the theatre
          The CAMERA continues to DOLLY back, making the Shot Wider and
          Wider, bringing in more and more the German occupied citizens
          of Paris, who stare at the OFF SCREEN silver screen in the dark
          We can hear the OFF SCREEN SOUNDTRACK of a Goebbels produced
          German omm paw paw musical movie being projected.
          The Shot continues to pull further and further back, and the
          German dialogue continues to fill the auditorium...

          TILL...
          .The DOLLY SHOT LANDS on a CLOSE UP of Shosanna,. watching the
          movie.

          A SUBTITLE APPEARS:

          "1941

          PARIS

          TWO WEEKS AFTER THE MASSACRE

          OF SHOSANNA'S FAMILY"
          We hear the sound of the German musicals climax.
          The lights go up in the auditorium.
          Shosanna, dressed in a NURSES UNIFORM she swiped from
          somewhere, remains seated, as the rest of the PATRONS, gather
          their coats, and file out.

          

          

          

          

          3P.

          EXT - LITTLE CINEMA (PARIS)- NIGHT
          Patrons exit under the cinema marquee, as someone from inside
          SHUTS OFF the marquees lights.
          The MARQUEE READS in French:
          "GERMAN NIGHT BRIDGET VON HAMMERSMARK in MADCAP IN MEXICO".

          EXT - PROJECTION BOOTH (LITTLE CINEMA)
          A French Black Man, who we will learn later is named MARCEL,
          is the cinema's projectionist. We see him for a moment, taking
          the film reels off the projector, and placing them on rewinds.

          INT - AUDITORIUM

          CU SHOSANNA
          still sitting in her seat. Except for her, the auditorium is
          empty.
          The owner of the Cinema, a attractive looking French woman,
          who we will later know as MADAME MIMIEUX, appears in
          one of the cinema's opera box balconies.
          Looking down from her perch at the young girl, sitting in
          the empty cinema.
          The DIALOGUE will be spoken in FRENCH, and SUBTITLED into

          ENGLISH.

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          So young woman, since it's beyond obvious
          we're closed for the evening. I must assume
          you want something. What can I do for you?

          SHOSANNA
          May I sleep here tonight?

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          So I gather your not a nurse?

          SHOSANNA
          No.

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          But your a bright little thing, that's
          clever disguise. Where is your family?

          SHOSANNA
          Murdered.

          

          

          

          

          3 1.

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          So your a war orphan?

          SHOSANNA
          We were from Nancy. The Bosch found us

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          Is this a sad story?

          SHOSANNA
          Oui.

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          Sad stories bore me. These days everyone
          in Paris has one. I haven't bore you
          with mine, don't bore me with yours.

          SHOSANNA
          You can run the machines?

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          What machines?
          Using her hands to pantomime the rotating film reels on a
          projector, she says;

          SHOSANNA
          The machines that show the film?

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          The projectors? Yes, I own a cinema,
          of course I can operate them.

          SHOSANNA
          I know, I saw you.

          FLASH ON:

          CU SHOSANNA
          eyes creeping up the stairway in the projection booth,
          watching...

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          expertly working the projectors...

          BACK TO SHOSANNA

          SHOSANNA
          Teach me. Teach me to run the machines,
          that show the film. It's only you and
          the negro. I know you could use some help.

          

          

          

          

          40.

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          I know at least six people who've been
          put up against a wall, and machine
          gunned for sheltering enemies of the
          state. I have no intention of being
          unlucky number seven. How long have
          you been in Paris?

          SHOSANNA
          A week, and a few days.

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          How have you survived the curfew
          without capture?

          SHOSANNA
          I sleep on rooftops.

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          Again, I'm forced to admit, clever
          girl. How is it?

          SHOSANNA
          Cold.

          MADAME MIMIEUX

          (LAUGHS)
          I can imagine.

          SHOSANNA
          Respectfully, no you can't.

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          Fair enough.

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          So you can't operate a 35mm film projector,
          you want me teach you, in order to work
          here, in order to use my cinema, as a hole
          to hide in, is that correct?

          SHOSANNA
          Oui.

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          Whats your name?

          SHOSANNA
          Shosanna.

          

          

          

          

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          I'm Madame Mimieux. You may call
          me Madame. This is a cinema. Not a
          home for wayward war orphans.
          Having said that, what you say is true.
          If you were truly exceptional, I could
          find use for you. So Shosanna, are you
          truly exceptional?

          SHOSANNA
          Oui Madame.

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          I will be the judge of that.

          DISSOLVE TO

          TITLE CARD:
          Which shows a lovely PENCIL SKETCH of the CITY OF PARIS,
          complete with Eiffel Tower.

          ABOVE IT READS:

          "1944

          PARIS"

          THEN...
          The CAMERA PULLS BACK, and we see we're not looking at a TITLE
          CARD at all, but a CALENDER stuck on the wall of the Little
          Cinema's Projection Booth. Before we leave it, WE SEE the
          Month is JUNE.
          ..The CAMERA finds, the THREE YEARS OLDER SHOSANNA, working
          as the PROJECTIONIST. It would appear, that Shosanna passed
          Madame Mimieux's exceptional test.
          A lyrical Morriconie-like tune PLAYS on the SOUNDTRACK, this
          will be "Shosanna's Theme".
          A Little Bell, begins RINGING, on one of the projectors,
          alerting Shosanna it's time for a REEL CHANGE.
          Shosanna stands at the projector, watching the old German film
          she's projecting, waiting for the1st REEL CHANGE MARK...

          SILVER SCREEN
          of the little cinema. On Screen LENI REFENSHTAL lies
          horizontal as a ice sickle drips on her head in the old
          German film, "The White Hell Of Piza Palu",
          The 1st REEL CHANGE MARK POPS ON in the upper right
          hand corner of the FRAME...(That tells the projectionist
          to get ready).

          

          

          

          
          As the FILM REEL on the lst PROJECTOR rolls out, Shosanna
          stands ready, waiting by the 2nd PROJECTOR...

          WHEN...

          SILVER SCREEN
          the 2nd REEL CHANGE MARK POPS ON in the same place(That's the
          one).

          SHOSANNA
          THROWS the lever on the 2nd PROJECTOR, switching the film from
          projector 1# to projector 2#, executing a perfect REEL CHANGE.
          As Shosanna's Theme plays on the Soundtrack, we watch viva
          MONTAGE, her go through her daily chores. Carry heavy film cans
          up the stairs, empty the rat traps, ect,ect...

          EXT - CINEMA - NIGHT
          The MARQUEE READS in French:
          "GERMAN NIGHT LENI REFENSHTAL in PABST WHITE HELL OF PIZA PALU"
          Shosanna emerges from the cinema carrying two buckets of
          LETTERS (for the marquee), and a tall ladder. Her chore here,
          obviously, is to change the show on the marquee.
          The LITERARY NARRATOR comes on the Soundtrack in ENGLISH;

          NARRATOR(VO)
          To operate a cinema in Paris during
          the occupation, one had two choices.
          Ether you could show new German propaganda
          films, produced under the watchful
          eye of Joseph Goebbels. Or... .you
          could have a German night in your
          weekly schedule, and show allowed
          German classic films.
          Their German night was Thursday.
          Shosanna, by herself, perched up high on the ladder, changing
          the letters on the marquee.
          A YOUNG GERMAN SOLDIER(about the same age as Shosanna), walks
          out of the cinema. He sees the ladder with the young French
          girl on top, and walks over.
          They speak FRENCH, SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          What starts tomorrow?
          Shosanna looks down, seeing the young German Solder smiling up
          at her from below.

          

          

          

          

          LC 3.

          SHOSANNA
          A Max Linder festival.

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          Ummmm, I always preferred Linder to
          Chaplin. Except Linder never made a
          film as good as "The Rid". The chase
          climax of "The Kid", superb.
          Shosanna continues working, not adding to the conversation.

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          I suppose now you could use a "M"
          a "A" and a "X"?

          SHOSANNA
          No need, I can manage.

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          Don't be ridiculous, it's my pleasure.
          He hands the French damsel the letters spelling MAX.

          SHOSANNA
          Merci.

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          I adore your cinema very much.

          SHOSANNA
          Merci.
          She busies herself with the marquee letters...

          GERMAN SOLDIER

          SHOSANNA

          GERMAN SOLDIER

          SHOSANNA

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          How does a young girl, such as yourself,
          own a cinema?
          Do to his uniform, and Shosanna's situation, all his efforts
          at trying to make small talk, strikes the young Jewess in
          hiding as a Gestapo interrogation.

          

          

          

          

          SHOSANNA
          My aunt left it to me.

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          Lucky girl.
          Shosanna makes no reply back.

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          Merci for hoisting a German night.

          SHOSANNA
          I don't have a choice, but your welcome.

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          Do you chose the German films yourself?

          SHOSANNA
          Oui.

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          Then my merci stands. I love the
          Refensthal mountain films, especially,
          "Pizu Palu". It's nice to see a French
          girl who's a admirer of Refensthal.

          SHOSANNA
          "Admire", would not be the adjective
          I would use to describe my feelings
          towards Fraulein Refensthal.

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          But you do admire the director. Pabst,
          don't you? That's why you included
          his name on the marquee.
          She climbs down from the ladder and faces the German
          Private.

          SHOSANNA
          I'm French. We respect directors
          in our country.

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          Apparently even Germans.

          SHOSANNA
          Even Germans. Merci for assistance,
          Private. Adieu.
          She turns to go back inside.

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          Your not finished?

          

          

          

          

          SHOSANNA
          I'll finish in the morning.
          She opens the door to go inside.

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          May I ask your name?

          SHOSANNA
          You wish to see my papers?
          She hands him her excellently forged papers.
          That's obviously not what he meant, but he takes them anyway
          to read her name.

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          Emmanuelle Mimieux. That's a very
          pretty name.

          SHOSANNA
          Merci. Are you finished with my papers?
          He hands them back.

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          Mademoiselle. My name is Fredrick Zoller.
          She gives no response.

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          It's been a pleasure chatting with a
          fellow cinema lover. Sweet dreams,
          Mademoiselle.
          He gives her a little salute, and walks into the black of a
          curfew imposed night.
          She looks after him. She didn't show it, but he kinda got to
          her. After all, for any true cinema lover, it's hard to hate
          anybody who, CINEMA MON AMOUR.

          EXT - ROOFTOP CINEMA - NIGHT
          Shosanna stands on the roof of her cinema, late at night,
          lighting up a cigarette. As she takes her first big drag,
          she remembers a voice.

          FLASH ON
          MADAME MIMIEUX, the younger Shosanna, and the black
          projectionist Marcel, in the projection booth. Shosanna
          lights up a cigarette, and Madame Mimieux SLAPS her face
          HARD, knocking the cigarette out of her mouth. Marcel
          quickly STAMPS it out on the floor.

          

          

          

          
          If-7.

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          if I ever see you light up a cigarette
          in my cinema again, I'll turn you into
          the Nazi's, do you understand?
          Shosanna is shocked by this statement.

          SHOSANNA
          Oui, Madame.

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          And for bringing a open flame in my
          cinema, you deserve far worse then
          a Nazi jewish boxcar. With your thick
          head, what do you think the highest
          priority of a cinema manager is?
          Keeping this fucking place from burning
          down to the ground, that's what!
          In my collection, I have over 350,
          35mm, nitrate film prints, which are
          not only immensely flammable, but
          highly unstable. And should they
          catch fire, they burn three times
          faster then paper. If that happens..
          .POOF...all gone, cinema no more,
          every body burned alive. If I ever
          see you with a open flame in my cinema
          again, I won't turn you into the Nazi's
          I'll kill you myself. And the fucking
          Germans will give me a curfew pass.
          Do you understand me?

          SHOSANNA
          Out, Madame.

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          Do you believe me?

          SHOSANNA
          Out, Madame.

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          You damn well better.

          BACK TO ROOF
          Shosanna exhales cigarette smoke.
          Marcel comes onto the roof.

          MARCEL
          Are you well?

          

          

          

          

          SHOSANNA
          Even on the roof I can't smoke a
          cigarette without hearing Madames
          voice yelling at me. That's why I
          do it. To hear Madames voice again.

          MARCEL
          We both miss her.

          SHOSANNA
          I know. I'm fine, darling. I'll be
          to bed soon.
          Marcel goes back inside, Shosanna smokes.

          INT - FRENCH BISTRO - AFTERNOON
          Shosanna sits in the back of a French bistro, reading a
          book, "The Saint in New York" by Leslie Charteris, drinking
          wine. When the young German Private from the other day,
          FREDRICK ZOLLER, walks in. He gets a beer, then notices the
          French girl sitting in the back. He smiles, and heads over
          to her. "Oh no, not this guy again", she thinks.
          Again they speak in FRENCH SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;

          FREDRICK
          May I join you?

          SHOSANNA
          Look Fredrick -

          FREDRICK

          (SMILING)
          - You remember my name?

          SHOSANNA
          Yes....Look, you seem a pleasant
          enough fellow -

          FREDRICK
          - Merci.

          SHOSANNA
          Your welcome. - regardless, I want
          you to stop pestering me.

          FREDRICK
          I apologize mademoiselle, I wasn't
          trying to be a pest. I was simply
          trying to be friendly.

          SHOSANNA
          I don't wish to be your friend.

          

          

          

          

          FREDRICK
          Why not?

          SHOSANNA
          Don't act like a infant. You know why.

          FREDRICK
          I'm more then just a uniform.

          SHOSANNA
          Not to me. If you are so desperate for
          a French girlfriend, I suggest you try
          Vichy?
          Just then TWO OTHER GERMAN SOLDIERS come over, obviously
          very impressed with Fredrick. They make a fuss over him in
          UNSUBTITLED GERMAN, which nether Shosanna, or the non German
          speaking members of the movies audience, can understand.
          He signs autographs for them, shakes their hands, and they
          go on their way.
          Shosanna's eyes narrow.

          SHOSANNA
          Who are you?

          FREDRICK
          I thought I was just a uniform?

          SHOSANNA
          Your not just a German soldier, are
          you somebodies son?

          FREDRICK
          Most German soldiers are somebodies son.

          SHOSANNA
          Yeah, but your not just somebody. What
          are you, Hitlers nephew?
          He leans in across the table, she leans in too, and he says;

          FREDRICK
          Yes.

          SHOSANNA
          Really?

          FREDRICK
          No not really, I'm just teasing you.
          She leans back annoyed.

          SHOSANNA
          Then what is it? What are you, a German
          movie star?

          

          

          

          

          6'O

          FREDRICK
          Not exactly.

          SHOSANNA
          (Pfuit), what does that mean, "not exactly".
          I asked if you were a movie star, the
          answer to that question, is yes or no.
          Fredrick laughs at that line.

          FREDRICR
          When you said that just now, you
          reminded me of my sister.
          This catches young Shosanna off guard.

          FREDRICR
          I come from a home of six sisters.
          We run a family operated cinema in Munich.
          Seeing you run around your cinema,
          reminds me of them. Especially my sister
          Helga. She raised me, when our father
          wasn't up to the job. I admire her very
          much. You'd like her, she doesn't wear a
          German uniform.

          SHOSANNA
          You were raised by Helga?

          FREDRICK
          All my sisters, I'm the baby, but Helga
          was the bossiest.

          SHOSANNA
          And your mother and father?

          FREDRICK
          My mother died. And my father was a
          loser. My fathers moto; "If at first
          you don't succeed, quit". The day he
          left, good riddance. My sisters are
          all I need. It's why I like your cinema.
          It makes me feel both closer to them,
          and a little homesick at the same time.

          SHOSANNA
          is your cinema still operatiing?

          FREDRICR
          Oui.

          SHOSANNA
          What's it called?

          

          

          

          

          5!

          FREDRICK
          The Kino Haus.

          SHOSANNA
          How has it done durring the war?

          FREDRICK
          Actually, in Germany, cinema
          attendance is up.

          SHOSANNA
          No doubt, you don't have to operate
          under a curfew.

          FREDRICK
          How often do you fill your house?

          SHOSANNA
          (Pfuit), not since before the war.

          FREDRICK
          So if you had one big engagement, that
          would help you out?

          SHOSANNA
          Of course, but that's not likely to
          happen.
          TWO MORE GERMAN SOLDIERS and their TWO FRENCH DATES approach
          the table. They ask for Fredricks autograph, he signs it for
          them. One of the French Girls says in FRENCH, how exciting
          it is to meet a real live German war hero. Shosanna hears
          it. They leave. So that's it, she thinks.

          SHOSANNA
          So your a war hero? Why didn't you tell me?

          FREDRICK
          Everybody knows that, I liked you didn't.

          SHOSANNA
          What did you do?
          He takes a sip of beer.

          FREDRICK
          I've shot the most enemy soldiers
          in world war two...so far.
          You bet your sweet ass that got her attention.

          SHOSANNA
          Wow.

          

          

          

          

          52

          FREDRICK
          I was alone in a bell tower in a
          walled off city in Russia. It was
          myself, and a thousand rounds of ammo,
          in a bird's nest, against three
          hundred Soviet soldiers.

          SHOSANNA
          What's a bird's nest?

          FREDRICK
          A bird's nest is what a sniper would call
          a bell tower. It's a high structure,
          offering a three hundred and sixty degree
          view. Very advantageous for marksmen.

          SHOSANNA
          How many Russian's did you kill?

          FREDRICK
          Sixty-eight.

          (BEAT)
          The first day. A hundred and fifty the
          second day. Thirty-two, the third day.
          On the forth day, they exited the city.
          Naturally my war story received alot of
          attention in Germany, that's why they
          all recognize me. They call me the
          German Sgt.York.

          SHOSANNA
          Maybe they'll make a film about
          your exploits.

          FREDRICK
          Well, that's just what Joseph Goebbels
          thought. So he did. It's called "Nation's
          Pride", and guess what, they wanted me to
          play myself, so I did. They have posters
          for it in kiosks all over Paris. That's
          another reason for all the attention.

          SHOSANNA
          "Nation's Pride" is about you? "Nation's
          Pride" is starring you?

          FREDRICK
          I know, comical, huh?

          SHOSANNA
          Not so comical. So what are you doing
          in Paris, enjoying a rest?

          

          

          

          

          53.

          FREDRICK
          Hardly. I've been doing publicity,
          having my picture taken with different
          German luminaries, visiting troops,
          that sort of thing. Goebbels wants the
          film to premier in Paris, so I've been
          helping them in the planning.
          Joseph is very keen on this film.
          He's telling anybody who will listen,
          when "Nation's Pride" is released,
          I'll be the German Van Johnson.
          Shosanna, wasn't falling for the young German, by any stretch.
          However his exploits, as well as his charming manner, can't
          help but impress. But his referring to Goebbels as "Joseph",
          like their friends, is all she needed to get on the right side
          of things. This young man is trouble with a capital "T", and
          she needs to stay far fucking away from him.
          She abruptly rises, and says;

          SHOSANNA
          Well, good luck with your premier
          Private. I hope all goes well for
          Joseph and yourself. Au revoir.
          And with that, she disappears. Leaving the perplexed private
          alone.

          EXT - CINEMA MARQUEE - DAY
          It's the next day.
          Shosanna and Marcel are changing the letters on the marquee.
          Marcel excuses himself to visit the toilet.
          $hosanna is alone outside the little cinema, perched up on her
          ladder.

          WHEN...
          .A BLACK NAZI SEDAN pulls up in front of the little cinema.
          A GERMAN MAJOR in a black Gestapo uniform steps out of the back
          of the sedan.
          The DRIVER, a German Private, steps out as well.
          Yelling to the young girl up high on the ladder;
          Both GERMAN and FRENCH will be SUBTITLED into ENGLISH.

          

          

          

          
          5 q.

          GESTAPO MAJOR
          Mademoiselle Nimieux?

          SHOSANNA
          Oui?
          Telling his Driver in German to ask her in French;

          GESTAPO MAJOR
          Ask her if this is her cinema?
          in French The Driver asks Shosanna;

          DRIVER
          is this your cinema?

          SHOSANNA

          GESTAPO MAJOR
          Tell her to come down.

          DRIVER
          Come down please.
          She climbs down the ladder.
          The Driver opens the back door of the sedan, indicating for her
          to get in.

          SHOSANNA
          I don't understand, what have I done?

          DRIVER
          (to Major)
          She wants to know what she's done?

          GESTAPO MAJOR
          Who says she's done anything?

          DRIVER
          Who says you've done anything?
          Then in her best imitation of Madame Mimeux's arrogantmanner.

          SHOSANNA
          Then I demand to know what this is about,
          and where do you propose to take me?
          The Driver begins to translate, when the Gestapo Major holds up his
          hand, telling him not to bother. The Major looks at the young
          French girl and tells her in German;

          

          

          

          

          55.

          GESTAPO MAJOR
          Get your ass in that car.
          No translation necessary. She climbs into the back of the car,
          followed by the Germans. The sedan takes off.

          INT - SEDAN(MOVING) - DAY
          The Nazi sedan drives through the early afternoon Paris
          streets.

          WE HOLD SHOSANNA IN TIGHT CU
          the whole ride, never showing her Nazi oppressor sitting beside
          her. We just hold on her face trying not to revel anything.
          The sedan stops.
          The car door opens and the Driver offers Shosanna his hand.

          EXT/INT- MAXIUM'S (FAMOUS PARIS CAFE) - DAY
          She steps out of the car, and is lead into a Paris cafe by the
          Gestapo Officer. It takes the young Jewess a moment or two before
          she realizes she's not being led to a Gestapo interrogation
          room, a railroad car, or a concentration camp, but to lunch.
          The best table at Maxims. Three people, and two dogs, sit at it.
          Germany's Minister of Propaganda, and the number two man in
          Hitlers Third Reich, JOSEPH GOEBBELS, his female French translator
          (and mistress), FRANCESCA MONDINO, and young Private Zoller,
          are the people. TWO BLACK FRENCH POODLES, belonging to
          Mademoiselle Mondino, sit together in another chair at the
          table.
          We join them in mid-conversation;
          They all speak GERMAN, SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;

          GOEBBELS
          - it's only the off spring of slaves that
          allows America to be competitive athletically.
          America olympic gold can measured in Negro
          sweat.
          Shosanna is lead through the French eatery by the Gestapo Major.
          Private Zoller see's her, and stands up, excuse's himself,
          and greets her before she reaches the table.
          Fredrick says in French, SUBTITLED in ENGLISH;

          FREDRICK
          Good you came. I wasn't sure weather or
          not you'd except my invitation.

          

          

          

          

          SHOSANNA
          Invitation?

          THEN...
          .Goebbles Voice says OFF SCREEN;

          GOEBBLES(OS)
          Is that the young lady in question,
          Fredrick?
          Private Zoller turns in his direction, takes Shosanna by the
          arm, and leads her to him.

          FREDRICK
          Yes it is, beer Goebbels. Emmanuelle,
          there is somebody I want you to meet.
          Joseph Goebbels, remaining seated, looks up at the young French
          girl, scrutinizing her as he spoons creme brule into his mouth.
          The excited Fredrick introduces Shosanna to the propaganda
          minister formally.

          FREDRICK
          Emmanuelle Mimieux, I'd like to
          introduce you to the minister of
          propaganda, the leader of the entire
          German film industry, and now I'm a
          actor, my boss, Joseph Goebbels.
          Goebbels offers up his long spider-like fingers for Shosanna to
          shake. She does.

          GOEBBELS
          Your reputation precedes you Fraulein
          Mimieux.
          He looks to Francesca to translate, but she's just taken a big
          bite of terri misu.
          They all laugh.
          Fredrick jumps in...

          FREDRICK
          And normally, this is beer Goebbels French
          interpreter, Mademoiselle Francesca
          Mondino.

          FRANCESCA
          looks up at Shosanna.

          

          

          

          

          5'?

          Do it! Do it! Fuck me - fill me!

          BACK TO FRANCESCA
          looking at Shosanna.

          FRANCESCA
          Bon jour.

          SHOSANNA
          Bon jour.

          

          

          

          

          I
          f.

          FREDRICK
          And you've met the Major.
          The Gestapo officer steps up and says, to Fredrick in German;

          GESTAPO MAJOR
          Actually, I didn't introduce myself.
          (to Shosanna)
          Major Deiter Helistrom of the Gestapo, at
          your service mademoiselle.
          (he clicks
          his heels)
          Please allow me, have a seat.
          The Gestapo Officer pulls out a chair, for the young lady to sit
          down. Shosanna takes the hot seat. Seated to her right is
          Private Zoller. To her left are the two curly pampered
          poodles. Major Helistrom pours Shosanna a glass of red wine
          from a small craft on the table.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          Try the wine mademoiselle, it's quite good.
          Goebbels looks across the table at her.

          GOEBBELS
          well I must say, you've made quite a
          impression on our boy.
          Francesca interprets Goebbels German for Shosanna.

          GOEBBELS
          I must say fraulein, I should be rather
          annoyed with you.
          Francesca interprets..

          GOEBBELS
          I arrive in France, and I wish to have
          lunch with my star...
          Francesca interprets...

          GOEBBELS
          Little do I know Be's become
          the toast of paris, and now he
          must find time for me.
          Francesca interprets...

          

          

          

          
          c9 Ã¢â¬Â¢

          GOEBBELS
          People wait in line hours, day's,
          to see me. For the Fuhrer and
          Private Zoller, I wait.
          Francesca interprets...

          GOEBBELS
          So finally, I'm granted a audience
          with the young Private, and he spends
          the entire lunch speaking of you
          and your cinema.
          Francesca interprets...

          GOEBBELS
          So Fraulein Mimieux, let's get down
          to business.
          Private Zoller interrupts -

          FREDRICK
          - Heer Goebbels, I haven't informed
          her yet.

          GOEBBELS
          Unless the girls a simpleton, I'm
          sure she's figured it out by now,
          after all she does operate a cinema.
          Francesca, tell her.
          Francesca tells Shosanna in French;

          FRANCESCA
          What they're trying to tell you
          Emmanuelle, is Private Zoller has
          spent the last hour at lunch,
          trying to convince Monsieur Goebbels
          to abandon previous plans for Private
          Zollers film premier, and change the
          venue to your cinema.
          Zoller reacts.

          FRANCESCA

          (FRENCH
          to Zoller)
          What?

          FREDRICK
          I wanted to inform her.

          FRANCESCA
          Shit. I apologize Private, of
          course you did.

          

          

          

          

          60.

          GOEBBELS

          (GERMAN
          to Francesca)
          What's the issue?

          FRANCESCA
          The Private wanted to inform the
          mademoiselle himself.

          GOEBBELS
          Nonsense. Until I ask a few
          questions, he has nothing to inform.
          Let the record state, I have not
          agreed to a venue change.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          Duly noted.
          Goebbels speaks German to Shosanna;

          GOEBBELS
          You have opera boxes?

          SHOSANNA

          GOEBBELS

          SHOSANNA

          GOEBBELS
          More would be better. How many
          seats in your auditorium?

          SHOSANNA
          Three hundred and fifty.

          GOEBBELS
          That's almost four hundred less
          then The Ritz.
          Fredrick jumps in...

          FREDRICK
          But beer Goebbels, that's not such
          a terrible thing. You said yourself
          you didn't want to indulge every
          two faced french bourgeois taking
          up space currying favor. With less
          seat's it makes the event more
          exclusive. Your not trying to fill
          the house, their fightin g for seats.

          

          

          

          

          61.

          FREDRICK

          (CON'T)
          Besides, to hell with the French.
          This is a German night, a German
          event, a German celebration. This
          night is for you, me, the German
          military, the high command, their
          family and friends. The only people
          who should be allowed in the room,
          are people who will be moved by
          the exploits on screen.
          Goebbels listens silently, then after a bit of a pause;

          GOEBBELS
          I see your public speaking has
          improved. It appears I've created
          a monster. A strangely persuasive
          monster. When the war's over,
          politics awaits.
          Table chuckles.

          GOEBBELS
          Well Private, though it is true,
          I'm inclined to indulge you anything.
          I must watch a film in this young
          ladies cinema before I can say,
          yes or no.
          (to Shosanna)
          So young lady, you are to close
          your cinema tonight, and have
          a private screening me.
          Francesca interprets...

          GOEBBELS
          What German films do you have?
          Francesca asks..

          SHOSANNA
          My cinema , on German night, tends
          to show older German classics.
          Francesca interprets...

          GOEBBELS
          Why not my films?
          Francesca asks...

          

          

          

          

          6Z.

          SHOSANNA
          I draw a older German audience in
          my cinema, that appreciate the
          nostalgia of the earlier time.
          Francesca interprets...

          GOEBBELS
          That's nonsense fraulein. Us Germans
          are looking forward, not backwards.
          That era of German cinema is dead.
          The German cinema I create, will not
          only be thee cinema of Europe. But
          the worlds only alternative to the
          degenerate Jewish influence of
          Hollywood.
          Fredrick Jumps in...

          FREDRICK
          Along with being a cinema owner,
          Emmanuelle is quite a formidable
          film critic.
          He chuckles, but alone.

          GOEBBELS
          WSo it would appear. Unfortunately
          for the fraulein, I've outlawed
          film criticism.
          Zoller, thinking fast, says;

          FREDRICK
          Why don't you screen "Lucky Kids"?
          I'm sure Emmanuelle hasn't seen. it.
          And it's so funny, I've been meaning
          to recommend it to her, for her
          German night. That's a great idea,
          let's watch "Lucky Kids" tonight.

          GOEBBELS
          Ahhh, "Lucky Kids", "Lucky Kids",
          "Lucky Kids". When all is said and
          done, my most purely enjoyable
          production. Not only that, I
          wouldn't be surprised, if sixty
          years from now, It's "Lucky Kids"
          that I'm the most remembered for.
          I know it doesn't seem like it now,
          but mark my words.
          Very well, I'll have a print sent
          over to the fraulein'.s cinema.
          We'll screen "Lucky Kids" tonight.

          

          

          

          

          63
          As Francesca interprets this for Shosanna...
          ...the empty chair next to the young Jewish girl is suddenly
          filled with the bottom half of a grey S.S. officer uniform.

          GOEBBELS
          Ah Landa, your here, this is the
          young lady in question.
          The S.S. Officer sits down, and it's our old friend from the
          first scene COL HANS LANDA.

          FREDRICK
          Shosanna, this4pol Hans Landa of
          the SS., he'll be running security
          for the premier.

          CU SHOSANNA
          A bomb is dropped and detonated behind her eyes. But if she
          gives any indication of this, her war story ends here.
          The S.S. OFFICER
          that murdered her family, takes her hand and kisses it,
          saying in perfect French;

          COL LANDA
          Charmed Mademoiselle.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          Better known as "The Jew Hunter".
          The table laughs.

          GOEBBELS
          Oh Francesca, what was that funny
          thing the Fuhrer said about Hans?

          FRANCESCA
          What thing?

          GOEBBELS
          You know, you were there, it was a
          funny thing the Fuhrer said,
          about Hans...Something about a pig?
          Francesca's memory is jogged.

          FRANCESCA
          Oh, yes of course.
          She repeats it by whispering it in Goebbels ear.

          

          

          

          

          6 "F

          GOEBBELS
          Oh, yes of course, that's it. So
          the Fuhrer said, he wouldn't be
          surprised if Hans weren't rooting
          out Jews like a truffle pig from
          the play pen.

          FRANCESCA
          That's what we need, pigs that can
          root out Jews.

          COL LANDA
          Who needs pigs when you have me?
          Big hearty laugh around the table.

          GOEBBELS
          Do you have a engagement tonight?

          COL LANDA
          Well, as a matter of fact, I do -

          GOEBBELS
          - Break it. We're all going to the
          Fraulein's cinema tonight to view
          "Lucky Kids".

          COL LANDA
          Splendid.
          Then Reich Ministers companion mademoiselle Mondino,

          INTERRUPTS;

          FRANCESCA
          And now I must get Reich Minister Goebbels
          to his next appointment.

          GOEBBELS
          Slave driver! French slave driver!
          They all chuckle.
          Everybody begins to stand up from the table...
          ..Francesca gathers the stupid dogs...
          .as Col Landa stands, he says;

          COL LANDA
          Actually, in my role as security
          chief of this joyous German occasion,
          I'm afraid I must have a word with
          Mademoiselle Mimieux.

          

          

          

          

          C. 5.
          Mademoiselle Mimieux eyes go to Private Zoller, who responds.

          FREDRICK
          What sort of discussion?

          COL LANDA
          That sounded suspiciously like a
          Private questioning the order of a
          Colonel? Or am I just being sensitive?

          FREDRICK
          Nothing could be further from the
          truth Colonel. Your authority is
          beyond question.
          But your reputation does proceed
          you. Should Mademoiselle Mimieux
          or myself be concerned?

          GOEBBELS
          Hans, the boy means no harm, he's
          simply smitten. And he's correct.
          Your reputation does proceed you.
          Laughter all around. The Reich Minister and his axis entourage,
          make their way to front of the cafe, with the two dumb dogs on
          a leash, leading the way.

          COL LANDA
          No need for concern, you two.
          As security chief, I simply need
          to have a chat with the possible
          new venue's property owner.

          FREDRICK
          I was just hoping to escort
          Mademoiselle Mimieux back to her
          cinema.

          GOEBBELS
          Nonsense! You can eat ice cream,
          and walk along the Sienne another
          time. Right now, allow Col Landa
          to do his job.
          Everybody saystheir farewells.
          Col Landa offers the young jew in hiding a seat at a small
          table in the outside patio area of Maxims.
          The fluency and poetic proficiency of the S.S. jew hunters
          french, revels to the audience, that his feigning clumsiness at
          french with Monsieur Lapadite in the films first scene, was
          simply a interrogation-technique.

          

          

          

          
          bd.
          They speak FRENCH SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;

          COL LANDA
          Have you tried the strudel here?

          SHOSANNA
          No.

          COL LANDA
          It's not so terrible. So how is it
          the young Private and yourself came
          to be acquainted?
          She's about to answer, when a WAITER approaches.

          COL LANDA
          Yes, two strudels, one for myself,
          and one for the mademoiselle. A cup
          of espresso, with a container of.
          steamed milk, on the side.
          For the Mademoiselle, a glass of milk.
          Considering Shosanna. grew up on a dairy farm, and the last time
          she was on a dairy farm, her strudel companion murdered her
          entire family, his ordering her milk is, to say the
          least... . disconcerting.
          The key to Col Landa's power, and or charm, depending on the
          side ones on, lies in his ability to convince you he's privy to
          your secrets.

          COL LANDA
           So Mademoiselle, you were beginning
          to explain....?

          SHOSANNA

          (ANXIOUSLY)
          Up untill a couple of days ago,
          I had no knowledge of Private Zoller,
          or his exploits. To me, the Private
          was simply just a patron of my cinema.
          We spoke a few times, but -

          COL LANDA
          - Mademoiselle, let me interrupt you.
          This is a simple formality, no
          reason for you to feel anxious.
          The Colonel takes one look at it, and says to the Waiter;

          

          

          

          

          67

          COL LANDA
          I apologize, I forgot to order the
          cream fresh.

          WAITER
          One moment.
          He exits.

          COL LANDA
          (Refuring to
          the apple pie)
          Wait for the cream.
          (Back to

          BUSINESS)
          So Emmanuelle - May I call you
          Emmanuelle?

          SHOSANNA
          Oui.

          COL LANDA
          So Emmanuelle, explain to me how
          does it happen, that a young lady
          such as your self, comes to own a
          cinema?
          The Waiter returns, applying cream fresh to the two strudels.
          The S.S. Colonel looks across the table at his companion, picking
          up his fork, he says;

          COL LANDA
          After you.
          Shosanna takes Ã¢â¬Â¢a whip creamy bite of strudel, Landa follows her
          lead.

          COL LANDA

          (MOUTHFULL
          of pie)
          Success?
          Shosanna, mouth full of pie, indicates she approves.

          .COL LANDA
          Like I said, not so terrible.
          (Back to

          BUSINESS)
          So you were explaining the origin of
          your cinema ownership?

          

          

          

          

          69.

          SHOSANNA
          The cinema originally belonged to
          my aunt and uncle -
          Col Landa removes alittle black book from his pocket.

          COL LANDA
          - What is there names?

          SHOSANNA
          Jean-Pierre and Ada Mimieux.
          He records the names in his little book.

          COL LANDA
          Where are they now?

          SHOSANNA
          My uncle was killed during blitzkrieg.

          COL LANDA
          Pity... . Continue.

          SHOSANNA
          Aunt Ada passed away from fever
          last spring.'

          COL LANDA
          Regrettable.

          (RESPECTFUL

          PAUSE)
          It's come to my attention you have
          a negro in your employ, is that true?

          SHOSANNA
          Yes, he's a Frenchman. His name is
          Marcel. He worked with my aunt and
          uncle since they opened the cinema.
          He's the only other one who works
          with me.

          COL LANDA
          Doing what?

          SHOSANNA
          Projectionist.

          COL LANDA
          Is he any good?

          SHOSANNA
          The best.

          

          

          

          

          61.

          COL LANDA
          Actually one could see where that
          might be a good trade for them.
          Can you operate the projectors?

          SHOSANNA
          Of course I can.

          COL LANDA
          Knowing the Reich Minister as I do,
          I'm quite positive he wouldn't want
          the success or failure of his
          illustrious evening, dependent on
          the prowess of a negro. So if it
          comes to pass we hold this event
          at your venue, talented no doubt,
          as your negro may be, you will
          operate the projectors. Is that
          exceptable?
          As if she has any say.

          SHOSANNA
          Oui.
          Col Landa takes another bite of strudel, Shosanna follows suit.

          COL LANDA
          So it would appear our young hero is
          quite smitten with you?

          SHOSANNA
          Private Zollers feelings for me
          aren't of a romantic nature.

          COL LANDA
          Mademoiselle...?

          SHOSANNA
          Colonel, his feelings are not
          romantic. I remind him of his sister.

          COL LANDA
          That doesn't mean his feelings
          aren't romantic.

          SHOSANNA
          I remind him of his sister who
          raised him.

          

          

          

          

          70

          COL LANDA
          It's sounding more and more romantic
          by the minute.
          Landa takes out a handsome looking cigarette case, with a S.S.
          LOGO on it. Removing on of the fags, he lights it up with a
          fancy S.S. gold lighter. He offers one to Shosanna.

          COL LANDA
          Cigarette?

          SHOSANNA
          No thank you.

          COL LANDA
          Do you smoke?

          SHOSANNA
          Yes.

          COL LANDA
          Then I insist, you must take one.
          There not French, there German.
          I hope your not nationalist about
          your tobacco, to me French cigarettes
          are a sin against nicotine.
          She takes one, but makes no move to light it.
          He inhales deep, and says;

          COL LANDA
          I did have some thing else I wanted
          to ask you, but right now, for the
          life of me, I can't remember what it
          is. Oh well, must not of been important.
          Col Landa stands up, throws some French francs on the table,
          puts on his grey S.S. cap, touches his finger to his visor,
          saluting Shosanna, and saying:

          COL LANDA
          Till tonight.
          And with that he's gone.
          Shosanna breaths a sigh of relief.
          The CAMERA begins to slowly lower from a MEDIUM CU to her feet
          ankles and floor. We see her shoes are in a puddle of urine.
          During her conversation and strudel with the man that
          exterminated her entire family, shosanna pissed herself.
          She drops the German cigarette in to the piss puddle by her
          feet.

          INT - CINEMA AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
          The SILVER SCREEN
          on screen is the German screwball comedy "LUCKY KIDS".
          We hear OFF SCREEN laughter at the on screen aryan antics.

          CU GOEBBELS
          Watching the screen, basking in his own toxic genius.

          CU FRANCESCA
          Laughing at the comedy, hand covering her mouth.

          CU TWO BLACK POODLES
          Pantingly watching the screen.

          CU MAJOR HELLSTROM
          Smiling, smoking a French cigarette.

          CU COL LANDA
          Smoking his calabash, amused.

          CU FREDRICK ZOLLER
          Truly enjoying himself.

          CU SHOSANNA
          watching the screen.
          The LITERARY NARRATOR comes on the soundtrack.

          NARRATOR (VO)
          While Shosanna sits there pretending
          to be amused by the aryan antics of
          Goebbels Frank Capra copy, "Lucky
          Kids", a thought suddenly comes to
          her.
          We see her face get slightly distracted behind the eyes.

          NARRATOR (VO)
          What if tonight, accidently, the
          cinema burned down? The Third Reich
          would lose it's Minister of
          propaganda, it's national hero, and
          it's top jew hunter, all in one fell
          swoop.
          She chuckles at the thought, though it looks like she's
          laughing at the German comedy.

          SILVER SCREEN
          "The END" card for "Lucky Kids" is projected.
          The Nazi rouges gallery, and Shosanna, applaud the film.

          The lights go up.

          P
          Goebbels excepts congratulations, as they stand and begin to
          file out into the lobby.

          NARRATOR(VO)
          The screening of "Lucky Kids" was a
          complete success. And Heer Goebbels
          conceded to have the venue changed
          to Shosannas cinema. Not only that,
          in a moment of inspiration, Heer
          Goebbels had a idea.
          Goebbels speaks GERMAN, and Francesca translates;

          GOEBBELS
          I must say, I appreciate the modesty
          of this auditorium. Your Cinema
          has real respect, almost church like.
          Not to say we couldn't spruce the
          place up a bit. In Versailles
          there's a crystal chandelier hanging
          in the banquet hall that is
          extraordinary. we're going to get it,
          and hang it from the very middle of
          auditorium roof. Also I want to go to
          Louvre, pick up a few Greek nudes,
          and just scatter them about the lobby.

          MONTAGE
          we see a quick series of shots that show all that happening.
          The chandelier being removed from the ceiling of Versailles.
          Greek nude statues being hand trucked out of the Louvre.
          A truck driving through the french countryside with the
          enormous crystal chandelier in the back.
          The lobby of Shosanna's cinema, pimped out in Nazi iconography.
          WORKERS buzz around decorating. The Greek statues are moved
          into place.
          We see Workers trying with incredible difficulty, to hoist the
          huge, heavy, and twinkingly fragile chandelier, in Shosannas
          auditorium, which now resembles something out of one of Tinto
          Brass's Italian B-movie rip off's of Visconti's "The Damned".

          SHOSANNA
          watches all this from a opera box, she shakes her head in
          disbelief.

          

          

          

          

          73

          BACK TO SHOSANNA AND THE NAZI "S
          in the lobby, post screening of "Lucky Rids", she's soundlessly
          escorting them to the door, as they make their goodbyes.

          NARRATOR (VO)
          As they left the little French
          cinema that night, all the Germans
          were very happy...
          We see Private Zoller hanging back, so he.can say goodbye.

          NARRATOR (VO)
          None more so then Private Zoller.
          She closes the door on him. Watching the Nazi's walk into the
          Paris night. Their shadows, for a moment onAwall, look
          like grotesque Nazi charcthers. 4644
          The Nazi's are gone.
          Marcel sits at the top of the staircase of the lobby, looking
          down at Shosanna.
          They speak in FRENCH SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;

          MARCEL
          What the fuck are we suppose to do?

          SHOSANNA
          It looks like we're suppose to have
          a Nazi premier.

          MARCEL
          Like I said, what the fuck are we
          suppose to do?

          SHOSANNA
          Well, I need to speak with you
          about that.

          MARCEL
          About what?

          SHOSANNA
          About these Hun swine, commandeering
          our cinema.

          MARCEL
          What about it?
          She slowly walks up the stairs to Marcel. She makes him part
          his legs, and sits on the lower step, between his legs. Her
          back up against his chest, his arms around her shoulders.
          Shosanna has only known this type of intimacy with Marcel.

          

          

          

          

          SHOSANNA
          Well, when I was watching the bosch
          (Said in

          ENGLISH)
          Capra-corn abomination,
          (Back to

          FRENCH)
          I got a idea.

          MARCEL
          I'm confused, what are we talking
          about?

          SHOSANNA
          Filling the cinema with Nazi's and
          their whores, and burning it down
          to the ground.

          MARCEL
          I'm not talking about that, your
          talking about that.

          SHOSANNA
          No, we're talking about that,
          right now. If we can keep this
          place from burning down by
          ourselves, we can burn it down
          by ourselves.

          MARCEL
          Shosanna -

          SHOSANNA
          No, Marcel, just for sake of argument,
          if we wanted to burn down the cinema,
          for any number of reasons, you and I
          could physically accomplish that, no?

          MARCEL
          Oui Shosanna, we could do that.

          SHOSANNA
          And with Madame Mimieux's 350 nitrate
          film print collection, we wouldn't
          even need explosives, would we?

          MARCEL
          You mean we wouldn't need any more
          explosives?

          SHOSANNA
          Oui, that's exactly what I mean.
          She begins kissing his hands.

          

          

          

          

          75.

          SHOSANNA

          (CON'T)
          I am going to burn down the cinema
          on Nazi night.
          One of his fingers probes her mouth.

          SHOSANNA

          (CON'T)
          And if I'm going to burn down the
          cinema, which I am, we both know,
          your not going to let me do it
          by myself.
          The back of her head presses up hard against him, as his hand
          both caresses, and grips her lovely neck.

          SHOSANNA

          (CON'T)
          Because you love me. And I love you.
          And your the only person on this earth
          I can trust.
          She then TWISTS around, so she's straddling him. They are now,
          face to face.

          SHOSANNA

          (CON'T)
          But that's not all we're going to do.
          Does the filmmaking equipment it the
          attic still work? I know the film
          camera does. How about the sound
          recorder?

          MARCEL
          Quite well, actually. I recorded a
          new guitarist I met in a cafe last
          week. It works superb. Why do we
          need filmmaking equipment?

          SHOSANNA
          Because Marcel, my sweet, we're
          going to make a film. Just for the
          Nazi's.

          INT - ENGLISH COUNTRY ESTATE - DAY
          A young MILITARY ATTACHE, opens the sliding double doors
          that serve as a entrance to the room.

          MILITARY ATTACHE
          Right this way, Lieutenant.
          A snappy handsome British Lieutenant in dress browns, steps inside
          the room. This officer, who has been mixing it up with
          the Gerrys since the late thirties, is named LT.ARCHIE HICOX.
          A young George Sanders type(The Saint and Private affairs of
          Bel Ami, years).
          Upon entering the room, Lt.Hicox is gobsmacked.
          Standing before him is legendary military mastermind,
          GENERAL ED FENECH, a older George Sanders type (Village of the
          Dammed).
          But in the back of the room, sitting behind a piano,
          smoking his ever present cigar, is the unmistakable
          bulk of WINSTON CHURCHELL.

          LT. HICOX
          Lt. Archie Hicox, reporting sir.

          GEN FENECH
          (Salutes back)
          General Ed Fenech, at ease Hicox.
          Drink?
          Hicox's eye's go to the formidable bulldog behind the piano,
          who's scrutinizing him behind his cigar. However the man behind
          the cigar makes no gesture, and the General, makes no
          acknowledgment of the three hundred pound gorilla in the room.
          Which Lt.Hicox knows enough to mean, if Churchell isn't
          introduced, he ain't there.

          LT.HICOX
          if you offered me a scotch and plane
          water, I could drink a scotch and
          plain water.

          

          

          

          

          ?7.

          GEN.FENECH
          That a boy, Lieutenant. Make it
          yourself, like a good chap,
          will you? Bars in the globe.
          Hicox heads over to the bar globe.

          LT.HICOX
          Something for yourself, sir?

          GEN.FENECH
          Whiskey straight. No junk in it.
          The Lieutenant moves over to the Columbus-style globe bar, and
          busies himself mixing spirits, playing bartender chappy.
          Fenech, eyeing the Lieutenant's file.

          GEN.FENECH
          It says here you've run three
          undercover commando operations in
          Germany, and German occupied
          territories? Frankfaurt, Holland,
          and Norway to be exact?
          Back to them, mixing drinks, he says;

          LT.HICOX
          Extraordinary people, the Norwegian's.

          GEN.FENECH
          It says here you speak German fluently?

          LT.HICOX
          Like a Katzenjammer Kid.

          GEN.FENECH
          And your occupation before the war?
          His back still to us, as he bartends...

          LT. H I COX
          I'm a film critic.

          GEN.FENECH
          List your accomplishments?

          LT.HICOX
          Well sir, such as they are, I write
          reviews and articles, for a publication
          called; "Films and Filmmakers".
          As well as our sister publication.

          

          

          

          
          7f .

          GEN.FENECH
          What's that called?

          LT.HICOX
          "Flickers Bi-Monthly". And I've had
          two books published.

          GEN.FENECH
          Impressive. Don't be modest Lieutenant,
          what are their titles?

          LT. HI COX
          The first book was called; "Art Of The
          Eye's, The Heart, and The Mind:A Study
          of German Cinema in the Twenties".
          And the second one was called; ...
          He turns around with his whiskey and plain water, and the
          Generals whiskey no junk. He finishes what he was saying, as
          he walks toward the General, handing him his drink.

          LT.HICOX
          "Twenty-Four Frame Da Vinci".
          It's a subtexual film criticism
          study of the work of German director
          G.W. Pabst.

          LT. HI COX
          What should we drink to, sir?

          GEN.FENECH
          (Thinking, for
          a moment)
          Down with Hitler.

          LT.HICOX
          All the way down, sir.

          GEN.FENECH
          Are you familiar with German cinema
          under the Third Reich?

          LT. HI COX
          Yes. Obviously I haven't seen any of
          the films made in the last three
          years, but I am familiar with it.

          GEN.FENECH
          Explain it to me.?

          

          

          

          

          77

          LT.HICOX
          Pardon sir?

          GEN.FENECH
          This little escapade of ours,
          requires a knowledge of the German
          film industry under the Third Reich.
          Explain to me UFA, under Goebbels?

          LT.HICOX
          Goebbels considers the films he's
          making to be the beginning of a new
          era in German cinema. A alternative
          to what he considers the Jewish
          German intellectual cinema of the
          twenties. And the Jewish controlled
          dogma of Hollywood.
          SUDDENLY... Bellowing from the back of the room;

          CHURCHELL
          How's he doing?

          LT. H I COX
          Frightfully sorry sir, once again?

          CHURCHELL
          You say he wants to take on the Jews
          at their own game? Compared to say
          .Louis B.Mayer...how's he doing?

          LT.HICOX
          Quite well, actually. Since Goebbels
          has taken over, film attendance has
          steadily risen in Germany over the
          last eight years. But Louis B.Mayer
          wouldn't be Goebbels proper opposite
          number. I believe Goebbels see's himself
          closer to David O.Selznick.
          Gen.Fenech looks to the Prime Minister.
          With a puff of cigar smoke, Churchell says;

          CHURCHELL
          Brief him.

          GEM.FENECH
          Lt.Bicox, at this point in time I'd
          like to brief you on, Operation Kino.
          Three days from now, Joseph Goebbels is
          throwing a gala premier of one of his
          new movies in Paris -

          

          

          

          

          80.

          LT.HICOX
          - What film sir?
          The General has to resort to peeking at his file.

          GEN.FENECH
          The motion pictures called; "Nation's
          Pride".

          LT.HICOX
          Oh, you mean the film about Private
          Zoller?

          GEN.FENECH
          We don't have any intelligence, on
          exactly, what the film that night
          will be about.

          LT.HICOX
          But it's called "Nation's Pride"?

          GEN.FENECH
          Yes.

          LT.HICOX
          I can tell you what it's about,
          it's about Private Fredrick Zoller.
          He's the German Sgt.York.
          Fenech can't help suppress a smile, they have the right man.

          GEN.FENECH
          In attendance at this joyous Germatic
          occasion, will be Goebbels, Gerring,
          Boorman, and most of the German High
          command, including all high ranking
          officers of both The S.S., and, The
          Gestapo. As well as luminaries of the
          Nazi propaganda film industry.

          LT.HICOX
          The master race at play, aye?

          GEN.FENECH
          Basically, we have all our rotten
          eggs in one basket. The objective of
          Operation Kino.... Blow up the basket.

          LT.HICOX
          (Reciting a
          a poem)
          "...and like the snows of yesteryear,
          gone from this earth". Jolly good, sir.

          

          

          

          

          GEN.FENECH
          An American Secret Service outfit,
          that lives deep behind enemy lines,
          will be your assist. The Germans call
          them; "The Basterds".

          LT.HICOX
          "The Basterds", never heard of them.

          GEN.FENECH
          Whole point of the secret service,
          old boy, you not hearing of them.
          But the Gerrys have heard of them,
          because these yanks have been them
          the devil. Their leader is a chap
          named Lt.Aldo Raine. The Germans
          call him, "Aldo the Apache".

          LT.HICOX
          Why do they call him that?

          GEN.FENECH
          Best guess, is because he removes the
          scalps of the Nazi dead.

          LT.HICOX
          Scalps, sir?

          GEN.FENECH
          The hair.
          He runs his finger along his hairline.

          GEN.FENECH
          Like a red Injun.

          LT.HICOX
          Rather gruesome sounding little
          Dicky bird, isn't he?

          GEN.FENECH
          No doubt the whole lot, a bunch a
          nutters. But you've heard the
          expression, "It takes a thief".

          LT.HICOX
          Indeed.
          General Fenech continues on with his exposition, moving over
          to a military map.

          

          

          

          
          9i.

          GEN.FENECH
          You'll be dropped into France, about
          twenty four kilometers outside of Paris.
          The Basterds will be waiting for you.
          First thing, you go to a little village
          called, "Nadine".
          (He points it
          out on the map)
          Apparently the Gerrys never go there.
          In Nadine, there's a tavern, called,
          "La Louisiane", you'll rendez-vous
          with our double agent, and she'll take
          it from there. She's the one who's
          going to get you in the premiere.
          It will be you, her, and two German
          born members of the Basterds. She's
          also made all the other arrangements
          your going to need.

          LT.HICOX
          How will I know her?

          GEN.FENECH
          I suspect that won't be too much
          trouble for you. Your contact is
          Bridget Von Hammersmark.

          LT.HICOX
          Bridget Von Hammersmark? The German
          movie star is working for England?

          GEN.FENECH
          For the last two years now. one could
          even say Operation Kino was her
          brainchild.
          In the back of the room the bulldog barks;

          CHURCHELL
          Extraordinary women.

          LT.BICOX
          Quite.

          GEN.FENECH
          You'll go to the premiere as her
          escort, lucky devil. She'll also
          have the premiere tickets for the
          other two. Got the gist?

          LT.HICOX
          I think so, sir. Paris when it sizzles.
          The three British bulldogs laugh.

          EXT - CINEMA ROOFTOP - DAY
           Shosanna and Marcel are on the rooftop of their cinema,
          literally, making a movie.
          Marcel is behind a old (even then) BOLEX 35MM MOVIE CAMERA,
          positioned low looking up.
           Shosanna, the camera subject, stands on boxes looking down
          into it.
          A old timey MICROPHONE is positioned out of frame.
          As they always do, and always will, they speak FRENCH
          SUBTITLED into you know what.

          MARCEL
          We need a sync mark.

          SHOSANNA
          What is a sync mark?

          MARCEL
          A action and noise put together,
          So we can sync up the picture
          and sound.

          SHOSANNA
          How do we do that?

          MARCEL
          Clap your hands.
          She does.

          MARCEL
          In frame imbecile.
          She claps her hands in front of her face.

          MARCEL
          Ready?
          Shosanna takes a deep breath, then;

          SHOSANNA
          Ready.

          MARCEL
          Action.

          WE CUT BEFORE SHE SPEAKS TO...

          .THE SCENE EARLIER BETWEEN MARCEL AND SHOSANNA IN THE

          LOBBY, ON THE STAIRS, TALKING ABOUT BURNING DOWN THE CINEMA.
          Big diffrence this time, it's in COLOR.

          MARCEL
          But how do we get it developed?
          Only a suicidal idiot like us would
          develop that footage. How do we get
          a35mm print with a soundtrack?

          SHOSANNA
          Do you know one person who can do
          both things?

          MARCEL
          Of course Gaspar, very nice man,
          took care of all the experimental
          filmmakers. But nobody in their
          right mind would strike a print of
          what your talking about. If the
          Nazi's found out, their life wouldn't
          be worth this.
          He snaps his fingers.

          SHOSANNA
          In a wolf fight, you ether eat the
          wolf, or the wolf eats you. If we're
          going to obliterate the Nazi's,
          we have to use their tactics.

          MARCEL
          What does that mean?

          SHOSANNA
          We find somebody who can develop
          and process a35mm print. And we
          make them do it, or we kill them.
          Once we tell them what we want to
          do, if they refuse, we have to kill
          them anyway, or they'll turn us in.

          MARCEL
          Would you do that?

          SHOSANNA
          Like that.
          Snaps her fingers.

          Late late at night.
          GASPAR, the fatherly figure of all the experimental French
          filmmakers in the decade before German rule, takes a SAVAGE
          BEATING at the hands of his friend Marcel.
          Shosanna watches, pitiless.

          SHOSANNA
          Bring that fucker over here!
          Put his head down on that table.
          Marcel, holds his arm behind him, as he forces his head flat
          against the table top.
          Shosanna brings a HATCHET DOWN DEEP into the table, just by
          his face.

          SHOSANNA
          You ether do what the fuck we tell
          you to, or I'll bury this axe in your
          collaborating skull.

          GASPAR
          I'm not a collaborator!

          SHOSANNA
          Then prove it! Or does your manhood
          go no deeper, then standing to piss?
          Marcel, does his wife, and children
          know you?

          MARCEL
          Oui.

          SHOSANNA
          Then after we kill this dog for
          Germans, we'll go and silence them.
          She lifts up the hatchet, raises it high...

          EXT - LA LOUISIANE (TAVERN) - NIGHT
          We see a small basement tavern, with a old rustic sign out
          front that reads, "La Louisiane".

          A SUBTITLE APPEARS:
          "The Village of

          NADINE, FRANCE"
          TWO SHOT LT.HICOX and LT.ALDO RAINE
          Aldo is dressed like a French civilian. Hicox is dressed in a
          German grey S.S. Cap't uniform. They look out of a window, in a
          apartment, in the village of Nadine, overlooking the tavern.

          LT.ALDO
          You didn't say the goddamn rendez-vous
          was in a fuckin basement.

          LT.HICOX
          I didn't know.

          LT.ALDO
          You said it was in a tavern?

          LT.HICOX
          it is a tavern.

          

          

          

          

          LT.ALDO
          Yeah, in a basement. You know,
          fightin in a basement offers a lot
          of difficulties, number one being,
          your fighting in a basement.
          Wilhelm Wicki, joins the SHOT, dressed in a German S.S.
          Lieutenant uniform.

          WICKI
          What if we go in there, and she's
          not even there?

          LT.HICOX
          We wait. Don't worry, she's a British
          spy, she'll make the rendez-vous.
          WE SEE the other Basterds, dressed in French civilian clothes,
          are in the room as well, they are, Donowitz, Hirschberg,
          and Utivich. And in the back of the room, dressed in the grey
          uniform of a S.S. Lieutenant, Hugo Stiglitz sits off by himself,
          sharpening his S.S. DAGGER on his leather belt looped around his
          boot. Anybody not in the scene from the Basterds opening
          chapter, is dead.
          Lt.Hicox watches Stiglitz off by himself on the other side of
          the room, SHARPENS his dagger menacingly.
          .Stiglitz is fucking werid...
          Lt.Hicox approaches Stiglitz...

          LT.NICOX
          Stiglitz, right?

          STIGLITZ
          That's right, sir.
          He continues bringing the blades edge, up, then, down on the
          leather strap.

          LT.HICOX
          I hear your pretty good with that?
          Meaning the blade. Stiglitz doesn't answer.

          LT.HICOX
          You know, we're not looking for
          trouble, right now. We're simply
          making contact with our agent.
          Should be uneventful. However, on
          the off chance I'm wrong, and things
          prove eventful. I need to know, we can
          all remain calm.

          

          

          

          

          99.
          The renegade Gerry Sergeant, stops his blades progress, and
          looks up at the limy Lieutenant.

          STIGLITZ
          I don't look calm to you?

          LT.HICOX
          Well, now you put it like that,
          I guess you do.
          He turns his attention back to his blade.
          Hicox moves over to Aldo, and asks him privately;

          LT. HI COX
          This Gerry of yours, Stiglitz?
          Not exactly the loquacious type,
          is he?
          Aldo just looks at him.

          LT.ALDO
          Is that the kinds man you need, the
          loquacious type?

          LT.HICOX
          Fair point, Lieutenant.

          LT.ALDO
          So y'all git in trouble in there,
          what are we suppose to do?
          Make bets on how it all comes out?

          LT.HICOX
          If we get into trouble, we can
          handle it. But if trouble does
          happen, we need you to make damn
          sure no Germans, or French, for
          matter, escape from that basement.
          If Frau Von Hammersmark's cover is
          compromised, the mission is kaput.

          SGT.DONOWITZ
          Speaking of Frau Von Hammersmark,
          who's idea was it for the death trap
          redez-vous?

          LT.HICOX
          She chose the spot.

          SGT.DONOWITZ
          Well isn't that just dandy?

          

          

          

          

          LT.HICOX
          Look, she's not a military strategist.
          She's just a actress.

          LT.ALDO
          Ya don't got to be Stonewall
          Jackson to know you don't want to
          fight in a basement.

          LT.HICOX
          She wasn't picking a place to fight.
          She was picking a place, isolated,
          and without germans.

          PFC.HIRSCHBERG
          Lieutenant, I hate to be contrary,
          but I got me a Nazi pissin on
          Louisianna two-o'clock.
          They move to the window, and sure enough, ONE LONE NAZI
          PRIVATE, relieves himself against the side wall.
          Lt.Bicox, this was definitely, not the plan.

          LT.HICOX
          Shit.
          Sgt.Donowitz chides him;

          SGT.DONOWITZ
          So what do you think your fraulein
          Von Hammer -

          LT.HICOX
          - Obviously, I don't know,Sgt.
          The British officer watches the German soldier, who's not
          suppose to be there. When Hugo Stiglitz joins him at the
          window. Stiglitz looks down at the urinating Nazi, S.S. dagger
          in hand.

          STIGLITZ
          If we're going, let's go.
          He sheaths the dagger.

          EXT - LA LOUISIANE (BASEMENT TAVERN) - NIGHT
          The GERMAN PISSING PRIVATE, sloppily finishes his task.
          Craming his noodle back in his pants, he descends the stairs
          that lead him back into the basement tavern. We Follow him...

          

          

          

          INT - LA LOUISIANE (BASEMENT TAVERN)- NIGHT
          .Inside the basement tavern, La Louisiane. it has a very low
          hanging basement ceiling. A old looking wood bar off to the
          right. And the only other space in the little tavern, is taken
          up by two large(at least in here) tables, which take up both
          half's of the room. And despite rumors to the contrary, one of
          the two tables, is completely filled with drunken celebrating
          Nazi enlisted men, of which our urinating friend is one of
          five.

          FIVE NAZI'S
          ONE GERMAN MASTER SGT, ONE FEMALE GERMAN SGT (a powerfully built
          stocky type), and THREE MALE GERMAN PRIVATES.
          The Five Nazi's are sitting around the table, drinking, and
          playing a very fun game with none other then the fraulein of
          the hour, UFA diva, BRIDGET VON HAMMERSMARK. Dressed to the
          nines in a chic Forties style women's suit, complete with
          fedora. The game their playing consists of each player having
          a card with the name of a famous person, real or imaginary,
          stuck to their forehead. The player doesn't know what name is
          on their forehead. So they ask the others questions to figure
          out who they are.
           The Five Germans, five cards read; MASTER SGT #1(POLA NEGRI),

          FEMALE SGT #2(BEETHOVEN), GERMAN PRIVATE #3(MATA HARI),

          GERMAN PRIVATE #4 (EDGAR WALLACE), GERMAN PRIVATE #5
           (WINNETOU). And Bridget Von Hammersmark, who wears her card in
          the brim of her fedora, has GENGHIS KHAN.
          It's German#5 (WINNETOU) turn to ask questions.
           The DIALOGUE will be in GERMAN, and SUBTITLED into ENGLISH.
          Also, while some dialogue will be written for the German
          Soldiers, it will be mostly made up from the exuberance
          of their game playing, and celebrating.

          WINNETOU
          .okay, I'm not German. Am I American?
          The whole table bursts out laughing.

          FEMALE SGT/BEETHOVEN
          Yes you arel

          EDGAR WALLACE
          Well, not really.

          SGT.POLA NEGRI
          What do you mean, not really? Of
          course he is.

          

          

          

          

          91

          EDGAR WALLACE
          Well if he's so American, how come
          he's never been translated into
          English? He's not American. He's
          suppose to be American, but he's not
          a American creation. In fact, he's
          something very different.

          WINNETOU
          Okay, I'm a fictional, literary
          character, from the past, I'm American,
          and that's controversial.

          BRIDGET/GENGUS
          No it's not controversial. The nationally
          of the author, has nothing to do with
          the nationally of the character.
          The Character is the character.
          Hamlet's not British, he's Danish.
          So yes, this character was born in
          America.

          WINNETOU
          Well I'm glad that's settled. If I had
          a wife, would she be called a squaw?
          He's got it.
          The table Laughs.
          The TABLE

          YES!

          WINNETOU
          Is my bloodbrother, Old Shatterhand?
          The TABLE
          Yes!

          WINNETOU
          Did Karl May write me?
          The TABLE
          Yes!
          In the BACKGROUND, WE SEE, our three counterfeit German
          Officers, Hicox, Wicki, and Stiglitz, enter the basement
          tavern. They obviously. see the five German soldiers, but their
          too far away for us (the audience) to read their face. No
          doubt their less then happy. Fraulein Von Hammersmark
          see's them as well. Without getting up, she waves to them.

          

          

          

          

          QZ

          BRIDGET
          Hello, my lovelies, I will join you
          in moments. I'm finishing up a game
          with my five new friends here.

          LT.HICOX
          No hurry, Frau Von Hammersmark.
          Take your time, enjoy yourself.

          BRIDGET
          (To Winnetou)
          So who are you?

          WINNETOU
          I am WINNETOU, CHIEF of the APACHES!
          The table CHEERS, and APPLAUD the Apache Chief, as he takes
          the card off his forehead.
          The other Four German Soldiers drink down there beer(part of
          the game).
          Bridget Von Hammersmark knock backs her champagne.

          MATA HARI
          Frau Von Hammersmark, when your
          friends came in, did you realize
          you did a double take, like in the
          movies?

          BRIDGET
          Really? No, I wasn't aware of that
          at all.

          MATA HARI
          They must be second nature to you now?
          Did they teach you how to do a double
          take in the movies?

          BRIDGET
          Well, yes they did, but it's not really
          that difficult.

          SGT.POLA NEGRI
          Do one for us.
          The Tableheartily agrees.
          Bridget looks directly at the Master Sgt, and does a perfect,
          and perfectly funny, Double Take.
          The Table loves it.

          

          

          

          
          q3.

          MATA HARI
          My turn, I want to try.
          Mata Hari, looks directly at Beethoven, and does a Double
          Take.

          EDGER WALLACE
          I want to try.
          He does.
          Soon the whole Table is doing dueling Double Takes.

          HICOX - WICKI - STIGLITZ
          watch the table do dueling Double Takes. Obviously, they don't
          understand.

          THEN...
          .Bridget Von Hammersmark rises, and excuses herself from the
          Table. She removes the card stuck in her fedora, looking at
          the name Gengus Khaun for the first time.

          BRIDGET
          Gengus Khaun! I would never of gotten that.
          She walks over, and joins the masquerading Germans table, the
          Gentlemen rise. She greets each warmly with a french cheek
          kiss, as if she knows them well.
          They all take a seat. The two Basterds, and one Brit, drink
          Whiskey. The taverns PROPRIETOR, a older, big bellyed
          Frenchman named EARL, comes over to the table, and pours more
          champagne into Bridget's Champagne glass. He leaves, returning
          back behind the bar, with the YOUNG FRENCH BARMAID, the only other
          person in the establishment.
          Obviously, they speak GERMAN, SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;

          LT.HICOX
          I thought this place was suppose to
          have more French then Germans?

          BRIDGET
          Normally that's true. The Sgt over
          there's wife, just had a baby. His
          commanding officer gave him, and his
          mates the night off to celebrate.

          WICXI
          We should leave.

          

          

          

          

          BRIDGET
          F No, we should stay. For one drink at
          least. I've been waiting for you in a
          bar, it would look strange if we left
          before we had a drink.

          LT.HICOX
          She's right, just be calm, and enjoy
          your booze.

          BACK TO THE GERMAN TABLE
          The French Barmaid, has taken Bridget's place in the rousing,
          rowdy game. She tells them, her person must be French, or she
          won't know them. Winnetou thinks for a moment, then writes a
          name on a card. The Barmaid puts it on her forehead, It says;

          NAPOLEON.
          The Germans all laugh.

          BACK TO THE BASTERDS TABLE

          BRIDGET
          There's been some new developments.
          The cinema venue has changed.

          LT.HICOX
          Why?

          BRIDGET
          No one knows. But that in itself
          shouldn't be a problem. The cinema
          it's been changed to is considerably
          smaller then The Ritz. So whatever
          materials you brought for The Ritz,
          should be doubly effective here.
          Now this next piece of information
          is colossal, try not to over react.
          The Fubrer, will be attending tomorrow.
          Hugo Stiglitz does a SPIT TAKE.
          Bridget's eyes bore holes in him.

          BACK TO THE REAL GERMANS
          They see Hugo do the spit take, and burst out laughing.
          Keeping it up, they begin to do dueling spit takes, like they
          did dueling double takes earlier. Needless to say, they all
          get wet.

          

          

          

          

          9

          BACK TO BASTERDS

          BRIDGET
          (To Hicox)
          You'll be going as Ernst Schuller.
          You'll say your a associate producer
          on Riefenstahl's "Tiefland". It's the
          one German production not under Goebbels
          control, and Leni wouldn't be caught dead
          at a Goebbels film affair.

          BACK TO REAL GERMAN TABLE
          Master Sgt.Pola Negri, drinks his beer, as he looks over,
          dreamily, at Bridget Von Hammersmark at the other table.

          BACK TO BASTERDS
          We See in Bridget continues to brief Hicox on his identity.
          the B.G., the German Master Sgt stand up from his table, and
          head toward Fraulein Von Bammersmark.

          BRIDGET
          .the films gone through many delays,
          and Leni's heath is deteriorating, so
          if you have to speak...
          Hicox, seeing the German Master Sgt approach, signals for her
          to cool it.

          SGT.POLA NEGRI
          Frau Von Hammersmark, I was just
          thinking, could you sign a autograph
          to my son on his birthday?

          BRIDGET
          I'd love to Wilhelm.
          (To the Table)
          This handsome happy Sgt, just became
          a father today.
          The Pretend Officers offer congratulations to the Sgt.
          The German Master Sgt, CLICKS his heels, and bows before his
          superior officers.

          SGT.POLA NEGRI
          Thank you, heil Hitler.
          He raises his hand .... as do the seated phony officers; "Heil
          Hitler".
          As she takes a rather fancy fountain pen from her clutch..

          BRIDGET
          So Wilhelm, do you know the name of
          this progeny yet?

          

          

          

          

          SGT.POLA NEGRI
          I most certainly do, fraulein. His
          name is Maximilian.
          Even the slightly psychotic Stiglitz, likes this German Sgt.

          STIGLITZ
          Wonderful name, Sgt.

          SGT.POLA NEGRI
          Thank you, Lieutenant. When he's old
          enough to ride a bicycle, I will buy
          him a blue one. And I will paint on
          the side "The Blue Max".
          He thrusts out his beer stein, for the officers to cheers.
          They do.
          Bridget finishes signing her autograph, with a big flourish.

          BRIDGET
          There you go. But wait, I'm not finished yet.
          She reaches into her clutch, and pulls out some lipstick.
          Applies some ruby red color to her lips, and then kisses the
          napkin, leaving a big red lip print. Then hands the treasured
          item to the young father.

          BRIDGET
          Nothing but the best for little Maximilian.

          SGT.POLA NEGRI
          Thank you fraulein, thank you. Max may
          not know who you are now. But he will.
          I will show him all of your movies.
          He will grow up with your films,
          and this napkin on his wall.
          Then, to the whole tavern...

          SGT.POLA NEGRI
          I purpose a toast to the greatest actress
          in Germany! There is no Dietrich, there is
          no Riefenstahl, only Von Hammersmark!
          The whole room toasts.
          This would be a good time for the German Sgt to go back to his
          table, and his men. And he almost does.... but... since he is
          drunk, and star struck, he out wears his welcome.

          SGT.POLA NEGRI
          So, Frau Von Hammersmark, what brings
          you to France?

          

          

          

          

          97 .
          Feeling any good Nazi officer's patience would of been
          exhausted long ago, Lt.Hicox butts in.

          LT.HICOX
          None of your business,Sgt.
          You might not have worn out your welcome
          with the fraulein, with your drunken
          boorish behavior, but you have wore out
          your welcome with me.
          The Table of game playing Soldiers, hear this, and get quiet.

          LT.HICOX
          Might I remind you Sgt.,your a enlisted
          man. This is a officers table. I suggest
          you stop pestering the fraulein, and
          rejoin your table.
          The German Master Sgt., looks quizzically at the officer.

          SGT.POLA NEGRI
          Excuse me Cap't, but your accent is
          is very unusual.
          The whole room pauses-for different reasons...

          SGT.POLA NEGRI
          Where are you from?
          A silent moment passes between the two tables, then the two
          German born impostors spring into action.

          WICKI
          Sgt.! You must be ether drunk or mad,
          to speak to a superior officer with
          such impertinentness!
          Stiglitz, STANDS and YELLS to the other table;

          STIGLITZ
          I'm making YOU,...
          (Pointing at

          WINNETOU)
          .and YOU,..
          (Pointing at
          Edgar Wallace)
          .responsible, for him.
          (Pointing at
          Sgt.Pola)
          I suggest you take hold of your friend,
          or he'll spend Max's first birthday
          in jail for public drunkenness!

          

          

          

          

          78
          The Germans SPRING UP, and take hold of Sgt.Pola...

          1W

          WHEN...
          A GERMAN VOICE rings out;

          GERMAN VOICE (OS)
          Then might I inquire?
          The Five known Germans move aside, reveling the unknown German
          in the room, unseen till now, our old friend from before
          MAJOR DEITER HELLSTROM of the GESTAPO. The Major stands from
          the little table he was sitting at.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          Like the young newly christened father,
          I too have a acute ear for accents.
          And like him, I too find yours odd.
          From where do you hail, Cap't?
          Wicki jumps in;

          WICKI
          Major, this is highly inappr -

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          T wasn't speaking to you
          Lt.Saltzberg,
          (Turning to

          STIGLITZ)
          or you ether, Lt.Berlin.
          (Looking at

          HICOX)
          I was speaking to Cap't I--don't-know-what.
          The Gestapo Major is now standing beside Sgt.Pola, before the
          impostors table.
          Lt.Hicox, calmly explains his origin.

          LT.HICOX
          I was born in the village that rests
          in the shadow of Piz Palu.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          The mountain?

          LT.HICOX
          Yes. In that village we all speak like
          this. Have you seen the Riefenstahl film?

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          Yes.

          

          

          

          
          f q s

          LT. HICOX
          Then you saw me. You remember the skiing
          torch scene?

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          Yes I do.

          LT.HICOX
          In that scene was myself, my father,
          my sister, and my two brothers. My
          brother is so handsome, the director
          Pabst, gave him a Close Up.
          As Bridget Von Hammersmark places a cigarette in a ivory
          cigarette holder, which Hicox, as if on cue, lights for her,
          she says;

          BRIDGET
          Major, if my word means anything, I can
          vouch for everything the Young Cap't has
          just said. He does hail from the bottom
          of Piz Palu, he was in the film,
          and his brother is far more handsome
          then he.
          The impostors laugh.
          Then....so does the Gestapo Major. He turns to the Sgt.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          You should rejoin your friends.
          Which the young Sgt is more then happy to do. That table
          begins playing there game again.
          Major Hellstrom, the highest ranking officer in the room, bows
          graciously to the female German celebrity.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          May I join you?

          BRIDGET
          By all means, Major.
          The Gestapo Major sits at the table, opposite Lt.Hicox, and
          Wicki. The French Barmaid brings over the Majors beer stein.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          So that's the source of your bazaar
          accent? Extraordinary. So what are
          you doing here Cap't?

          LT.HICOX
          Aside from having a drink with the lovely
          fraulein?

          

          

          

          

          ,00 .

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          Well that pleasure requires no explanation.
          Chuckle...Chuckle

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          I mean in country. Your obviously not
          stationed in France, or I'd know who
          you are.

          LT Ã¢â¬Â¢ I'! I COX
          You know every German in France?

          MAJOR BELLSTROM
          Worth knowing.

          LT.HICOX
          Well, there in lies the problem. We
          never claimed to be worth knowing.
          Chuckle... Chuckle.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          (Chuckling as
          he asks)
          All levity aside, what are you doing
          in France?

          LT.HICOX
          Attending Goebbels film premiere as
          the frauleins escort.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          Your the frauleins escort?

          LT.HICOX
          Somebody has to carry the lighter.
          Chuckle chuckle.

          BRIDGET
          The Captain is my date, but all three
          are my guests. We're old friends Major,
          who go back along time. Longer then
          a actress would care to admit.
          Chuckle chuckle.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          Well, in that case, let me raise a glass
          to the three luckiest men in the room.

          BRIDGET
          I'll drink to that.

          

          

          

          

          101
          They cheers.

          BACK TO THE REAL GERMAN TABLE
          They continue to have alot of fun playing their game.

          BACK TO OFFICERS TABLE

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          I must say, that game their playing
          looks like a good bit of fun. I didn't
          join them, because your quite right Cap't,
          officers and enlisted men shouldn't
          fraternize. But seeing as we're all
          officers here,
          (Bowing to

          BRIDGET)
          .and sophisticated lady friends of
          officers. What say we play the game?
          Lt.Hicox begins to refuse, when Bridget (feeling she knows
          better), interrupts him;

          BRIDGET
          okay, one game.

          The Major borrows five cards from the other table, and lays
          them out in front of Bridget and the officers.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          So the object of the game, is to write
          the name of a famous person on your card.
          Real or fictitious, doesn't matter. For
          instance, you could write Confucius or
          Fu Manchu.
          (He SNAPS his

          FINGERS)
          Eric' More pens.
          (Back to players)
          And they must be famous. No Aunt Inga's.
          When you finish writing, put the card
          face down on the table, and move it to
          the person to your left. The person to
          your right, will move their card in
          front of you. You pick up the card
          without looking at it, lick the back,
          and stick it on your forehead like so.
          He demonstrates.

          And in ten yes or no questions, you must
          guess who you are...
          As Major Hellstrom finishes explaining the finer points of the
          game, The CAMERA PANS OFF HIM, and BEGINS SLOWLY ZOOMING INTO
          STIGLITZ. The Majors dialogue begins to FADE AWAY.
          Untill we're in a SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK. Which is RED
          FILTERED FOOTAGE of Hugo being savagely WHIPPED by somebody
          wearing a GESTAPO UNIFORM, SUPERIMPOSED over his CLOSE UP.
          The Flashback disappears. It's driving Stiglitz crazy, being
          this close to a Gestapo uniform, and not plunging a knife into
          it.
          The Majors Voice comes back on the soundtrack.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          .So let's give it a try, shall we?
          Everybody write your names.
          The Five players write their names...
          Then move their cards to the right...
          Everybody sticks their cards on their forehead...

          Am I German?

          No.

          MAJ.KING KONG
          Am I a American?
          They laugh - but then Wicki says;

          Wait a minute, he goes to

          Don't be ridiculous, obviously he wasn't
          born in America.

          MAJ.KING KONG
          So... . I visited America, aye?
          The Table says; "Yes".

          MAJ.KING KONG
          Was this vist...fortuitous?

          WICKI
          Not for you.

          MAJ.KING KONG
          .Bummm. My native land, is it what
          one would call, exotic?
          The Table confers, and decides, yes it is exotic.

          MAJ.KING KONG
          Hummmm. That could be ether a reference
          to the jungle, or the Orient. I'm going
          to let my first instinct take over, and
          ask, am I from the jungle?
          The Tablesays; "Yes you are".

          MAJ.KING KONG
          Now gentlemen, around this time you could
          ask, weather your real or fictitious.
          I however, think that's too easy, so I
          won't ask that, yet. Okay, my native land
          is the jungle? I visited America, but my
          visit was not fortuitous to me, but the
          implication is that it was to somebody
          else. When I went from the jungle to
          America,... .Did I go by boat?
          "Yes".

          MAJ.KING KONG
          Did I go against my will?
          "Yes".

          displayed in chains?
          "Yes".

          MAJ.KING KONG
          Am I the story of the Negro in America?
          The Table says, "No".

          Well then I must be King Kong.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          Now, who's next?

          LT.HICOX
          Major, I don't mean to be rude. But the
          four of us are very good friends. And
          the four of us haven't seen each other
          in quite a while. So...
          Major, I'm afraid, you are intruding.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          I beg to differ Cap't. It's only if the
          fraulein considers my presence a
          intrusion, that I become a intruder.
          How about it fraulein? Am I intruding?

          BRIDGET
          Of course not, Major.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          I didn't think so. It's simply the young
          Cap't is immune to my charms.
          The Table's not sure what to do, is this a confrontation?
          Then, the Major laughs.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          I'm just joking, of course I'm intruding.

          

          

          

          

          MAJOR HELLSTROM

          Eric has a bottle of thirty-three year old
          single malt scotch whisky from the
          Scottish highlands. What do you say
          gentlemen?

          LT.HICOX
          Your most gracious, sir.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          Eric, the thirty-three, and new glasses!
          You don't want to contaminate the thirty-
          three with the swill you were drinking.

          ERIC
          How many glasses?

          LT.HICOX
          Five glasses.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          Not me. I like scotch, scotch doesn't like
          me.

          BRIDGET
          Nor I. I'll stay with bubbly.
          Lt.Bicox, hold up three fingers(pinky to index), to Eric the
          owner.

          LT.HICOX

          They all mutter, "a thousand year reich", and toast glasses.
          The Gestapo Major puts down his beer stein, and then WE HEAR a
          CLICK, under the table.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          Did you hear that? That's the sound of
          my Luger pointed right at your testicles.

          Because you've just given yourself
          away, Cap't. Your no more German then
          that scotch.

          You were saying?

          LT.HICOX
          I was saying that makes two of us. I've
          had a gun pointed at your balls since
          you sat down.

          SGT.STIGLITZ
          That makes three of us.

          UNDERTABLE

          as Bridget's legs, right besides the Nazi Major's. Her pretty
          gams are sure to be chewed up in the possible crossfire.

          of a sticky situation here.

          LT. H ICOX
          What's going to happen, Major, is your
          going to stand up, and walk out that
          door with us.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          No no no no no no, I don't think so.
          I'm afraid you and I both know, no matter
          what happens to anybody else in this room,
          the two of us aren't going anywhere.

          the Nazi Major bought him, and says;

          There's a special rung in hell reserved
          for people who waste good scotch.
          And seeing as I might be rapping on

          girl, and leave! That simple, Willi!
          You go your way, we go ours! And little
          Max, gets to grow up playing catch with
          his daddy! So what'ya say, Willi, we
          got a deal?
          Willi thinks...
          Bridget watches Willi think...

          WILLI
          Aldo?

          ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
          I'm here Willi!

          WILLI
          I want to trust you.... But howcanI?

          ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
          What choice ya got?

          WILLI
          I could kill the girl!

          ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
          Well now, Willi, that's true enough.
          But something you need to know, so
          you don't get the wrong idea. Ain't
          none of us give a fuck bout that
          girl. But, admittedly, if you kill
          her, it would fuck up our plans. But
          you'll be dead by then anyway, so
          what'd you care? And lets not
          forget that little gatzenjammer
          Max, growin up without a pop. So in
          the spirit of gettin you home to
          him, we got a deal, Willi?

          WILLI
          Okay Aldo, I'm going to trust you!
          Come down, no guns!
          Aldo and Hirschberg come down the stairs, showing open hands.
          Willi keeps his machine gunn trained on them.
          Aldo with his hands up, says;

          A

          

          

          

          

          ALDO
          Hey Willi, what's with the machine
          gunny I thought we had a deal?

          WILLI
          We do have a deal, now git the girl
          and go.

          ALDO
          Not so fast, Willi, we only have a
          deal, we trust each other. A Mexican
          stand off ain't trust.

          WILLI
          You need guns on me for it to be
          a Mexican stand off.

          ALDO
          you got guns on us, you decide to
          shoot, we're dead. Up top, they got
          grenades, they drop 'em down here,
          your dead. That's a Mexican stand
          off, and that wasn't the deal.

          WILLI
          Just take that fucking traitor, and
          go! See? Now your down here
          Now you get tricky - t

          ALDO
          - No tricks!- Ain't nobody gittin
          tricky, Willi; I swear to god, I'm
          too damn dumb toget tricky. But

          (MEANING

          HIRSCHBERG)
          him and I lived upto the deal. We
          came down without guns. Now it's
          your turn. No trust,no deal.
          Willi pointing gunn at them.,,, -thinking...

          ALDO
          i know your scarred. I'm scarred,
          he's scarred, we're all scarred.
          So what's it gonnabe Willi?
          Ether we got a deal, or you might
          as well just shoot us now.
          Willi decides...
          He puts the machine gunn down on the bar.

          

          

          

          

          WILLI
          Fine. Take that fucking traitor and
          get her out of my sight.

          ALDO
          Danka, Willi, danka. okay, Hirschbeg,
          you grab her shoulder -

          WHEN...
          From behind Aldo and Hirschberg, Bridget lifts up Major
          Hellstroms Luger, and EMPTIES the remaining bullets into
          Sgt.Willi, who FALLS to the floor, DEAD.
          Aldo and Hirscberg spin around shocked.

          ALDO
          You fuckin bitch! I had a deal with
          that man!
          From the floor, the bloody, sweaty, and in excoriating pain
          (she'll probably lose that leg), German movie star, says to the
          two American soldier's she's just meeting for the first time;

          BRIDGET
          He was a enemy soldier, who knew who
          I was. He couldn't live.

          3
          Hirscberg loses control, and RICKS the woman on the floor,
          hard in the side.

          HIRSCHBERG
          I ought'a beat your fuckin head in

          ALDO
          Stop it. Just pick her up, and get
          that bitch outta here.

          HIRSCHBERG
          Aldo, she just-

          ALDO
          - She's right.

          HIRSCHBERG
          What?

          ALDO
          I said, she's right. He was a Nazi
          soldier. If he lived, he would doomed
          the mission.

          Don't mean I like it, don't mean I
          like her, but she's right. Now as
          Willi said, "take this fuckin
          traitor, and get 'er outta my sight".

          Hirschberg, carrying Fraulein Von Hammersmark, and Aldo emerge
          from the bowels of the basement.
          Bridget points at a fancy black sedan, telling them it's her's.

          A OLD MAN lies asleep under the covers of his blankets, in his
          bed, in his bedroom...

          WHEN...
          OFF SCREEN the sound of a DOOR BEING KICKED OPEN...
          r .The SOUND of what sounds like EIGHT DOGS BARKING .... and the
          sound of FEET RUNNING TOWARDS US...
          .his bedroom door, is THROWN OPEN, and Sgt.Donowitz RUSHES
          IN, grabbing the Old Man in his bed, and putting a
          45Automatic to his head.

          What? What's happening?
          head, shocking, Donny SLAMS the 45. hard against the Old Man's
          scarring, and bringing the old gent to attention.

          SGT.DONOWITZ

          (ENGLISH)
          Doctor? Are you a fucking doctor?
          He nods his head, yes.

          Donny YANKS/DRAGS the Old Man out of bed, in his almost
          comical nightshirt (which makes him cuter, thus the brutality
          against him hurts more) towards the door...

          INT - DOCTORS EXAMINING ROOM - NIGHT
          .Into a doctors examining room, built into a French country
          house, with a examining table, and medical instruments.
          However, it's obviously the medical examining room
          of a veterinarian.
          Along the walls are different cages with eight excited BARKING
          dogs in it.
          The Soldiers are putting the shot in the leg, bleeding, and in
          excruciating pain, Bridget on the examining table.
          Donny, still holding on to the Old Man, points in the girls
          direction...

          SGT.DONOWITZ

          (ENGLISH)
          She's been shot. Shot. Bang bang...

          OLD MAN

          (FRENCH)
          No no no, I don't speak English.
          Donny jams the barrel of his 45. into the thigh of the Old Man.

          SGT.DONOWITZ

          (ENGLISH)
          BANG BANG - in the leg, understand!
          The Old Man nods his head yes.

          It's still a doctor. If he can get
          a bullet out of a cow, he can get
          a bullet outta you.

          LT.ALDO
          Right now, we just need morphine.
          Donny yells at the Old Man;

          SGT.DONOWITZ
          Morphine! We need morphine!
          The Old Man tries to explain in French, that he's not a human
          doctor...

          WHEN...
          ..Donny takes the 45. and SHOOTS one of the DOGS in the
          cages.
          Everybody jumps.
          Donny SCREAMS at the Old Man;

          SGT.DONOWITZ

          MORPHINE!!!

          BANG
          He SHOOTS another dog...

          SGT.DONOWITZ

          The Old Man begs him to stop, and goes to get the morphine.

          INT - LA LOUISTANE- NIGHT
          Were back in the basement tavern. Colonel Hans Landa stands
          over the corpse. He moves over to the next corpse, a smile
          breaks out on his face.
          He says in GERMAN SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;

          COL.LANDA
          Ahhh Hugo, you've moved up in the
          world I see. Lieutenant. And with
          your record of insubordination.
          Truly remarkable.

          Austrian born jew, who immigrated
          to the United States when things
          began turning sour for the Israelites.
          They are the two German born members of
          The Basterds. They've been known
          to don german uniforms, to ambush squads.

          FLASH ON
          Three Nazi Soldiers walking towards a company of other German
          Soldiers. The Three Soldiers backs are to us. Dried bloody
          bullet holes cover the backs of the three uniforms.
          The SGT of the German company, yells to the trio;

          SGT.GERMAN COMPANY
          What brings you all the way out here?

          But that doesnt look like this.
          This is odd.
          Looking down he see's something...
          .bending down, he examines fraulein von Hammersmarks two
          pretty dress shoes lying on the floor.
          One shoe is covered in blood.
          The other, while blood speckled, is fairly clean.
          Picking up the clean shoe, and holding it in his hand.

          COL.LANDA
          It would appear somebodies missing.
          Somebody fashionable.
          A OFF SCREEN SOLDIER'S VOICE cries out;

          Col, this ones still alive!
          We follow Hans to the spot on the floor where Sgt.Willi lies.
          He's shot in the chest, but it looks like Max's daddy is still
          alive.

          The other Basterds in the room watch Aldo interrogate the
          German lady.

          LT.ALDO
          Now 'fore we yank that slug outta ya,
          you need to answer a few questions

          BRIDGET
          Few questions about what?

          LT.ALDO
          About I got three men dead back there,
          and why don't you try tellin us what
          the fuck happened?

          BRIDGET
          The British officer blew his German
          act, and a Gestapo Major saw it.

          LT.ALDO
          'fore we get into who shot John,
          why did you invite my men to a
          rendez-vous in a basement with a bunch
          of Nazis?

          BRIDGET
          I can see, since you didn't see
          what happened inside, the Nazi's
          being there must look odd.

          LT.ALDO
          Yeah, we gotta word for that kinda
          odd in English, it's called,
          suspicious.

          BRI DGET
          Don't let your imagination get the
          better of you, Lieutenant. You met
          the sergeant, Willi. He had a baby
          tonight. His commanding officer gave
          him and his friends the night off to
          celebrate. The Germans being there
          was just a tragic coincidence.
          Aldo thinks for a moment...

          LT. ALDO
          Okay, I'll buy that. He was ether
          there with his men waiting for us,
          or he was there celebrating his
          sons birthday, he wasn't doin both.

          

          

          

          

          120.

          LT.ALDO
          How did the shootin start?

          BRIDGET
          The English man, gave himself away.

          LT. ALDO
          How did he do that?

          BRIDGET
          He ordered three glasses.
          She holds up three fingers, index to pinky.

          BRIDGET
          We order, three glasses.
          She holds up three fingers, thumb to index.

          BRIDGET
          That's the German three. The other
          is odd. Germans would, and did notice it.

          LT. ALDO
          Okay, let's pretend there were no
          Germans, and everything went exactly
          the way it was suppose to. What would
          of been the next step?

          BRIDGET
          Tuxedos. To get them into the
          premiere, wearing military uniforms,
          with all the military there, would
          of been suicide. But going as
          members of the German film industry,
          they wear tuxedos, and blend in with
          everybody else. I arranged a tailor
          to fit three tuxedos tonight.

          LT.ALDO
          How did you intend to get them into
          the premiere?

          BRIDGET
          Hand me my purse.
          They do. And she opens it, and takes out three tickets to the
          film premiere.

          BRIDGET
          Lt.Hicox was going as my escort.
          The other two were going as a German
          cameraman and his assistant.

          LT. ALDO
          Can you still get us in that
          premiere?

          BRIDGET
          Can you speak German better then your
          friends, no. Have I been shot, yes.
          I don't see me tripping the light
          fantastique up the red carpet any
          time soon. Least of all by tomorrow
          night.

          (PAUSE)
          However, there's something you don't
          know. There's been two recent
          developments regarding Operation
          Kino. One, the venue has been
          changed from The Ritz, to a much
          smaller venue.

          LT.ALDO
          Enormous changes at the last minute?
          That's not very Germatic. Why the
          hell is Goebbels doin stuff so damn
          peculiar?

          BRIDGET
          It probably has something to do with
          the second development.

          LT. ALDO
          Which is?

          FLASH ON
          IN A PRIVATE DINNING ROOM IN GERMANY, The FUHRER, aka Adolph
          Hitler, aka Adolph Shicklegroover, aka The Bohemian Corporal,
          having dinner with Goebbels, only a few short days ago.
          The FUHRER

          (GERMAN)
          I've been rethinking my position in
          regards to your Paris premiere of
          "Nations Pride". As the weeks have
          gone on, and the Americans are on
          the beach, I do find myself thinking
          more and more about this Private
          Zoller. This boy has done something
          tremendous for us. And I'm beginning
          to think my participation in this
          event could be meaningful.

          BACK TO BRIDGET

          BRIDGET
          The Fuhrer's attending the premiere.

          What?

          LT.ALDO
          When the hell did this happen?

          The venue change, two weeks ago.
          The Fuhrer's attendance, four days
          ago.

          LT. ALDO
          And how come London don't know
          nothing about that?

          BRIDGET
          We need to get something straight,
          once and for all. Everything London
          knows, it learned from me. If I
          don't know, London doesn't know.
          So now, this is me, informing you,
          Hitler's coming to Paris.

          SGT.DONOWITZ

          FUCK A DUCK?
          Aldo stands up from the chair, pacing as he takes in this new
          information.

          BRIDGET
          What are you thinking?

          LT.ALDO
          I'm thinking getting a wack at
          plantin ole Uncle Adolph makes
          this a horse of a different color.

          BRIDGET
          What's that suppose to mean?

          LT.ALDO
          It means, your gettin us in that
          premiere.

          BRIDGET
          I'm going to probably end up losing
          this leg, bye bye acting career,
          fun while it lasted. How do you
          expect me to walk up a red carpet?

          The doggie docs gonna dig that slug
          outta your gam. Then he's gonna wrap
          it up in a cast, and you gotta good
          how I broke my leg mountain climbing
          story. That's German, ain't it?
          Y'all like climbin mountains,
          don'tch?

          BRIDGET
          I don't. I like smoking, drinking,
          and ordering in restaurants, but I
          see your point.

          LT. ALDO
          We fill ya up with morphine, till
          it's comin out ya ears. Then just
          limp your little ass up that
          rouge car-pet.

          BRIDGET
          Splendid. When the Nazi's put me up
          against a wall, it won't hurt
          so much.
          (Changing tone)
          I know this is a silly question
          before I ask it, but can you
          American's speak any other language
          then English?

          HIRSCHBERG
          Other then Yiddish?

          BRIDGET
          Preferably.
          Donny referring to Aldo and himself.

          SGT.DONOWITZ
          We both speak alittle Italian.

          BRIDGET
          With a atrocious accent, no doubt.
          But that doesn't exactly kill us
          in the crib. Germans don't have a
          good ear for Italian. So you mumble
          Italian, and brazen through it, is
          that the plan?

          LT. ALDO
          That's about it.

          

          

          

          

          BRIDGET
          That sounds good.

          LT. ALDO
          it sounds like shit, but what else
          we gonna do, go home?

          BRIDGET
          No, it's good. If you don't blow it,
          with that, I can get you in the
          building.
          (Change tone)
          So, who does what?

          LT.ALDO
          Well I speak the most Italian, so
          I'll be your escort. Donowitz speaks
          the second most, so he'll be your
          Italian cameraman. And Hirschberg
          third most, so he'll be Donnys
          assistant.

          HIRSCHBERG
          I don't speak Italian.

          LT. ALDO
          Like I said, third best. Just keep
          your fuckin mouth shut. In fact why
          don't you start practising, right now.

          BRIDGET
          (Meaning Utivich)
          What about the little one?

          UTIVICH
          Do you mean me?

          BRIDGET
          I didn't mean any offence.

          UTIVICH
          None taken you German cunt.

          LT.ALDO
          Utivich is the chauffeur.

          UTIVICH
          I can't drive.
          Bridget SCREAMS in frustration;

          BRIDGET
          You Americans are fucking useless!

          

          

          

          

          UTIVICH
          IVGimmie a break, I'm from Manhattan.

          LT.ALDO
          No worries, son. We got over fourteen
          hours before the movie tomorrow.
          More then enough time for you to learn
          to drive.

          UTIVICH
          NO no no no, Lieutenant, it's not!

          LT.ALDO
          Oh yes yes yes yes, Private, it is.
          And yes yes yes yes, you will.
          (Changes tone)
          Look Utivich, you and I both know,
          if we went to grade school together,
          you damn sure ain't copyin off of my
          test. Well I lern't to drive in four
          hours on a Tennessee mountain road.
          And I'm a shit for brains coal miner
          bootlegger. Hirschberg, you know how
          to drive, right?

          HIRSCHBERG
          Yes.

          LT.ALDO
          Teach 'em.

          BRIDGET
          But there is a problem. I'm a movie
          star. This is a movie premiere.
          I can't show up looking like I was
          just in a Nazi gun fight. Now I
          have a dress for the premiere at my
          hotel. But sometime tomorrow, I
          have to get my hair done.
          All The Basterds, except Donny, burst out laughing.

          LT. ALDO
          Sister, you must got wunderbar luck.
          Guess who went to beauty school?

          CHAPTER FIVE

          "REVENGE OF THE GIANT FACE"

           FADE OFF

          INT - SHOSANNAS AND MARCELS LIVING QUARTERS - NIGHT
          We're in Shosannas and Marcels living quarters, above the
          cinema. We've never been in here before.

          A SUBTITLE APPEARS ON SCREEN:

          NIGHT OF "NATION'S PRIDE" PREMIERE
          She's standing before a full length mirror, in a real
          attractive Forties style dress for the premiere. She's stunning.
          This is the first time in her life she's had the opportunity,
          or the occasion to wear something like this. Since she knows
          this is the last night of her life, no time like the present.
          SOUNDS of the hub-bub of the premiere, not to mention the
          German brass band that's blaring Third Reich Marches, can be
          heard coming from below.
          Shosanna walks to her apartment window, and looks down at the
          Germatic miasma below.
          SHOSANNAS POV: WE SEE all the pageantry below. Tons of
          SPECTATORS. Tons of guests dressed in Nazi uniforms, tuxedos,
          and female finery, walking up the long red carpet(with a big
          Swastika in the middle, naturally) leading into Shosannas
          cinema. The German brass band omm-pa-pa-ing away. German Radio
          and Film crews covering the event for the fatherland back
          home. And of course, MANY GERMAN SOLDIERS providing security
          for this joyous Germatic occasion.
          Shosanna COUGHS up a lugi, and HOCKS it.
          A GERMAN S.S. GENERAL, being interviewed by a RADIO COMMENTATOR,
          the lugi HITS him right on his bald head.
          Shosanna goes back to the full length mirror, places a very
          fashionable Forties style hat on her head, then lowers the
          period style black fish net veil over her face. She takes out
          a small GUN, and puts it in the pocket of her dress., and it's
          on. She exits the apartment door, to join the premiere.
          From this point on, there's no turning back, it's all the way
          baby, all the fucking way!

          INT - CINEMA STAIRWELL - NIGHT
          The stairwell in the building that connects the living
          quarters, with the cinema. She walks down the stairs, goes
          through a door that puts her next to the projection booth
          door. She takes out a key and opens it.

          INT - PROJECTION BOOTH - NIGHT
          Marcels prepping the film reels for tonight. The five silver
          metal film cans that carry one 35mm reel of film each are laid
          out. The cans for reels one and two are empty. Cans for reel
          three, our specially marked can for reel four, and can for
          reel five(which should never see the light of a projector)
          lie in wait.
          Shosanna, looking like a Forties movie star, enters the
          projection booth.
          The scene in FRENCH SUBTITLED in ENGLISH;

          MARCEL
          Ooh lala, Danielle Darrieux, this
          is so exciting. Pleased to meet you.

          SHOSANNA
          Shut up fool.
          Marcel lifts up the veil covering her face, and their lips
          meet.

          SHOSANNA
          Cheeky black bugger. I have to go
          down and socialize with these Hun
          pigs. Let's go over it again?

          MARCEL
          Reel one is on the first projector.
          Reel two is on the second. Three
          and four are ready to go.

          SHOSANNA
          Okay, the big sniper battle in the
          film begins around the middle of
          the third reel. Our film, comes on
          in the forth reel, so Somewhere
          towards the end of the third reel,
          go down and lock the doors of the
          auditorium. Then take your place
          behind the screen, and wait for my
          CUE, when I give it to you, BURN IT DOWN!

          INT - CINEMA LOBBY - NIGHT
          The pageantry of the evening is in full swing, as all the
          German beautiful people, enter the cinema. They mingle in the
          swastika covered, greek nude statue peppered lobby. Nazi
          Military Commanders, High Ranking Party Officials, and German
          Celebrities(Emil tannings, Veit Harlin), hob knob and drink
          Champagne from passing WAITERS who carry glasses on silver
          trays.
          We see Shosanna enter from the area at the top of the big
          staircase in the lobby that overlooks the lobby parlor
          entrance. She descends the staircase, and busies herself with
          theatre stuff.
          At the top of the staircase, looking down at the master race
          in all there finery, is Colonel Hans Landa, dressed in his
          finest SS Uniform, smoking on his Calabash.

          CAMERA FRAME
          directly behind him. On the right side, we see the figure of
          Col.Landa, from behind, watching the guests entering the
          cinema. On the left side of frame, is the cinema entrance,
          from a looking down perspective of the guests entering the
          building.

          THEN...
          .A THINK BUBBLE, like in a comic book, appears on the left
          side of frame, obscuring the cinema entrance. Inside of Landas
          think bubble, a little scene plays out.

          THINK BUBBLE
          Inside a hospital room filled with DOCTORS, NURSES, and a
          PATIENT in a hospital bed. Then Col.Landa enters the room, and
          screams at everybody;

          COL.LANDA
          I want everybody out of this room!
          They start to leave.

          COL.LANDA
          That means now, goddamnit!
          They RUSH OUT.
          He walks over to the Patient in the hospital bed, Its none
          other then SGT.WILLI, and yes, he's still alive.
          Landa pulls up a chair next to the bed, sits down.

          COL.LANDA
          Can you speak, Sgt?

          

          

          

          

          L - )1.

          SGT.WILLI

          (WEAKLY)
          Yes Colonel.

          COL.LANDA
          Tell me everything that happened in
          there?
          The THINK BUBBLE DISSOLVES away, reveling the entrance again,
          and as if on perfect cue, in walks Bridget Von Hammersmark,
          dressed lovely, leg in a big white cast. The three basterds in
          their tuxedos, flank her.

          CU COL.LANDA
          smiles.
          He descends the stairs, towards the four saboteurs...
          They speak in GERMAN, SUBTITLED in ENGLISH;

          COL.LANDA
          Fraulein Von Hammersmark, what
          has befallen Germany's most elegant
          swan?

          BRIDGET
          Colonel Landa, it's been years.
          Dashing as ever I see.

          COL.LANDA
          Flattery will get you everywhere,
          fraulein.
          They chuckle, and air kiss.

          COL.LANDA
          So what's happened to your lovely
          leg, a by product of kicking ass in
          the German cinema, no doubt.

          BRIDGET
          Save your flattery, you old dog.
          I know too many of your former
          conquests, to fall into that honey
          pot.
          Chuckle-chuckle...

          COL.LANDA
          Seriously, what happened?

          

          

          

          

          130.

          BRIDGET
          Well, I tried my hand, foolishly I
          might add, at mountain climbing.
          And this was the result.

          COL.LANDA
          Mountain climbing? That's how you
          injured your leg, mountain climbing?

          BRIDGET
          Believe it or not, yes it is.
          A brief moment passes between the two...

          THEN...
          The Colonel BURSTS OUT with UPROARIOUS LAUGHTER. So uproarious
          in fact, that it's quite disconcerting to the four saboteurs.
          The Colonel begins to regain his composure...

          COL.LANDA
          Forgive me, fraulein. I don't mean
          laugh at your misfortune. It's just
          .mountain climbing? I'm curious
          fraulein, what could of ever
          compelled you to undertake such a
          foolhardy endeavor?
          The Double meaning is not lost on the German actress.

          BRIDGET
          Well, I chant be doing it again,
          I can tell you that.

          COL.LANDA
          That cast looks as fresh as my old
          Uncle Gustave, when were you climbing
          this mountain, last night?

          BRIDGET
          Very good eye, Colonel. It happened
          yesterday morning.

          COL.LANDA
          Hummm. And where exactly in Paris
          is this mountain?
          This stops her for a seconded.
          Then Landa laughs it off, taking them off the hook.

          

          

          

          

          13[.

          COL.LANDA
          I'm just teasing you, fraulein. You
          know me, I tease rough. So who are
          your three handsome escorts?

          BRIDGET
          I'm afraid neither three speak a
          word of German. Their friends of
          mine from Italy. This is a wonderful
          Italian stuntman, Antonio Margheriti.
          (Meaning Aldo)
          A very talented cameraman, Enzo Gorlomi.

          Bravo... . Bravo.

          BRIDGET

          (GERMAN)
          Well, my two cameraman friends need
          to find there seats.
          Col.Landa stops a WAITER with a tray of champagne glasses.

          COL.LANDA

          (GERMAN)
          Not so fast, lets enjoy some champagne.
          Everyone gets a glass.

          COL.LANDA

          (FRENCH)
          - Oh, Mademoiselle Mimieux, please
          join us, I have some friends I'd
          like you to meet.
          Shosanna joins the circle, and is handed a champagne glass.
          This is the first moment The Basterds are aware of Shosanna.

          COL.LANDA

          (FRENCH)
          May I say Mademoiselle, you look
          divine.

          SHOSANNA

          Merci'.

          COL.LANDA

          (GERMAN)
          This lovely young lady, is Mademoiselle
          Emmanuelle Mimieux, this is her cinema,
          and she is our hostess for the evening.

          (FRENCH)
          And Mademoiselle, this battered, broken,
          and none worse for the wear German
          goddess, is Bridget Von Hammersmark.

          

          

          

          

          1 3 W.

          BRIDGET
          Bonjour.

          SHOSANNA
          Bon jour.

          BRIDGET

          (FRENCH)
          I'm afraid my companions don't speak
          any French, there Italian. This is
          Antonino, Enzo, and Dominick.
          All three smile goofy spaghetti bender smiles.

          COL.LANDA

          (FRENCH)
          Actually fraulein Von Hammersmarks
          Italian associates, need help finding
          there seats. Perhaps Mademoiselle
          Mimieux would be so kind to escort
          them?

          SHOSANNA

          (FRENCH)
          It would be my pleasure. Let me see
          your tickets?
          Donny hands her two tickets. She indicates for them to follow her.
          Donny and Hirschberg both exchange one last look with Aldo,
          then follow the young french girl into the auditorium.

          INT - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
          The cinema auditorium is filling up quickly with grey and black
          uniforms.
          Shosanna finds the two counterfeit Italians their seats.
          After she points out their seats, she turns to leave...
          Hirschberg...
          .reaches out and grabs her wrist.
          He looks her in the face, and filled with tremendous guilt,
          because if he's successful tonight he's going to blow this
          cute French girl to smithereens, he says;

          HIRSCHBERG
          Grazie.

          

          

          

          
          13r.
          The cute French Girl looks back at the goofy looking Italian
          boy with slicked back hair, that makes him look kind of
          Jewish, with tremendous guilt, knowing if she is successful
          tonight, she's going to burn him alive, and says;

          SHOSANNA
          Prego.

          BACK TO LOBBY
          They begin flicking the lights on and off. A GERMAN SOLDIER
          YELLS in GERMAN in the lobby;

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          Take your seats! The show is about to
          begin! Everybody take your seatsl
          Col.Landa, Lt.Aldo, and Bridget are still together.

          COL.LANDA

          (GERMAN)
          I must call The Fuhrer. He doesn't
          want to make his entrance untill
          everybody seated. Come with me Frau
          Von Hammersmark. The Fuhrer has
          heard your here, and he wishes to
          commend you personally.

          BRIDGET

          (GERMAN)
          Me? Why?

          COL.LANDA

          (GERMAN)
          Don't be modest. Everybody is quite
          taken with your resolve. A accident,
          like you've just experienced, and
          yet you still show up to to a
          important Party event. The Fuhrer
          was quite adamant in his gratitude.
          We'll use Mademoiselle Mimieux's office.
          (To Aldo
          in Italian)
          I'm afraid I must rob you of your
          companion, but only for a moment.

          BRIDGET

          (ITALIAN)
          Yes, apparently The Fuhrer wishes
          to commend me.

          

          

          

          

          ' 36

          COL.LANDA

          (ITALIAN)
          Wait here a moment. I promise I won't
          detain her long.
          What are ether of them suppose to do, argue?
          Col.Landa goes over to one of the Nazi GAURD/USHER, and
          whispers in his ear, gesturing toward Aldo. Like he's saying,
          leave the boy alone, till we come back... .Or is he?
          Col.Landa limps Bridget away towards Shosannas office.
          As Aldo stands in the lobby, more and more people enter the
          auditorium, till it's only Aldo and the six Nazi Gaurd/Ushers
          in the now vacant lobby.

          INT - SHOSANNA'S OFFICE - NIGHT
          Shosanna's cinema manager office. It's small, cluttered, and
          dominated by a desk.
          They both enter.
          Col.Landa closes the door behind him, and LOCKS IT.
          Bridget notices, but says nothing.
          Now the two Germans are alone.

          COL.LANDA
          Have a seat fraulein.
          Pointing at one lone chair in front of the desk.
          She lowers herself in the chair.
          Instead of moving around to the other side of the desk,
          opposite her. The SS Colonel pulls another little chair over,
          and places it in front of the fraulein.
          He sits. Their knees almost touching.
          The colonel points to the foot not in the cast.

          COL.LANDA

          (GERMAN)
          Let me see your foot.

          BRIDGET

          (GERMAN)
          I beg your pardon?

          

          

          

          

          1 31
          Patting his lap.

          COL.LANDA
          Put your foot in my lap.

          BRIDGET
          Colonel, you embarrass me.

          COL.LANDA
          I assure you fraulein, my intention
          is not to flirt.
          Patting his lap more with more aggression.
          The nervous fraulein, lifts up her strapy dress shoe enclosed
          foot, and places it in the Colonel's lap.
          The Colonel, very delicately, unfastens the thin straps that
          hold the frauleins shoe on her foot...
          .He removes the shoe...
          .Leaving only the frauleins bare foot...

          THEN...
          He removes from his heavy SS coat pocket, the pretty dress shoe
          the fraulein left behind at La Louisiane...
          He slips it on her foot...
          .it fits like a glove.
          Bridget knows she's BUSTED.
          Col.Landa smiles and says in ENGLISH;

          COL.LANDA
          What's that American expression...
          "if the shoe fits...you must wear it".
          He removes her foot from his lap.

          BRIDGET

          (GERMAN)
          What now Colonel?

          COL LANDA

          (GERMAN)
          Do you admit you treachery?
          She stares defiant daggers into him.

          

          

          

          

          1314

          BRIDGET

          (GERMAN)
          The only thing I will admit to, is
          resisting you...

          (ENGLISH)
          Sons-a-bitches..

          (GERMAN)
          .to my last breath.

          COL.LANDA

          (GERMAN)
          "Resist to your last breath"?

          SUDDENLY...
          Hans LUNGES forward, putting his strong mitts around Bridget
          Von Hammersmarks lily white delicate neck, and with all the
          violence of a Lion in mid-pounce, SQUEEZES with all his MIGHT.
          Bridgets face turns tomato RED, as the VEINS in her face
          BULGE, and her esophagus is CRUSHED in his GRIP.
          With a violent YANK, he JERKS her TO THE FLOOR. She TUMBLES
          out of the chair, Landa never releasing his GRIP around her
          throat. Nov fully on top of her, he BEARS DOWN, SQUEEZING THE
          VERY LIFE OUT OF HER. Every thing he has, he brings to bear on
          the elegant ladies neck.
          Then, to finally finish her off, he begins BANGING THE BACK OF

          HER HEAD, HARD AGAINST THE FLOOR...

          BANG!

          BANG!

          BANG?
          She's dead.
          He releases the grip around her throat. His hands are

          TREMBLING...
          He rises.
          Strangling the very life out of somebody with your bear hands,
          is the most violent act a human being can commit.
          Also, only humans strangle, the opposable thumbs being quite
          important part of the endeavor. As Hans Landa stands, the
          sheer violence he had to call on to accomplish this task,
          still surges through him. He tries to gain control of the
          trembling, that is rippling through his body. He takes out a
          silver SS FLASK(filled with peach schnapps), and knocks back
          a couple of swigs. He holds his hand out in front of him. The
          TREMBLING is beginning to subside. He picks up the telephone.

          

          

          

          

          139-
          Into the phone in German he says;

          COL.LANDA
          Inform The Fuhrer the audience has
          taken there seats, and we're ready
          to begin.
          Step one, in Hans master plan, done.
          He then dials another number...

          INT - LOBBY - NIGHT
          Aldo in the lobby...

          WHEN...
          .he's JUMPED by the SIX NAZI USHERS...
          He's THROWN ROUGHLY to the ground face first. Like the modern
          day Secret Service, within seconds, his wrists are handcuffed
          behind his back, he's searched, they find the BOMB attached to
          his ankle, it's removed, a BLACK CLOTH BAG is pulled over his
          head, then he's hoisted up, and RUSHED out of the building.
          This happens in mere seconds, and quietly too, no one in the
          auditorium is none the wiser...

          INT - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
          ,including Donowitz and Hirschberg, sitting amongst the
          master race, waiting for showtime.

          EXT - CINEMA - NIGHT
          The Six Nazi Soldiers, hustle the hooded Aldo, down the red
          carpet, then into the alley besides the cinema.
          Aldo's put up against a wall.
          Inside the black hood, he's SCREAMING every insulting thing
          about Germany, Germans, German food, German
          shepherd... anything.

          COL.LANDA'S VOICE(OS)
          Shut up!
          The faceless black hood does.
          Col.Landa, now standing directly in front of his hooded
          prisoner, says in ENGLISH;

          COL.LANDA
          As Stanley said to Livingston;
          Lt.Aldo Raine, I presume?

          

          

          

          
          I 'to.

          LT. ALDO
          Hans Landa?

          COL.LANDA
          You've had a nice long run, Aldo.
          Alas, your now in the hands of the
          SS. My hands to be exact. And they've
          been waiting along time, to touch you.
          He reaches out with his finger, and lightly touches Aldo's
          face right in the middle of the hood.
          Aldo's head VIOLENTLY FLINCHES.

          COL.LANDA
          Caught ya flinching.
          In German, he orders the men put Aldo in the back of a truck.
          Aldo, bound, and bagged, is put in the truck. Also in the
          truck is Utivich, wearing a makeshift chauffeurs uniform,
          bound, and bagged like the Lieutenant.
          The Truck drives off.
          Col.Landa turns around, and SEES FROM A DISTANCE, Hitlers
          motorcade pull up to the cinema.. Then the Fuhrer, Goebbels,
          Francesca, and the rest of the entourage, make there way down
          the red carpet into the cinema.
          Landa smiles.

          EXT TRUCK (MOVING) - NIGHT
          We see the truck leaving the city of Paris, under the veil of
          night.
          We also seem to be leaving the drama of Operation Kino.

          INT - TRUCK(MOVING) - NIGHT
          The two hooded prisoners, bounce along in the back of the
          truck.
          Utivich, is crying inside his hood.

          LT.ALDO
          Utivich?

          UTIVICH
          Is that you Lieutenant?

          LT. ALDO
          Yep.

          

          

          

          
          lyl.

          UTIVIC}I
          Do you know what happened to Donny?
          Hirchberg? The woman?

          LT.ALDO
          No I do not.

          UTIVICH
          Lieutenant, sorry I'm crying.

          LT. ALDO
          Nothin to be sorry about, son.
          This bag, get to anyone.

          UTIVICH
          Not exactly John Wayne, am I?

          LT.ALDO
          John Waynes a pampered movie star.
          He burst into tears, if his cook,
          busts his yoke at breakfast. Just
          try puttin a bag over his head, and
          hear what kinda sounds he makes.
          Utivich, giggles through the tears.

          LT.ALDO
          I just want you to know, son, I was
          real proud of you tonight. Learnin
          how to drive overnight. Driving in
          that Limo line. You was in the hot
          seat, son, and you stood up real good.
          Utivich Cries LOUDER.
          Aldo takes his foot, finds Utivichs foot, and places his foot
          on top.
          The TOUCH has a slight calming effect on Utivich.
          In the darkness, Utivich has reclaimed his dignity.

          EXT- COUNTRY TAVERN - NIGHT
          The truck pulls up to a small tavern outside of Paris(not La
          Louisaiane),
          The two hooded prisoners, are walked inside the establishment.

           INT - COUNTRY TAVERN - NIGHT
          The hooded men are lead into the closed for business, but open
          for something else, rustic tavern.

          

          

          

          
          0The Nazi Guards, unlock the handcuff, then sit them down inchairs.
          Then, simultaneously, the hoods are YANKED OFF.
          The two prisoners, are seated at a table, in what they can now
          see, is a rustic tavern. On the table is one telephone, one
          bottle of Chianti, and three glasses. And on the opposite end
          of the table, sits Colonel Hans Landa.
          A NAZI SOLDIER sits posted at  a impressive looking two way
          radio set up in the tavern.
          Colonel Lands starts in right away at the two baffled,
          discombobulated American soldiers.
          They will only speak ENGLISH in the scene.

          COL.LANDA
          Italian? Really?

          (BEAT)
          What could you have possibly been
          thinking?

          LT. ALDO
          Well, I speak alittle Italian -

          COL.LANDA
          I speak a little Tagalog, but I
          wouldn't begin to presume I could
          pass for Filipino. Don't get me
          wrong, I understand you were in a
          pickle, what with you losing your
          Germans. And I have nothing but
          admiration for improvisation.
          Still.... Chico Marx is more
          convincing. if the three of you had
          shown up to the premiere dressed
          in womans attire, it would have been
          more convincing.
          Landas eyes go to the Two Nazi Guards behind the prisoners.

          COL.LANDA

          (GERMAN)
          You may leave us. But stay alert
          outside.
          They exit, leaving the Colonel, the Lieutenant, the
          Private and a German Radio Man in the corner.

          

          

          

          

          "43'

          COL.LANDA
          So your Aldo the Apache?

          LT. ALDO
          So your The Jew Hunter?

          COL.LANDA
          Jew Hunter, (pfuit), I'm a detective.
          A damn good detective. Finding
          people is my specialty. So naturally,
          I worked for the Nazi's finding people.
          And yes, some of them were Jews.
          But Jew Hunter? Just the name that stuck.

          UTIVICH
          Well you do hafts admit, it is
          catchy.

          COL.LANDA
          Do you control the nicknames, your
          enemies bestow on you? Aldo the
          Apache and The Little Man?

          UTIVICH
          What do you mean, The Little Man?

          COL.LANDA
          The Germans nickname for you.

          UTIVICH
          The Germans nickname for me is, The
          Little Man?

          COL.LANDA
          Or "The Little One, ether one means you.
          And as if to make my point, I'm
          a little surprised how tall you
          were in real life. I mean, your a
          little fellow. But not circus midget
          little, as your reputation would
          suggest.

          LT.ALDO
          Where is my men? Where is Bridget
          Von Hammersmark?

          Bridget Von Hammersmark. Oh I'm sure
          she's in whatever, big bubbling
          cesspool in hell, the devil reserves
          for traitors of her ilk.

          (COR'T)
          Well, lets just say, she got what
          she deserved. And when you purchase
          friends like Bridget Von Hammersmark,
          you get what you pay for.
          Now as far as your Pisanos,
          Sgt.Donowitz, and Pt.Hirschberg-

          LT. ALDO
          How do you know our names?

          COL.LANDA
          Lt.Aldo, if you don't think I wouldn't
          interrogate every single one of your
          swastika marked survivors... .?
          We simply aren't operating on the
          level of mutual respect I assumed.
          Now, back to the whereabouts of your
          two Italian saboteurs. At this
          moment, both Hirschberg, and
          Donowitz, should be sitting in the
          very seats we left them in. Seats,
          0023 and 0024, if my memory serves.
          Explosives, still around
          there ankle, still ready to
          explode. And your mission, some
          would call a terrorist plot, as of
          this moment, is still a go.
          The two Basterds don't believe this. It can't be true.

          LT. ALDO
          That's a pretty exciting story.
          What's next, Eliza on the ice?

          COL.LANDA
          However, all I have to do, is pick
          pick up that phone right there.
          Inform the cinema, and your plans
          kupet.

          LT. ALDO
          IF, their still there, and IF their
          still alive, and that's one big IF,
          there ain't no way, you gonna take
          them boys without settin off them
          bombs.

          I have no doubt, and yes, some
          Germans will die., and yes, it will
          ruin the evening, and yes, Goebbels
          will be very very very mad at you
          for what you've done to his big night.
          But you won't get Hitler, you won't
          get Goebbels, you won't get Gering,
          and you won't get Boorman. And you
          need all four to end the war.

          (PAUSE)
          But if I don't pick up that phone,
          right there, you may very well get
          all four. And if you get all four,
          you end the war...tonight.
          The Nazi Colonel lifts up the bottle of Chianti, and fills
          three glasses. As he pours, he says;

          COL.LANDA
          So gentlemen, lets discuss the
          prospect of ending the war-tonight.
          All three have their Chianti filled glasses.

          COL.LANDA
          So the way I see it, since Hitlers
          death, or possible rescue, rests
          solely on my reaction...If I do
          nothing ...it's as if I'm causing his
          death, even more then yourselves.
          Would you agree?

          LT. ALDO
          I guess so.

          COL.LANDA
          How about you Uitivich?

          UITIVICH
          I guess so too.

          COL.LANDA
          Good, we more or less, all agree.
          Gentlemen, I have no intention, of
          Killing Hitler, and killing Goebbels,
          and Killing Gerring, and killing
          Boorman, not to mention winning the
          war single handedly for the allies,
          only later, to find myself standing
          before a Jewish tribunal.

          

          

          

          
          I q
          Now they get it.

          COL.LANDA
          If you want to win the war, tonight,
          We have to make a deal.

          LT.ALDO
          What kinda deal?

          COL.LANDA
          The kind you wouldn't have the
          authority to make. However, I'm sure
          this mission of yours, has a
          commanding officer? A General, I'm
          betting. For ..

          (THINKING)
          .O.S.S. would be my guess.
          Aldo's eyebrows reveal that was a good guess.

          COL.LANDA
          Oooh, that's a bingo. Is that the
          way you say it, That's a bingo?

          LT.ALDO
          You just say, bingo.

          COL.LANDA
          Bingo! How fun. But I digress, where
          were we? Oh yes, make a deal. Over
          there is a very capable two way
          radio. And sitting behind it, is a
          more then capable radio operator,
          named Herrman. Get me somebody on
          the other end of that radio with the
          power of the pen, to authorize my
          - Let's call it, the terms of my
          conditional surrender, if that taste
          better going down.

          .So, when the military history of
          this night is written, it will be
          recorded, that I was part of
          "Operation Rino" from the very
          beginning, as a double agent.
          Anything I've done in my guise as a
          SS Colonel, was sanctioned by The
          O.S.S., as a necessary evil to
          establish my cover with The Germans.
          And it was my placement, of
          Lt.Raines dynamite in Hitler and
          Goebbels opera box that assured
          there demise. By the way, that last
          part is actually true.

          benefits under my proper rank.
          I want to receive the congregational
          medal of honor, for my invaluable
          assistance in the toppling of the Third

          conversation.

          COL.LANDA
          In fact, I want all the members of
          "Operation Kino" to receive the
          congregational medal of honor. Full
          citizenship for myself - but that
          goes without saying. And I would
          like the United States of America to
          purchase property for me on
          Nantuckett island, as a reward for
          all the countless lives I've saved
          by bringing the tyranny of the
          National Socialist party to a
          swifter then imanged end. Do you
          have all that, sir?

          face as well, sir.

          The Colonel hands the headphones and microphone to Aldo.

          LT.ALDO
          Yes, sir?
          We HEAR the VOICE on the other end of the radio, give Aldo his

          ORDERS;

          RADIO VOICE(OS)
          Colonel Landa will put you and
          Private Uitivich in a truck as
          prisoners. Then he and his radio
          operator, will get in the truck,
          drive to our lines. Upon crossing
          our lines, Colonel Landa and his
          man will surrender to you. You will
          then take over driving of the truck,
          a bring them straight to me for
          debriefing. Is that clear, Lieutenant?

          LT.ALDO
          Yes, sir.
          The Conversation is over, he puts the radio down.
          The three men look at one another.

          That tower is one of the oldest, and
          most beautiful structures in Russia.

          thousand years of history into dust!

          playing now, is halfway through. In a few short minutes, it's
          going to be show time.
          Marcel says to Shosanna in FRENCH, SUBTITLED in ENGLISH;

          MARCEL
          It's time. I should go lock the auditorium,
          and take my place behind the screen.
          This is the last time they will ever see each other, too much
          to say. He holds her in his arms and lays a one kiss before I
          die wet one on her.

          DONOWITZ AND HIRSCHBERG
          sit in their seats watching the movie, surrounded by DRESS
          UNIFORM NAZI'S. They've developed a dopey way of communicating
          with each other in this hostel environment.
          Basically, speaking English like it were gibberish Italian.
          They say English words, only adding a "I", or a "A", or a "O",
          to the end of it. And saying it in a exaggerated Italian
          accent, complete with pantomimes.
          Donowitz leans into Hirschberg, and says in a wispier;
          They speak in ITALIA-ISH SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;

          SGT.DONOWITZ

          When-a I-a Go-a, you-a Set-ta Boom-a.
          (When I go, you set your bomb)
          Hirschberg indicates/pantomimes, he can't set his bomb
          surrounded by all these Nazi's.
          Donowitz, pantomimes crossing his legs, setting bomb on ankle
          in his seat. Then getting up, and dropping it in the back of
          the auditorium, in the dark.
          Hirschberg doesn't get it.

          HIRSCHBERG
          What-a?
          (What?)
          Donny pantomimes again, more exaggerated, and with less
          patience.

          Donowitz stands from his seat, and walks out of the dark
          auditorium, into the lobby. The Nazi Guards/Ushers are gone,
          the lobby is completely empty. Seeing the STAIRS leading down
          to the WATER CLOSET/BATHROOM, he descends them to plant
          the Boom-a, I mean, The Bomb.

          DESCENDING THE STAIRS
          leading to the Water closet. Like a lot of old cinema's, not
          only was the water closet located under the auditorium, you
          had to pass through a rather large SMOKING LOUNGE to get to
          it. In the Smoking Lounge are TEN NAZI ENLISTED MEN, the
          Guards/Ushers for the event, smoking and indulging in soldiers
          gossip. They're all in dress uniforms, and all are armed.
          Donowitz, in his tuxedo, acts cool, and walks right through
          them.
          They look up, but don't disturb there time off vibe.
          Donny enters the big Water Closet. Except for ONE LONE NAZI
          ENLISTED MAN at the urinal, it would appear as if
          Donny has the whole wash room to himself.
          He enters the privacy of a toilet stall, locks the door.

          MARCEL IN LOBBY
          He descends the stairs leading down from the projection booth,
          into the empty lobby. He goes to one of the auditorium doors,
          and peers inside.

          WE SEE THE SCREEN AND THE AUDIENCE FROM MARCELS POV:
          in the back of the room. The audience seems riveted to
          Fredrick's exploits on screen.
          Marcel closes the door, and with a KEY, DEADBOLTS it SHUT.

          INSIDE THE AUDITORIUM
          WE PAN OFF THE SCREEN to Marcel, who locks the two doors on
          ether side of the screen....due to curtains placed there, no
          one notices Marcels actions.
          Marcel then goes BEHIND THE SCREEN, WE SEE the IMAGE
          (backward) of Fredricks sniper battle HUGE COVERING ENTIRE
          SIDE ROOM ...A PILE of over300nitrate FILM PRINTS, lay like a
          junk pile, right behind the screen.
           Sitting down in a wooden chair facing the screen, and
           Pile-o-film, he lights up a cigarette, a absolute no-no in a
           cinema of this era, but tonight, what does it matter?4.
           He smokes, and waits for his cue to... .BURN IT DOWN!

          

          

          

          

          )53.

          FREDRICK IN OPERA BOX
          along side Hitler, Goebbels, Francesca, and BOORMAN. On screen
          the battle rages. He leans over and whispers something in
          Goebbels ear, we can't hear. Goebbels makes a very sympathetic
          face (at least sympathetic for Goebbels), and says in German;

          GOEBBELS
          Perfectly understandable, dear boy.
          You go now, and we'll see you after
          the show.
          He exits the opera box. And walks to the projection booth
          door. He raps on the door in a trying to be amusing way.
          The door opens, just a little bit, Shosanna not friendly,
          stares at him.
          Be, as per usual, is all smiles and charm.
          They speak in FRENCH, SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;

          FREDRICK
          Are you the manager, of this cinema?
          I want my money back. That actor in
          the movie stinks.
          He laughs.

          IV
          She doesn't even smile. She says, in all serious business;

          SHOSANNA
          What are you doing here?

          FREDRICK
          I came to visit you.

          SHOSANNA
          Can't you see how busy I am?

          FREDRICK
          Then allow me to lend a assist.

          SHOSANNA
          Fredrick it's not funny, you can't
          be here. This is your premiere, you
          need to be out there with them.
          As Fredrick prepares to tell his little tale, with all the
          charm at his command, Shosanna listens, knowing the third reel
          is just about over, and her big reel change is coming up.

          

          

          

          

          FREDRICK
          Normally, you would be.right.
          And for all the other films I do,
          I intend to endure evenings like
          tonight, in the proper sprit.
          However the fact remains, this film,
          is based on my military exploits.
          And in this case, my exploits
          consisted of me killing many men.
          Consequently, the part of the film
          that's playing now,... .I don't like
          watching this part.

          SHOSANNA
          Fredrick, I am sorry, but -

          FREDRICK
          - So, I thought, I'd come up here
          and do what I do best, annoy you.
          And from the look on your face, it
          would appear I haven't lost my touch.

          DONNY IN TOILET
          Sgt.Donowitz, with BOMB in his lap, sets the timer, six
          minutes from now. He then places the bomb in the back of the
          toilet tank.

          CAMERA ON FLOOR OF WATER CLOSET
          we see the tile of the floor stretch out before us. We see
          Donny's feet in the closed toilet stall. We HEAR, the OFF
          SCREEN Nazi Enlisted Man, finish his piss. Then HIS SHOES WALK
          THROUGH FRAME... .WE FOLLOW THEM TO... .The SINK...WE STAY ON
          The Shoes ...as WE HEAR The Soldier WASH HIS HANDS... THEN...
          THE CAMERA RISES UP HIS PANT LEG...Till...WE"RE EYE LEVEL with
          the German Soldier, with a ARMY CAP on his head, who's
          done washing his hands....THEN....The Soldier removes
          his cap, brushes some bangs out of his face, and WE CAN SEE

          THE SWASTIKA HAND CARVED INTO HIS FOREHEAD, UNDENIABLE MARK
          OF THE BASTARDS. He SPLASHES some WATER ON HIS FACE, puts his
          cap back on his head, and joins his comrades in the smoking
          lounge. As he exits FRAME, he says to somebody OFF SCREEN;

          SWASTIKA FOREHEAD

          (GERMAN)
          Hey Fritz, you owe me three cigarettes,
          now pay up.

          SHOSANNA AND FREDRICK
          Fredrick still outside the doorway, and Shosanna, still baring
          the way.

          SHOSANNA
          I have to get prepared for the reel
          change.

          

          

          

          

          FREDRICK
          Let me do it?

          SHOSANNA
          No.

          FREDRICK
          Oh please, it's been two years since
          i've done a reel change.

          SHOSANNA
          I said, no.

          FREDRICK
          (Cute whine)
          Come on, it's my premiere.

          SHOSANNA
          Are you so use to the Nazi's kissing
          your ass, you've forgotten what the
          word,ÃÂ°ÃÂ°No" means? No Fredrick, you
          can't come in here, now go away!
          No subtitles for Fredrick needed this time, he gets it.
          He does a one-armed PILE DRIVE PUSH on the door, knocking both
          it OPEN, and Shosanna back into the room.
          Fredrick, a different cat then we've seen up till now, enters
          the booth, closing the door behind him, and LOCKING it.
          The quite startled Shosanna, says to Fredrick;

          SHOSANNA
          Fredrick, you hurt me.

          FREDRICK
          Well, it's nice to know you can feel
          something. Even if it's just physical
          pain.
          Fredrick steps forward...
          Shosanna steps backwards...

          FREDRICK
          I'm not a man you say, "Go away"
          to. There's over three hundred
          dead bodies in Russia, that if
          they could, would testify to that.
          After what I've done for you, you
          disrespect me at your peril.

          

          

          

          

          156.

          BACK TO WASHROOM
          The Swastika Forehead Soldier, get a light for his cigarette.
          He takes a big drag.

          SOLDIER'S POV:
          He faces the washroom, and down that long throw, he sees Donny
          emerge from the toilet stall. His tuxedo jacket is off, and
          draped over his right hand. Sporting the white dress shirt,
          and black tuxedo vest. He's quite far away, so now he just
          looks like some guy in a tux, who just finished taking a shit.
          Donny walks toward us ...

          CU SWASTIKA FOREHEAD
          seeing him get closer...

          SOLDIER POV:
          Donny gets closer...

          SOLDIER POV:
          Donny getting closer, begins to notice, German soldier notice
          him...

          CU SWASTIKA FOREHEAD
          now Donny is close enough for the Soldier to recognize. His
          face SCREAMS;

          SWASTIKA FOREHEAD
          The Bear Jew!1!
          The Soldier's GUN is out of it's holster, and rising toward
          Donny's chest...

          WHEN...
          Donny raises his right arm, with the tuxedo jacket on it, and
          FIRES a GUN concealed under it.
          HITTING Swastika Forehead in the chest...Who finishes raising
          his GUN, FIRING HITTING Donny in the chest...
          The Two Soldier's FIRE INTO each other.... Till there weapons are
          empty, and the two men lie dead on the floor.
          The Nine other NAZI'S in the room, stand shocked at what just
          happened in front of them.

          SHOSANNA AND FREDRICK IN PROJECTION BOOTH
          Fredrick hears the gunshots below them, and turns towards the
          door.

          FREDRICK
          What the hell was that?
          While Fredrick's back is turned, Shosanna takes a GUN out of
          her pocket, and SHOOTS Fredrick THREE TIMES in the back...
          ..Be CRASHES HARD into the door, then FALLING FACE FIRST to
          the floor...
          Shosanna, gun in hand, looks out projection booth window into
          the audience...
          The ON SCREEN BATTLE rages so LOUDLY with GUNFIRE, that her
          weapon didn't stand a chance of being heard.
          Her eyes go from the audience...
          .up to the big screen...
          .Which holds FREDRICK ZOLLER in a tight handsome CLOSE UP.
          The Face on the silver screen, breaks the young girl's
          heart...
          .She looks to his body, lying face down on the floor, blood
          flowing from the holes she put in his back...
          .His body moves a little, and he lets out a painful MOAN...
          .DIEING though he is, at this moment, Fredrick is still

          ALIVE...
          Shosanna moves to him...
          ..She touches him, and he lets out another MOAN...
          .She turns his body over on it's back...
          ..he's holding a LUGER in his hand...
          .he FIRES TWICE...

          BANG BANG
          Two bullets HIT HER POINT BLANK IN THE CHEST...
          THROWING HER against the wall, then FALLING FORWARD on her
          knees to the floor...
          ..Fredrick, Luger still in hand, takes aim from the floor...

          

          

          

          

          I,

          .FIRES...
          HITTING the bloody girl on the floor, in the thigh...
          .SPINNING her BODY around in agony...
          Like he did to the Russian on screen, he picks her apart, one
          bullet at a time...

          .FIRES...

          BULLET BLOWS OFF HEEL OF HER FOOT...
          Luger drops to floor, Fredrick DIES.
          Our young French Jewish heroine, lies on the projection booth
          floor, in a pool of her own blood, her body RIDDLED with
          bullets, her nerve endings wracked with pain, CRIPPLED and

          DIEING...

          WHEN...
          ..the little bell on the 1st projector, starts to ring,
          informing the projectionist, it's time for The REEL CHANGE.
          Dieing or not, if Shosanna intends to get her revenge, she's
          going to have to lift her ass off the floor, and execute this
          fucking reel change.

          CINEMA AUDITORIUM
          The battle on screen continues waging. The audience is
          riveted.
          The FUHRER
          watches, completely caught up in the dramatic spectacle.
          He says to Goebbels in German;

          HITLER
          Extraordinary Joseph, simply
          extraordinary. This is your finest
          film yet.
          Goebbels is beyond proud, he smiles to Francesca, who proudly
          pats his hand.

          CAMERA in the exact same placement, same background (b/w sky),
          SLIGHT LOW ANGLE LOOKING UP, so on screen Shosanna is looking
          down on the Nazi's, the way Fredrick was looking down on the
          Russians. The way this HUGE IMAGE OF SHOSANNA'S GIANT FACE stares
          down the auditorium of Nazi's, brings to mind Orwells "1984"
          Big Brother.
          HITLER and GOEBBELS
          React.

          HIRSCHBERG
          standing in the middle of the aisle, turns towards the screen.
          When he see's Shosanna's GIANT FACE, he's gobsmacked.

          BEHIND SCREEN
          Marcel sitting in the chair, with his cigarette, before the

          SHOSANNAS GIANT FACE ON SCREEN
          She stares down the packed house of Nazi's, and says
          in FRENCH;

          SHOSANNAS GIANT FACE
          I have a message for Germany. I'm
          interrupting your Nazi propaganda
          horse shit, to inform you despicable
          German swine, that your all going to
          die.
          HITLER and GOEBBELS
          react.

          HIRSCHBERG
          react.

          MARCEL
          smiles.

          SHOSANNAS GIANT FACE
          And I want you to look deep in the face
          of The Jew who's going to do it.

          The BOMB Landa set in Hitlers and Goebbels opera box...

          EXPLODES.

          

          

          

          
          BLOWING TO SMITHEREENS, HITLER, FRANCESCA, BOORMAN, and
          propelling GOEBBELS, still in his theatre seat, across the
          auditorium, into the opposite wall, and taking out a portion
          of the ceiling as well.
          The crowd reacts...
          The explosion causes the huge chandelier from Versailles, to
          topple from it's jerry-rigged placement, and CRASH on to the
          audience below...
          ON SCREEN THE GIANT FACE OF SHOSANNA finishes her WAR CRY.

          SHOSANNAS GIANT FACE
          My name is Shosanna Dreyfus, and this is
          the face of Jewish Vengeance! Marcel,

          BURN IT DOWN!

          BEHIND THE SCREEN
          Marcel takes his cigarette, and FLICKS IT into the pile of
          nitrate film.
          ON SCREEN SHOSANNAS GIANT FACE LAUGHS MANIACALLY at the
          scrambling little Nazi's, running in a panic, as FLAMES LIKE

          OUT OF A GIANT BLAST FURNACE, BURST THROUGH SHOSANNAS FACE,
          and CLIMB UP THE WALLS of the cinema.
          The AUDIENCE

          HIRSCHBERG
          with bomb set on ankle, is caught in a massive Day of the
          Locust SWARM OF BODIES...
          People frantically pound on locked doors, trapping them to
          there grizzly fate.
          The FLAMES and FIRE spread through thr auditorium...
          Hirschberg caught in people crunch, knows this is it.

          HIS ANKLE BOMB GOES OFF
          right underneath everybody in the room.
          The effect this has on the people in the room, is very similar
          to that of the effect a M-80blowing up in a ant hill, would
          have on the ants. The auditorium is a literal red rain of legs,
          arms, heads, torsos, and asses.

          THEN...

          DONOWITZ TOILET BOMB
          BLOWS UP UNDERNEATH the auditorium.

          EXT -- WOODS - MORNING
          It's a misty early morning, in the woodsy area. The German
          truck, with Aldo and Uitvich in the back, and Landa and
          Herrman in the front comes to stop.
          LANDA and HERRMAN IN TRUCK CAB
          Herrman, behind the wheel, tells Landa in German;

          HERRMAN
          These are the American lines, sir.
          In the back of the truck, sit the two last remaining members
          of The Basterds, Lt.Aldo Raine, and Prvt.Smithson Uitivich,
          both with their hands cuffed behind there back.
          Landa and Herrman appear at truck rear, says in ENGLISH;

          COL.LANDA
          Okay Gentlemen, you can climb down.          

          

          143
          Aldo and Uitivich climb down from the truck.
          Col.Landa indicates for Herrman to remove the handcuffs from
          the two prisoners.
          He does.

          COL.LANDA
          Herrman, hand them your weapon.
          He does.
          Col.Landa hands over his LUGER, and his very cool looking SS

          DAGGER.

          COL.LANDA
          I am officially surrendering myself
          over to you, Lt.Raine. We are your
          prisoners.

          LT.ALDO
          Thank you very much Colonel. Uitivich,
          cuff the Colonel's hands behind his
          back.

          COL.LANDA
          Is that really necessary?
          As Uitivich cuffs the. Colonels hands behind his back, Aldo

          SAYS;

          LT.ALDO
          I'm a slave to appearances.
          Then Aldo takes the Luger, and SHOOTS HERRMAN DEAD.
          The bound Col.Landa is appalled.

          COL.LANDA
          Are you mad? What have you done? I made
          a deal with your General for that mans
          life!

          LT. ALDO
          Yeah, they made that deal, but they
          don't give a fuck about him, they

          LT.ALDO
          Raw I don't think so, more like I'll
          be chewed out. I've been chewed out
          before. You know, Uitvich and myself,
          heard that deal you made with the Brass.
          End the war tonight? I'd make that deal.
          How bout you Uitivich, you make that
          deal?

          UITIVICH
          I'd make that deal.

          LT.ALDO
          I don't blame ya. Damn good deal.
          And that pretty little nest ya
          feathered for yourself. Well, if
          your willing to barbecue the whole
          high command, I suppose that's worth
          certain considerations. Now I don't
          care about you gettin pensions,
          merit badges, ticker tape parades,
          who gives a damn, let's all go home.
          But .1do have one question?
          When you go to your little place on
          Nantuckett Island, I image you gonna
          take off that handsome looking SS
          uniform of yours, ain't ya?
          For the first time in the movie, Col.Landa doesn't-respond.

          LT.ALDO
          That's what I thought. Now that...
          .I can't abide. How bout you
          Uitivich, can you abide it?

          UITIVICH
          Not one damn bit, sir.

          LT.ALDO
          I mean if I had my way, you'd wear
          that goddamn uniform for the rest of
          your pecker suckin life. But I'm
          aware that's ain't practical. I mean
          at some point ya gotta hafta take it
          off.
          He opens LandaSS DAGGER, and holds the BLADE in front of Hans
          face.

          LT.ALDO
          So I'm gonna give you a little
          somethin you can't take off.

          The Dagger has just completed carving a swastika deep into his
          forehead.

          COL.LANDA'S POV:
          On the ground, looking up at Aldo, bloody knife in hand, who
          straddles him.. And Uitivich, who's next to him. The two
          Basterds admire Aldo's handiwork.

          LT.ALDO
          You know somethin Uitivich, I think
          this just might be my masterpiece.

    We PULL BACK, in marked steps, to include neighboring apartments
    with identical frosted facades. Then more apartments, above and
    below, the tiers linked by ramps and crosswalks. It might be a
    prison cellblock but there are no guards apparent. Indeed, the
    residents move freely, all notably male, all clad in shearlings,
    polo shirts and slacks. It is just another day in Sector Four.

3   INT. NUTRITION PLAZA - SECTOR FOUR - DAY

    Satie's Gymnopedie plays from overhead speakers. 

    A glass wall looks out across a green mountain valley. The plaza, 
    formed in curves of creamy ceramic tile, is divided into two service 
    areas.

    Male residents in line on one side, females on the other. Both
    genders combine in the seating area. Lincoln reaches the head of
    the line. He swipes his ethercuff o v e r a scanner. A NUTRITION
    CLERK, a surly woman in uniform, eyes the readout on her screen-

                                    NUTRITION CLERK
                     Lincoln Six-Echo... Options are dried
                     fruit, oatmeal or anything in bran.

                                  LINCOLN
                     What? No bacon?

                                NUTRITION CLERK
                     You got a sodium flag, pal - now
                     what's it going to be?

                                 LINCOLN
                     Whatever.

    He shrugs, disgruntled. The clerk taps her screen. Turning to a
    row of chutes behind her, she collects a foil covered bowl and a
    drink can. Lincoln, less than appetized, loads his tray with the
    oatmeal and juice breakfast. Then he heads into the seating area.

    In the seating area, male and female residents sit eating and
    chatting happily. Uniformed busboys intermix, clearing and wiping
    tables. A divide in this community now starts to become clear...

    The busboys, like the nutrition clerk, like all the service,
    maintenance, and administrative staff we'll see, have distinct
    uniforms but no facial marking. They are known as "outsiders".

    The "residents", like Lincoln, have crosshatched scars on their
    upper left brows and ethercuffs o n their wrists. Mostly Caucasian,
    from mid-twenties to mid-sixties. There are no children here.

    We isolate a blonde - mid-20's, fresh, bright eyes, a fragile
    beauty, a crosshatch of two verticals and one horizontal. Her
    name is ESTER TWO-ALPHA. Seeing Lincoln, she smiles and waves-

                                     ESTER
                     Lincoln ! Over here!

                                                             3.



Lincoln crosses, a little surprised to see her. Pleasantly so.

                            LINCOLN
              Hello , stranger.

                           ESTER
              What? You don't recognize me?

                          LINCOLN
              It's just an expression, that's all.

                         ESTER
              You and your expressions, Lincoln. Now
              sit down and ask me where I've been.

                               LINCOLN
                     (sits , a spreading smile)
              Okay, Ester. Where have you been?

                               ESTER
              At the medical center. Just for tests
              but they had me on liquid nutrition.
                     (forks a mouthful of eggs)

              Mmmmm. This is the first solid food
              I've had in a week.

                          LINCOLN
              Exciting.

                            ESTER
              That's not the exciting part. I got my
              first trimester report: happy, healthy
              and contaminant-free... Both of us.

                          LINCOLN
              Us?

                        ESTER
              My baby... It's in perfect condition.
              I just hope I can keep it that way. I
              still have six months to delivery.

                          LINCOLN
              Then you leave all this behind, huh?

                          ESTER
              Why? Will you miss me?

Her eyes betray a flicker of something. It unsettles Lincoln.

                          LINCOLN
              I'll miss your coffee. C'mon, I
              already burned up my quota.

                                                                       4.



                             ESTER
                Okay. But this is the last time.

In a deliberate move, she drops her napkin on the floor. As she
ducks down to retrieve it, Lincoln steals a gulp of her coffee.
Rising again, Ester registers his souring look.

                            ESTER
                What is it?

Lincoln just nods across the plaza. Ambient conversation is now
ebbing at an arrival. An outsider in a grey, vaguely clerical
uniform - sanguine, settled, precise eyes. He might be a prison
warden but for the generally warm reception. He is known as The
Community Director. His name is MERRICK.

He crosses to a lectern, unlooping a chain from his neck with a
three-forked pendant known as a "tri-key". He slots the tri-key
into the lectern. The glass wall frosts over and pixellates i n t o
a live feed of himself. Now amplified by the plaza speakers,
Merrick begins his address-

                            MERRICK
                Good morning. To everyone here and
                everyone watching on etherscreen,
                welcome to the community address. Today
                I'm coming to you from Sector Four. For
                those of you here with sugar quotas, let
                me recommend the french toast. I just
                tried some and it's excellent, really.
                But I know what everyone's hungry for
                s o let's move on to the lottery. As
                always the draw will be made from our
                host sector. So tell me, Sector Four -
                is everyone ready for The Daily Spin?

Applause and whistles erupt, mostly from the younger residents,
who take on the zeal of a game show audience. The older ones -
including Lincoln - greet the prospect with labored tolerance.
Merrick turns the tri-key i n the lectern. The glass wall
switches from the live feed to a jumbotron o f flashing text;

- - DAILY SPIN!... GET READY TO WIN!... DAILY SPIN!--

                           MERRICK
                Let The Spin begin.

To a burst of cheers, he turns the tri-key another notch. The
glass wall becomes a spinning blur, like a tumbler on a slot
machine. But instead of icons, it clicks through names, each
separated by a blank line - from "Adams One-Alpha" to "Zucker
Three - Charlie" - scrolling the entire population of Sector Four.

                                                                     5.



    As the spin slows, a pent silence falls. Expectant eyes watch the
    names click through the P's, the Q's, the R's, the S's and . . .
    - - SPIN WIN!... STARKWEATHER TWO-DELTA... SPIN-WIN!--

                                     MERRICK
                   Starkweather Two-Delta! Step up!

    Cheers and applause as everyone looks for the lucky recipient.
    The excitement abates as it becomes clear he's not among them.

                                    MERRICK
                   Well , Starkweather, if you're watching
                   on etherscreen - your time has come, my
                   friend! You're moving out to The Island!
                          (another burst of cheers)
                   And the rest of you, never lose hope;
                   what do we know about The Daily Spin?

                                   THE YOUNGER RESIDENTS
                   Everyone gets to win!

                              MERRICK
                   An d tomorrow it could be you...

    Merrick steps down and departs. The plaza reverts to its former
    mood, dotted with murmurs of disappointment. Lincoln scowls.

                                ESTER
                   Don't worry. Your time will come.

                                 LINCOLN
                   That's easy for you to say. Your time's
                   guaranteed. All you have is six months.

                              ESTER
                   Six months of mood swings, sore back
                   and swollen feet. Want to trade places?

                                    LINCOLN
                          (scowl lifting)
                   Give me some more of your coffee.

4   INT . SUBWAY PORTAL - SECTOR FOUR - DAY

    The portal is spanned by a rank of latticed metal gates, known as
    an "ethergate." Residents swipe their ethercuffs o v e r scanners,
    the gates hiss open and they step through in systematic order.

                                                                      6.



5   INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - SECTOR FOUR - DAY

    The subway, formed in arches of creamy ceramic tile, is not
    unlike our own. In place of escalators, moving walkways deliver
    the residents onto the platform. Along the platform wall runs a
    strip of mirrored panels, etherscreen reporting in banner crawl:

    - - NEXT STOP... SECTOR 5 - SECTOR 6 - CENTERVILLE...
    At the tunnel edge of the platform is a safety fence, where the
    residents wait in a patient line, Lincoln among them. His focus
    is drawn to two younger residents whispering furtively nearby.

                            RESIDENT #1
                   A stim unit says it hits the wall.

                                RESIDENT #2
                   Okay . But I get to set the can.

    Resident #1 shrugs and hands him a drink can. Resident #2 ducks
    under the fence, reaching the can down to the track. Or what
    looks like a track. The struts lining the bed are not sleepers
    but buffers of galvanized rubber. Nor are there any rails. The
    relay system is provided by a series of metal posts, flanking the
    buffers to run in twin parallel. Known as "lode-poles," they now
    start thrumming and pulsing with red light, like runway beacons.

                                RESIDENT #1
                   Hurry it up. The shuttle's coming.

    Resident #2 regains the platform. We PUSH IN on the drink can,
    balanced on a buffer. It starts rattling. Then suddenly shoots
    upward into the air, arcing and bouncing off the tunnel wall,
    clattering into obscurity. Resident #1 whoops in victory.

    A rush of air heralds the shuttle. It sails out of the tunnel,
    floating three feet above the track. A hybrid of subway car and
    nautical craft, it has runners in place of wheels, like hulls on
    a catamaran. It is buoyed by a magnetic flow emanating from the
    lode-poles, an invisible river known as a "lode-stream". The
    shuttle drifts to a gentle halt, hovering, rocking a little. Its
    gangplanks fold out toward the platform and the safety fence
    lowers. Lincoln and the other commuters file routinely aboard.

6   INT . CENTERVILLE - DAY

    An avenue of cream colored buildings. Uniform in architecture,
    rising five stories to meet a mirrored roof. Despite lighting
    arrays, the absence of sky lends a chasmic quality . Lincoln
    follows the flow of residents up the avenue. Building signs read:
    "Dept. Of Labor", "Dept. Of Health", "Dept. Of Sanitation". He
    splits off, turning into a building marked "Dept. Of Population."

                                                                            7.



7   INT. OFFICES - DEPARTMENT OF POPULATION - DAY

    Frosted glass workstations, notably circular rather than square.
    Lincoln sits at his desk in front of a wraparound etherscreen,
    divided into three sections, a formation known as a "visor".
    Right-visor shows a polymorph in fractal cycle, like a permanent
    screen saver. Mid-visor shows a tomograph of a residential block;
    tiers of apartments shown as boxes, most in solid white, a few
    blink red with the text label "Vacancy". Left-visor shows a list
    of names and sociographic grading sheaded "Residents Pending".

                                   LINCOLN (TO VISOR)
                     Hudson Four-Alpha; profile reviewed.
                     Match to vacancy; 171, Sector 5.
                     Request clearance to populate.

    - - PROCESSING . . . FOUR-ALPHA, HUDSON; POPULATION APPROVED

    Left-visor, the name highlights then blinks out. Mid-visor, a
    box labelled "Vacancy" turns from blinking red to solid white.

                                 A VOICE (O.S.)
                     Hey, you want to know something?

    Lincoln looks up at a face grinning over the partition - mid
    30's, jovial, tall and burly. His name is JONES THREE-BRAVO.

                                JONES
                     You know that guy who won the Spin in
                     your sector? Starkweather?

                                 LINCOLN
                     No.

                              JONES
                     I had a bout with him last week. Guess
                     how long he's been here? Six months.

                                LINCOLN
                     Six months?

                                JONES
                     You don't believe me - look it up.

                                 JONES
                     What do you say now? Still think The
                     Spin's rigged for the long haulers?

                                                                     8.



                             LINCOLN
                   He got lucky, that's all.

                              JONES
                   And don't you wish it was you... out
                   there on The Island... nature's own
                   clean air zone... no screening, no
                   quotas... unlimited pleasure...

                               LINCOLN
                   Shut up, Jonesy.

                              JONES
                   Why don't you make me? In the ring.

                                 LINCOLN
                   You're out of my weight-class.

                              JONES
                   Not anymore. They just got the new
                   program in - multi-weight balancing.

                               LINCOLN
                   I'll think about it.

                                 JONES
                   C'mon, champ. A stim unit says you
                   won't last three rounds.

8   INT . BOXING RING - CENTERVILLE - EARLY EVENING

    - C R A C K - The same face recoils from a punch. Jones shakes it off,
    retreating, recovering. He resets his guard as Lincoln moves in.
    Lincoln jabs at Jones' defenses, his blowing hitting harder than
    we'd expect from his stature. Suddenly he breaks through with a
    left hook. Jones staggers back. A strange ripple distorts his
    face. Stranger still, his skin tone takes on a grainy pallor.

    As the bout continues, we widen to see the boxing ring is indeed
    a ring rather than a square and beyond the ropes is an outer ring.
    With Lincoln in FG, we now see another figure in the outer ring,
    mirroring his moves, dressed identically but for the gloves which
    are like gauntlets. The gauntlets are rigged to two armatures
    which are, in turn, rigged to a gantry-like mechanism. It glides

    noiselessly to and fro, shadowing the figure round the outer ring.
    RACK FOCUS reveals the figure is also Lincoln . The real Lincoln,
    in fact. The one in FG is a derivative hologram known as a "proxy".
    As Lincoln fakes and jabs, the counter-weighted armatures drag
    and recoil, duplicating the exertions of his proxy. Jones moves
    more sluggishly, his proxy now ghostly, transparent. Now being
    sent on a last offensive only to be roundhoused by another left
    hook. Jones' proxy topples and explodes into a pixellated mist.

                                                                     9.



                               LINCOLN
                   Whoooooo!

    Lincoln proxy - and Lincoln - punch the air in victory. Jones
    unlatches his gauntlets, sweating, galled by the defeat-

                               JONES
                   Sure you input the right weight class?

                                 LINCOLN
                   You're just too slow, Jonesy.

                                 JONES
                   You're faster `cause you're lighter.
                   Programmers... they always miss
                   something.

                               LINCOLN
                   Hey, you put up, now pay up.

9   INT . STIM BAR - CENTERVILLE - EVENING

    Rainbow light and swirling electronic music. The clientele are
    all male residents. Round the walls, poster-sized etherscreens
    display various dancing women, beckoning, text supers flashing:

    - - NEW AT THE PLEASURE CENTER!... OR TRY A MYSTERY DATE!...
    At the bar, Lincoln and Jones, freshly showered, each swipe their
    ethercuffs over a scanner. A uniformed BARTENDER notes the readout-

                                BARTENDER
                   Jones Three-Bravo; you got five units.
                   Your friend, he's got an alcohol flag.

                             JONES
                   So make it a beer and a Vita Cola.

    The bartender serves the drinks and they settle at the end of the
    bar. Scoping for onlookers, Lincoln steals a gulp of Jones' beer.

                              JONES
                   You know, you're going to get yourself
                   contaminated one of these days.

                               LINCOLN
                   Shut up, Jonesy.

                              JONES
                   So, you up for a rematch tomorrow?

                            LINCOLN
                   I can't. I got an interact.

                                                                        10.



                                JONES
                    With who? That blonde again?

                                LINCOLN
                    Hey, it's an authorized interaction.
                    We're on the same meditation program.

                               JONES
                    You want to get flagged for proximity?

                              LINCOLN
                    No law against friendship, Jonesy.

                                    JONES
                    Quick . . . Give me that beer back.

     TWO CENSUS OFFICERS ("CENSORS") enter the bar; in wireless head-
     sets and white uniforms, they seem at once clinical and military.
     CENSOR 1 carries a tablet known as an "etherboard". CENSOR 2,
     more imposing, carries a wide-muzzle rifle known as a "stopgun".
     Their foreboding appearance is greeted without alarm. As they
     move up the bar, the customers dutifully swipe their ethercuffs
     over the etherboard. Now reaching Jones, who swipes accordingly-

                                  JONES
                    What's going on, officer?

                                  CENSOR 1
                    Census check.

     Censor1 checks the etherboard; a headshot of Jones spins in 3-D.
     He offers it to Lincoln who swipes his ethercuff emphatically-

                                LINCOLN
                    What happened? You lost count?

                             CENSOR 1
                    I hope nobody's drinking off-quota.

                                LINCOLN
                    Vita Cola all the way, officer.

     Lincoln sips his cola. As they move on, he grimaces at the taste.

10   INT . SHUTTLE - IN TRANSIT - LATER

     Lincoln stares out of the window. The red pulse of the lode poles
     catches a glazed look in his eyes. His pupils, a little dilated.
     His focus returns to the interior and an etherscreen banner:

     - - G E T READY FOR THE DAILY SPIN!... TOMORROW IT COULD BE YOU...

                                                                             11.



11   INT. BEDROOM - LINCOLN'S APARTMENT - THE NEXT DAY

     The horizon. The morning sun streams over the green mountains.
     Lincoln lies sleeping, his head buried under the pillow. Off a
     beeping sound, he stirs and squints up at the mirrored ceiling:

     - - ETHER CALL PENDING ; ACCEPT OR SEND TO MESSAGE BANK?

                                   LINCOLN
                       Accept.

     The etherscreen resolves Ester's face, fresh and bright.

                                       ESTER (ON ETHERSCREEN)
                       Lincoln? I missed you at breakfast.

                                LINCOLN
                       I guess I overslept.

                                ESTER (ON ETHERSCREEN)
                       I just wanted to check we're still on
                       for tonight. The interact.

                                     LINCOLN
                       Right. I'll be there.

                                   ESTER (ON ETHERSCREEN)
                       I'll see you then. Enjoy your day!

     Her face blinks out. Lincoln gets out of bed with a smile.

12   INT . RESIDENTIAL BLOCK - SECTOR FOUR - DAY

     Lincoln exits his apartment and heads up the walkway. We reveal
     the walkway ends at another ethergate, governing residential
     access. Lincoln swipes his ethercuff o v e r a scanner and a gate
     swings open. He heads on, the gate hissing closed behind him.

13   INT . NUTRITION PLAZA - SECTOR FOUR - DAY
     Ravel's Pavane plays overhead. The plaza is emptying as residents
     leave for work. Lincoln arrives at the service counter. He
     swipes his ethercuff and greets the clerk with an amiable grin.

                                   LINCOLN
                       Just juice today. I'm late for work.

                                  NUTRITION CLERK
                       Too bad. I gotta serve the full meal.

     Lincoln shrugs, his gaze wandering past her into the kitchens.
     His grin fades as he spots TWO CENSORS talking to a busboy. Then
     the view is lost as he's served an oatmeal and juice breakfast.

                                                                        12.



14   INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - SECTOR FOUR - DAY

     Not so crowded at this hour. Halfway down the platform we see a
     vending machine with confections in nameless silver wrappers. A
     mouse-ish resident collects a bar from the trough. His name is
     KLEINWORT NINE-ALPHA. Seeing Lincoln approach, he preempts-

                              KLEINWORT
                   No, no, no. Use your own sugar quota.

                                 LINCOLN
                   C'mon, Kleinwort...

     He says this amicably enough but he's using his imposing presence
     on the smaller man. Kleinwort sighs and breaks off a chunk.
                             LINCOLN
                   So what's up with the Censors, huh?

                                  KLEINWORT
                   They're conducting a census check. Or
                   don't you watch the bulletins?

                            LINCOLN
                   I know what it is. I've just never
                   seen them out in this sector before.

                                     KLEINWORT
                   Probably just tracking a glitch. A bad
                   scanner or maybe an userware defect.
                          (off Lincoln's puzzled look)
                   Ethercuffs. They get damaged, you get
                   a false read. Sometimes even a dropout.

                               LINCOLN
                   What are you saying? They lost someone?

                                  KLEINWORT
                   Someone just isn't showing up where
                   they should be. What do you care?

     A rush of air heralds the shuttle, curtailing the conversation.
     Beneath his tousling hair, a frown plays on Lincoln's brow.

15   INT . LINCOLN'S WORKSTATION - DEPT. OF POPULATION - DAY

     Lincoln stares at the fractal on right-visor, at the intricate
     paths of dysplasia. The glazed look has returned to his eyes,
     his pupils, a little dilated. His stare narrows at an errant
     thought. He shrugs it off. But the thought returns, persistent.
     More to dispel than indulge it, Lincoln turns to mid-visor-

                                                                       13.



                              LINCOLN (TO VISOR)
                Census File: Two-Delta, Starkweather.
- - T W O - D E L T A , STARKWEATHER: 102, SECTOR 4 - DAY: -- / HR: --

                                  LINCOLN (TO VISOR)
                Accomodation Status : 102, Sector 4.

The tiered boxes resolve, zooming in to isolate Apartment 102.
The box shows solid white. Lincoln frowns, assimilating this.

                            LINCOLN
                Hey , Jonesy. Remember the guy who won
                The Spin yesterday? His apartment's
                still showing as occupied.

                             JONES (O.S.)
                So?

                          LINCOLN
                So you get 24 hours to move out.

                             JONES (O.S.)
                Maybe the system didn't update yet.

                           LINCOLN
                No. It updates on the hour. If he's
                gone it should be showing a vacancy.

                                  JONES
                      (appearing over the partition)
                What? You think he's still here? The
                guy wins a place on The Island and you
                think he just decided not to go?

                         LINCOLN
                I don't know. He wasn't there to step
                up. And now there's a census check...
                           JONES
                And now nothing. It's probably the
                programmers messing up.

                             LINCOLN
                Maybe.

                         JONES
                A stim unit says I can prove it. Cross
                reference with sanitation.

                                  LINCOLN (TO VISOR)
                Sanitation Status: 102, Sector Four.

                                                                        14.



     --PROCESSING... APT. 102; CLOSED FOR CONTAINMENT CHECK--

                                    JONES
                        See ? Standard procedure. They got to
                        sweep it for the next occupant.

     Their supervisor interrupts them - an outsider, efficient-type-

                                  SUPERVISOR
                        If you gentlemen aren't busy... Perhaps
                        I could get an update on sector six?

                                     LINCOLN
                        Still in the electrical phase, sir.

                                    SUPERVISOR
                        Well the guys upstairs are griping
                        about the backlog. So go over there
                        and light some fires, will you?

                                         LINCOLN
                               (pulls on his jacket to leave)
                        I'll take care of it.

                                         SUPERVISOR
                        Aren't you forgetting something?
                               (holds up A STEEL BRIEFCASE)
                        Or do you want to get contaminated?

16   INT . CONSTRUCTION ZONE - SECTOR SIX - DAY

     An arc of blue light. A uniformed worker steers a plasma torch
     over a conduit. In the fog of smoke, we see wires being spliced,
     circuits, tested. Outsiders in hardhats, goggles and cup masks.
     Lincoln comes over the crosswalk, starkly contrasted in dacron
     coveralls and a hooded gasmask. THE CREW FOREMAN intercepts him -
     drawn, desiccated features, a husky drawl. His name is MCCORD-

                                      MCCORD
                        Sorry, chief. I can't let you get any
                        closer. We got live wires over there.

     Lincoln's reply is muffled by the gasmask, lost in the noise.

                                      MCCORD
                        What's that you said?

     Lincoln repeats to no avail. Frustrated, he peels off his gasmask-

                                 LINCOLN
                        I said I can't hear you.
     M c C o r d c h u c k l e s at the irony.

                                                                      15.



                                MCCORD
                    He y , you get yourself contaminated,
                    don't come pointing the finger at me.
                               LINCOLN
                    How are you doing, Mac?

                               MCCORD
                    You know how it is. `Gets to the end of
                    shift, `crew starts draggin t h e i r feet.

                                LINCOLN
                    We l l the guys upstairs are griping
                    about the backlog. They want to know
                    when you'll be ready for move in.
                             MCCORD
                    I guess if we bust our backs, we could
                    be out of here by the end of the week.

                                LINCOLN
                    I'll tell them two weeks.

                                   MCCORD
                    Thanks , chief. I appreciate that.

                                 LINCOLN
                    So . . . got any stuff on you today?

17   INT . AIRLOCK - SECTOR SIX

     A sign reads "Warning! Contamination Risk!". Lincoln stands by as
     McCord u n l o o p s a neckchain w i t h a single-forked pendant known as
     a "uni-key". He slots it into the top of three keyholes. A light
     starts flashing and the airlock gives a heavily pressurized hiss.

18   INT . EXTRACTOR SHAFT

     A deep steady thrum. Giant extractor fans churn above and below,
     both directions seemingly limitless. The bleak concrete shaft is
     streaked with soot, threaded by ladders and catwalks. On one
     such, we isolate Lincoln and McCord. B o t h smoking cigarettes.

                                LINCOLN
                    I t ' s too bad.
                                MCCORD
                    What do you mean?

                                LINCOLN
                    T h a t your shift's almost over.

                                                                     16.



                           MCCORD
                You mean, these things? Well, these
                things ain't good for you anyways.

                            LINCOLN
                The y taste good.

An exchanged smile. A pause as they enjoy the guilty pleasure.

                         LINCOLN
                I like coming here. Talking. Most
                outsiders don't like to talk.

                              MCCORD
                That's because we ain't supposed to.
                They got rules about fraternization.

Lincoln nods. Another pause as they drag on their cigarettes.

                            LINCOLN
                What do you do when the shift's over?

                            MCCORD
                M o r e of the same. They cycle us onto
                the disposal detail. Hump `n dump crew.

                            LINCOLN
                H u m p `n dump crew?

                              MCCORD
                D e b r i s clearance. We hump the heavy
                stuff to a site on the outside.
                          LINCOLN
                Is it as bad as they say out there?

M c C o r d l o o k s momentarily puzzled. Lincoln displays his gasmask.

                           LINCOLN
                The air... the containments.

                           MCCORD
                Right.

                           LINCOLN
                But not everywhere. Not on The Island.

                              MCCORD
                    ( b e a t , stubs his cigarette)
                I don't know too much about that.
Lincoln eyes him narrowly. McCord p a u s e s , then tucks his lighter
into the cigarette box and offers it with a palliative smile.

                                                                       17.



                                MCCORD
                    He y , take it from me, you got a sweet
                    deal right here. So why worry, huh?
     Lincoln shrugs, accepting the gift with a slow exhale of smoke.
     We tilt up to follow the smoke plume, dissipating into the fans.

19   EXT . THE WORLD OUTSIDE - DAY
     A i r blasts up from a giant tunnel.

     W i d e n i n g , we see it is one of a huge ring, planted in the dust,
     backdropped b y mountainous red rocks. At the hub of the ring is
     a large cubic building. From its facets, giant appendages of
     ducting plunge into its surround. These are the inlets for the
     processed air that feeds the underground...

     This is the landscape of the world outside and manifestly above.

     F r o m the processing plant, we pull back and up, raking over a
     large industrial complex. More cubic buildings, cream colored,
     windowless, like stacks of giant playing bricks. Now we see the
     front of the complex. The planate f a c a d e , faceless but for the
     entrance, cubed in polarized glass, like a dark cyclopean eye.

     F r o m the entrance, we follow a walkway out to a dock where the
     ground drops away into a broad concrete trench; like the subway,
     lined with lode-poles and buffers, it is known as a "lodeway".
     From the dock, we follow the lodeway out to a perimeter wall; red
     rock slabs, twenty feet high, framing a giant gateway. The gates
     now glide open to disclose a view of the world outside the wall-

     The shimmering bleached wilderness of The Arizona Desert.
     O u t in the distance, where the lodeway tapers into the scrub, a
     vehicle emerges from the shimmer. A hybrid of bus and nautical
     craft, single hulled, known simply as a "liner". Now as the
     liner becomes clearer, a decal on its prow is revealed - a
     crosshatch insignia over a blocky l e g e n d "The Sanger Institute".
20   INT . ENTRANCE HALL - THE SANGER INSTITUTE - DAY

     The polarized glass shows the liner has docked and A TOUR GROUP
     is disembarking. The men are mostly over 40, bloated by luxury.
     The women, mostly under 30, wives and girlfriends, all jewels and
     haute couture. They filter into the entrance hall to be greeted
     by the courtesy staff. Pretty girls in short skirts and blazers
     with the crosshatch insignia, led by a pert redhead named LYDIA.

                                  LYDIA
                    L a d i e s and gentlemen, my name is Lydia
                    and on behalf of our staff, I'd like
                    t o welcome you to The Sanger Institute.

                                                                          18.

                                    LYDIA (cont'd)
                    Before we start the tour, we'll be serv-
                    i n g r e f r e s h m e n t s in the visitor center
                    and circulating our standard discretion
                    agreements. I should add that today you
                    are all very lucky because our CEO and
                    founder, Dr. Henry Sanger, is with us
                    and will be leading the tour personally.

21   INT . INNER FOYER - LATER
     The crosshatch emblem spins on a wall-to-wall screen. Not a real
     screen but a projected flat known as a "holoframe". Here, Lydia
     assembles the tour group, nursing wine glasses and canapes. The
     holoframe fades up a serene music track and a commercial begins:
     A series of vignettes; an old man shuffling on a walking frame --
     a middle-aged woman in a bathing suit, one breast flattened by a
     mastectomy -- a young woman in labor, her face knotted in pain.
     The group watches with frowns and disapproving mumbles. Then-

                                V O I C E (O.S.)
                    I t ' s not a pretty sight, is it?
     E y e s turn to a figure behind them, dressed in a vestmental w h i t e
     labcoat - 70's, tall, slightly hunched by senility, eyes like
     quicksilver, glittering. He has the hauteur of a visionary
     stooping to the role of a salesman. His name is DR. HENRY SANGER.

                                      DR. SANGER (cont'd)
                    M o r t a l i t y . We all know its face and yet
                    w e look away, don't we? We deny that our
                    l i v e s are ordained to suffering. That
                    w e are all, inalterably, going to die.

     He pauses, fielding the various disconcerted looks. Then smiles.

                                DR. SANGER
                    I t takes courage to confront mortality,
                    my friends. And I see it in each of
                    y o u . My name is Dr. Henry Sanger and
                    I'm here to reward your courage.
     L y d i a applauds. The tour group dutifully follows suit. Sanger
     whispers a question in Lydia's ear. She broadcasts her response-

                                   LYDIA
                    T o d a y ' s group is from New Gaza Health
                    Care. They're with the platinum plan.

                               DR. SANGER
                    N e w Gaza. Yes, very good oncology unit.

     M u l l i n g this, he ambles through the holoframe which ripples at
     his passage. Rallied by Lydia the tour group follows him into--

                                                                  19.



22   INT. SALES HALL - DAY

     A hall of windows, each window framing a display case, each
     display case housing a different taxidermied a n i m a l . Not unlike
     a museum. On closer inspection, more like a chamber of horrors.
     I n one window is a pig with a horribly distended abdomen. Another,
     magnified, shows a mouse with a human ear grown on its back. In
     another, a chimpanzee stares out at us with glaringly human eyes.

                               DR. SANGER
                   I t doesn't get any prettier, does it?
                   But this is not a freakshow, my friends.
                   This is a war museum. A history of our
                   battles with mortality... and defeats.
                   Take the stem cell, for instance. A bid
                   to cultivate human parts for transplant -
                   in rodents, primates, barnyard animals.
                   It's enough to make your skin crawl. In
                   some cases literally, giving rise to a
                   new range of cross-species viruses. But
                   that's how we learn. From our mistakes.
     The y turn a corner. Another hall of windows, portals onto tanks
     of amber fluid that might be formaldehyde. Suspended within are
     embryos, fetuses and infants. All human. All grotesquely mutated.

                               DR. SANGER
                   C a s e in point, the clone. Back in the
                   beginning, the mapping of the human
                   genome was declared a historic landmark-
                   t o break the curse of heredity, to
                   correct congenital defect... genetic
                   engineering became the brave new world
                   of medical science. A bright future
                   that led to a dark age and much of the
                   legislation we know today. But while
                   the clone laws may have narrowed the
                   field, science marches on. Only to hit
                   the same wall over and over again - the
                   enigma of growth, the alchemy that
                   takes us from embryo to adult. A clone
                   barely reaches infancy before its
                   growth enzymes misfire, resulting in
                   the kind of monstrosities - which are
                   only effigies - you see here.

     S o m e reassured sighs from the women. They turn another corner onto
     another hall. A hall of mirrors. Simple, full-length mirrors.

                            DR. SANGER
                   So what do we learn from our mistakes?
                   That human parts cannot grow outside a
                   human body. That human bodies cannot
                   grow outside nature's grand design.

                                                                  20.



A FAT MAN, supporting his bulk with a walking stick, grunts -

                         T H E FAT MAN
               S o what the hell are we doing here?

                            DR. SANGER
               L e t ' s say one day you go to your doctor
               for a checkup. He discovers you have
               imminent renal failure and require a
               kidney transplant. What would you do?

                           T H E FAT MAN
               I wouldn't do nothing. My brother'd
               g i v e me one of his. Or else.

                           DR. SANGER
               E v e n if your brother's kidney is with-
               o u t defect, there's still a 38% chance
               of rejection. Or less if he's your twin.

                           T H E FAT MAN
               He's not. He's older.

                          DR. SANGER
               But what if you did have a twin?

O f f the fat man's confused look, Sanger smiles and gently coaxes
him to face a mirror. Their reflections stare back at them.

                           DR. SANGER
               What if you had a genetic double who'd
               give you not just one of his kidneys,
               but both? In fact, any organ or body
               part you ever had cause to need?

                            T H E FAT MAN
               What ? You mean like a clone? I thought
               you said all that stuff was a bust.

                        DR. SANGER
               I said the problem with a clone is it
               doesn't survive infancy. The solution
               is to find a different starting point.
               Why sow the seed when you can create
               the fruit? Or what we like to call...
               an "agnate".

L y d i a starts clapping., then s t o p s , realizing this wasn't a cue.

                         DR. SANGER
               An agnate is sequenced from a point on
               the cellular timeclock. I t is spawned
               post-maturate. It is `created' adult.

                                                              21.



                                DR. SANGER (cont'd)
              O f course, its brain is still vestigial
              s o for the first three years we keep it
              i n suspension. During which time we use
              d a t a impression to supply a template
              f o r functionality - a process we call
              " f o u n d a t i o n " . After foundation we
              t r a n s f e r the agnate into "containment"
              w h e r e it enters the conditioning
              p r o c e s s . An ongoing series of quality
              c o n t r o l s designed to test and maintain
              i t s functionality. After a minimum of
              t w o years conditioning, the agnate
              b e c o m e s eligible for harvest...
                      ( t o the FAT MAN, smiling)
              An d you, my friend, get your new kidney.

A hush falls among the group as they process what they've heard.
It's a sign of the times that none of them seems to be horrified.

                        T H E FAT MAN
             L e t me see if I got this straight. You
             can create this whatever... this walking
             spare parts holder... but I gotta w a i t
             five years to get hold of em?

                        DR. SANGER
             The spare parts, as you put it, need to
             be tested for integrity. But as many of
             our clients leave it till late in life
             to take out the policy, we do offer the
             option for early harvest. Given the
             risks, however, a waiver is required.

                       T H E FAT MAN
             S o five years or no warranty? For the
             premiums you're asking?

                        DR. SANGER
             An d what if the organ you   needed was a
             heart? Ask yourself, each     of you. If
             you had to put a price on     your life,
             your very survival - what     would it be?

A deep lull as the group considers this. Sanger picks his moment.

                         DR. SANGER
             I t ' s a question your insurance company
             has already answered. For them, the
             agnate obviates costly and ineffective
             treatment programs. Should you decide
             t o take out our policy, not only will
             they lower your existing premiums but
             they'll also cover the production cost.

                                                               22.



The incentive ripples across the faces. A troubled one speaks up-

                          T O U R MEMBER
              This "agnate"... what happens to it?
              After our friend here gets his kidney.

                            DR. SANGER
              That's entirely his decision. Our role
              is intermediary. We, as the insurance
              provider, guarantee the condition and
              availability of the agnate but all
              other rights are retained. In legal
              terms, the policy holder is defined as
              a "sponsor". The premiums, in effect,
              becoming sponsorship payments,
              maintaining the agnate until such time
              as harvest is required. At such time
              and where feasible, the sponsor has
              the option to extend sponsorship,
              retaining the agnate for secondary
              harvest or, shall we say, let the
              policy expire.

                             T O U R MEMBER
              E x p i r e ? You mean... let it die?

                            DR. SANGER
              N o . Not as you and I know it, at least.
              The associations of life and death are
              no more applicable to an agnate than to
              a cow in a field. It exists in a state
              of limited consciousness - aware not of
              life but of functionality. Imbued with
              the knowledge to maintain its function
              but without the capacity to question it.
              And yet, in many ways, the end if the
              most humane part of the process. The
              agnate goes to harvest without any fore-
              b o d i n g and is painlessly returned to the
              sleep from whence it came. Eternal or
              otherwise. There is mortality for an
              agnate. Just utility and redundancy.

                        T O U R MEMBER
              S o it doesn't know? It doesn't know
              its... its p u r p o s e in life?

                         DR. SANGER
              W h o does know my friend? Who among us
              knows our true purpose in life?
S a n g e r ambles on, plunged in thought. Lydia picks up the slack-

                                                                  23.



                          LYDIA
              This month we're offering a special
              rate for new sponsors. Including a 10%
              discount on the his-and-hers plan.

She ushers the group round another corner. Another holoframe and
another commercial, displaying the same characters as the first;
The old man with the walking frame is now running in a park--
The woman with the mastectomy is now at a party, her cocktail
dress broadcasting a full cleavage -- The young mother is now in
a waiting room, smiling as a doctor hands her a newborn baby.

                         LYDIA
              DR. SANGER? Would you like to close?

                            DR. SANGER
              Yes . . . Now some of you may be thinking
              this commercial is staged. But these are
              not actors, these are past customers.
              Real p e o p l e enjoying the real f r u i t s of
              sponsorship. What we offer here at The
              Sanger Institute is not just health
              insurance but indemnity. What we offer
              is the chance of a new lease on life...

The tour group applauds, this time without prompting from Lydia.

                         DR. SANGER
              N o w Lydia will walk you through the
              rest of the tour and explain the
              various limitations and exclusions.
              But I do have time for a few questions.
H a n d s are raised. A waspish-looking woman butts ahead of them-

                         T H E WASP
              The commercial. The girl with the baby.
              What is that? A fix for infertility?

                         DR. SANGER
              You mean the maternity plan? No.
              N o t endemic infertility at least. As I
              said, the law prohibits genetic
              alteration so a defect endemic in a
              sponsor will also be present in their
              agnate. No, what the maternity plan
              provides is a way round the risks and
              rigors of childbirth. Under this plan,
              an agnate becomes eligible for
              pregnancy shortly after foundation. A
              simple donation of sperm from the
              father, then the agnate is fertilized
              and brings your baby to term.

                                                                      24.



                                THE WASP
                     An d then what? You get it in the mail?

                                DR. SANGER
                     F o r practical reasons, delivery is
                     handled by your healthcare p r o v i d e r .

                                T H E WASP
                     An d "the agnate" - what happens to it?
                     When it's, you know - delivered.

                                DR. SANGER
                     The same rule applies. You can continue
                     your sponsorship. Or not. And in this
                     case, there's a natural window for
                     compliance as the agnate is routinely
                     sedated after delivery. As to whether
                     it wakes up from that sleep, like I
                     said, the choice is yours...

                                      T H E WASP
                            ( b e a t , a shrug)
                     An y t h i n g to avoid stretch-marks, right?

     The other tour members, some more guiltily than others, laugh.

23   EXT . PROCESSING PLANT
     A i r blasts up from the same giant tunnel, swallowing the laughs.

24   INT . EXTRACTOR SHAFT

     The acoustic hollowing as we look up from the now empty catwalk.
     The blast of air fading into the deep, steady thrum of the fans.

25   INT . CONTAINMENT

     The thrum fading to silence. A flat, measured silence as we
     revisit the community in soundless montage. The residential
     block, the frosted facades. The nutrition plaza, the counters,
     the chutes. The subway, the moving walkways. Centerville, the
     buildings now emitting a trickle of agnates, ending their
     workday - unwitting participants in their own greater utility.

26   INT . DIRECTOR'S OFFICE - CENTERVILLE
     A glass wall looks down on the avenue. The furniture is trans-
     p a r e n t , ethereal. Merrick sits at a console desk studying an
     etherboard. O f f a buzz, he taps a button. The door opens and
     Lincoln enters, composing a deadpan. He doesn't like this man.

                                LINCOLN
                     You wanted to see me?

                                                                    25.



                               MERRICK
                   Yes . Please, take a seat.
He taps     a button. The glass wall frosts over. It's unnerving but
Lincoln      stays deadpan, moving the chair before taking a seat.
Merrick      reviews the etherboard: Lincoln's headshot s p i n n i n g in
3D w i t h   a scroll of data. Then he looks up, forming a smile-

                                MERRICK
                   How ' s Lincoln Six-Echo today?

Lincoln shrugs, noncommittal. Merrick eyes him thoughtfully.

                                     MERRICK
                   E v e r y t h i n g going okay?

                            LINCOLN
                   I guess not.

                              MERRICK
                   Why do you say that?
                             LINCOLN
                   I f I'm here.

                              MERRICK
                   I'm not sure I deserve such a negative
                   association. My job's only to see that
                   you're happy. That everything's okay.

                                LINCOLN
                   Right.
                             MERRICK
                   I t sounds like you don't believe me.

                              LINCOLN
                   Why wouldn't I?

                                   MERRICK
                          ( s i t s back, smiling)
                   I t ' s part of your makeup. To challenge
                   things. To question what's around you.

                                LINCOLN
                   Ah.

                                  MERRICK
                   P e r h a p s you can utilize that facility
                   by helping me solve a little puzzle.
Lincoln shifts, feeling uneasy. Merrick consults the etherboard-

                                                                 26.



                                MERRICK
                You're doing well in most areas - pro-
                f i c i e n t a t work, exercising rigorously,
                your last medical puts you in excellent
                condition. But screening's picked up
                some deviations. Trace levels, changes
                in your sleep pattern... I see you've
                also been burning up your quotas...

                           LINCOLN
                A r e you saying I'm contaminated?

                            MERRICK
                No.
                            LINCOLN
                The n what's the problem?

                             MERRICK
                The r e are parameters, Lincoln. When
                someone starts straying from those
                parameters, we need to find out why.

                            LINCOLN
                Why?

                               MERRICK
                Because you - not just you, all of our
                residents - are special. Because people
                like me don't get to go to The Island.

He smiles. Lincoln stays deadpan, wondering where this is going.

                          MERRICK
                S o tell me, have you noticed any
                changes in yourself?

                            LINCOLN
                No.
                            MERRICK
                What about your sleep pattern? You
                feel you've been sleeping properly?

Lincoln shrugs, refractory.

                           MERRICK
                L e t me put it another way, when you
                wake up, do you feel... disrupted?

                         LINCOLN
                Disrupted?

                                                                  27.



                                MERRICK
               R e s t l e s s , disoriented, uneasy...
                        LINCOLN
               I don't know.

                              MERRICK
               They're all words in your vocabulary.
               I know you understand what they mean.
Lincoln ' s jaw clenches, patronized. Merrick notes this, resumes-

                                MERRICK
               Quotas . . . nutrition. Do you feel like
               you want more than you're given?
                        LINCOLN
               I don't know.

                         MERRICK
               Do you have any difficulty staying
               focused? At work, for instance?

Lincoln ' s jaw twitches. Merrick notes this, proceeds with care-

                           MERRICK
               H a v e you been experiencing feelings,
               sensations you don't quite understand?

                        LINCOLN
               I don't know.

                         MERRICK
               Do you sometimes feel agitated for no
               apparent reason? Frustrated, angry...

                             LINCOLN
               That's it.

                             MERRICK
               An g r y ? You feel angry?

                           LINCOLN
               Right.

                           MERRICK
               When exactly do you feel angry?

                           LINCOLN
               Now...
Lincoln leans forward as if to assert this. Merrick slowly nods
like he's just revealed something. He taps the etherboard-

                                                                 28.



                          MERRICK
               I'm going to order some tests at The
               Medical Center. In the meantime, I'd
               like you to stay away from stimulants -
               protein, sugar, caffeine...

                        LINCOLN
               I already burned up my quotas.

                          MERRICK
               But I know you can get around them.

He levels a knowing look. Lincoln stiffens again, unsettled.

                          MERRICK
               I'm asking you to cooperate. Not for
               my sake, Lincoln, but for your own.

                         LINCOLN
               Is that it?

                            MERRICK
               The r e is one other thing. You have a
               female friend. "Ester". Your file shows
               you've been interacting regularly.

                              LINCOLN
               The r e ' s no law against friendship.

                         MERRICK
               O f course not. We encourage interaction
               in the hope it'll be of mutual benefit.
               But given these deviations... let's
               just say proximity becomes an issue.

                        LINCOLN
               I know the rules of proximity.

                             MERRICK
               The rules of proximity apply to sexual
               contact, Lincoln. In this case it goes
               deeper than that. Ester is entering
               h e r second trimester. A time of change
               and emotional confusion. Further inter-
               a c t i o n might be... unhealthy for you.
Lincoln , patronized, looks away. This pill he won't swallow.

                          MERRICK
               An d for Ester - well, she has only six
               months left to delivery. Then she'll
               move out to The Island and whatever
               ties she has here will be broken.

                                                                       29.



                                      MERRICK (cont'd)
                    A s a friend, shouldn't you make her
                    t r a n s i t i o n as painless as possible?
     Lincoln ' s deadpan falters. This one, a bitter pill, he swallows.

                                 MERRICK
                    G o o d . Now I'm also going to refill
                    your pleasure quota. It may help to
                    settle you down a little.

                                 LINCOLN
                    Thank you. I feel much better now.

                               MERRICK
                    I'm not sure you do. But I think
                    you'll do what's right, Lincoln. You
                    may not trust me. But I trust you.

27   INT . COMMUNITY CENTER - CENTERVILLE - EVENING

     A theater in the round. The audience is mostly pregnant females
     and older residents. As the lights dim, eyes turn to the stage.
     Speakers bring up Handel's O m b r a M a i Fu. Then a glowing mist
     rises, condensing into a huge sphere, like a seed. Known as a
     "holomorph", it reacts sonically, germinating into stems and
     branches and blossoms, growing and evolving with the music. The
     diaspora i s as spellbinding as it is pacifying. It is beautiful.

28   INT . FOYER - COMMUNITY CENTER - EVENING

     The music from within is like a warm beckoning hand. The foyer is
     slightly vaulted to accommodate a statue. On a bench at its
     f o o t , Ester sits alone, waiting patiently. As Lincoln enters,
     s h e rises to greet him, smiling. He seems more sullen than
     usual.

                                 LINCOLN
                    S o r r y I'm late.

                                ESTER
                    I t ' s okay. I was waiting to tell you
                    something anyway. Guess what?

     Lincoln looks at her, unsettled by her flourishing smile.

                              ESTER
                    M y baby - I felt it move. And it's the
                    weirdest feeling too. I can't explain
                    it. It's like being more... more h e r e .
     Lincoln returns a deadpan look. Ester's smile wavers a little.

                                                                          30.



                                ESTER
                     I'm sorry. I'm all excited and we're
                     supposed to be finding peace of mind.

                              LINCOLN
                     I have to cancel, Ester.

     His voice is expressionless. Ester shrugs, refreshing her smile.

                               ESTER
                     S o I'll see you at breakfast tomorrow?

                              LINCOLN
                     I don't think so.
     Ester ' s smile falls. Her eyes, reaching, trying to understand.

                                ESTER
                     Did I do something wrong, Lincoln?

                                LINCOLN
                     No.

     A small word but it comes heavily. Before Ester can ask another
     question, Lincoln turns and leaves. His jaw, clenching with the
     effort of self-containment. Ester watches him, not hurt, just a
     little confused. We widen to encompass the height of the statue.
     The likeness is idealized but unmistakably that of Dr. Sanger.

29   INT . PLEASURE CENTER - NIGHT

     B l u e light. Lincoln walks up a long corridor, carrying a sealed
     plastic bag. Along the walls, poster-sized screens like those in
     the bar, display images of women, gyrating, licking their lips.

30   INT . PLEASURE CELL - NIGHT

     The blue light sustains. To one side is a mirrored wall, known
     as an "etherwall". It is currently pixellated t o display a grid
     of women's faces, artificial consorts waiting to be selected.
     Facing the etherwall i s a large aquarium-like tank, filled with
     gelatinous blue liquid. This vessel is known as a "sense tank".

     Lincoln sits at the rim, naked, wearing a full-head oxygen mask.
     He couples it to a hose dangling from the ceiling. Then lowers
     himself into the tank. On the inner facet, a touchlight k e y p a d
     resolves. Lincoln taps some keys and the etherwall a c k n o w l e d g e s :

     - - P L E A S U R E PARTNER SELECTED; PROGRAM COMMENCING...

     Lincoln looks out at the etherwall. The faces blink off to leave
     him staring at his reflection. Just one left, a pouting redhead,
     who licks her lips in anticipation as the lights dim.

                                                                       31.



     A holographic mist now rises. First resolving a proxy of Lincoln,
     naked, replicating his posture in the tank. Then the redhead is
     conjured, her buxom nudity glimpsed through the swirling mist.
     Lincoln proxy reaches out to stroke redhead proxy's breast. In
     the tank, Lincoln's fingers caress only the gel, his fingertips
     met by soft arcs of light - neurological charges, conducted by
     the gel, creating the sense of touch. They are known as "impulse
     arcs". Redhead proxy responds, dappling her lips across Lincoln
     proxy's neck. In the tank, impulse arcs flicker across Lincoln's
     throat, then down his chest, descending to more erogenous zones.
     Lincoln stiffens and closes his eyes, yielding to the sensation.

     The sensation engulfing him, Lincoln's brow starts to furrow. Not
     with ecstasy. Something darker. His eyes open, his pupils fixed
     in a black dilated stare. Resisting the artificiality, his face
     forming a sneer, tightening until... he slams h i s palm into the
     touchpad. The tank shakes. The proxies blink out. Lincoln stands
     mirrored in the etherwall. His hand, pressed against the glass in
     a posture of defiance. His reflection, warped and shuddering.

31   INT . ELEVATOR SHAFT

     F r o m darkness grows a seed of light. Red light, pulsing to reveal
     the shaft, lined by lode-poles, here in triangulated relay. The
     polarity cradles a dark mass towards us. An elevator in descent.

32   INT . DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

     Merrick   is at his console, working late. Off a buzz, he taps a
     button.   The door opens and an outsider enters - 40's, square set,
     hollow,   remote eyes. His hair is damp and he wears post-decon
     scrubs.   A USMC ring is visible on his finger. His name is SCHEER.

                                    MERRICK
                     K a r l . . . Welcome back.

     S c h e e r pauses, his face twitching. Then sneezes violently.

                              SCHEER
                     I forgot how much I hate the air here.

                                 MERRICK
                     J u s t a histamine reflex. Your system's
                     readjusting to the sterile environment.

                                 SCHEER
                     I t ' s the smell I hate. Empty.

                                 MERRICK
                     Yes , well I cut short your leave for a
                     reason. I take it you've been briefed?

                                                                     32.



                                SCHEER
                      ( s i t s , sniffing)
                O n e of our lab rats is missing.
W i t h a dour look, Merrick slots his etherboard i n t o a dock. A
proxy resolves over the console, quarter scale, spinning in 3D;
male, African American, bull neck. Data etches across thin air:

- - P R O D U C T ID: STARKWEATHER; FOUNDATION: II; GENERATION: DELTA;
- - I N T E G R A T I O N DATE: 01/27/84 // CONTAINMENT REF: 102, SECTOR 4

                           MERRICK
                His name is Starkweather Two-Delta. He
                dropped off the ether two days ago. At
                first we thought it was a system error.
                Then we found this in a garbage chute.

He opens a drawer and pulls out an ethercuff. He hands it to
Scheer who considers it remotely for a few seconds. Then-

                             SCHEER
                D e l t a generation, huh?

                              MERRICK
                That's right.

                          SCHEER
                I t was a Delta the last time.

                            MERRICK
                T h a t was entirely different. The
                product suffered a head injury.
                            SCHEER
                What happened to this one?

                          MERRICK
                We don't know. He just disappeared.
                           SCHEER
                N o t easy to disappear. Unless he
                figured a way through the boundary.

                            MERRICK
                He's a code two, Karl. A low functioner.
                          SCHEER
                I f you ask me, it's a mistake giving
                them any functions at all.

                            MERRICK
                The y don't function mentally, they don't
                function physically - you know that.

                                                                      33.



                           SCHEER
               The n perhaps if you're going to breed
               lab rats, you should breed them tame.
His look, albeit from a distance, throws a stone. Merrick hardens-

                         MERRICK
               I f you bothered to read the clone laws,
               you'd realize we have no choice in the
               matter. The virtual humanity statutes
               accord them a set of freedoms. All we
               can do is prescribe the limits. And
               even those are subject to regulation.
               Scope of knowledge, range of activity,
               even their speech patterns. The law
               requires that what is of human origin
               be provided with human characteristics.

                          SCHEER
               You mean, like fallibility?
Merrick pauses. He's not going to take the bait.

                          MERRICK
               The ether shows no attempts on the
               boundary. He's here, Karl. But for
               some reason, your men seem unable to
               find him. It's your job to contain the
               products. I'd like you to do it, okay?

                        SCHEER
               A little sensitive, aren't we?

                           MERRICK
               J u s t after Starkweather went missing,
               his sponsor placed an order. An order we
               can't fill. Damn right I'm sensitive.

                               SCHEER
               A l r i g h t . How much time do I have?

Merrick taps a button. A holoframe appears beside the proxy.
Even in two dimensions, the face is identical. Just a different
hairstyle and a gold earring. This is the face of The Sponsor.

                               MERRICK
               J a m i l Starkweather . . . last week he
               sustained a hepatic trauma resulting in
               liver hemorrhage. In medical terms, we
               have maybe a few weeks. In legal terms,
               we're already o n borrowed time...
                      ( a s Scheer rises to leave)
               An d Karl?

                                                                            34.



                                   MERRICK (cont'd)
                      I don't want a godawful m e s s like the
                      l a s t time. Minimal damage. Understood?

33   INT . LINCOLN'S APARTMENT - PREDAWN

     The horizon. The green mountains cast black by the predawn
     glower. Lincoln sits rigidly hunched on his bed, still in
     yesterday's clothes, sleepless. He is staring fixedly out of the
     window, hungrily, as if inviting the outer darkness to come in.

     His gaze lowers onto his jacket, slung across the bed. He digs
     in the pocket. And pulls out the cigarette pack. For a moment he
     considers it. Then slowly, purposefully, he opens it. He slips a
     cigarette between his lips. And lights up. He leans back, taking
     a slow drag. Exhaling, he watches the smoke rise. His gaze rests
     on the etherscreen above, expectant. The cursor comes to life:

     - - S C R E E N I N G . . . CONTAMINANT DETECTED: ADVISING SANITATION CTRL

     R e f l e c t e d in the ceiling, Lincoln grins at his small victory.
34   INT . RESIDENTIAL BLOCK - SECTOR FOUR

     Q u i e t , empty at this hour. Just the drum of footfalls as Lincoln
     marches up the walkway, puffing his cigarette. He stops at the
     ethergate, regarding it as if for the first time. Then he stubs
     out his cigarette. And swipes his ethercuff o v e r the scanner.

35   INT . THE ETHER GRID

     A blue dot blinks in space. We widen to establish its locus on a
     tomograph. Now building the boxes, the quadrants, the sectors.
     Revealing a vast, fully dimensional hologram of containment. It
     spins in the vaulted chamber like a giant geometrical phantom.

36   INT . ETHER CONTROL ROOM

     O v e r l o o k i n g the ether, like a studio control booth. Known as
     "Ethercon", it's also the title of the Censor at the console.
     Scheer stands over him, now in a white censor uniform with black
     chevrons on the sleeves, marking his seniority. He instructs-

                                    SCHEER
                     R e v e r s e map. Crop to twelve hour
                     segments. Then put up a sub-grid.

     - - S T A R K W E A T H E R TWO-DELTA: ETHER HISTORY; REVERSE MAPPING...

     T o one side, a miniature of the ether grid resolves. It peppers
     with a series of blue dots. Then a blue line stems from a point
     of origin to start joining them. Scheer leans in, eyes honing,
     watching the blue line retrace the last steps of his quarry.

                                                                     35.



37   INT. NUTRITION PLAZA - SECTOR FOUR - PREDAWN

     The glass wall reprises the predawn glower. The plaza is empty
     at this hour. But the service counters are staffed as breakfast
     is being prepared. The clerk looks surprised to see Lincoln
     arriving so early. He seems grim, latent, stiffly swiping his
     ethercuff o v e r the scanner. She eyes the readout on her screen-

                                   N U T R I T I O N CLERK
                    Lincoln Six-Echo... Options are dried
                    fruit, oatmeal or anything in bran.

                             LINCOLN
                    I want some bacon.

                               N U T R I T I O N CLERK
                    You heard the options.

                               LINCOLN
                    An d coffee. I want coffee.
     The clerk sighs and taps her screen. Turning to the chutes, she
     collects a foil covered bowl and a juice can and sets them on
     Lincoln's tray. Lincoln glances down at it, then back up-

                                LINCOLN
                    This isn't what I asked for.

                               N U T R I T I O N CLERK
                    You want to get into it? Look, I just
                    work here, pal. I serve the meal and
                    make sure it goes down on your record.
     Lincoln nods slowly. Then picks up the bowl. And flings i t across
     the plaza. Then the juice can, trying to outdistance the bowl.
     Finally, the tray, which rotors almost to the far side before
     clattering into obscurity. Then he turns back to the clerk-

                               LINCOLN
                    P u t that on my fucking r e c o r d .

38   INT . SUBWAY PORTAL - SECTOR FOUR

     The latticed wall of ethergates. The rising beat of footfalls as
     Lincoln approaches. He swipes his ethercuff o v e r the scanner. The
     gate slowly hisses open. Too slowly for Lincoln, who kicks it and
     barges his way through, leaving the gate to shudder on its hinge.

39   INT . SUBWAY PLATFORM

     The walkways, unmoving. The platform, deserted. The echoing beat
     of footfalls as Lincoln marches up to the vending machine. He
     swipes his ethercuff o v e r the scanner. A screen illuminates:

                                                                36.



--SUGAR QUOTA EXCEEDED; ACCESS DENIED

Lincoln glowers at the message. His jaw clenching, twitching with
anger. Erupting, he lashes out, punching t h e machine. He winces
as his knuckles crack. Then grabs the machine, trying to rip it
off the wall. Pulling, straining, sneering with effort, until-

He lets go with a defeated gasp. Then kicks the machine in final
affront. The machine resounds with a dull boom. For a moment, he
stands there, chest heaving. Then suddenly traps his breath...

The r e , in the fading boom, a noise. Faint, rhythmic. Becoming
discernible as THE SOUND OF A MAN SOBBING. Lincoln turns toward
the platform. Tracing the sound, he crosses to the safety fence.

                           LINCOLN
               Hello?

His voice echoes to nothing. He leans over the fence and peers
up the tunnel. There. In the fog of darkness, a figure. A figure
paused, half-standing, like an animal on the brink of flight.
The figure seems to stare at him. Then pulls upright. Now moving
forward and into the light. His face is African American, bull-
n e c k e d , eyes wild and bloodshot. A stranger to Lincoln, we know
him as STARKWEATHER TWO-DELTA. His voice is quivering, unhinged-

                           STARKWEATHER
               Please...

Lincoln stands, frozen by the sight of this dark, dishevelled
resident. As he climbs up onto the platform, we see his hands,
the fingertips grated and bloody. He lumbers towards Lincoln-

                              STARKWEATHER
               P l e a s e , you have to help me...

He rushes forward, grabbing Lincoln, pulling him face-close-

                          STARKWEATHER
               Y O U CAN'T LET THEM TAKE ME!

The stranger's eyes grow darkly, his pupils abysmal, black with
dilation. Lincoln fiercely shrugs off his grip, backing away...

                          LINCOLN
               W h o are you? What's wrong with you?

The stranger's eyes bore into him, obsidian. Face contorting,
baring his teeth like a rabid dog. Suddenly he lunges a t Lincoln-
- B O O M - ramming him back into the vending machine - Lincoln is
stunned - suddenly a vice-like grip on his wrist swings him round-
- C R A C K - into the etherscreen banner, webbing at the impact...

                                                                           37.



     For a moment, all is a blur. Teetering, Lincoln props himself
     against the wall. Then his focus resolves on the etherscreen and
     his fractured reflection. He releases a deep, bewildered breath.
     Then he notices his wrist. His ethercuff i s missing, his skin,
     grazed red from abrasion. Confusion yielding to anger, he looks
     for his assailant. But the platform is empty. His jaw clenches.

40   INT . SUBWAY PORTAL - SECTOR FOUR

     T H E DRUM OF FOOTFALLS as Starkweather rushes up to the ethergate.
     H a n d shaking, he swipes Lincoln's ethercuff o v e r the scanner. The
     gate hisses open and he barrels through, suddenly spurred by --

     LINCOLN BURSTING UP from the well of walkways, charging forward
     like a bull. The gate now closing, Lincoln races for the gap,
     barging his way through. And the gate snaps shut with a CLANG.

41   INT . ETHER CONTROL ROOM

     A N ALARM SOUNDS. The console flashes. Ethercon responds with a
     flurry of keystrokes. Scheer rejoins him as he pulls up a sub-
     g r i d . This one evolving past tomograph, mosaicing a n g l e s from
     etherscreen, conjugating a 3D l i v e feed known as an "etherview"--

                                                             M A T C H CUT TO:

42   INT . NUTRITION PLAZA - SECTOR FOUR - DAWN

     S T A R K W E A T H E R BARRELING ACROSS THE PLAZA; glancing off tables,
     sending chairs flying. Some residents, arriving for breakfast,
     scatter at his onset. Shocked faces, looking back and forth as
     Lincoln follows, in hot pursuit, vaulting the toppled furniture.

43   INT . ELEVATOR BANK - AN UPPER LEVEL

     A SQUAD OF CENSORS CONVERGING; called suddenly to duty, looping
     tri-keys r o u n d their necks, donning headsets, priming stopguns.
     S c h e e r leads them into the elevator, coolly relaying his orders-

                                   SCHEER
                    S u b j e c t headed into North Quadrant. Two-
                    m a n teams - we block him and force him
                    to ground. If you have a shot, hook him
                    but keep it above the belt. Management
                    doesn't want us to "damage the product".
     The Censors roll their eyes knowingly. Scheer taps his headset.

                                     S C H E E R (INTO HEADSET)
                    E t h e r c o n ? Sector Four North; code an
                    exclusion for tri-key a c c e s s . Then
                    give me a full quadrant lockdown.

                                                                          38.



44   INT. RESIDENTIAL BLOCK - SECTOR FOUR

     A VERTICAL ONTO A RESIDENTIAL BLOCK: the grid of crosswalks, the
     tiers of frosted facades; quiet, the residents still dormant--

     A DRUM OF FOOTFALLS: Then a figure breaking frame, racing up the
     walkway of an upper floor; then another figure, in hot pursuit --

     T H E LOCKDOWN I N I T I A T E S : the lights shifting spectrum from white
     to ultraviolet, bathing the quadrant in a lambent purple haze--

     S T A R K W E A T H E R : his eyes bulging with panic as he races up the
     walkway, straining for an ethergate a t the far end of the floor--

     LINCOLN : his eyes charged with adrenaline, straining to close
     ground on his assailant; oblivious to the building noise of--

     T H E LOCKDOWN: locks hissing, lights flashing, ripping up the row
     of frosted facades; sweeping past Lincoln and onward toward--

     S T A R K W E A T H E R : the ripple of hissing locks rushing up on him, he
     pours on the pace, sneering with effort as he tries to outrace--

     T H E LOCKDOWN: the ripple spearing ahead of him to the end of the
     floor; now banking across the ethergate a n d sealing the exit.

     S T A R K W E A T H E R : stalled by the realization he's trapped; he spins
     round, looking for another avenue of escape only to find--

     LINCOLN: blindsiding h i s assailant with a headlong tackle; both
     men toppling over, hitting the floor with a bone-jarring thud--

     S T A R K W E A T H E R : quick to recover, breaking lose of entanglement;
     now struggling to his feet, stumbling onward up the walkway--

     LINCOLN : gets up to resume pursuit, then pauses, spotting his
     ethercuff, discarded on the ground. He looks up in confusion at--

     S T A R K W E A T H E R : a short distance ahead, climbing over the walkway
     rail; launching himself off, into a seemingly suicidal plummet--

     LINCOLN : leaning over the rail, seeing his assailant land safely
     on a crosswalk beneath, resuming his flight on the lower floor as-

     - B O O M - A GUNBLAST r i p s the air. A KEENING SOUND builds to a wail-
     - T H U D - LINCOLN JOLTS as something hits his shoulder, catching him
     off-balance, a stab of pain keeling him onto the rail -CLANG -

     LINCOLN SLUMPS INTO FG - TWO CENSORS converging like white ghosts
     from the purple haze - one reprimanding his recalcitrant cohort-

                                                                           39.



                               CENSOR
                    You asshole! You hooked the wrong one!
     He crouches to examine Lincoln. Blood is blossoming from a wound
     on his shoulder, jutting from which is a projectile. The censor
     presses its base and it snaps loose of its unintended target.

     N o w we see the projectile more clearly. A fat metal pellet, snub-
     n o s e d , finned at the tail by four metal teeth. On impact, the
     nose recesses to release a springload a n d the teeth snap forward
     to bite into the target. This device is known as a "hookhead".

                                     CENSOR
                    J u s t a flesh wound. `Hit his head
                    pretty hard. Possible concussion.
                           ( i n s p e c t i n g Lincoln's pupils)
                    T h i n k you can walk, buddy?

     Lincoln nods slightly. The censor unloops a tri-key f r o m his neck-

                               CENSOR
                    You see this? It'll get you past the
                    lockdown. You're to report to The
                    Medical Center. You understand?

     O f f Lincoln's blank stare, the censor presses the tri-key i n t o
     his palm. Then departs. Lincoln stays where he sits, still dazed
     from the concussion. Absently he watches the censors race off up
     the walkway, dissolving back into the purple haze as we-

                                                                     C U T TO:

45   INT . ETHER CONTROL ROOM
     S T A R K W E A T H E R RUNNING. Meeting white uniforms at every turn, zig-
     z a g g i n g o v e r crosswalks, down ramps. The rat in the maze, dumb to
     its inevitable destination. Widening, we see we are watching the
     action on etherview, racking and dollying like a deific e y e .

                                E T H E R C O N (INTO HEADSET)
                    E a s t side team hold position. Subject
                    headed for the second floor crossramp.

46   INT . GROUND FLOOR - RESIDENTIAL BLOCK
     C l o a k e d in shadow, Scheer listens to the play-by-play on headset.
     With a tap, he changes the channel, whispering to his squad-

                                S C H E E R (INTO HEADSET)
                    G i v e him some space. I have him.
     A N O T H E R ANGLE: Starkweather hits the deck running, sprinting up
     the avenue. In BG, Scheer steps forth, stopgun l e v e l l e d , aiming--

                                                                             40.



     -BOOM- The flash of the muzzle, the shrill wail of the hookhead.

     - T H U D - Starkweather jolts as the shot hits him square in the
     back, arching as the hookhead b i t e s ; but he keeps on running-

     - B O O M - B O O M - B O O M - Scheer unleashes his ordnance, filling the air.

     - T H U D - T H U D - T H U D - Starkweather jolts from one, two, three more
     hits; hookheads b i t i n g , spraying blood; but he keeps on running.
                                 S C H E E R (INTO HEADSET)
                      A l l clear. Flood the area.

     A N O T H E R ANGLE; Floor level, as between the tiles, tiny red lights
     start blinking, rippling forward in a wave. Known as "lode-pins"
     their small magnetic pulses accumulate into a low level stream.

     The hookheads c l a w e d in Starkweather's back also start blinking
     red. The invisible stream flowing beneath his feet, Starkweather
     feels its force. The duelling polarities stealing his traction.
     His run reducing to a slipsliding s t a g g e r . Then his feet leave
     the ground. He flails for a handhold. But there's nothing. The
     force lifts him a foot clear off the ground before balancing out
     to dangle him in mid-air, squirming about like a fish on a hook.

     A N O T H E R ANGLE; Scheer advances to reel in his catch. The stream
     bows before him, red lights blinking out. Until all that remains
     is the section where Starkweather hangs suspended. Scheer stops
     at its limit, looking up at him like some curious zoo exhibit.

                                  S C H E E R (INTO HEADSET)
                      H o o d him, cuff him, patch the bleed.
                      Then let's get him up to Level Three.
     A N O T H E R ANGLE: looking down from high above as the Censors move
     in on Starkweather. Scheer now walking away, tapping his headset-

                                       S C H E E R (INTO HEADSET)
                      E t h e r c o n ? Send word to dispatch.
                      Starkweather Two-Delta is secured.

     R E V E R S E ANGLE: Lincoln in CU, looking down. He has seen and heard
     all that has just passed. In his eyes, we see his daze clearing,
     consciousness coalescing, deepening. His pupils dilating into a
     deep and uncanny stare. What can only be described as a dawning.
47   INT . NUTRITION PLAZA - SECTOR FOUR - LATER

     N o w full but unusually quiet. Residents sit in whispered, anxious
     discourse. The news of the incident is spreading. Off a series of
     chimes, eyes turn to the glass wall, now pixellating i n t o an
     outsider's face - calm, official. THE COMMUNITY ANNOUNCER begins-

                                                                      41.



                                COMMUNITY ANNOUNCER
                    Good morning - this is a community
                    bulletin... Following an incident in
                    Sector Four earlier this morning, The
                    Department of Sanitation is issuing an
                    all-sector contamination warning...

     TRACKING the rapt concern of the residents, Ester among them.

                               COMMUNITY ANNOUNCER
                    The incident involved a resident found
                    to be infected with a pathogen. While
                    the risk is assessed, residents are
                    advised to be aware of the symptoms.
                    Should you experience aberrant levels
                    of anxiety or witness it in others,
                    immediately contact The Medical Center.

48   INT . DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

     The proxy of Starkweather spins over the desk. Merrick regards
     i t with a frown. Scheer sits turning the ethercuff i n his fingers
     with a demeanor of cool curiosity. Underneath, he's rattled.

                               SCHEER
                    You want to tell me what's going on?

                                   MERRICK
                    There's nothing going on, Karl.

                               SCHEER
                    I'm jaded. Not stupid.

                                  MERRICK
                    What's your point?

                             SCHEER
                    I checked up. In the past year, three
                    products have destabilized. All of them
                    Deltas... and there's nothing going on?

                                  MERRICK
                    You're jumping to conclusions.

                                SCHEER
                    Once I can overlook. Twice I can call
                    coincidence. Three times I start giving
                    a shit. Because if these products are
                    defective...

                                   MERRICK
                    Q u a l i t y control is not your concern.

                                                               42.



                        SCHEER
              S o it is a quality control issue?

                            MERRICK
              That's not what I said.

                        SCHEER
              He was in the subway tunnels for two
              days. In the dark, no food, no water.
              His fingers were scraped to the bone.
              He was trying to dig his way out. Now
              you try to explain to me why that is.

His look says he smells a rat. Merrick weighs him a moment. Then
sighs, a little depleted. He gets up and crosses to the glass
wall. Looks down on the avenue, at the agnates m i l l i n g beneath.

                               MERRICK
              It's not an exact science - biogenesis.
              There's a degree of trial and error. If
              the agnate doesn't come together on the
              first pass, we have to abort and start
              over. It's like breaking inertia. The
              bioreactor, the growth medium - we just
              keep upping the levels till we achieve
              integration. At which stage the agnate
              is deemed physically stable. We rely on
              foundation to provide mental stability -
              matching the templates to their capacity
              but walling it in with parameters.
                     ( b e a t , considers the proxy)
              When signs of instability started to
              show up, it pointed to foundation. A
              hole in the wall, an oversight. But it
              was only happening in the later generat-
              ions . Which pointed back to biogenesis.

                        SCHEER
              So there was a production defect.

                              MERRICK
              Actually the opposite. We found out in
              the later generations, the levels were
              so high that when we broke inertia, the
              process kept going. Over-integrating.
              Specifically the neural system. It
              produced a condition called synesthesia.

                       SCHEER
              Synesthesia...

                                                                  43.



                             MERRICK
               A fusion of the senses, creating a
               component awareness. Sixth sense,
               s e c o n d sight, whatever you want to call
               it. Its emergence seems to be arbitrary.
               But it gives them experiences beyond
               their functional parameters. And
               ultimately... it destabilizes them.
               However, if we catch it early enough we
               can control it with re-conditioning.

Scheer absorbs this with a slow grin. Merrick looks puzzled.

                          MERRICK
               You find this amusing?

                          SCHEER
               Poetic.

                          MERRICK
               Poetic?

                           SCHEER
               This "agnate" took off just before his
               sponsor placed an order. Maybe he got
               the sense his days were numbered...

Merrick ' s composure cracks a little. He hadn't thought of this.

                           MERRICK
               This stays between you and me, Karl. I
               trust I can rely on your cooperation?

                            SCHEER
               Don't you mean my complicity?

                                MERRICK
                      (hardening again)
               Remind me, why is it you were
               discharged from the military?

                             SCHEER
               What's your point?

                            MERRICK
               Learn to be a team player, Karl. Or
               you'll find yourself out of another
               job.

Scheer rises, discarding the ethercuff onto Merrick's desk.

                             SCHEER
               Nobody else would take it.

                                                                     44.



49   INT. EXTRACTOR SHAFT

     The deep steady thrum of the extractor fans. We are TIGHT ON the
     frame of an airlock. Hissing, it indents and opens. Lincoln steps
     through, eyes black and uncanny. The tri-key g l i n t i n g , dangling
     from his fingers. Scanning around, he fixes on a section of wall.
     He wipes off some soot. Legible beneath is a number. Twenty. He
     assimilates this. Then turns his gaze up the extractor shaft.

50   INT . ELEVATOR SHAFT

     Looking up an elevator shaft. The red pulse of the lode-poles,
     rippling downward as an elevator descends from the surface.

51   INT . OUTER THRESHOLD - LEVEL THREE

     A tiled chamber. Draped off cubicles. The elevator doors slide
     open. An outsider emerges, dressed in a flightsuit, emblazoned
     "Medical Courier". He announces himself, seemingly to no one-

                                      T H E COURIER
                     Clearance code: NG-230-2DS.

                                V O I C E ON SPEAKER
                     New Gaza Healthcare. Okay, you're
                     clear. Go ahead and get undressed.

52   INT . DECONTAMINATION CHAMBER

     The pressure door hisses, heaving open. The courier steps inside,
     naked, covering his genitals, some goggles slung around his neck.
     He takes position on two marked footpads and puts on the goggles-

                              T H E COURIER
                     I tell you, I hate this fucking r u n . I
                     always leave this place with sunburn.

                                V O I C E ON SPEAKER
                     Try full-course decontamination. It's
                     even more fun. Especially the colonics.

     The lights blink out. A red glow rises. Twin planes of light
     scrape across the courier, infra-red, searing his epidermis.

53   INT . INNER THRESHOLD - LEVEL THREE

     A chamber like the first. The inner pressure door hisses open.
     The courier emerges, dripping wet from a decon s h o w e r . He goes
     to a cubicle, grabbing a towel and dries himself off. Laid out
     within are some scrubs. Beside them is A STEEL COOLER, inset
     with a thermostat and embossed with the crosshatch insignia.

                                                                     45.



54   INT. CORRIDOR - LEVEL THREE

     The courier strolls up the corridor, now dressed in the scrubs
     and carrying the cooler. He turns a corner and his footsteps
     gradually fade out. A flat, sterile silence falls in his wake.

     A metal squeal. A ventilation grid levers down from the ceiling.
     A pause. Then a pair of feet drop through, legs, torso. Dropping
     to the floor, Lincoln stands revealed. Sweaty, smeared black
     with dust. For a moment he looks around to get his bearings.
     Suddenly he freezes, hearing-

                                  A VOICE (O.S.)
                     C h e c k in at the nurse's station. Up
                     the corridor, left, then first right.

     The footsteps are now coming back. Lincoln spins round. He finds
     a door. A lock panel. A moment of panic. Then he fumbles the tri-
     k e y f r o m his pocket, hurriedly slotting it into the lock panel.

55   INT . THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR - SECONDS LATER

     Lincoln waits, ear to the door, listening as the footsteps pass
     and fade out of earshot. Lincoln releases his breath in relief,
     calming a little, then frowning as he registers another sound.

     Very faint, rhythmic. He turns and looks around. The room is in
     partial shadow. To one side is a row of seats, to the other, a
     row of windows, covered by blinds, light creasing through. The
     sound repeats. Muffled. But now unmistakably THE CRY OF A BABY.

56   INT . HARVEST ROOM

     A grid of bio-readouts, each square alive with graphs and digits.
     The familiar baseline of a cardiograph. A lever-arm mounted with
     an IV r e s e r v o i r , dangling tubes and wires onto the OR table.

     We see A DOCTOR and A MIDWIFE, in whose arms A NEWBORN BABY
     squirms and bawls. Lying on the table, we see THE MOTHER, her
     feet up in stirrups, deeply flushed and puffing from exertion.
     Marked by her crosshatch as an agnate, she has just given birth-

                                THE AGNATE MOTHER
                     May I hold her?

                               THE DOCTOR
                     We have to run a few tests on her first.
                     In the meantime, I'm going to give you
                     something to help you relax, okay?

     Off his smile, the agnate mother nods, anxiously watching the
     midwife wrap her baby in blanket. The doctor taps a button and
     watches the IV reservoir misting with a pale colored fluid.

                                                                              46.



     The cardiograph marks the drop as the fast-acting sedative takes
     effect. The agnate mother watches drowsily as the midwife takes
     her baby from the room. Then the cry of the newborn is shut out.
     J u s t the cardiograph now, the beeps evening out, the scart o f
     peaks shallowing a s the agnate mother falls asleep. The doctor
     taps a button. On the grid, the face of a DESK NURSE appears.

                                 THE DOCTOR
                        I'm incubating the baby for 24 hours
                        prior to transport. But go ahead and
                        contact the sponsor. Tell her she has
                        a beautiful baby girl.

     The nurse nods. The grid square goes blank. A pause. Then the
     doctor taps another button. Text appears. Reading it, he cites-

                                    THE DOCTOR
                        Let the record show the sponsor has
                        signed Clause 22 of The Basic Sponsor-
                        s h i p Agreement. Initiate compliance.

     A light starts blinking. The doctor walks stiffly out of the
     room. The door hisses closed. The agnate mother is left alone.
     Sleeping peacefully, blind to the fluid now seeping into her IV.
     D e a f to the slowing beep of the cardiograph. The peaks of the
     baseline falling. Spacing, fading, slowing, slowing, until...
     The cardiograph flatlines. An d a sepulchral stillness falls. Our
     angle widens with the growing emptiness. The lifelessness.

57   INT . OBSERVATION ROOM

     Lincoln looks down from above, eyes frozen in the slatted light.
     His fingers are trembling, rattling the blinds against the glass.

58   INT . CORRIDOR

     Lincoln tumbles out of the door. He can't breathe, can't think,
     his mind is in overload. He stumbles around like a wounded
     animal. His focus suddenly and searingly r e t u r n s as he hears-

                                          DESK NURSE (O.S.)
                        Starkweather ? Like the football player?

59   INT . NURSES STATION - LEVEL THREE - CONTINUOUS

     A rotunda spoked by corridors. A console at its hub, manned by
     the desk nurse we saw earlier. The courier stands over her-

                                      THE COURIER
                        That's right. Starkweather.

                                                                       47.



                                 DESK NURSE
                    Still showing in surgery. Sorry.

                                  THE COURIER
                    Honey, I got a bird on the pad and a
                    storm moving in. How long's it gonna be?

60   INT . ANOTHER OPERATING ROOM

     Another grid of readouts. Another cardiograph beeps. A spotlamp
     illuminates the OR table and STARKWEATHER TWO-DELTA - his face,
     slack with anesthesis, eyes rolling a little beneath the lids.
     The rest of him under a sheet, cut out over the belly, the flesh
     slit and parted by a clamp, framing a window into his innards.

     Standing over him, mid-operation, A SURGEON and SURGICAL TECH.
     Interrupted by a chime, the surgeon looks up at a screen, where
     a panel flashes: "PAGING". He cradles his bloody gloves and
     elbows a button. The face of the desk nurse resolves on screen-

                               DESK NURSE (ON SCREEN)
                    The courier's here for pickup.

                                THE SURGEON
                    Well he's going to have to wait a while.
                    It took forever to put this one under.

                                SURGICAL TECH (O.S.)
                    Doctor...

                                DESK NURSE (ON SCREEN)
                    He's asking for an ETA. Said something
                    about some kind of storm moving in.

                               THE SURGEON
                    For Christ's sake, is that my fault?
                    Just find a way to stall him, okay?

                                S U R G I C A L TECH (O.S.)
                    Doctor.

                                SURGEON
                    What is it?

                                     SURGICAL TECH
                    Subject's heart rate is spiking.

                               SURGEON
                    Not again. Boost the anaesthetic lev...

     Suddenly he's sprayed with blood a s the clamp springs loose from
     the stomach, clattering to the floor. He's frozen by shock as...

                                                                               48.



     Starkweather sits bolts upright. Dazed, he looks at the surgeon,
     the tech, then down at his wide-open stomach. Instinctively, he
     clutches it. Then, his mind assimilating the horror, he SCREAMS.
     Now launching off the operating table, the lever-arm swinging
     out, blindsiding t h e tech - tubes and wires snapping loose -
     instruments flying - Starkweather lunges for the doorway - the
     surgeon steps up to block him - only to be hurled aside...

61   INT . CORRIDOR - LEVEL THREE

     THE BLARE OF AN ALARM. Starkweather, clumping down the corridor,
     clutching his open stomach, blood streaming down his legs. He's
     delirious, running nowhere, anywhere, running blind. Reaching the
     end of the corridor, he stops suddenly, seeing WHITE UNIFORMS.
     He doubles back up the corridor. Kicking at doors with bare feet,
     frantic for any means of escape. He spots a ventilator grid,
     slightly open. He jumps, reaching for it. Once, twice, then his
     feet slip from under him. He hits the floor with a damp splat.
     TWO CENSORS turn the corner, ready for action. But there is
     Starkweather, face-down in a starburst o f his own blood.

                                    CENSOR (INTO HEADSET)
                       Yeah, no sweat, subject is secured.

62   INT . DUCTING - MINUTES LATER

     POVCEILING VENTILATOR GRID. Looking down through the slits onto
     Starkweather directly beneath. He now has a loose white hood over
     his head. His wrists and ankles are bound by plastic cuffs. A
     loop of intestine plumps out from his belly. His weight is such
     that the Censors have to drag him away, leaving a bloodsmear o n
     the floor. His guttural whimpers are the only sign of life.

     CLOSEUP: Lincoln's face in part shadow, looking down. The gleam
     of his eyes as Starkweather disappears from view. Listening now,
     to those feeble whimpers, growing fainter, ever fainter until
     they disappear from earshot. Silence again. Emptiness. All that
     remains of Starkweather is a wending bloodsmear o n the floor.

                                                           SLOW FADE TO BLACK.

63   INT . BEDROOM - DAWN

     The horizon. The green mountains in different aspect, framed by
     a different window. The bedroom is like Lincoln's but with a few
     feminine touches. Ester, in her papery pajamas, sits brushing
     her hair. With a chime, etherscreen scales over her reflection:
     - - E T H E R C A L L P E N D I N G ; ACCEPT OR SEND TO MESSAGE BANK?--

                                                                        49.



                                  ESTER
                    Accept.
     The etherscreen resolves Lincoln's face, dishevelled, urgent-

                                    LINCOLN (ON ETHERSCREEN)
                    Ester . . . I have to talk to you.

                                    ESTER
                    Lincoln ? Are you okay? I was worried.

                                LINCOLN (ON ETHERSCREEN)
                    What are you talking about?

                               ESTER
                    The contamination warning. Somebody
                    said you'd been exposed.

     Lincoln pauses to process this. Hunted, more cautious now-

                             LINCOLN (ON ETHERSCREEN)
                    I want you to meet me as soon as you
                    can. But you can't tell anyone.

                              ESTER
                    Is it true? Were you contaminated?

                               LINCOLN (ON ETHERSCREEN)
                    You know where to come.

     His face blinks out. Ester is left frowning at her reflection.

64   INT . BEDROOM - LINCOLN'S APARTMENT - DAY

     Lincoln stares at his own mirror image. His eyes, fraught with
     revelation. His clothes, begrimed with dirt and blood. He rests
     his head against the etherscreen panel, shuddering, pressing his
     eyes tightly closed. As if he could ever forget what he's seen.

65   INT . CENTERVILLE - DAY

     The routine flow of residents up the avenue. Lincoln walks, head
     bowed, trying to look inconspicuous. Showered, white shirt and
     blue slacks under his shearling, he looks a little too scrubbed,
     too clean. He spots a familiar figure up ahead. He catches up.

                                  LINCOLN
                    Jonesy. . .

     J o n e s lets him fall into step with a look of mild curiosity-

                                                                           50.



                                 JONES
                     Hey, champ. Are you alright? I heard
                     there was a contamination scare.

                              LINCOLN
                     I saw what happened to him.

                                 JONES
                     What are you talking about?

                                       LINCOLN
                     Starkweather . . . What they did to him.

     Jones huffs, dismissively. Lincoln grabs his shoulder, ardent-

                                 LINCOLN
                     They cut him open, Jonesy. The y took
                     him upstairs and they cut him open.

     Jones holds his gaze a moment, then shrugs off his grip.

                                JONES
                     You caught that fucking p a t h o g e n ,
                     didn't you? You're contaminated.

                                    LINCOLN
                     J o n e s y , listen to me...
     But Jones just backs away. Lincoln makes to follow. Then stops
     dead in his tracks. Across the avenue, TWO CENSORS are on patrol
     and his best friend is now heading towards them. With a barren,
     torn grimace, Lincoln turns away and melts back into the crowd.

66   INT . COMMUNITY CENTER - CENTERVILLE - LATER

     R i n g s of empty seats round the empty stage. Ester enters warily,
     walking up the aisle. Lincoln waits in the shadows. He checks to
     see she hasn't been followed. Then steps forward. Ester recoils-

                                      ESTER
                     Please . . . don't come any closer. I
                     don't want to get contaminated.

                                   LINCOLN
                     Ester, I'm not contaminated.

                                ESTER
                     But they said...

                                LINCOLN
                     I'm not contaminated!

                                                                  51.



His shout echoes through the empty auditorium. Ester looks at
him, alarmed by his vehemence. Lincoln calms himself a little-

                                 LINCOLN
               Contaminants, pathogens... it's just
               what they tell us to keep us inside.

                           ESTER
               What do you mean?

                        LINCOLN
               I saw it. Why they keep us here. To
               use us. To take things from us.

                             ESTER
               You're not making sense.

                           LINCOLN
               Your baby... they're going to take
               your baby away... you understand?

                         ESTER
               M y baby? Why would they do that?

                        LINCOLN
               I don't know! But I saw it!

                             ESTER
               You're scaring me, Lincoln...
               I want to go back now.

                          LINCOLN
               You can't go back! Don't you get it?
                             A VOICE (O.S.)
               N o b o d y move! Stay right where you are!

A CENSOR steps through, stopgun l e v e l l e d . Ester freezes. Lincoln
hovers, mind racing. The censor moves in, tightening aim on him.
Ester looks on anxiously as he approaches Lincoln. Lincoln now
sees the censor pulling out some plastic cuffs. The same cuffs
used on Starkweather, promising the same fate... TRIGGERING HIM--

LINCOLN LUNGES AT THE CENSOR - ramming him - toppling him across
the seats - knocking the stopgun f r o m his grasp - recoiling as--

THE CENSOR RETALIATES - driving a knee into his groin, doubling
him over - then a knee to his head - THUDDING INTO HIS SKULL-

                            ESTER
               Don't hurt him!

                                                                        52.



     ESTER RUNS UP grabbing at the white uniform, trying to restrain
     him - the censor swats her blindly - hitting her in the stomach--
     LINCOLN SPINS ROUND at the sound of Ester's yelp - only to be
     roundhoused b y the censor - the blow sending him to the floor--

     Ester DOUBLED OVER - wincing at the pain - clutching her belly
     instinctively, protectively - an ominous scowl knotting her face-
     THE CENSOR PUNISHING LINCOLN - kicking him down the aisle - then
     suddenly hearing a noise from behind - turning to face it as --

     - B O O M - A GUNBLAST R I P S THE AIR. The brief wail of a hookhead.

     - T H U D - THE CENSOR RECOILING - lurching as the hookhead b i t e s -
     starting to gag - blood jetting from his neck - a hookhead
     c l a w e d into his jugular - gurgling, collapsing to the floor--

     Ester STANDING FROZEN - holding the stopgun - seeing Lincoln now
     getting up - she drops the stopgun l i k e it's on fire, aghast-

                                ESTER
                     Lincoln?

     L i k e she's asking him what she did... Silence - the rasp of the
     censor, blood foaming - another sound - FOOTFALLS. Lincoln goes
     to the door - an IMMINENT MASS OF WHITE UNIFORMS. He grabs Ester-

                                LINCOLN
                     RUN!!!

67   INT . FOYER - THE COMMUNITY CENTER

     CENSORS BURSTING IN - led by Scheer, pushing through into the
     main hall - the statue of Dr. Sanger looking serenely down--

68   INT . MAINTENANCE CORRIDOR - BEHIND THE COMMUNITY CENTER

     A HISS OF DEPRESSURIZATION - a pressure door swings open - Lincoln
     and Ester tumbling through - running up the maintenance corridor--

69   INT . COMMUNITY CENTER - MOMENTS LATER

     CENSORS FANNING OUT - sweeping the hall, stopguns r e a d y - Scheer
     finds the fallen Censor - crouches to examine him, then-

                                     SCHEER
                     Somebody get someone down here!

     A Censor splits off to join him, tapping his headset - Scheer
     rises again - in his eyes, detachment yields to cold intensity--

                                                                     53.



70   INT. VARIOUS CORRIDORS - CONTAINMENT INFRASTRUCTURE

     THE CENSORS: flooding through into the maintenance corridor, in
     their white uniforms, they seem like a swarm of antibodies--

     LINCOLN AND ESTER: deeper in, at another pressure door, fumbling
     the trikey i n t o the lock. A tense second. The lock hisses open--

     SCHEER : pushes through the opening gap of another pressure door,
     taking the lead, his Censors surging up in his wake --

     LINCOLN AND ESTER: meeting an intersection, veering at random,
     running blind, running deeper into the faceless labyrinth--

     SCHEER : catching up, hitting the intersection, pausing to split
     his squad in each direction - white uniforms dispersing--

     LINCOLN AND ESTER: reaching another pressure door. Footsteps
     audible. Lincoln jams the tri-key i n t o the lock. And waits. The
     seconds pass. But the door doesn't open. Lincoln looks around
     for another exit. Ester looks at him in mounting panic then--
     THE PRESSURE DOOR OPENS: not onto a corridor but an elevator
     car. Pulling Ester inside, Lincoln finds an array of buttons.
     His fingers hovers, uncertain which to press. So he punches all
     of them, stabbing madly, trying to prompt the door to close.
     SCHEER : turns a corner, seeing his quarry at the far end of the
     corridor, he gathers pace. The elevator is closing but he doesn't
     break stride. He deftly taps his headset, opening a channel to--

                                     SCHEER (ON HEADSET)
                    Ethercon! The elevator - override it!
                    Do you read me? Bring it back down!

71   INT . ETHER CONTROL ROOM

     Ethercon is working the console keys like a madman. His gaze
     flitting to a subgrid o f the complex, spinning the angles,
     navigating the mesh of lines. His voice comes apologetically-

                                  ETHERCON (INTO HEADSET)
                    You're off the grid, sir. Give me a
                    second. Can you tell me where you are?

     He recoils at the blaring volume of the response.

72   INT . CORRIDOR - OUTSIDE THE ELEVATOR

     Scheer stands with his Censors, poised, watching the panel chart
     the elevator's descent. A light flashes and the doors open. They
     level their stopguns o n . . . nothing. The elevator is empty.

                                                                       54.



                                      SCHEER (INTO HEADSET)
                    Foundation Levels - all of them. Lock
                    them down. Access only on my command.

73   INT . FOUNDATION LEVEL

     A dead acoustic. A corridor paved with sound proofing panels. It
     ends at a pressure door, where Lincoln and Ester now arrive.
     Lincoln looks back to the elevator at the other end. No going
     back. He slots the tri-key into the lock. The door hisses open.

74   INT . FOUNDATION CHAMBERS

     Amber light. The sound of slow bubbling. Lincoln and Ester pause
     to adjust to the gloom. They are in a hall of windows. Ester is
     the first to venture forth, as if drawn, to the nearest window.

     Behind the glass is a foundation tank. Bubbling with viscous
     fluid, laced with various tubes pulsing matter to and fro. The
     tubes connect to a form. A human form, an adult form but curled
     foetally. I t is known as a "nascent". In this tank is a female
     nascent, shifting slightly, causing Ester to gasp. The nascent
     registers the noise, turning its head. Its eyelids are closed but
     its eyeballs move, questioning. A slight furrow appears on its
     crosshatched brow. Ester recoils in sudden horror, perhaps
     remembering on some deep level that this is where she came from.

                                  LINCOLN
                    Ester ! Come on!

     Spurred to action, Ester follows Lincoln onward up the hall.
     Still conscious of movement all around, of nascents stirring at
     the sound of their footfalls like the ripples of a nightmare.

75   INT . FOUNDATION CHAMBER

     A STOPGUN n o s e s through the door. Followed by Scheer moving in
     silence, honed. How much time has passed is unclear. He signals
     his censors to split off. Tracking Scheer's advance, we INTERCUT:
     ANOTHER FOUNDATION CHAMBER: Censors making their sweep. Strobes
     of light from an armature mechanism moving up the row of tanks.
     It angles to project a grid across each nascent's face, then
     fires a short laser burst, searing a crosshatch into the brow.
     ANOTHER FOUNDATION CHAMBER: another contingent moves up another
     row of foundation tanks. The nascents within have cables plugged
     into their ears, filaments pulsing. The nascents a r e in a posture
     of rigor, sinews straining as they accept the data impression.

     RETURNING TO SCHEER as he reaches the end of the first chamber.
     No further access, just a continuing wrap of foundation tanks.
     He pauses, confused for a second. One of the censors comes up-

                                                                    55.



                                      CENSOR
                      Nothing , sir. No sign.

                                  SCHEER
                      They can't have got past this level.

     Scheer peels off his headset, giving full leash to his senses,
     straining to concentrate. Seconds of pent silence. Then he hears
     a faint humming. His gaze slowly drifts up to a ventilator grid.

76   INT . / EXT . THE FUNNEL - NIGHT

     A POV LOOKING UP. The funnel mouth framing a vista of the world
     outside. A hostile vista of black sky, maelstroms of sand. The
     sound of blasting air, suborned to the giant howl of a DUSTSTORM.
     A HAND. Reaching over the funnel lip as Lincoln pulls himself up
     with a mighty effort. Blinking, blinded by the sand, he swings
     astride the lip. Then he reaches down to pull Ester up. Ester
     gains the lip and likewise swings astride, coughing, blinking.
     T H E DUSTY EARTH as Lincoln leaps down to meet it. We track up as
     he helps Ester down from the funnel. Her feet meeting the earth,
     we are now in CU o n their faces. Gaping and blinking at the
     prospect of the world outside. A world of darkness and storm.

     SUDDEN BLINDING LIGHT as halogens explode the darkness. Lincoln
     shields his eyes, scanning for their source. He spots a large
     cubic building, banks of spotlights on the roof. He pulls Ester
     away. Away from the lights and towards the safety of darkness.

77   INT . EXTRACTOR SHAFT

     T H E THRUM OF EXTRACTOR FANS. Scheer pacing on a catwalk. White
     uniforms above and below, flashlights roving, sliced by the
     blades of the extractor fans. From somewhere, comes a shout-

                                  C E N S O R (O.S.)
                      Sir ! We got em! Motion sensors just
                      picked them up at the surface!

78   EXT . FRONT OF THE INSTITUTE - NIGHT

     ANOTHER BURST OF HALOGENS. More spotlights engage, their blaze
     flooding across the foreview, catching two figures; Lincoln and
     Ester, running, now, veering sharply away from the light. Now
     disappearing from sight, dropping into the trench of the lodeway.

79   INT . MAINTENANCE ELEVATOR - CONTAINMENT

     THE RISING HUM OF THE LODE-POLES. The elevator crammed with
     censors. Scheer at the front, staring ahead. He looks very
     focused, bitterly so. The look of a man outwitted by lab rats.

                                                                 56.



80   EXT. THE LODEWAY - NIGHT

     THE DARKNESS OF THE TRENCH. Lincoln and Ester running along the
     lode-way, stumbling over the buffers. Above them, the dust
     flails in lashing tongues, starkly depicted by the halogens.

81   EXT . PROCESSING PLANT - NIGHT

     WHITE UNIFORMS IN THE NIGHT - censors spill forth into the
     halogen light, splitting in all directions. Scheer suddenly
     notices the corona of light from the front of the complex. He
     barks something inaudible to his men, launching into a run.

82   EXT . THE GATEWAY - NIGHT
     THE GATEWAY LOOMING ABOVE. Beneath, Lincoln and Ester, on their
     knees, clawing at the dust. Like burrowing animals, trying to
     widen the gap between the foot of the gate and the lodeway.

83   EXT . FRONT OF THE INSTITUTE - NIGHT
     A LONE WHITE UNIFORM. As Scheer reaches the forecourt, stopping
     to scan the spotlit view, the veils of the duststorm. His face
     tightening with urgency. Suddenly he taps his headset, barking-

                               S C H E E R (INTO HEADSET)
                    The lodeway! Flood it! Light it up!

84   EXT . THE GATEWAY - NIGHT

     THE RISING HUM OF THE LODE-POLES barely audible over the storm.
     Lincoln and Ester, washed by pulsing red light. Ester recoiling,
     her arm flinging back from the pull. Lincoln grabbing her, his
     own arm straining now. The polarity tugging their ethercuffs.

85   EXT . THE LODEWAY - NIGHT

     THE RED WASH OF LIGHT from the lodeway as Scheer races up the
     edge, eyes trawling the trench for his quarry. His pace now
     suddenly dropping, slowing to a halt. He doubles over, catching
     his breath. More white uniforms now appear from the dust as the
     Censors, unable to match his pace, finally catch up. The first
     reaching him, Scheer pulls upright, bellowing over the wind-

                               SCHEER
                    G e t me a bird!

                             CENSOR
                    A bird?! In this storm?!

                                SCHEER
                    The y got out! They got past the gate!

                                                                                  57.



     Scheer spins on his heel back towards The Institute. The Censor
     lingers, confused. Then he fixes on the lodeway. Floating past
     in the red wash are the luminous blue seams of two ethercuffs.

86   EXT . THE DESERT - NIGHT

     The perimeter wall silhouetted in the middle-distance. Lincoln
     and Ester scramble through the scrub, blinded by dust, driven by
     momentum. As Ester starts lagging behind, Lincoln grabs her arm-

                                      LINCOLN
                        Ester ! We have to keep going!

     But Ester resists him, breaking loose from his grasp. Lincoln
     looks at her, uncomprehending. Until he sees her expression, the
     harrowed stare in her eyes, the labored heaving of her chest.

                                     LINCOLN
                        Ester?

     Ester staggers back, losing balance, reeling as if spun by the
     storm. Her eyes widening, senses flooding. The howling wind, the
     swirling dustclouds, the pendent gulf of black sky. Her reel
     returning her to face Lincoln, Ester opens her mouth to speak.
     But all that comes is A SCREAM. A scream from deep within, shrill
     and hysterical, the only articulation she can find. Lincoln grabs
     her and covers her mouth. Fighting to stifle her, rocking to her
     convulsions. But Ester keeps screaming. A scream of everything.

87   INT . BEDROOM - SOMEWHERE - LATE NIGHT

     All is still. Just a muted shudder of wind on glass. The room is
     in shadow. All we see is a canopied bed where a figure,
     obscured, lies sleeping. The still is disrupted by a chime. The
     figure stirs, fumbling at the nightstand. A holoframe resolves,
     the light revealing Dr. Sanger, rumpled by sleep. He peers into
     the holoframe to find the face of Merrick, gaunt with concern-

                                        Merrick (ON HOLOFRAME)
                        He n r y . . . There's been a breach.

                                                                H A R D CUT TO BLACK.

     SLOW FADE UP:
88   EXT . THE RED ROCKS - DAWN

     A horizon. A brim of dawn over the red rocks. The view is framed
     by the mouth of a cave. Lincoln sleeps within, slumped against
     the rock, his head bowed heavily. The touch of first light opens
     his eyes. His brow creasing, as if waking from a bad dream into
     a worse reality. He looks around only to find himself alone. He
     gets up, a little shaky at first, then ventures out of the cave.

                                                                     58.



     He emerges onto a ledge, perhaps fifty feet up. He pauses, eyes
     adjusting to the quality of light. He sees the storm has reduced
     to a low wind, combing the floorland o f scrub. Now, across the
     ledge, he sees Ester. Perched on an outcrop, hugging her knees,
     watching the sunrise over the desert. He crosses and lowers to a
     crouch beside her. Ester turns to him with a confused frown-

                                 ESTER
                    W h e r e did all the green go?
     Lincoln looks deep into her troubled eyes. He answers gently-

                                 LINCOLN
                    The r e is no green. The windows in
                    there... they were just pictures.

     Ester absorbs this with difficulty. Lincoln rises again and
     stands looking out across the desert, into the barren unknown.

89   EXT . THE SKY OVER THE DESERT - MORNING

     From the massive sky grows a glinting shape. Like a helicopter
     but sleeker, aquiline. Without combustion, its only noise is the
     sibilance of blades slicing air. It is known as a "whisper".

90   INT . WHISPER - MORNING

     The pilot jockeys with the thermals. Scheer rides shotgun. Now
     in civvies, scanning the terrain with electronic binoculars. The
     flight console beeps. He taps a keypad. A holoframe resolves:

                                  CENSOR (ON HOLOFRAME)
                    Ground team checking in.

                                 SCHEER
                    Anything?

                               CENSOR (ON HOLOFRAME)
                    The storm pretty much covered their
                    tracks. We're scanning for thermals
                    b u t the hotter it gets, the harder it
                    is to isolate a heat signature. I don't
                    know, sir, it's a big desert out there.

91   EXT . CHASM - THE RED ROCKS - DAY

     The desert sun clefts the chasm into light and shadow. Lincoln
     trudges into view, Ester lagging behind. He stops to let her
     catch up, only to watch her slump onto a rock. He allows her a
     moment to rest and walks to where the chasm comes to an end.

                                                                     59.



     He surveys the terrain. His eyes roam the carpet of scrub, now
     narrowing on an inconsistency. A faint strip where nothing seems
     to grow. Tracing its lineage, he walks a few feet out. Then
     drops to a crouch and starts clawing away at the dust.

     His fingers meet something hard. He sweeps off the dust to expose
     a layer of concrete. Continuing, revealing the ghost of a line.
     What we might recognize as a lane marker but a curiosity to him.
     Continuing, opening a window in the dust. Now his fingers snag
     o n something. He tugs it and it gives a little, dust crumbling to
     reveal a section of rusted chainlink. A corner of metal is
     visible. Lincoln exposes the rest. A sign, barely legible: "US
     Government - Restricted Area". He frowns, trying to assimilate.
     Ester comes up to join him. Off her anxious look, he decides-

                             LINCOLN
                    I think I've found a path.

92   EXT . THE GREEN MOUNTAINS - DAY

     W h i t e rock blanketed by stands of fir and ponderosa pine. A
     whisper skims over the treecaps, circling in on a high shelf.
     Here, remotely nestled in a clearing, stands a glass villa.

93   INT . THE GLASS VILLA - DAY

     The flood of light, the majestic view lend an air of beatitude.
     The decor is minimalist with Native American accents, kokopelli
     spirits in carved silhouette. Dr. Sanger stands at a glass wall,
     looking out across the green mountain valley. On the sofa sits
     Merrick, now in civvies, still gaunt from worry. The air stirs
     as a maid ushers in A WOMAN - 30's, all business, sharp blue
     eyes, a severe, mannish coiffure. Her name is ELLEN CROWNE.

                                CROWNE
                    Good morning, gentlemen.

                                    SANGER
                    Bernard, this is Ellen Crowne from our
                    legal department. Ellen, this is
                    Bernard Merrick, director of products.

                                 MERRICK
                    Thank you for coming out here.

                                CROWNE
                    Well when Henry called me I got the
                    sense it wasn't for a social visit.

     They settle at a table. A jug of icewater a n d glasses laid out.

                             CROWNE
                    I understand there was an incident?

                                                                 60.



                            MERRICK
              First, let me stress there's no way we
              could have anticipated what happened...

                           CROWNE
              We're on the same team, Mr. Merrick.
              Just give me the facts down-and-dirty.

                               MERRICK
                     (uneasy, clears his throat)
              We'v e lost two of our products. They
              escaped containment last night.

Crowne casts a troubled look at Sanger. Merrick quickly adds-

                                Merrick (cont'd)
               However, we have all available
               resources dedicated to the search.

                         CROWNE
              How exactly did this happen?

                           MERRICK
              We'r e still piecing it together.

                        CROWNE
              Do we expect more products to escape?

                           DR. SANGER
              Don't be so alarmist, Ellen.

                         CROWNE
              I'm sorry, Henry, but you asked me
              here to assess our liabilities.

                        MERRICK
              To answer your question, we condition
              our products with a deterrent. A fear of
              contamination. And thereby of the outer
              environment. So to escape, they first
              have to escape their conditioning.

Crowne pauses to absorb this and to light a slim black cigarette.

                                CROWNE
              Containment is one of the terms of our
              state health license. The fact it was
              compromised could put us in violation.

                       DR. SANGER
              Bureaucracy.

                                                  61.



              CROWNE
Henry , it was a bloody battle getting
our license through in the first place.

                DR. SANGER
They're not going to pull our license,
Ellen. We have a lot of friends on the
Commission. Not to mention the goodwill
we earned in DC when we took over the
facility; a bunker complex for a bio-
chemical war that never happened... We
relieved them of a costly embarrassment.

           CROWNE
I'm not sure we can rely on that.

                DR. SANGER
Alright . What do you suggest?

              CROWNE
First, I need you to level with me.
What are our chances of finding them?

             MERRICK
Well, in our favor, they've never been
outside containment. They'd have no
coordinates, no sense of direction.

         CROWNE
I don't see how that's in our favor.

               MERRICK
They're in the middle of the desert.
Food and water become an issue.

          CROWNE
So they might return to the trough?

            MERRICK
Possibly.

           CROWNE
And if not? How long could they last?

         MERRICK
A few days maybe. But there is another
variable. We maintain the products in a
sterile environment. So basically their
immune systems are untested. Toxins,
pathogens, environmentals t h e rest of
us overcome routinely, to them...

                                                               62.



                             DR. SANGER
               That's a little drastic. Some immune
               systems are more adaptive than others.

                            CROWNE
               Let's take the drastic case. What then?

                              MERRICK
               Well . . . the male, we could cover. Fast-
               track another generation before the
               sponsor ever needed access. The female
               comes under the maternity plan. She's
               three months pregnant. Even if we fast-
               tracked another generation, we couldn't
               fast-track the pregnancy. We'd miss the
               delivery date, the sponsor would wonder
               why and there would be... difficulties.

Crowne looks worried. Sanger pours a glass of icewater.

                           DR. SANGER
               Even so, the worst may not happen.

                         CROWNE
               We haven't even touched on the worst. If
               these products reach a populated area,
               there's the problem of scrutiny.
                             DR. SANGER
               Ellen , we operate under State license on
               a lease from the Federal Government...

                             CROWNE
                    ( c u t s him off, harshly)
               We slipped through a loophole in the
               clone laws, Henry. And they only let
               u s through because they smelt money.
               And they gave us a government basement
               to cover their own a s s e s not ours. It's
               at the core of our license - why we
               screen potential sponsors, why we make
               them sign discretion agreements, why
               containment is such a critical factor -
               to limit the extent of public scrutiny.

                             DR. SANGER
               E i t h e r way, it's unlikely they'd get
               that far. It's at least twenty miles to
               the next settlement. Right, Bernard?

Merrick hesitates before nodding his assent. Crowne pounces on it-

                                                                    63.



                                     CROWNE
                    Something to add, Mr. Merrick?

                                    MERRICK
                    I just don't think we should under-
                    estimate them. Especially the male.

                               DR. SANGER
                    And I don't think we should panic.

     He cautions Merrick with a discreet look, then shakes a pill
     from a bottle. Crowne looks forward to both men. Very serious.

                                      CROWNE
                    Gentlemen, whatever happens we need
                    t o keep one thing clearly in mind. As
                    far as the world at large goes, we are
                    just another medical services company.
                    Anything that alters that perception
                    puts us at risk. And we cannot rely on
                    the sanction of the law to protect us.
                    Whenever and wherever and in whatever
                    condition we recover these products, we
                    have to stay beyond reproach. All it
                    takes is one nudge to put us in the
                    spotlight. Then you'll see how fast
                    politicians can run for cover.

     Merrick shifts, uneasy. Sanger takes the pill with a bitter smile-

                              DR. SANGER
                    I n other words we need to find them
                    o r else. That's very astute, Ellen.

94   EXT . DESERT HIGHWAY - SUNSET

     The dust swirls and puffs across a highway of yesteryear. A dirt
     track but for patches of exposed concrete and angles of buckled
     lampposts. The empty path reaches to a blood-red sunset.

95   EXT . SCRAPYARD - SUNSET

     The dust skims over mountains of rusted scrap. Nestled in the
     mountains is a shack. A sign creaks in the breeze "Osmund D e e r ,
     Licensed Salvage Merchant". On the porch sits an old man in a
     greasy ballcap a n d dungarees. This is the eponymous owner, OZZIE.

     He's sitting on a lounger, surveying his empire, enjoying a beer
     and a cigarette. Exhaling a drag of smoke, his eyes crease to a
     squint. He sees something through the smoke, silhouetted against
     the sunset. An approaching figure, wary, like a flighty animal.

                                                                          64.



                                OZZIE
                    Hello?

     The silhouetted figure doesn't answer, just stares back at him.

                               OZZIE
                    Can I help you?

     This seems to get a response. The figure ventures closer. We
     recognize Lincoln. Exhausted, dust-covered and dry-throated -

                              LINCOLN
                    My friend... she needs water.

96   INT . BACK ROOM - THE SHACK - SUNSET

     A mass of technology and furniture from recent and distant past.
     Lincoln lowers Ester onto a threadbare sofa. Ozzie, excited to
     have visitors, bustles up with a water gallon, pouring a glass.
     Lincoln takes it and tips it to Ester's lips. She coughs it out
     at first. Then takes the glass and starts drinking with vigor.
     Ozzie sets down the water gallon in front of his visitors. Then
     settles in an armchair and cracks open a beer. It lends the mood,
     albeit strained, of a social visit. Lonely old Ozzie wanting to
     make it so. Despite which, both men have an eye on each other.

                               OZZIE
                    Got stuck in that supercell, didya?

     Lincoln eyes him, wary of the question. Ozzie reads confusion-

                                     OZZIE
                    Supercellstorm , that's what they call
                    it on the news anyways. I n my day, we
                    just called `em "big ol' h o w l e r s " .

     Ozzie chuckles to himself. It seems to put his visitor at ease.

                                OZZIE
                    Yep, I heard it shut down some of the
                    lodeways. Dust in the works, I guess.
                    Where were you folks headed anyways?

     Lincoln gulps down some water, deciding an answer. Then ventures-

                                LINCOLN
                    Away.

                                 OZZIE
                    A w a y ? You mean, like outta s t a t e ?

                                LINCOLN
                    " O u t of state"...

                                                                          65.



     The term is meaningless to Lincoln but he likes the sound of it.
     Ozzie grins. This is starting to feel like a real social visit.

                               OZZIE
                    N o w where's my manners gone? I'm Ozzie.
                    Osmund r e a l l y . But folks call me Ozzie.

     An awkward lull as Ozzie waits for his visitor to reciprocate.

                                     OZZIE
                    S o m e t i m e s I like to make a joke of it,
                    my last name bein' D e e r . . . "O. Deer".

     O z z i e chuckles but the pun seems lost on his visitor. He lets it
     drop. The awkward silence returns. Lincoln drinks the water,
     wondering if this strange old man is as harmless as he appears.

                                OZZIE
                    We l l now, looks like yer g i r l f r i e n d ' s
                    made herself at home.

     Lincoln looks at Ester, slumped over, asleep on the sofa. Ozzie
     puts a finger to his lips, beckoning his visitor out of the room.

97   EXT . SCRAPYARD - DUSK

     The porch light comes on, casting the scrapyard in grades of
     light and shadow. Ozzie steps out onto the porch, lighting a
     cigarette. His visitor hovering at the threshold, he offers the
     pack. Lincoln steps out and takes one. Ozzie lights it for him-

                                    OZZIE
                    Yer girlfriend sure is pretty.

     His visitor looks at him curiously. Ozzie misinterprets that
     he's said something out of turn. Time to change the subject-

                              OZZIE
                    So what's with them tattoos, huh?

     He taps his forehead. Lincoln fingers his crosshatch, suddenly
     aware of it now and suspicious of the question. Ozzie palliates-

                                OZZIE
                    Hey , in the eye of the beholder, right?
                    Now this place, this is beautiful to
                    me. This is my place. I own it. `May
                    not look like much but you'd be
                    surprised. C'mon, lemme show you...

     Ozzie moseys into the scrapyard, beckoning his visitor. Lincoln
     hesitates, then follows him, sensing it's better to play along.

                                                                       66.



                                    OZZIE
                    M o s t a t h i s heavy stuff's industrial
                    scrap. Comes in from all over. Easy way
                    round the recyclin' l a w s . Me, I sell it
                    on to the boondock b o y s for meltdown.
                    Other stuff, I pick up at the scrap
                    markets. Fix it up, `fetches a price.

     The y reach a vehicle shell. A rust-pocked chassis, canted on its
     axle, we might recognize it as an automobile from our own era.

                               OZZIE
                    Fossil fuel transport. This piece o'
                    junk's a collector's item. All that
                    Age of the Wheel nostalgia, "elegant
                    era of transport" bullshit. I find the
                    parts, she's as good as solid gold.

     Ozzie pats his investment and moves to another rusted metal pile.
     Steepled by rail tracks, we see elevator sheaves, tension cables.

                                 OZZIE
                    Now this here's got a colorful history.
                    Came in from this ol' g o v e r n m e n t bunker
                    out in the valley. `Got shut down way
                    back. Then this new outfit took over,
                    stripped the place out. I guess they're
                    doin' s o m e more remodelling cause I
                    just had `em in again the other day...
                           ( a tug of smoke, reflective)
                    Hump`n dump crew. Nice fellas.

     Lincoln frowns. The term is familiar. The taste of smoke, a hint.
     But his memory has been clouded by trauma. Ozzie reads his face-

                               OZZIE
                    You okay there?

     Lincoln looks at him, something breaking the clouds. A sense of
     danger, indistinct. Suddenly cautious, he stubs his cigarette-

                               LINCOLN
                    I'm going to check on my friend.

98   INT . FRONT ROOM - THE SHACK - DUSK

     A front room turned into a front office. Piles of paper teeter
     atop junk furniture. A bankers lap we might recognize from our
     own era glows over a desk where Ozzie is rummaging, looking for
     something. He stops to peer through and check on his visitors-

                                                                   67.



The woman still lies asleep on the sofa. The man is sitting
beside her armchair, head bowed, seemingly plunged in thought.
O z z i e resumes rummaging to find a crumpled delivery note. He
reviews it for a moment. Then quickly clears away some more
papers to uncover a keypad device. It is known as a "holocom".
He taps a key and a holoframe resolves. Then taps in some digits
from the delivery note. The holoframe snows with static. Then a
crosshatch insignia appears, spinning in 3D:

                              RECORDED VOICE (ON HOLOCOM)
               Welcome to The Sanger Institute. If you
               know your party's extension, press...

                           LINCOLN (O.S.)
               What are you doing?

Ozzie jerks round to find his visitor suddenly standing there.
He fumbles on the holocom keypad and the crosshatch blinks out.

                              OZZIE
               Nuthin . I wasn't doin nuthin .

Lincoln frowns, the sense of danger becoming more distinct.
Ozzie reads his visitor's troubled expression, realizing-

                        OZZIE
               I knew it... them clothes... them
               weird tattoos... I mean, I heard
               stories from those guys but I never...

O f f his visitor's frown, Ozzie bites his tongue. He's cornered
in this cramped space with a freak of science. Time to backpedal-

                          OZZIE
               N o t that I believe `em... buncha c r a z y
               stories... nuthin t o do with you...

He chuckles feebly. But his visitor just stares back at him,
pupils dilated and dark, somehow inhuman. Time to wriggle out-

                               OZZIE
               W h a d d y a s a y we just forget about it,
               huh? How about I go getcha a beer?

He makes a move past but his visitor doesn't budge. Lincoln
senses danger in this old man, whose fear is now manifest-

                               OZZIE
               What e v e r you want... Just take it...
               Whaddya w a n t . . . ? You want money...?

                                                                     68.



      His visitor frowns. Ozzie quickly unlocks a cashbox. He grabs
      some colored plastic cards and offers them like meat to a lion.

                                 OZZIE
                     I t ' s all I got... Take it... just
                     please... just don't hurt me...

      His visitor takes a blue card, inspecting it like a curiosity.
      Then steps closer. Ozzie shrinks back. An ominous moment, then-

                                 LINCOLN
                     " O u t of state" - how do I get there?

      O f f Ozzie's cowering and confused look, we -
                                                               C U T TO:

99    EXT . SKY OVER THE DESERT - NIGHT

      F r o m darkness grows a seed of light. The whisper flies low and
      quiet, its spotlight roving the undulant desert. Now picking out
      metal glints as it banks over a scrapyard. Now training its beam
      on a figure in the dust whirl beneath. Ozzie, his hair flying
      wild, gesticulating madly. The whisper follows his directions,
      nosing onwards, its spotlight corrugating across the red rocks.

100   EXT . SHUTTLE STOP - NIGHT

      I n the middle of nowhere, a canopied platform. Not unlike the sub-
      w a y platform, it borders a deeply trenched lodeway. A wave of dust
      rolls in, swelled by the whisper, landed beyond. It seems to bring
      Scheer to the platform. He scans around for a clue, a footprint
      perhaps. But somehow he already knows. He looks up the lodeway,
      eyes honing. The deep black line stretches far into the night.

101   INT . THE GLASS VILLA - NIGHT

      Silence. Still. Sanger sits nursing a cup of herb tea. Crowne
      sits smoking. Stubs in the ashtray speak of long hours waiting.
      The still is broken as Merrick emerges from an adjacent room.
      Sanger and Crowne look up, expectant. Merrick closes the door
      with slow care. Then he faces them, a grim tenor in his voice-

                                   MERRICK
                     Bad news.

102   EXT . PHOENIX - NIGHT

      The whisper slices the night, running lights blinking. We pan to
      frame it against a skyline of black towers. A glittering row of
      domes and spires, somehow celestial, touching the sky. The city
      bears no trace of its origins, once built over Indian ruins, now
      rebuilt, subsumed by urban overhaul. It has become a metropolis.

                                                                        69.



103   INT. ROOFTOP NIGHTCLUB - PHOENIX

      A glass dome, faceted, insectile. A haut-monde h i v e . The movers
      and shakers of the high-tech boomtown drinking, dancing. Shot
      waitresses dose blue tequila. Bass music thuds like a heartbeat.
      Scheer looks out of place here but the crowd's too self-absorbed
      to care. He moves through them, invisibly, towards a corner booth.

      TWO MEN IN SUITS sit with a bottle of blue tequila. The first is
      bald, pale and dead-looking, he'd be the grim reaper but for his
      fixed leer. The second is long-haired, bearded, hulking, more of
      a grim ploughman. He has a metal brace screwed into his forearm.

                                  SCHEER
                     Which one of you is Diggs?

                                   DIGGS (THE BALD MAN)
                     That's me, slick. This here's my
                     partner Burdon. Don't mind him. He
                     gets a little shy around strangers.

                                 SCHEER
                     What happened to his arm?

                                     DIGGS
                     `Pursuit last week. The guy took a
                     swing at him with a fireaxe. Didn't
                     stop Burdie though . `Took down that
                     fucker with one arm, didn't you?

      Burdon sips his drink. Scheer, underwhelmed, takes a seat.

                                SCHEER
                     You don't look like bounty hunters.

                                 DIGGS
                     Well we're on the job, see? And it
                     kind of helps if you bleed in. You
                     don't look like a bondman either.

                                SCHEER
                     I'm just an intermediary.

                                DIGGS
                     Now that's what people use when they
                     don't want to get their hands dirty.

      He grins, cannily. Scheer grimaces, a pro suffering an amateur.

                              SCHEER
                     I was told you also handled civil
                     bonds. Debt runners, data-thieves...

                                                               70.



                          DIGGS
              What we hunt depends on the bounty.

                          SCHEER
              It's worth ten platinum. Unmarked.

Diggs pauses at this. A huge amount. Suspiciously huge. He licks
some salt, downs a blue tequila shot and bites a slice of lime.

                            DIGGS
              What's the bond?

                         SCHEER
              The parties I represent want to limit
              the specific details. But let's just
              say industrial secrets are involved.

                         DIGGS
              Ten platinum. Must be big secrets.

That canny grin again. It raises Scheer's hackles-

                         SCHEER
              Any good at keeping them?

                         DIGGS
              Oh, me and Burdie, we're busy bees. We
              don't have time to file every report
              and we got real bad memories. But just
              so we understand each other, slick,
              we're talking about a bag job, right?

Scheer returns an equivocal look. Then dips in his pocket for two
digital slides - Lincoln and Ester's headshots, spinning in 3D.

                            DIGGS
              What's up with these tattoos? They
              look like fucking boondock types .

                         SCHEER
              All I'm authorized to tell you is they
              have no records in this state. Also
              that they're not armed or dangerous.

                         DIGGS
              How about we start with their names?

                          SCHEER
              John and Jane Doe...

                            DIGGS
              You're kidding me, right? No names?

                                                               71.



Scheer's look says he's serious. But Diggs is still confounded.

                          DIGGS
              The n - with all due respect - how the
              fuck d o you expect us to find them?

                             SCHEER
              Because you won't have to look. They
              jumped an overnight shuttle. They'll be
              headed for the terminal, trying to get
              out of state. It's strictly a recovery
              job. For you, it should be childsplay.

                          DIGGS
              The n why not do it yourself? Or is the
              dog ring just to impress the ladies?

The grin. Scheer moves his hand to cover the USMC ring, stiffly-

                         SCHEER
              The parties I represent want to stay at
              arm's length. And just so we understand
              each other that means no connection, no
              papertrail, no police interest...

                        DIGGS
              Is that everything?

                           SCHEER
              . . . no mistakes. They want these two
              brought in quickly and quietly and
              unharmed. Once you have them, you'll
              contact me for further instructions.

                       DIGGS
              I don't know. What do you say, Burdie?

B u r d o n looks over. Then suddenly stands bolt upright, diving into
his jacket, jerking out what looks like a pump-action shotgun.

                           BURDON
              F r a n k Hofstetter! This is a bond
              recovery! Step away from the bar!

F A C E S TURN as he swings aim across the bar - HOFSTETTER, slight,
wide-eyed, looking hunted - customers moving away, exposing him -
Burdon chambering a cartridge, emphatic - Hofstetter f r e e z e s - a
deer in the headlights - a moment of hesitation - then he runs.

- B O O M - BURDON FIRES but the shot misses, hitting the bartender -
exploding on impact with A BLINDING ELECTRICAL DISCHARGE - the
stunned bartender spasms and drops - Burdon pumps and chambers
another slug - his weapon now earned the name of a "thunderbolt".

                                                                            72.



      A STAMPEDE BEGINS - customers running scared - his quarry lost
      in the stampede, Burdon vaults over the table - Diggs pulls out
      what looks like a twin-barrel sawn-off and launches after him -
      Scheer stays seated, watching the hunt with remote curiosity--

      H O F S T E T T E R C L A W S THROUGH THE STAMPEDE - spotting Burdon and the
      thunderbolt close behind - he drops out of the firing line - onto
      his knees - crawling, banged about - almost at the exit, almost--
      T W I N BARRELS PRESS TO HIS HEAD - Diggs looks down - grinning,
      beckoning him upright - Hofstetter l o o k s up - bleak, defeated -
      A GIRL blunders into them - toppling over Hofstetter i n t o Diggs--

      H O F S T E T T E R T A K E S HIS CHANCE TO RUN - now scrambling against the
      stampede - Diggs disentangles himself and levels his weapon -
      the stampede parting - throwing themselves to the ground as--

      - B O O M - DIGGS FIRES - the scattershot hits Hofstetter a s he flees
      up some steps - peppering his leg - sparks off metal as Diggs
      keeps firing - his weapon now earned the name of a "rainmaker".
      H O F S T E T T E R R E A C H E S A CATWALK - his leg dragging, numbing from
      t h e tranquilizer cores - the catwalk dead-ends - blind panic now -
      He ducks under the rail, reaching for the dome - finding a
      precarious handhold, he swings across - trying to climb --

      D I G G S COMES UP BENEATH - looking up, grinning - the pathetic
      sight of Hofstetter - one leg useless - clinging to the dome
      like a fly trapped under glass - as Burdon goes to recover him -

                                   DIGGS
                      Don't bother. He'll drop by himself.
      B u r d o n pulls out some handcuffs and stands waiting. Diggs returns
      to the booth. Pouring out two tequila shots, he grins at Scheer -

                                    DIGGS
                      N o w . . . where were we?

104   EXT . THE DESERT - MORNING

      S u n l i g h t blinks off a chain of carriages, travelling the trench
      of a lodeway. The overnight shuttle slits through the desert.

105   INT . PASSENGER CAR - MORNING
      The sun is a muted orb behind polarized glass. Lincoln stares out
      of the window at the bleak new world blurring past. He's wearing
      Ozzie's ballcap o v e r his crosshatch, his former clothes discarded
      for some of the old man's ill-fitting denims. Perhaps a disguise
      or perhaps just to shed the memory. He glances across at Ester,
      dressed likewise, her hair teased to cover her crosshatch. She's
      dozing, head rested on the glass. A TICKET COLLECTOR comes up-

                                                                        73.



                               TICKET COLLECTOR
                      Tickets...
      Lincoln looks at the man in uniform, uncertain what he wants. The
      ticket collector shakes his head. These two look like deadbeats.

                                   T I C K E T COLLECTOR (CONT'D)
                      A d u l t fare is forty five currency
                      units. Do you have the money, sir?

      Lincoln assimilates. Money. The word is familiar. He pulls out
      the blue plastic card. The man in uniform looks encouraged. He
      gives him the card, watching him slot it into a handheld device,
      which briefly flashes, then the card is returned. Lincoln sees a
      strip at the top is now transparent, like a depleted reservoir.
      He assimilates. Not so different from the transactions in the
      world below. Then he notices Ester is awake and is looking at
      him. Her bright eyes, dim and troubled, somehow accusatory.

                                  LINCOLN
                      I t ' s going to be okay, Ester.

                                ESTER
                           (faint)
                      Is it?

                                LINCOLN
                      We just need to get out of state.

      Ester , disconsolate, looks out of the window. In her gaze, the
      forlorn air of a hatchling fallen from the nest. Lincoln watches
      her, knowing her troubles and knowing that he cannot relieve them.

106   EXT . PHOENIX - DAY

      The skyline stands reprised in daylight. A glimmering citadel.

107   EXT . SHUTTLE STOP - PHOENIX - DAY

      P a s s e n g e r s climb the steps from an underground gloom. Lincoln and
      Ester with them, jostled by the more certain flow. They cross the
      portal onto the street and stop, dazzled by the sunlight. Only to
      be dazzled again by the sudden, stunning prospect of the city...

      F i r s t there's the quality of light, a burning white, perhaps from
      depleted ozone, depicting everything in a surreal shimmer. Then
      there's the towers, darkly crystalline, facets of polarized glass
      rising to domes and spires, like monolothic f i n g e r s reaching for
      the sky. The traffic flashing past, the chassis identifiable as
      trucks, taxis, compacts, sedans, streamlined in a nautical trim,
      hull runners in place of wheels. The sound of claxons, more like
      fog horns than car horns. Then there's the street itself, a six-
      l a n e lodeway, lanes marked with buoys, bobbing around on cables.

                                                                            74.



      The graceful arcs of pedestrian bridges at the intersections. The
      citizens, strange hairstyles, fashions, all wearing sunglasses.
      Even to us it's a wondrous sight. The urbanism, the grandeur, as
      if here in the heart of southwest, Manhattan has met Venice.

                                  V O I C E (O.S.)
                      He y , man, spare a little green?

      A w e interrupted, Lincoln and Ester look around. Slouched by the
      street exit is A HOBO with a mangy dog. He grins toothlessly-

                                   T H E HOBO
                      A i n ' t eaten in two days, have we, boy?

      Lincoln and Ester step back as the dog rises to greet them. Tail
      wagging, it noses forward, sniffing. Then, abruptly, drops its
      tail and backs off, whining. Lincoln and Ester likewise back off.
      Both sides have just discovered a new species. The hobo pets his
      whining canine, watching the strangers walk off with curiosity.

108   EXT . STREET - DAY

      The sunlight flares off passing vehicles, hypnotic. The faces of
      pedestrians flash past. Lincoln and Ester wander in thrall up the
      street. Everywhere new sights, new curiosities bombard them...

      The storefronts, mysterious recesses behind polarized glass. The
      glass, alive with pixellated g r a p h i c s , marquees: "Temps! Temps!
      New Tech Opportunities!" - "Beauty Therapy! Manicures, Dermals,
      Follicle Grafts!" - "Discount Legal Service! Class Actions Only!"

      H o l o f r a m e b i l l b o a r d s loom over the street, huge shimmering
      panels like phantom jumbotrons, commercials playing on a loop:
      - - A businessman in a conference room, shrinking from a fierce
      negotiation; the scene replayed with the same businessman, now
      on his feet, stabbing his finger angrily in the air; a pill
      bottle in CU, a text super "Combatrine! The Aggression Enhancer"
      - - A teenager bemused by his homework: his parents escorting him
      into a clinic; the teenager hooded by an electronic dome; his
      parents clapping; the teenager smiling as he accepts a diploma;
      a text super "Intellex: Data Impression For A New Generation"

      Lincoln suddenly looks round, realizing Ester is gone from his
      side. He scans the sea of faces. Then spots her stepping through
      a doorway. Over the threshold is a holoform: a pig with wings,
      circled by the legend "Hog Heaven! Home Of The True Hamburger".

109   INT . HOG HEAVEN - DAY

      F a s t food outlets have evidently changed little. Promotional
      posters in 3D: "Ham Slam", "Porker Forkers", "Bacon Blitz".

                                                                     75.



      Service counter, seating area. Ester is looking around like
      Alice In Wonderland. Lincoln comes up, out of breath, edgy-

                              LINCOLN
                     I told you to stay with me.

                                     ESTER
                           ( i n n o c e n t , plaintive)
                     I'm hungry.

                                  LINCOLN
                     O k a y . Okay...

      He nods, realizing he is too. He plants Ester in a seat and looks
      around. People stand in line transacting, receiving food trays.
      Not unlike nutrition plaza. Lincoln ventures to the counter. He
      offers the blue card hopefully. THE SERVICE CLERK looks at him-

                                T H E SERVICE CLERK
                     A r e you gonna tell me what you want?

                                      LINCOLN
                            ( b e a t , no other reference)
                     What are my options?

                                  T H E SERVICE CLERK
                     K n o c k yourself out, buddy.

      He indicates a menu above. Lincoln assimilates, looking up at
      the menu. Understanding now, his face lifts to almost a smile.
      It's the first time he's been given an unrestricted choice.

110   INT . SEATING AREA - A FEW MINUTES LATER

      Lincoln returns to Ester with a tray of food and drink. She's
      staring off again, distant. He puts a burger and drink cup in
      front of her. She seems not to notice. He tries to engage her-

                              LINCOLN
                     I asked the man how to get to the
                     terminal. He said it's not far.

      But Ester just keeps staring, her brow now furrowing as A LITTLE
      GIRL skips past, maybe 11, sipping a soda. Now Lincoln sees her
      too and is transfixed. Now the little girl notices the strangers,
      staring at her. She hurries onward, uncomfortable. Lincoln and
      Ester's eyes follow. It's the first time they've seen a child.

111   EXT . PHOENIX TERMINAL - DAY

      A low rumble. A plume of smoke. A sudden eruption of fire. A bird
      rises from the flames and a phoenix spreads its wings. Widening,
      we reveal this is a holoform o v e r the terminal entrance.

                                                                        76.



      Union Station now looks more like Grand Central. A huge granite
      facade, a covered colonnade linking to pedestrian bridges at the
      corners. Here, in the flow of figures, we make out Lincoln and
      Ester, resembling tourists. Then, a short distance behind, we
      spot two more figures. The hobo and his timorous dog. Following.

112   INT . CONCOURSE - TERMINAL - DAY

      V a u l t e d . Arched windows, mosaiced i n polarized glass. Sunlight
      falls in filtered shafts. Footfalls echo off polished granite.
      Lincoln and Ester scan around. Ester looks daunted by the space.
      Lincoln looks focused. He sees people in line, transacting.

113   INT . TICKET WINDOW - DAY
      The sign on the window reads "Tickets". Lincoln assimilates. The
      word is familiar. He steps up to the counter with Ester. A TICKET
      CLERK - female, immaculately groomed - greets them with a glossy
      smile. Lincoln offers her the blue card. She seems not to notice.

                                    T H E TICKET CLERK
                     We l c o m e to Phoenix Union Station. What
                     is your date of travel, sir?

      Lincoln has to think. Dates mean nothing to him. He ventures-

                                 LINCOLN
                     Now...

                                T H E TICKET CLERK
                     An d what is your destination?

                                LINCOLN
                     O u t of state.

                                T H E TICKET CLERK
                     I'm sorry. Could you repeat that?

                               LINCOLN
                     We want to go out of state.

                                T H E TICKET CLERK
                     I'm sorry. Could you repeat that?

                                 V O I C E (O.S.)
                     L i k e talking to a wall, ain't it?

      Lincoln and Ester turn to look. The interceder is pale, bald,
      wearing leathers. A stranger to them, we recognize him as DIGGS-

                                       DIGGS
                     H o l o s e r v e . C h e a p e r than flesh and
                     blood but nothing between the ears.

                                                                     77.



      Diggs demonstrates, wafting his hand across the ticket counter.
      It cuts through the ticket clerk with a holographic ripple.

                                   DIGGS
                      F i r s t time I used one of these, I
                      asked her out on a date...

      He grins genially, examining their faces, verifying his quarry.
      Lincoln examines the pale man. The sense of danger is welling-

                                  LINCOLN
                      What do you want?

                                  DIGGS
                      J u s t wanted to help, that's all.
      D i g g s shrugs, disarming, trying to win them over, nice and easy
      per the mandate. Then he notices the eyes of his male quarry. The
      pupils, black and dilating. Suddenly the male jerks away, like a
      shying horse, drawing the female with him. Diggs, unperturbed,
      makes no attempt to follow. Turning his back on them, he touches
      a device concealed in his ear canal, a miniature two-way radio-

                                     D I G G S (INTO RADIO)
                      B u r d i e , it's them. East exit.

114   EXT . TERMINAL - DAY

      Lincoln and Ester emerge into the colonnade, rejoining the flow
      of figures. Lincoln presses the pace, alert, darting looks back.
      The pale man doesn't appear to be following. But the sense of
      danger is spurring him to gain distance. Ester, vicarious to the
      danger, stays close to Lincoln's side, scurrying to keep up.
      Neither of them notices the grey vehicle sliding up on them,
      kerbside. A commercial transit van known as a "cutter", it's a
      common sight on the streets. The driver leans out of the window -
      hair tied back, dressed in buckskins, we recognize BURDON-

                                 BURDON
                      You folks need a ride?

      Lincoln and Ester turn to look. The dark giant is just another
      stranger, cast in a demeanor of casual inquiry. He's offering an
      opportunity to gain distance but Lincoln remains hesitant. The
      sense of danger, turbulent, hard to read. Burdon sugars the way-

                                     BURDON
                      P r i v a t e cab. No state surcharge...

      He taps a button and the side-door slips open. Lincoln looks into
      the lightless c a v i t y , wavering, uncertain. Ester, hugging close,
      nervous. Figures passing, jostling them toward the cavity. The
      dark giant, looking on expectantly. The pause stretching, then-

                                                                78.



                           VOICE (O.S.)
               He y ! What the fuck are you doing, man?
B a c k down the colonnade, THE HOBO is gesticulating to Burdon-

                        T H E HOBO
               I told you! They went inside!

The hobo doesn't see Lincoln and Ester, unwitting that he's just
betrayed himself as their shadow... and Burdon as their predator.
His dog starts barking. Lincoln starts backing away with Ester,
his eyes blackening, the danger surging, the dog barking, the
giant's face dropping, the elements converging... They bolt.

                           BURDON
               Shit!

B U R D O N JAMS INTO REVERSE - but his pursuit is cut short by a
parked vehicle - he swings a look back, jabbing his earpiece-

                            B U R D O N (INTO RADIO)
               N o r t h Corner! North Corner!

LINCOLN AND ESTER RACE UP THE COLONNADE - against the flow of
figures - darting and weaving like fish swimming upstream --

D I G G S BURSTS FROM THE NORTH EXIT - launching up the north side
of the terminal - thinner foot traffic here, faster going --

LINCOLN AND ESTER SLOWING - the flow massing under the portico -
they peel through - the holoform p h o e n i x rumbling overhead --

D I G G S TURNING THE NORTH CORNER - pausing to touch his earpiece -
now launching south down the colonnade - towards the portico -
jerking a pair of handcuffs from his belt, ready for the snatch--

LINCOLN AND ESTER GAINING PACE - past the portico now, the way
opening - Lincoln's eyes flaring - a face in the distance ahead -
the pale man - he swings Ester around - doubling back to find --
B U R D O N COMING UP BEHIND - the flow of figures, no obstacle -
parting at his thunderous onset - his quarry, stopped and
staring at him - almost upon them - handcuffs at the ready--

LINCOLN FREEZES - caught between the dark giant and the pale man -
Ester cringing to his side - the dark giant charging up on them -
sunlight on metal - the sight of the handcuffs - TRIGGERING HIM--

LINCOLN GRABS ESTER - swinging her off the sidewalk - lowering
her into the lodeway - leaping down to join her - lode poles
pulsing, thrumming - rivets on their denims, rattling from the
polarity - traffic soaring past on lode-stream, chest-high -

                                                                       79.



      DARTING OUT INTO TRAFFIC - Lincoln leads Ester by the hand like
      a child - across the lanes, dodging, weaving through the gaps -
      claxons b l a r i n g , deafening - sunflashes, blinding - a sudden
      shadow - a huge freight truck bearing down, no gaps ahead --

      LINCOLN DRAGS ESTER TO THE GROUND - both flattening against the
      concrete lode-bed - the shadow engulfing them - the truck's hull
      runners shearing narrowly over their heads - the rush of air,
      sweeping off Lincoln's ballcap - rousing a storm of dust--

      LINCOLN AND ESTER CHOKING - crawling onward through the dust -
      hull runners scudding overhead - maybe only a foot of clearance -
      buoy cables whipping around like cheesewire - onwards, crawling
      across the concrete - fighting their way across the lode-stream--

      B U R D O N WATCHING from the sidewalk where Lincoln and Ester first
      dropped, scouring the trench for a sight of them. Now he spots
      them, climbing up onto the sidewalk the far side of the street.

      D i g g s now arrives at his side, sweating, out of breath. Now
      seeing their quarry take off up the far side of the street, he
      turns to his lumberous p a r t n e t , fury mixed with incredulity-

                                 DIGGS
                      Why the fuck d i d n ' t you go after them?!

      B u r d o n just looks at him, displaying the metal brace on his fore-
      a r m . Diggs, out of sheer frustration, gives him a pounding shove-

                                DIGGS
                      Fuck!

115   EXT . ALLEY - DAY
      The refuge of shadow. The alley is divided by a lodeway and the
      walls on each side are jutted with dumpsters. Lincoln and Ester
      run up the narrowed strip of sidewalk, forced into single file.

      A huge shape looms ahead. A garbage vehicle known as a "scow".
      Like a leviathan spreading its tentacles, the scow's tube-arrays
      dock with the dumpsters and start sucking the contents out.

      Lincoln glances back to find Ester has stopped and is cringing
      away from the tentacled monster. He returns to her, his eyes
      flicking around, aware that their real predators are close-

                                LINCOLN
                      We have to keep going.

      He takes Ester's hand, drawing her onward. But Ester recoils,
      shaking off his grip. Now he looks at her more closely. She's
      panting, shuddering, fraught with trauma. Her voice is haunted-

                                                                            80.



                                      ESTER
                     P l e a s e . . . Please, I want to go back...
      She shrinks into the shadows, shaking her head. The hatchling
      wanting to return to the nest. Lincoln meets her eye, deeply-

                                  LINCOLN
                     T h o s e men - that's what they want too.
      Ester holds his gaze, chest heaving. Then looks back towards the
      alley mouth. Her fingers reach for her belly, clawing a little.
      Then her eyes lower, assimilating, reason reasserting its heavy
      grip. Lincoln senses her turmoil. His voice is soft but sturdy-

                               LINCOLN
                     We have to keep going, Ester.

      Ester looks up at him again. The forlorn air seems to have faded.
      Her eyes, grimly set. Her face, a little haggard. Older somehow.
      She takes Lincoln's hand and together they head off up the alley.

116   EXT . ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER

      The alley mouth darkens as a vehicle turns off the street. The
      grey cutter moves through the shadows, prowling and shark-like.

117   INT . CUTTER - DRIVING

      The drone of resistors. The throbbing glow of the drive console,
      a panoply of instrumentation. Burdon steers in silence, Diggs
      beside him, edgy, intent, combing the shadows for their quarry.

                                       DIGGS
                     S u n n a v a b i t c h ! What the fuck d o we do
                     now, huh? They could be anywhere...

                               BURDON
                     We go back to the office and run `em.

                               DIGGS
                     A s what? John and Jane Doe?

                               BURDON
                     We ask the guy.

                                  DIGGS
                     Y e a h , let's tell him we couldn't hack
                     it in kindergarten. See how long him
                     and his ten platinum stick around.

      He fires a barbed look. Burdon absorbs this, unflinched, thinking-

                                                                       81.



                                BURDON
                      I t was blue, right?

                                DIGGS
                      What?

                                  BURDON
                      The y were using a blue currency card.

118   EXT . STREET - DAY

      Lincoln and Ester walk up the street. Wary of attention, they go
      with the flow of figures, eyes peeled for predators. The sights
      of the city now seem hostile. Faces flash past, dead-eyed in sun-
      g l a s s e s . Traffic rushes like steel rapids. Storefronts construct
      a black wall. Holoframe b i l l b o a r d s loom, mocking, half-noticed:

      - - A woman in a bathroom, adjusting her sexy neglige; a crack in
      the door shows a man in bed, waiting; the woman closes the door
      and picks up what looks like a toothpaste tube; she arches her
      eyebrow; "F.I.G. F e m i n i n e Impulse Gel... Because who needs him?"
      - - A cemetery under a grim overcast sky; suddenly a frisbee flies
      across frame; an old woman, dressed like a teenager, catches it;
      she tosses it to an old man dressed likewise; a text super "Death
      Sucks!", a sting, "New Gaza Healthcare: Your Life Is Our Life."
      Lincoln and Ester stop at the corner. They look around, blindly,
      no coordinates, no frame of reference. Urban canyons, identical,
      gordian a n d chasmic. P a s s i n g figures jostle. Then Lincoln spots
      something across the street. It looks like an over-sized phone
      booth. Its beacon flashes; "C.I.N. - CITY INFORMATION NETWORK."

119   INT . CIN BOOTH - DAY

      A flourish of music greets Lincoln and Ester as they enter. The
      fanfare conjures a holoform i n mid-air. A cartoon rattlesnake,
      benignly rendered, welcomes them with a clownish, fanged smile:

                                THE SNAKE
                      H i there! I'm Tattletail! What e v e r you
                      want to know, wherever you want to go, I
                      got the answers! Let's look at the menu!

      A set of text frames appear: "Residential Listings", "Business
      Listings", "Transport Listings", "Hotel Listings". Lincoln
      assimilates. The terminologies are not unfamiliar.

                                 THE SNAKE (CONT'D)
                      N o w let's make a selection!

                                                                     82.



                                   LINCOLN
                         ( b e a t , venturing)
                     Transport...
                                  THE SNAKE
                     O k a y ! Let me open that directory for
                     you! I'll be with you in two shakes!

      The snake rattles accordingly and coils in a holding pattern.
      Then a tomographic map of the city appears. A red dot plants
      itself under a text flag "You Are Here!". Then other red dots
      scatter across the map, each flagging with transportation icons.

120   INT. CUTTER - STREETS - DRIVING - DAY

      B u r d o n steers calmly, scanning the streets. Diggs impatiently
      bashes the keys of a holocom on the drive console. A holoframe
      hovers, snowed with static. Then a secretary's face appears -
      sagging, older, primped and painted young. Her name is JANEEN-

                                  J A N E E N (ON HOLOCOM)
                     D i g g s & Burdon Bond Agency.

                     J a n e e n , where the fuck have you been?

                                   J A N E E N (ON HOLOCOM)
                     B e a u t y therapy. I got a date tonight.

                                DIGGS
                     O h , Jesus... Listen, I want you to
                     punch into the currency stream for me.
                     Sweep for blue card transactions.

                                   J A N E E N (ON HOLOCOM)
                     You're kidding me, right? You have any
                     idea how long that's going to take?

                              DIGGS
                     I want serial numbers, batched a n d
                     cross-referenced. Start from Union
                     Station and work your way out...

      B e f o r e he can object he taps a key. The holoframe blinks out.

121   EXT . BUS STATION - LATE AFTERNOON

      A surging sound. A surface of water. A burst of spray. A dolphin
      leaps from the waves and hangs suspended. Text scrolls around:
      "Get Out Of State & Out Of Mind - Ride the Grey Dolphin Line!"
      This is the next incarnation of the greyhound. The blue facade,
      crested into waves. We make out Lincoln and Ester, now looking
      more like transients than tourists, dirty, worn and exhausted.

                                                                      83.



122   INT. CONCOURSE - BUS STATION

      Low roof. Flat lighting. The faces here seem less threatening,
      the young and the low-income. Lincoln and Ester look around. Not
      unlike the train terminal. People standing in line, transacting.

123   INT . TICKET WINDOW

      Lincoln and Ester step up to the ticket window. A TICKET CLERK -
      male, immaculately groomed - greets them with a polished smile.

                                     T I C K E T CLERK
                      We l c o m e to Grey Dolphin Bus Lines.
                      What is your destination, please?

      Lincoln squints at him. Then wafts his hand across the counter.
      The ticket clerk flinches at the impact. Then composes himself.
      A trace of camp as he smiles bashfully at the rugged customer-

                                  T I C K E T CLERK
                      I t ' s okay. Really. I get that a lot.
                      I'm sorry, now where were we again?

                               LINCOLN
                      I want to get out of state. Now.

                                     T I C K E T CLERK
                      B e l i e v e me, I know how you feel. So
                      where did you want to go exactly?

                                 LINCOLN
                      O u t of state...
                                  T I C K E T CLERK
                      J u s t wherever the wind takes you, huh?

                                     LINCOLN
                      Where's that?

                                   T I C K E T CLERK
                      We l l , if it was me, out to the west
                      coast. It's perfect this time of year.

      Lincoln nods, liking the sound of this. The ticket clerk smiles,
      enjoying the acceptance of his suggestion, he ventures hopefully-

                                        T I C K E T CLERK
                      T r a v e l l i n g alone, are we?

                                 LINCOLN
                      N o . With her.

      He gestures, then realizes Ester is gone from his side again.

                                                                     84.



      He scans the faces. The clerk, disappointed, taps some keys.

                                 T I C K E T COLLECTOR
                      T w o adults, let me see... I'm afraid I
                      can't get you seats till the morning.

124   INT . FOOD SERVICE AREA - BUS STATION

      A grill bar. A rank of vending machines. Ester moves through the
      seating area as if drawn. Now over the ambient noise, we isolate
      the cry of a baby. Ester is following the sound to its source.
      She finds a Mexican woman shushing her infant. The woman looks
      up and smiles. Ester just stands there, awe-struck. Lincoln now
      comes up to reclaim her. He's about to ask why she wandered off
      when she turns to him. He sees her eyes are brimming with tears.
      Tears of joy and sorrow. It's the first time she's seen a baby.

125   EXT . STREET - DUSK

      The winged pig flutters over the doors of "Hog Heaven". The
      milling customers are suddenly parted by Diggs, bursting out
      through the doors. He leaps into the grey cutter, parked
      kerbside. I t peels out with a flash of its halogen eyes.

126   INT . CUTTER - DRIVING - DUSK

      B u r d o n steers, glancing inquisitively at his partner. Diggs taps
      the holocom, urgently, galvanized. The holoframe resolves snowed
      with static. Janeen's face appears. Less primped, disgruntled-

                                   J A N E E N (ON HOLOCOM)
                      D i g g s & Burdon Bond Agency.

                                DIGGS
                      We got a positive on the serial number.
                      Punch in and pull up the transactions.
                      Start with the last hour and work back.

                                    JANEEN
                      G r e a t . So I got to park my ass in
                      front of a screen all night?

                                  DIGGS
                      I t ' s a platinum bond, Janeen. We get
                      this, I'll buy you a new ass, okay?

      He grins at Burdon. The thrill of the chase glows in his eyes.

127   INT . WAITING AREA - BUS STATION - NIGHT

      A blue glass partition wall looks out onto the depot. More like
      a marina with an embarcadero a n d a row of docks. "Liners" slot
      in and out, their nautical trim making them seem like ferries.

                                                                    85.



      Lincoln and Ester sit waiting. Lincoln, rigid, watchful. Ester,
      gazing across at the Mexican woman, who as the infant cradled
      asleep. Ester glances wistfully at Lincoln. Then she frowns-

                                      ESTER
                      Lincoln , what is that? On your face?

      Lincoln turns, touching his face. He feels stubble there. For
      the first time. His body is naturalizing but it feels unnatural
      to him. Ester reaches out and runs her fingers across his cheek.
      Lincoln stiffens a little, unused to this type of contact. But
      her touch is gentle and the contact is warming. Their eyes
      slowly meet, flickering, something passing between them. Then
      Ester's face contorts slightly. She emits a shallow cough.

                                 LINCOLN
                      A r e you alright?

      Ester clears her throat. But another cough follows.

                                ESTER
                      M y throat... it feels dry...

                                     LINCOLN
                      O k a y . . . I'll get you some water.

128   INT . FOOD SERVICE AREA - NIGHT

      E m p t y . The grill bar is closed. Only the vending machines are
      active. Lincoln considers them. Not unlike those he used to
      know. He finds one that offers water bottles. The sign reads
      "Arctic Melt". He pulls out his blue card and looks for the
      slot. Then pauses, picking up his reflection in the glass. He
      examines the shadowy growth on his face. Then he notices his
      eyes. They seem to be darkening. The pupils, welling open. Then
      he feels it. The sense of danger, surging up like a geyser.

129   INT . DEPARTURE AREA

      Ester sits waiting, anxious now, coughing persistently. Hearing
      footfalls, she looks round. But the face that greets her is not
      Lincoln. It's the pale man, the one who chased them. Before she
      can react, he forcefully pulls her upright, tapping his earpiece-

                                   D I G G S (ON RADIO)
                      P i e c e of cake, Burdie. J a n e Doe's in
                      the bag. Keep an eye out for John-Boy.

      Ester looks around in panic. Faces turn but none of them are
      Lincoln's. Diggs confronts the spectators, flashing a badge -

                                  DIGGS
                      Bond recovery... state license.

                                                                      86.



      He marches his female quarry towards the exit. Now she starts to
      struggle and he jerks her back, slapping a cuff onto her wrist-

                                 DIGGS
                     Play nice, little girl. Now you want
                     to tell me where your boyfriend is?

                                   LINCOLN (O.S.)
                     Behind you.

                                     DIGGS
                     What?

      - T H U D - LINCOLN HAMMERS HIS FIST into the pale man as he turns -
      dropping him, flat-on-his-ass - pulling Ester away from him -
      D I G G S JERKS OUT THE RAINMAKER - quick to his feet - more insulted
      than hurt - targeting his quarry - who suddenly duck down as--

      - B O O M - DIGGS FIRES - A WOMAN SCREAMS - the Mexican woman - her
      face, peppered with tranquilizer core - her baby starts crying--
      Ester FROZEN - horrified by the screaming woman - the bloody,
      slack grimace - the baby bawling - Lincoln dragging her down-

      - B O O M - THE BLAST OF THE THUNDERBOLT - Burdon positioned behind
      them - narrowly missing his target - hitting the partition wall -
      - C R A S H - THE PARTITION WALL EXPLODES in a blinding electrical
      discharge - shattering into a sudden TEMPEST OF GLASS SHARDS -

      LINCOLN AND ESTER SPIN ROUND to see the pale man retargeting -
      the dark giant reloading - exit blocked, they lunge towards --
      T H E PARTITION WALL - kicking through the hole in the glass -
      Ester's last glimpse of the screaming woman - the howling baby -

130   EXT . BUS DEPOT - NIGHT

      LINCOLN AND ESTER LEAP OUT onto the embarcadero - running -
      faces blur past - liners flash by with glaring halogens--

      D I G G S LEAPS OUT AFTER THEM - rainmaker poised - the embarcadero
      g l u t t e d with passengers - he can't get a bead on his quarry--
      LINCOLN AND ESTER VAULTING over the scattered luggage - the
      crowd thinning - the canopy opening onto the street beyond--

      D I G G S RIGHT ON THEIR TAIL - people screaming, parting as they
      see his weapon - the firing line clearing - he levels aim and--

                                     M E T R O PD OFFICER (O.S.)
                     M e t r o PD!      Drop it!

                                                                              87.



                                 DIGGS
                      I'm a bond agent!

                               M E T R O PD OFFICER
                      I said drop the fucking w e a p o n !

      D i g g s sees his quarry now escaping. With a scowl, he complies.
      He laces his fingers, tapping his earpiece in the process-

                                        D I G G S (INTO RADIO)
                      N o r t h b o u n d on Third. Get `em, Burdie -
                      and take off the fucking g l o v e s . . .

                                                                        C U T TO:
131   EXT . STREET - NIGHT

      T H E GREY CUTTER VEERS ROUND A CORNER - Burdon at the wheel - his
      quarry visible ahead - he jams the throttle - revs rising -

      LINCOLN AND ESTER SPRINT UP THE SIDEWALK - disorientation - the
      sudden diaspora o f lights and darkness - the sharp acoustics -

      T R A F F I C SWERVING - CLAXONS B L A R I N G - the cutter hurtling up the
      street, relentlessly - its halogen eyes, burning, growing -

      LINCOLN AND ESTER RACING FOR THE END OF THE BLOCK - towards a
      pedestrian bridge - trying to outpace the cutter -

      T H E GREY CUTTER CLOSING - Burdon punching a button - the side
      window slides open - he levels his thunderbolt, angling a shot-

      LINCOLN AND ESTER VEER LEFT - up onto the pedestrian bridge -
      rising above the traffic - claxons b l a r i n g beneath as --

      T H E GREY CUTTER PLOUGHS INTO THE INTERSECTION - banking into a u-
      t u r n - vehicles braking to avoid collision - LIGHTS, CLAXONS -

      LINCOLN AND ESTER - turmoil raging behind them - a glimpse of
      the cutter regaining pursuit - Lincoln sees an opening ahead--

132   EXT . ALLEY - NIGHT

      LINCOLN PULLS ESTER INTO THE SHADOWS - the sidewalk narrowing -
      they run onward, glancing off dumpsters - DULL BOOMS OF METAL -
      A FLOOD OF HALOGENS - the cutter banking sharply into the alley -
      pouring on the speed - the quarry trapped in its headlights--

      LINCOLN AND ESTER - nowhere to run - THE LIGHTS GROWING - THE
      RISING DRONE OF RESISTORS - Lincoln sees another opening --

                                                                        88.



133   EXT. PEDESTRIAN ALLEY - NIGHT

      LINCOLN PULLS ESTER INTO THE DARKNESS - a narrow access, barely
      lit, hard to see - a sudden dead-end - they SLAM INTO A BARRIER--

      A CHAINLINK F E N C E - the links shuddering - Lincoln looks up and
      sees it's scalable - claws into the links - STARTS CLIMBING-

      Ester TRYING TO CLIMB - rattled by coughing - fighting to
      breathe - her limbs shaking - her muscles failing - then--

      - B O O M - A BLINDING ELECTRICAL DISCHARGE - SUDDENLY THE FENCE IS
      ALIVE WITH ELECTRICITY - BURNING FINGERS JITTER ACROSS THE LINKS-

      LINCOLN AT THE TOP OF THE FENCE - jolted by the sudden shock -
      muscles in reflex - falling - landing the far side of the fence--

      Ester STILL CLIMBING - the jolt instantly toppling her back -
      landing the near side of the fence - more rattled than hurt --

      B U R D O N RUNNING TOWARDS THEM - thunderbolt smoking from the shot-
      LINCOLN ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE FENCE - recovering from the fall--

      Ester ON THE NEAR SIDE OF THE FENCE - cowering, coughing -

      B U R D O N JERKS HER UP BY THE HAIR - like a rapacious viking - he
      looks through the fence at Lincoln - sniffing her, almost bestial-

                               BURDON
                     G o ahead. I'll look after her.

      LINCOLN ' S EYES FLICKERING DARKLY - jaw clenching - the sense of
      danger urging him to run - but Ester is in the giant's grips -

      Ester CLAWING TO BREAK FREE - coughing, rasping - her fingers
      snag on the giant's arm-brace - TUGGING WITH ALL HER STRENGTH--

      B U R D O N YOWLING AT THE SUDDEN PAIN - lashing out - flinging Ester
      into the fence - dropping the thunderbolt - CLUTCHING HIS ARM--

      LINCOLN LEAPING ONTO THE FENCE - scrambling up the link - the
      dark giant momentarily off-guard - HE VAULTS OVER THE TOP --

      - T H U D - BURDON SPINS ROUND - takes the full brunt of Lincoln's
      impact - overbalancing - THEY CRASH TO THE GROUND -

      LINCOLN STRUGGLES UPRIGHT - winded, but forced to face the dark
      giant - who is already on his feet, his mighty fist SWINGING OUT-

      - T H U D - LINCOLN TAKES A PUNCH TO THE JAW - recoils, reciprocates
      throwing a left hook - hitting hard but the giant barely flinches-

                                                                      89.



      -THUD-THUD- BURDON POUNDS INTO HIM - a storm of punches - his
      quarry, ducking and blocking - now backed up against the fence--
      Ester RETRIEVING THE THUNDERBOLT - trying to work the mechanism -
      coughing - hands shaking - accidentally touching the trigger -

      - B O O M - THE SHOT BLASTS INTO THE AIR - enough of a distraction
      for Lincoln - he lands the giant with A BONE-JARRING LEFT HOOK-
      B U R D O N KEELS OVER INTO THE WALL - cracking the back of his head -
      his knees buckling - sliding down - just catching sight of--

      LINCOLN AND ESTER SCRAMBLING UP OVER THE FENCE - and then the
      quarry is lost from sight in A DOWNPOUR OF ELECTRICAL SPARKS.

134   EXT . BACKSTREET - NIGHT

      S I R E N S WAILING IN THE DISTANCE. Lincoln and Ester race down the
      sidewalk, along a construction hoarding. Ester slows, doubling
      over, rasping. Lincoln looks at her, her l i p s , blue, her face,
      pale. The sirens, getting louder. He sees a gap in the hoarding-

135   EXT . ENCANTO PARK - NIGHT

      Lincoln and Ester emerge through the gap onto a derelict tract.
      A once public park, now a construction site. Mounds and craters
      of earth. Dim shapes of huge vehicles, like sleeping dragons.
      Patches of parkland, as yet untouched. Bowed palms, dead grass,
      a stagnant lagoon, a dull mirror for the ascendant moon. On its
      shoreline is a dilapidated construct that was once a boathouse.

136   INT . BOATHOUSE - ENCANTO PARK - NIGHT

      The refuge of shadow. The collapsed   roof allowing streams and
      puddles of moonlight. Lincoln helps     Ester onto a rotted bench.
      She slumps down, exhausted, Lincoln     watches her, helplessly.
      She's fighting for breath, wheezing     and coughing in deep rasps.

                              ESTER
                     I can't... I can't breathe... my
                     throat... it's so... dry...

                                 LINCOLN
                     I ' l l find you some water.

      He looks around blindly. Some junk in the corner. He rummages,
      finds a rusted metal box. Pries it open, empties the contents.
      Gauzes, band-aids - evidently a first-aid box - then a bottle.
      He opens it, sniffs. It smells pungent. Alcohol, not water.
      Ester suddenly starts sobbing. Lincoln returns to her side-

                                 LINCOLN
                     I t ' s going to be okay, Ester.

                                                                90.



                            ESTER
               N o . . . no, it isn't...

                           LINCOLN
               I ' l l find you some water, okay?

Ester looks up at him, wheezing, tears streaming from her eyes-

                          ESTER
               An d then what, Lincoln?

                           LINCOLN
               I ' l l find another way. Out of state.

                          ESTER
               An d then what? What if they find us?

                           LINCOLN
               The n we'll keep going.

                        ESTER
               I can't... I can't run anymore...

Ester folds over, sobbing and coughing at the same time. Pitiful
to watch. Lincoln crouches, gaining her eyeline, very deliberate-

                            LINCOLN
               We ' l l keep going till we get there.

Ester traps a sob, reading his eyes, something reviving in her-

                          ESTER
               The Island... You mean, The Island?

Lincoln answers with a brief smile. If this will keep her going
then the truth is redundant. He eases her out of the moment-

                          LINCOLN
               N o w I'm going to get some water. But I
               want you to stay here. It'll be safer.

Ester wipes away her tears, sniffing. Her breaths, calming.

                            ESTER
               Don't go yet. Stay with me, Lincoln.
               Stay with me for a little while.

Lincoln looks puzzled by Ester's request. Even more puzzled as
she rests her head on his shoulder, nestling into his neck. He
feels her against him. The warmth spreading through him again.
His arm reaching, as if of its own accord, closing around her.
I t feels right somehow. And there he stays, holding her, looking
out across the dereliction. And the moon rises over Encanto P a r k .

                                                                      91.



137   EXT. METRO PD STATION - NIGHT

      The holoform l o g o of The Metro PD glows over the threshold.
      Diggs exits with a dark glower. The cutter is waiting kerbside.

138   INT . CUTTER - DRIVING - NIGHT

      Diggs climbs in an Burdon steers out into traffic. The thrill
      o f the chase is gone from them now. Both seem equally grim and
      determined. Diggs taps the holocom. A holoframe resolves, snows
      with static. Then Janeen's face appears, dishevelled, bitter-

                                 JANEEN (ON HOLOCOM)
                     What the fuck do you want now?

                                     DIGGS
                            (very calm, very cold)
                     Punch into the currency stream, close
                     the net on downtown and keep the search
                     active. The next time they use the card,
                     I want to be right on top of them...

      O f f his icy tone, Janeen nods without retort. Diggs hits a key
      and her face blinks out. And the cutter prowls into the night.

139   EXT . DOWNTOWN STREET - NIGHT

      The winged pig flutters over the doors of "Hog Heaven". Another
      franchise on a more downtrodden street. Lincoln emerges with a
      bag of food and drink. He considers the blue card. The reservoir,
      now close to the bottom, his resources almost exhausted. With a
      look of foreboding, he pockets the card and turns the corner.
      An d suddenly stops in his tracks. But it's not a vehicle that he
      sees. Or a predator. His eyes are fixed on a holoframe billboard:

      - - A football player in montage; pummeling into a defensive line;
      running for a touchdown; gyrating in the endzone; spinning in an
      NFL podium shot, super; "Nobody Stops The Juggernaut!"; a team
      logo, super; "Come See The Phoenix Admirals! Rulers of the AFC!"
      Lincoln recognizes the player's face but it's not possible. He
      waits for the loop to restart. There it is again. The face of
      Starkweather Two-Delta. Incredulous, he stops a pedestrian-

                                LINCOLN
                     The man, the man up there. Who is he?

                                 PEDESTRIAN
                     What planet `you been living on?
                     That's the Juggernaut, brother.

                                LINCOLN
                     The juggernaut...

                                                                          92.



                                     PEDESTRIAN
                     Jamil "The Juggernaut" Starkweather -
                     highest rushing total in the league.
                     `Least till that injury blew out his
                     gut. Now the doctors are saying he'll
                     be back on his feet next season. Those
                     fuckers sure can work miracles, huh?

      Lincoln doesn't respond. The pedestrian shrugs and heads on,
      writing him off. Lincoln lingers, staring up at the billboard.

140   INT . CIN BOOTH - NIGHT

      The flourish of music greets Lincoln as he enters. The cartoon
      rattlesnake appears and smiles his clownish, fanged smile:

                               THE SNAKE
                     Hi there! I'm Tattletail! What e v e r you
                     want to know, wherever you want to go, I
                     got the answers! Let's look at the menu!

      The set of text frames appears: "Residential Listings", "Business
      Listings", "Transport Listings", "Hotel Listings".

                                THE SNAKE
                     N o w let's make a selection!

      A heavy pause. Lincoln's voice comes with a slight tremor.

                              LINCOLN
                     Residential...

                                   THE SNAKE
                     Please give me the name.

                              LINCOLN
                     Starkweather...

                                  THE SNAKE
                     Okay! Let me find that listing for
                     you! I'll be with you in two shakes!

      The snake rattles and coils. Then a headshot a p p e a r s with the
      face of Jamil Starkweather , scaled across with a red line.

                                       THE SNAKE
                     Starkweather , Jamil... I'm sorry! This
                     listing is blocked from the directory!

      Lincoln stands, darkly intent on the face. Now irrefutably the
      same face he saw in his life below. The snake shakes its rattle-

                                                                           93.



                                THE SNAKE
                     You want me to find another listing?
      Lincoln looks at the snake, flicking its tongue, coiling.

                                                             F A D E TO BLACK.

141   EXT . DOWNTOWN STREET - MORNING

      A downtrodden neighborhood. The buildings look like remnants from
      our own era. A scruffy man slouches up to a gated storefront. He
      slots a key into a lock panel and the gate rolls up, squealing.
      We widen to a vehicle parked kerbside. A familiar grey cutter.

142   INT . STORE - MORNING

      L i g h t s flicker on to disclose a gunshop. The array of firearms
      a s fathomless as their purpose. The scruffy gunshop o w n e r slouches
      inside. Diggs and Burdon enter on his heels. He yawns at them-

                               G U N S H O P OWNER
                     We ain't open for another hour.

                                  DIGGS
                     Y e a h , well we ain't in the market.

                                       G U N S H O P OWNER
                     E v e r y o n e ' s in the market, pal. One end
                     of the barrel or the other...

                                  DIGGS
                     We ' r e chasing up a currency record from
                     last night. These two ring a bell?
      D i g g s displays two digital slides. The owner pauses, suspicious.

                                 G U N S H O P OWNER
                     What are you? Cops? Lawyers?
      D i g g s answers by jerking out the rainmaker. The twin barrels
      aimed at his head, the gunshop o w n e r loses his cool a little-

                                 G U N S H O P OWNER
                     H i m , I remember... Came in just before
                     closing... wanted a shooter but didn't
                     have no ID... settled for one of these.

      He displays a HUNTING KNIFE, unsheathing it, showing the blade.

                                DIGGS
                     Did he give you a name?

                                G U N S H O P OWNER
                     No.

                                                                    94.



                                DIGGS
                     Did he say where he was going?
                                 G U N S H O P OWNER
                     No.

      D i g g s cocks the hammer. The owner flinches. Then, off the knife-

                                  G U N S H O P OWNER
                     The r e was one thing. Kinda w e i r d .
                     He wanted to know how to use it...

143   EXT . APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING

      An apartment building towers overhead, vaguely ominous. Lincoln
      approaches the entrance with Ester. We now see he has a band-aid
      covering his crosshatch. He takes Ester briefly aside, teasing
      some tresses over hers. As she gently smooths down her hair,
      Ester catches his eye. A look flickers between them. Then-

                                  D O O R M A N (O.S.)
                     Fancy dress, was it, sir?

      A DOORMAN is looking at them like they just rolled out of a club
      he wouldn't be seen dead in. Off their flustered looks, he gives
      an apologetic smile. Then opens the door and holds it for them.
      Lincoln reaches for Ester's hand. Then stiffly leads her inside.

144   INT . CORRIDOR - AN UPPER FLOOR - DAY

      The doors are set with small glowing orbs at peephole level. Like
      eyeballs, watching, as Lincoln and Ester proceed up the corridor.
      They stop at a door. Lincoln checks the number. Pauses heavily.
      Then looks for some type of doorbell. As his eyes cross the orb,
      it seems to blink. Then comes a sound of disengaging locks. Then
      the door swings open. Lincoln flinches, taken by surprise. Then
      frowns as he sees there is no one on the other side of the door.

145   INT . APARTMENT - DAY

      Lincoln enters, wary, scanning around. A living room. Framed
      pictures. A sofa, chairs. A coffee table, empty bottles,
      cigarette packs, a full ashtray. A bureau, some paperwork.
      Silence, stillness. No sign of life, no sense of danger. Lincoln
      moves across to the bureau and starts leafing through the
      papers. Ester ventures in through the door, curious-

                                 ESTER
                     What are you looking for?

                              LINCOLN
                     I don't know. Something. Just wait
                     there and make sure nobody's coming.

                                                                    95.



As he leafs the papers, Ester waits dutifully by the door. Her
eyes wander across the framed pictures. Then narrow onto a 3D
p h o t o g r a p h . A college boxing team photo, grinning cup winners.

                            ESTER
                L o o k at this...

Lincoln returns to her. Ester points to the photo. A face in the
row, blurred but eerily familiar. Lincoln seems not to react.
Ester, curiosity piqued, scans the other pictures. She alights
on a framed certificate - "Thomas R. Lincoln, Attorney-at-Law".

                            A MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                What the hell are you doing?

Lincoln turns to confront A MAN in a robe. Disheveled from sleep,
grey from a hangover... the man's face is unmistakably his own.
This is TOM LINCOLN, sponsor of Lincoln Six-Echo, his bleary
eyes now widening in disbelief as he recognizes his agnate-

                           TOM
                Oh, Jesus...

Lincoln is better prepared for this encounter but still stunned
by the sight of his double in the flesh. Sponsor and agnate stand
frozen. The only movement is Ester, her eyes flicking between
the same men, fraught, confused. Lincoln breaks the silence-

                           LINCOLN
                Who are you?

Lincoln steps closer, eyes piercing. Tom takes a step back.

                            TOM
                The y said... I'd never have to see you.

                           LINCOLN
                Who?
Lincoln takes another step closer. Tom takes another step back.

                           TOM
                The people...

                            LINCOLN
                What people?

Lincoln takes another step closer. Tom stiffens, gathers himself-

                             TOM
                Look, if you don't get out of here
                right now, I'm calling security...

                                                                  96.



Lincoln examines him, assimilating. His double seems to be as
belligerent as he is. Reasoning now, threat response kicking in.
Lincoln draws the hunting knife. Unused to it, he points it like
a gun. But it's enough of a threat for Tom, who swallows dryly-

                           TOM
                Why are you here? What do you want?

                         LINCOLN
                I want to know...

Tom grimaces at the ambiguity. That face. His f a c e . If not for
the pounding headache this would be a bad dream. He lowers onto
the sofa. Finds a cigarette and lights up. A drag, mind kicking
in. The knife cautioning him. With a slow exhale, he confesses-

                             TOM
                One of the partners at my firm... he
                told me about it. Gave me a referral.
                I thought he was joking at first. I
                went out there, took the sales tour.
                Even before that I knew it wasn't a
                joke. There was this discretion agree-
                ment. I never saw anything like it and
                I've seen a lot. Ironclad... breathe a
                word and they've got you by the balls.
                I don't know... There's cancer in my
                family. Maybe it was just to keep up.
                All the partners were on the policy.

                           LINCOLN
                The policy?

He looks at his agnate. Then realizes the level of ignorance.

                               TOM
                Christ, you have no idea, do you?

                             LINCOLN
                About what?

Tom drags his cigarette, fingers trembling. He shakes his head-

                         TOM
                I can't fucking do this...

                            LINCOLN
                What are you talking about?

Lincoln moves closer, pointing the knife. Tom flinches, then-

                                  TOM
                Insurance. You're an insurance policy.

                                                                   97.



                           LINCOLN
               What is that?

                             TOM
               Health insurance... medical...

                           LINCOLN
               What does that mean?

                         TOM
               If I get sick... if part of me gets
               sick... I take a healthy part from you.

                             LINCOLN
               Why?

                          TOM
               How do you expect me to answer that?
               It's just how it works, that's all.

Tom looks at his agnate. The insistent stare. The knife, pointing
at him like a finger. His fear yields to a flicker of anger-

                           TOM
               What do you want? A fucking apology?

                          LINCOLN
               Why do I look like you?

                              TOM
               Because you are me . . .

                        LINCOLN
               I don't understand.

                              TOM
               Because they made you from my cells...

                             LINCOLN
               Made me?

                             TOM
                      ( a flare of anger)
               That's right. You were made. Cooked up
               in a centrifuge like a fucking boiled
               egg. Every thought running through your
               head, every word coming out of your
               mouth, all of it, manufactured, made...

Lincoln frowns, trying to assimilate. Too much to process.

                             LINCOLN
               You . . . you're the one who made me?

                                                                98.



                         TOM
               No.

                          LINCOLN
               Who made me?

                        TOM
               I signed a contract. I can show you.

He gestures to a mirror on the wall. Lincoln steps back but his
eyes are unremitting. Tom rises, cautious, crossing to the wall.
He opens the mirror to reveal a wall safe. His trembling fingers
tap the keypad and the safe hisses open. He draws out a contract
folder embossed with a crosshatch. Then offers it to his agnate-

                           TOM
               It's all right there. Who, why...

Lincoln takes the contract folder and starts flipping the pages,
reading. A pendulous silence falls. Tom stands watching, smoking
nervously. Ester stands by the door, trying to take all this in.

                           TOM
               Look you've got what you wanted. Now
               why don't you just get out of here?

                                LINCOLN
                      (pause, looks at him)
               There are men out there, looking for
               us. I want you to make them stop.

                        TOM
               I can't...

Lincoln sets down the contract and brings up the knife again.

                          TOM
               I can't. Look, I'm a lawyer, I know how
               it works. The contract, everything, it's
               all laced with confidentiality clauses.
               It means they don't want this to get
               out. It means whatever I do, they're
               not going to stop. You understand?

Lincoln pauses, assimilating. His double's expression indicates
that he's telling the truth. Maybe try a more practical request-

                         LINCOLN
               Do you have transport?

                                 TOM
               Transport , yes... yes, parked
               downstairs... Bay 53... Take it...

                                                                      99.



                                LINCOLN
                     And then you'll call security?

      Lincoln steps closer, pointing the knife. Tom tries to stay dead-
      pan. The lawyer kicking in. Look them in the eye when you lie-

                                TOM
                     I'm not going to call security. I'm
                     not going to call anybody, okay?

      Lincoln looks at his double, reason now yielding to anger. Deep,
      roiling. Tom looks at his agnate, fear welling, deadpan cracking-

                                  TOM
                     Look, maybe there's something... maybe
                     there's a way to cancel the contract...

      Lincoln presses the tip of the blade to his double's cheek.

                                TOM
                     For Christ's sake! It's not my fault!

      Lincoln inches the blade deeper into the trembling face, drawing
      blood. The anger urging, hungry for more blood. Then suddenly-

                                     ESTER
                     Lincoln ! No!

      Lincoln looks at her, the anger interrupted, the knife still in
      place. He pauses. Then returns to his double. The dreading eyes,
      the trickle of blood down the face. His e y e s . His f a c e . A long,
      foreboding moment. Then suddenly Lincoln lashes out. His fist
      sends his double flying, falling in a flurry of contract pages.
      Lincoln stands over him, looking down, like a dominant species.
      His double is unmoving, unconscious. Lincoln abruptly spins away.

146   INT . ELEVATOR - DESCENDING

      The light panel flashes. Lincoln stands grimly, head lowered,
      trying to fathom the anger roiling within. Ester stares at him,
      wanly. Both held in the dark tableau. And the elevator descends.

147   INT . UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - DAY

      The vehicle parked in bay 53 is a hybrid of sportscar a n d speed-
      b o a t , a two-seater known as a "skiff". Lincoln and Ester climb
      in. Lincoln reviews the drive console, the controls, all of it,
      meaningless. His eyes cross an orb set in the steering wheel.

      The orb seems to blink and suddenly the drive console lights up.
      Lincoln reviews it. A screen in front of him is flashing:
      "PILOTING: MANUAL/AUTO?". He assimilates. Then ventures-

                                                                     100.



                                LINCOLN
                      Auto...

      The interface processes, then asks: "DESTINATION: NAME/ADDRESS?"

                                 LINCOLN
                      O u t of state... West...

      The interface processes, then reports "UNDOCKING". Lincoln and
      Ester jolt as the skiff shunts forward. Lode-poles pulsing ahead
      of them, the skiff moves out, as if pulled by a phantom tugboat.

148   EXT . STREET - DAY

      The skiff buckets off the ramp into a street inlet. Then stops
      rocking a little. The interface reports: "ESTABLISHING UPLINK".
      On another screen, a road map appears. A red dot plants at their
      point of origin then bleeds into a red line, plotting a course.

      The autopilot scans for traffic, then nudges forward on the
      throttle. The resistors drone, the steering wheel turns and the
      skiff noses onto the street. Finding its lane, it drops to
      cruise speed. Lincoln studies the interplay of steering wheel,
      throttle and brake. Then glances at Ester. She's plunged in
      thought, staring off. She turns to him with a haggard frown-

                                 ESTER
                      The man back there... who looked like
                      you... does it mean I have someone too?

      Lincoln looks at her blankly, unknowing. Ester stares off again,
      her brow knotting with unanswered questions. But Lincoln's gaze
      lingers. Her pale skin, her limpid eyes, her hair fluttering in
      the breeze. It's the first time he's really seen Ester's beauty.

149   EXT . PHOENIX SKYLINE - DAY

      The domes and spires glint in the sunlight. We isolate a glass
      steeple. A crosshatch insignia. A legend "Sanger Industries".

150   INT . CROWNE'S OFFICE - SANGER INDUSTRIES TOWER - DAY

      A corner office with a panoramic view of the city. Crowne sits
      at a console desk, reviewing some data on a holoframe screen. A
      knock on the door and HER SECRETARY enters, looking unsettled-

                               SECRETARY
                      I just thought I should warn you. I
                      have a sponsor holding. His name's
                      Thomas Lincoln. He sounded... angry.

                                                                      101.



151   EXT. STREET TUNNEL - DAY

      The skiff plunges into the shadow of an underpass. The interface
      flashes: "UPLINK INTERRUPT... AUTOPILOT DISENGAGING". Lincoln
      sits up, confused. The skiff is now slowing, drifting as if cut
      loose. He studies the controls again. Positions one hand on the
      steering wheel, the other on the throttle. Then he nudges it.

      The skiff lurches, veering out of its lane. Another vehicle zips
      narrowly past, rocking them with its invisible backwash. Ester
      looks at Lincoln, suddenly alarmed. Lincoln tries again, firm on
      the wheel, gentle on the throttle. And the skiff eases forward.

152   EXT . MOTEL - DOWNTOWN PHOENIX - LATE AFTERNOON
      D i s m a l . The kind of place that precedes a life on the street. We
      push in on a window, cracked glass, the drapes closed within.

153   INT . MOTEL ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

      G l o o m y , musty. A "holovision" plays some type of NFL recap. But
      Scheer is not watching it. He is lying on the bed, staring at
      the ceiling, motionless. Off a beeping sound, he stirs. He taps
      a holocom on the nightstand. A holoframe appears, resolving:

                                  Merrick (ON HOLOCOM)
                     K a r l , there's been a complication.

154   EXT . INTERSTATE - SUNSET

      The sunset melts gold across the horizon as the skiff cruises
      westward. Eight lanes of lodeway rake through the salt flats.
      Lincoln is driving more confidently now. Ester is huddled asleep
      beside him. Suddenly the skiff starts to slow again. Lincoln
      reviews the controls. Throttle, forward, foot, off the brake.
      The interface flashes: "REMOTE LOCKDOWN E N G A G I N G " . The skiff is
      steering itself onto the hard shoulder. It now pulls to a dead
      halt. Ester is woken by the sudden inertia. She opens her eyes
      and looks around. They've stopped in the middle of nowhere.

155   EXT . THE SALT FLATS - SUNSET

      The sun sinks in a slow pink haze. Lincoln and Ester walk across
      the salt flats. Visible in the distance is a walled settlement.

156   EXT . THE HERITAGE PARK - SUNSET

      An adobe wall culminates at an arched wooden gateway. Lincoln
      and Ester approach. They haven't walked far but Ester is already
      short of breath. As they near the gateway a holoserve appears,
      like a sentry - Native American, buckskins, feathered headdress
      and facepaint. His voice seems as old as the wind-

                                                                     102.



                                    THE INDIAN HOLOGRAM
                     Welcome to Salt River Heritage Park,
                     home to the Hohokam Nation for over two
                     thousand years. The park is now closed.
                     Please come back during opening hours,
                     9am t o 5pm, Monday through Saturday...

      Ester steps closer. With the sun hazing through, the holoserve
      s e e m s angelic or ghostly. She's examining his striped facepaint-

                               ESTER
                     He has marks on his face like us.

      She turns to Lincoln with a flowering smile. Then rushes up to
      the gateway, suddenly galvanized, squeezing through a gap.

157   EXT . THE HERITAGE PARK - SUNSET

      A ring of Native American pueblos. Pithouses a n d coursed adobes,
      recreations and preserved ruins. Ester rushes around the ring,
      looking into the pueblos as if expecting to find them inhabited.
      She ducks into one of the pithouses. Lincoln follows her inside.

158   INT . PITHOUSE - SUNSET

      The mud walls show a skeleton of saguaro ribs, cholla branches.
      It's cosy in here, dim. The living area, recreated with mats and
      pottery. Lincoln finds Ester looking around, between excitement
      and confusion. She turns to him, her voice wavering, wheezing-

                               ESTER
                     Is this... is this place The Island?
      Lincoln answers with a softly negating look. Ester's face slowly
      falls, the energy draining from her eyes. She lowers onto one of
      the mats and lies down, huddling. She looks up to him, wheezing-

                                ESTER
                     I'm tired. Let me rest for a while.

159   EXT . PITHOUSE - NIGHT

      Silence prevails but for the faint rattle of Ester's breathing.
      Lincoln sits on low stool, in sentinel over her as she sleeps.
      In his eyes, we see the weight of foreboding. He doesn't know
      what they'll do when she wakes. Of a moaning sound he looks at
      Ester. Then realizes it isn't coming from her. The sound is far
      off, a rhythmic moaning. Now discernible as the chant of voices.

160   EXT . THE PLATFORM MOUND - NIGHT
      A blazing fire. Figures in silhouette, moving around, chanting.

                                                                     103.



      The platform mound is situated just beyond the heritage park. An
      ancient ceremonial site, stepped in ruins, dusted with caliche.
      Pima and Maricopa, descendants of the Hohokam, are congregated
      for a solstice ceremony. Off to the side, a group of horses are
      tethered, shuffling, snorting. Lincoln approaches, cautiously,
      but somehow like a moth to the flame. He stops at a distance,
      watching. The curiosity of congruent sound and movement.

                                VOICE (O.S.)
                     You look a little lost, my friend.

      Lincoln turns to a figure emerging from the night. A tall man -
      swarthy skin, mist-colored eyes. His tribal name is GREY DOVE-

                               GREY DOVE (cont'd)
                     Or did you come here for a reason?

      Lincoln examines the tall man. The face seems as deep and gentle
      as the voice. His sense of danger, unstirring, he concedes-

                              LINCOLN
                     I was looking for water.

                                GREY DOVE
                     Not the best place to look.

                               LINCOLN
                     My transport... it stopped working.

                              GREY DOVE
                     I see. And where were you going?

                                LINCOLN
                     Out of state...

      Lincoln sighs, the destination seeming very far away. Grey Dove
      considers him. This bruised, weary outsider is somehow childlike.

161   EXT . THE CEREMONY - LATER

      The fire blazes across the face of a shaman. Old, gnarled, and
      dry as the salt flats. With a sacred mutter, he slips a peyote
      button onto his tongue. Then flings back his head, casting his
      eyes to the stars. When he lowers his head again, we see his
      pupils dilating. He rises, chanting, moving in ceremonial steps
      around the fire. Tribespeople s i t in a ring, joining the chant.

      Beyond the ring, others are dining at a roasting pit. Roast
      rabbit. Cornflour bread. The food is as it might been two
      thousand years ago. Only the sight of plastic water gallons
      breaks the illusion. Lincoln stands apart with Grey Dove, eating
      ravenously, gulping from a water gallon. He looks around-

                                                                     104.



                                 LINCOLN
                     What is this place?

                               GREY DOVE
                     It is a sacred place. My people come
                     here to commune with their spirits.

      Lincoln looks at him, puzzled. Grey Dove smiles tolerantly.

                                     GREY DOVE
                     Not easy to understand perhaps. For us,
                     the spirit is like the shadow on the
                     rock. Sometimes close, sometimes far
                     away, sometimes the sky clouds and the
                     shadow fades. We come here to ask our
                     spirits to return to us. The man...
                           (gestures to the shaman)
                     He speaks to The Grandfather from whom
                     all spirits are born. The Great Spirit
                     who binds every living thing. He has no
                     name. But he is everywhere. In the sun
                     and the moon, the wind and the rain...

      The shaman's chanting grows louder, more insistent. His circuit
      around the fire becoming faster, building in religious fervor.

                                GREY DOVE
                     Now he asks for the gift of vision that
                     he may see through to the spirit shape
                     of things. To find the spirits of the
                     lost. To bring them into the light...

      The shaman's chanting suddenly stops. He is looking directly at
      Lincoln, pointing. His face, contorting with what might be anger
      or fear. He starts babbling in dialect, ardently. Lincoln frowns
      in confusion. Grey Dove quietly draws him away from the mound.

162   INT . PITHOUSE - NIGHT - LATER

      Ester stirs from slumber. On the ground beside her, she finds a
      bowl of food and a water gallon. Now through the gloom, she sees
      Lincoln, sitting on the stool like he never left, keeping vigil.
      Something seems different about him as he turns, registering her-

                                LINCOLN
                     A r e you alright?

                              ESTER
                     I feel better after I sleep.

      Lincoln nods absently and stares off out of the doorway. Ester
      moves closer, sensing something. He speaks as if from far away-

                                                                      105.



                                LINCOLN
                     The man out there... he said
                     everything has a spirit... every
                     living thing... but not...

      His voice cuts off. Ester looks at him, recognizing his pain.
      She doesn't understand what it is or what caused it. It's pain
      and it evokes a response in her. A feeling, taking her over. Her
      hand reaches out and strokes his hair. Lincoln looks up at her,
      questioning. With supreme knowing, Ester leans down and kisses
      him. At the touch of her lips, Lincoln pauses. The first kiss
      for both of them but Ester takes it in her stride. The calm
      ballet of nature. Fluidly peeling off her shirt, breasts
      steeping with moonlight. Lincoln rising to face her, feeling her
      proximity, her radiant heat. His fingers touching her breasts.
      Ester trembling, her lips once more finding his. Lincoln closing
      his eyes, the rush of sensation, overwhelming. He yields to it,
      returning the kiss, with hunger, with passion... with spirit.

163   EXT . THE INTERSTATE - DAWN

      The sun rises in the east, depicting the traffic in silhouette.
      A vehicle arcs from the fast lane onto the hard shoulder where
      the skiff sits abandoned. The grey cutter pulls to a halt.

164   EXT . HARD SHOULDER - DAWN

      D i g g s and Burdon move up on the skiff, cover positions, weapons
      levelled. Burdon spins in to the driver side, snapping aim with
      the thunderbolt. But the skiff is empty. The only sign of life
      is the interface, flashing red: "REMOTE LOCATOR TRANSMITTING".

      B u r d o n exchanges a look with Diggs. No dice. Diggs reaches in his
      pocket and pulls out what looks like an electronic telescope. He
      puts it to his eye and pans the salt flats. Burdon crouches at
      the roadside, looking for tracks. Then Diggs fixes on something-

                              DIGGS
                     I got thermals.

165   EXT . PLATFORM MOUND - SUNRISE

      The fire is now reduced to a heap of embers. The tribespeople
      a r e asleep around the mound, wrapped in ethnic blankets. Diggs
      and Burdon move up stealthily, weapons at the ready. The horses
      bristle and snort, betraying their approach. The tribespeople,
      stirred by the noise, awake. Diggs and Burdon swing aim around
      the ring as faces rise and stare at them. None of the faces have
      white skin. Diggs lowers his weapon and addresses the gathering-

                                DIGGS
                     I'm looking for two bond runners. They
                     ditched near here last night.

                                                                        106.



                                          DIGGS (cont'd)
                      One man, one woman. Tattoos on the
                      forehead...
                              (nothing, just silent stares)
                      Anyone's seen them, I got fifty green.
                              (still nothing, aggravated)
                      What the fuck are you? Deaf and dumb?

      The tribal faces just keep staring. Diggs scowls. Then suddenly
      swings aim with the rainmaker and fires. -BOOM- hitting one of
      the horses in the haunch. It rears up, whinnying, setting off
      the rest of the horses. Diggs turns back to the gathering-

                                     DIGGS
                     Somebody start talking.

      He scans around the ring. Then fixes on one of the women. She
      lifts a trembling finger to a man nearby. Grey Dove stiffens.

166   EXT . SALT MOUNTAINS - SUNRISE

      The sunrise depicts two silhouettes, moving across the ridge.
      Lincoln and Ester clamber over the calcified rocks. Ester now
      stops to catch her breath. She is wheezing again, fighting for
      air. As Lincoln looks on with concern, she musters a brave smile-

                              ESTER
                     I can make it.

167   EXT . SALT CANYON - EARLY MORNING

      A freight barge whooshes through the canyon, trailing a chain of
      low, arched containers, capacious in width rather than height.
      The conveyance is similar to a lodeway but wider, deeper, known
      as a "lode-canal". At each end of the canyon, it intersects with
      other lode-canals, converging to use the same passage, a system
      of signals and lockgates controlling the flow of freight traffic.
      High above, on the south rim of the canyon, we find Lincoln and
      Ester. Ester is no longer wheezing but rasping. She looks down at
      the passing vessel, daunted. Lincoln offers her small comfort-

                                  LINCOLN
                     Don't worry. The one we want goes the
                     other way. He said it goes slower.

      They exchange a smile. The chain of containers tailing off, the
      barge leaving the canyon with a blast of its resonant claxon.

168   EXT . THE SOUTH FACE - MORNING

      Lincoln and Ester descend the rocky slope toward the lode-canal.
      Ester stops, having to catch her breath every few steps. Lincoln
      tries to hide his concern, looking away towards the sunrise. The
      westbound vessel will be coming soon.

                                                                        107.



      They just need to get out of state... Now he frowns, sensing
      something. Faint but growing. His jaw clenches. His face
      tightens. His pupils start to dilate.

169   EXT . THE NORTH RIDGE - MORNING

      The north ridge is evidently threaded by a lodeway as we see the
      grey cutter pulling up. Diggs and Burdon get out and look down
      into the canyon. Diggs pulls out his scope and starts panning.
      Burdon peels off his jacket. It's early but it's already getting
      hot. Diggs now pauses, handing him the scope for his opinion-

                                DIGGS
                      Up there in the rocks. Three o'clock.
                      I'm not sure... it could be ambient.

170   EXT . THE SOUTH FACE - MORNING

      Lincoln and Ester hide in the shadow of a rock. Ester is muffling
      her breaths as best she can. Lincoln now hazards a look over the
      top. Two figures are climbing down the far side of the canyon,
      now pointing in their direction. He ducks back, assimilating.
      Hiding, no longer an option. Nor running, at least for Ester.
      His face sets in a grimace of conviction. His eyes glow darkly.

171   EXT . THE NORTH FACE - MORNING

      Diggs and Burdon reach the foot of the rocks. Neither speaks,
      communicating in hand-signals. Diggs slips into the lode-canal.
      Burdon covers, sweeping the thunderbolt across the south face.

      Diggs emerges from the far side of the lode-canal. He stays low,
      moving up into the rocks. Then, from above, a rock dislodges,
      rattling down. Diggs reacts instantly, targeting, opening fire-

      - B O O M - B O O M - The shots from the rainmaker swathe across the rock.
      The thunderbolt now adding to the barrage, Burdon firing from
      the far side - SHOTS, BOLTS, KICKING UP A STORM OF DUST --
      SUDDENLY HOLDING FIRE, waiting for the dust to clear, reloading.
      No sign of movement. Just a slide of rubble. Fading echoes.

      D I G G S STEALS ONWARDS UP THE ROCKS - into the fog of dust - the
      sunlight and shadow playing tricks on his eyes - then suddenly-
      LINCOLN BURSTS OUT OF THE DUST - from the left - tackling the
      pale man - both of them toppling - tumbling down the slope --

      THUDDING TO A HALT at the lip of the lode-canal - the rainmaker
      lost in the fall - the impact throwing up a billow of dust --
      THE DUSTCLOUD - Diggs and Lincoln struggling, clawing, punching -
      Lincoln, with surprise on his side, gaining with the upper hand--

                                                               108.



DIGGS' CLAWING FINGERS discover Lincoln's knife - tugging it from
his jacket - Lincoln grabbing his wrist, fighting for control -
THE KNIFE MOVING BETWEEN THEM - Diggs with better leverage - the
blade inching towards Lincoln's face - pressing into his cheek--

LINCOLN'S EYES - welling black, almost inhuman - the sense of
danger screaming in his ears - he grabs the pale man's throat -
DIGGS' EYES - bulging as he strains to push the knife home -
oxygen draining - conscious ebbing - he slumps back -

LINCOLN REGAINS THE KNIFE - the pale man seems to be out cold -
but he's not sure - he pauses holding the blade over him, then--
- B O O M - THE KNIFE FLIES FROM HIS GRIP IN A BURST OF DISCHARGE -

BURDON SNAPS AIM FOR ANOTHER SHOT - beading - his target moving
now - dropping out of the firing line - into the lode-canal--

BURDON INCHES TOWARD THE EDGE - thunderbolt angling downward -
into the trench - then suddenly he's GRABBED BY THE ANKLES -

LINCOLN STRAINING to overbalance the giant - feet up against the
wall - like trying to topple a tree - finally winning some give-

BURDON TOPPLES INTO THE TRENCH - his ankles clamped by his
quarry - both men meeting the concrete with a bone-shaking-

- THUD - LINCOLN IS CRUSHED BENEATH THE MASSIVE WEIGHT - the giant
already recovering from the fall - now dragging him upright--

- THUD - BURDON THROWS A PUNCH - mightily - hurling his quarry
across the trench - moving in quickly, following up with a kick--

- THUD - LINCOLN CRUMPLES as the boot smacks into him - then
another kick - then another - the world starts blurring --

BURDON TURNS AWAY - his quarry disabled for now - he recovers
his thunderbolt - turns back to administer the coup de grace--

LINCOLN LOOKS UP - the giant looming - the muzzle of his weapon
thrumming with energy - the rivets on his denims start rattling--

BURDON SPINS ROUND - the thunderbolt suddenly ripped from his
grasp - there, in the distance - AN EASTBOUND BARGE IS COMING -

LINCOLN SCRAMBLES UP THE WALL OF THE TRENCH - muscles straining,
feet slipping on the concrete - escaping the imminent vessel --

                                                               109.



DIGGS COMING TO - now seeing his quarry a short distance away -
emerging from the lode-canal - he looks around for a weapon, then-

                             BURDON (O.S.)
               Diggs! Get me outta here!

BURDON STRUGGLING TO CLIMB OUT OF THE TRENCH - with one arm,
it's almost impossible - fighting against his own weight--
DIGGS REACHING THE EDGE - seeing the eastbound barge coming -
grabbing his partner's outreached hand - pulling him upward -

BURDON'S PANIC - his other arm flinging away - HIS METAL BRACE
SNARED BY THE LODE-STREAM - the force shuddering his entire body-
DIGGS PULLING WITH ALL HIS MIGHT - feet slipping - locked in a
tug of war with the lodestream - THE BARGE IS CLOSING FAST--

BURDON'S HORROR - now suspended between the two forces - feet
kicking - THE BARGE IS ALMOST UPON HIM - he screams agonized--

                           BURDON
               Help me! HELP MEEEEE!

THE SCREAM IS INSTANTLY LOST in the whoosh of the barge. Diggs,
stunned, just looks at his hands, empty, spattered with blood.

                        DIGGS
               Burdie...?

THE SHADOW OF THE ROCK - Lincoln rejoins Ester - casting a look
back - the eastbound barge now plummeting into the distance--
D I G G S STOOPING AT THE EDGE OF THE TRENCH - looking down - all
that remains of his partner is a smear of blood at the concrete--

LINCOLN AND ESTER REACHING THE FOOT OF THE ROCKS - seeing THE
WESTBOUND BARGE against the sunrise - snaking into the passage--
DIGGS PULLING UPRIGHT - spotting his quarry - fire in his eyes -
drawing out a boot-knife - slipping it between his teeth--

THE WESTBOUND BARGE pulling through the canyon - lode-poles
pulsing ahead of it - polarity thrumming in opposing flow--
LINCOLN AND ESTER start running as the barge comes towards them -
Lincoln pulling Ester along - struggling to match the pace--

A SOUND LIKE A BEATING TYMPANY COMING TOWARDS THEM - they look
round to see - A SHADOW RUNNING ALONG THE TOP OF THE BARGE--
D I G G S FLINGING HIMSELF OFF THE BARGE - the blade in his teeth -
arms spread - for an instant, like a vulture against the sun--

                                                                110.



LINCOLN IS SUDDENLY CRUSHED by the weight of his landing - ESTER
IS HURLED SIDEWAYS - into a ditch - lost in a cloud of dust--
D I G G S PULLING HIMSELF UP, astride of Lincoln - snatching the
knife from his clenched teeth - the sound, like a whetstone--

LINCOLN SPITTING DIRT - suddenly grabbed by the scalp and tugged
sideways - twisted partways o n t o his back, forced to look up at--
A BLACK SPOT AGAINST THE SUN - Diggs' face set in a murderous
sneer - he wants to see this fucker's e y e s - the torment--

LINCOLN DAZZLED BY THE SUNLIGHT - but suddenly knowing the face
of death - now catching the brief glint of the knife as --
D I G G S PLUNGES THE BLADE DOWN - slicing into his quarry's hand as
he throws it up in defense - his quarry YOWLING WITH PAIN--

LINCOLN FEELING THE STAB - his deepest instinct suddenly awoken -
every impulse, every fiber brought into alignment - survival--
D I G G S IS HURLED INTO THE AIR as Lincoln surges upward - he
tumbles backward into the dust - losing hold of the boot-knife--

LINCOLN PUSHES HIMSELF UPRIGHT - only makes it half-way -
scrambling towards the pale man - all fours, like an animal--
D I G G S CLAWING AROUND IN THE DUST - fingers finding metal - the
boot-knife - he brings it up - slashing at his imminent quarry--

LINCOLN RECOILING - the blade nicking his face - sudden rage -
grabbing the pale man by the arm - swinging him round into--
- B O O M - THE MOVING WALL OF FREIGHT CONTAINERS - as the westbound
barge passes - Diggs bounces off - stumbling to keep balance--

LINCOLN ON THE RETREAT - the pale man coming at him with the
knife - another nick - seeing a gap now, shoving him backwards--
- B O O M - THE MOVING WALL RESOUNDS - Diggs howls - snagged by a
bolt - hurt, his fury becomes incandescent - he strikes madly--

LINCOLN STUMBLING BACK - the pale man coming at him - the blade
flashing to and fro - frenzied - like a threshing machine--
F O R C I N G HIM UP AGAINST THE ROCKS - the knife almost upon him -
he grits his teeth and lunges forward - charging like a bull --

DIGGS CAREENS BACKWARD, still swiping the blade - digging into
his quarry - headlong towards the moving wall - hitting with--
- W H U M P - no resonant boom - no bouncing back - Diggs has hit a
gap between the containers and HIS HEAD HAS BEEN LOPPED OFF -

                                                                       111.



      LINCOLN STANDS HORRIFIED - as the headless body is spun by the
      moving wall - dropping into the trench as the barge tails off-
      The westbound barge gains speed, leaving the canyon. But there
      is Ester, running after it, vainly, coughing and sputtering.

                                   LINCOLN
                     Ester! Stop! It's no use!

                               ESTER
                     We have to... get to... The Island...

                                 LINCOLN
                     It's going too fast!

                               ESTER
                     We have to... get to...

      Ester staggers a few more steps, then collapses to her knees,
      rasping for breath. As Lincoln reaches her, she slumps back into
      his arms. Her head lolling, eyes rolled back to white, a drool
      of blood spilling from her lips. Then the blast of a claxon c u t s
      the air as the westbound barge disappears into the distance.

                                                          F A D E TO BLACK.

172   EXT . SEDONA - LATE AFTERNOON

      A ranch home in the middle of nowhere. Long shadows.

173   INT . STUDIO - RANCH HOME - LATE AFTERNOON

      Late golden sunlight through a mist of sawdust. Abstract wood
      sculptures are visible. Juniper wood, carved along the bias of
      the grain, polished to accentuate the curves of natural growth.
      AN OLDER WOMAN runs a sander over a work in progress - 60's, in
      coveralls, gray her tied back, her face shielded by goggles and
      a bandana. She pauses to review her work, shutting down the
      sander, slipping off her goggles and bandana. Her face is eerily
      familiar. Her name is KATHERINE. She now moves to the window,
      catching sight of something outside. Curiously, she watches a
      vehicle coming down the long driveway. A dusty, grey cutter.

174   EXT . FRONT PORCH - RANCH HOME - LATE AFTERNOON

      Katherine opens the front door. The cutter is now docked in the
      port and a stranger is staggering towards her. In his arms, is
      an unconscious woman. Now Katherine can see the face - younger,
      but unmistakable even so. Her voice comes in a chilled whisper-

                                KATHERINE
                     O h , God... Oh, my God...

                                                                      112.



175   EXT. PHOENIX - LATE AFTERNOON

      A whisper cuts across the glistening skyline towards The Sanger
      Industries Tower. It circles in to land on a rooftop helipad.

176   INT . CROWNE'S OFFICE - SANGER INDUSTRIES TOWER

      Silence . Crowne sits at her desk. Merrick sits across from her.
      Waiting. The air stirs as the secretary ushers Dr. Sanger into
      the office. No greetings are exchanged. Sanger just lowers into
      a chair, a little unsettled to find Merrick has preceded him.

                              CROWNE
                     I take it you've heard the news.

                                DR. SANGER
                     The bond agents. Yes. Unfortunate.

                                      CROWNE
                     Unfortunate?
                            (pauses, lights a cigarette)
                     We're way past unfortunate, Henry.

                              DR. SANGER
                     I thought we'd covered ourselves.

                                CROWNE
                     The police won't connect the bond
                     agents to us. But that's not the
                     problem. It's the sponsor.

                                 DR. SANGER
                     What are you talking about?

                                MERRICK
                     The male agnate tracked him down.

                                  CROWNE
                     His name's Thomas Lincoln. It seems
                     they had a genetic reunion. Not a
                     h a p p y one. It was all I could do to
                     stop him going to the authorities.

                              DR. SANGER
                     I still don't see the problem.

                               CROWNE
                     He may not want a police involvement
                     but he's already threatened to file
                     suit. And he's one of the biggest
                     litigation attorneys in the city.

                                                              113.



                            DR. SANGER
              That's why we have you, Ellen.

                            CROWNE
              That's why I asked Bernard to come out
              here. To find out how it happened.

                       MERRICK
              I told her, Henry. About synesthesia.

S a n g e r casts a betrayed look at Merrick. Then returns to Crowne-

                        DR. SANGER
              I t was a marginal problem. And it was
              under control - according to Bernard.

                            CROWNE
              That's not the point. Whether or not
              it's a factor in this instance, it
              puts us in breach of the clone laws.

                        DR. SANGER
              I t doesn't even touch their genetics.

                           CROWNE
              I'm talking about self-awareness. The
              virtual humanity statutes require us
              t o give them consciousness to the
              l e v e l of functionality. But not beyond.

This gives Sanger pause. Crowne drags her cigarette acutely.

                              CROWNE
              L e g a l l y , we are naked on every level.
              Federal legislature, state licensing,
              sponsorship contract... But even if we
              did manage to weather the legal storm,
              we'd never survive the public scrutiny.

S a n g e r absorbs this, calmly shaking a pill from his pill bottle.

                          DR. SANGER
              I've spent my entire career facing down
              naysayers, Ellen. Don't think for a
              second I'm afraid of facing them now.

                         CROWNE
              You remember cryogenics? At the outset,
              people dismissed it as a rich man's
              folly. Eccentric millionaires freezing
              their brains, hoping to wake up in a new
              body.

                                                                114.



                                 CROWNE (cont'd)
               E v e n when cloning showed signs of
               m a k i n g it feasible, it wasn't moral
               a f f r o n t that caused the backlash. It
               w a s the scope. The scope, Henry. When
               t h e size of the customer base was
               e x p o s e d , it screamed inequality - one
               m e d i c i n e for the rich and one for the
               p o o r . The pressure for accessible cryo-
               genics a s good as buried the industry.
                       ( a pause for emphasis)
               O u r graves are being dug as we speak,
               g e n t l e m e n . Every passing second, they
               g e t deeper. If we're going to survive,
               w e have to act swiftly and decisively.

                               DR. SANGER
               A l r i g h t . What do you suggest?

S a n g e r dry swallows the pill. Ellen opens a contract folder.

                          CROWNE
               O u r security chief - I've been looking
               at his file. Ex-marine, served in South
               China - do we think he still has it in
               him?

                               DR. SANGER
                     ( r e a l i z i n g , suddenly harsh)
               A r e you insane?

The i r eyes deadlock. Crowne gives Merrick a sideways glance.

                           CROWNE
               ` You ever wondered why Henry takes
               those pills, Bernard? Why he doesn't
               avail himself of his own technology?

                         DR. SANGER
               An agnate could give me a new heart
               but to get it to function mentally...

                                CROWNE
               B u l l s h i t , Henry. Bullshit. You don't
               want to deal with reality. Only with
               concept. I may not have been there at
               the start but I heard the stories. You
               wanted in on every aspect of
               construction, from environmental
               design right down to the classical
               playlists. I t wasn't enough just to
               make it work, was it? No, you wanted
               your own little utopia.

                                                                       115.



                                    CROWNE (cont'd)
                     Swanning a r o u n d in your mountain
                     r e t r e a t like some self-appointed
                     d e i t y . But when it comes to getting

      S a n g e r crosses to the window, looking down onto the city.

                                DR. SANGER
                     You see that street down there...?
                     Running east from the stadium. My
                     father used to take me to church on
                     that street. An old Spanish church.

                                   CROWNE
                     What's your point?

                              DR. SANGER
                     I didn't know they'd torn it down.

177   INT . GUEST BEDROOM - KATHERINE'S HOUSE - EVENING

      A floral bedroom. Ester lies in bed, wheezing, semi-conscious.
      Katherine slips a pill between her lips and tips in some water.
      Lincoln stands watching. Katherine ushers him out of the room.

178   INT . KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

      The kitchen is arrayed with modern technology but softened with
      paintings and craftwork. A r t marginally overwhelming science.
      Katherine starts making some herb tea in the traditional manner.

                                 LINCOLN
                     What did you give her?

                                 KATHERINE
                     J u s t something to help her sleep. I
                     think she has a bronchial infection.
                     But I'm not sure I should give her an
                     antibiotic in case it effects the baby.

                               LINCOLN
                     S o you know about the baby...

      Katherine pauses, reality sinking its claws. She looks at him-

                                                                 116.



                            KATHERINE
               Is n ' t that why you came here?

                        LINCOLN
               I found your name in the listings. I
               wasn't sure. You don't look like her.

                           KATHERINE
               The y have a plan... For women like me.

                         LINCOLN
               S o you're the one who takes her baby.

Katherine winces at him. It's uttered so matter-of-factly. She
pauses, hanging her head, searching within herself.

                          KATHERINE
               You know when you're young? How you
               run around thinking you're immortal?

Lincoln ' s look says he has no idea. She seems not to notice.

                            KATHERINE
               The r e was a lodeway accident. I was...
               damaged. After that, I thought no man
               would ever want me. I was wrong. His
               name was John. He said he married me
               for my eyes. Ocean eyes, he called
               them. He always loved the ocean. Up
               there on the wall, that's John's boat.

O f f her gesture, Lincoln glances at the wall. A watercolor of a
yacht. Meaningless to him but Katherine gazes it at, fondly-

                            KATHERINE
               But I think there was always an unspoken
               regret between us. When we heard about
               the technology, it was like... forgive-
               n e s s , like a second chance. A child of
               our own, part of both of us. Sailing
               trips, fishing trips, so many plans...
                      ( a flat beat)
               J o h n got cancer a year ago. He died.

He r eyes mist, distant and bittersweet, talking to herself now.

                              KATHERINE
               I r o n i c . That the same technology could
               have saved his life. And now the baby
               is the only part of him I have left.
               And the boat. I still have the boat.

Lincoln looks discomfited. There's more to this than he thought.

                                                                     117.



179   INT. MOTEL ROOM - EVENING

      S c h e e r opens the door. Merrick stands at the threshold with an
      attache case. Scheer, seemingly unsurprised, brings him inside.

                              SCHEER
                     I told you we shouldn't have gone to
                     outside personnel. They were cowboys.

                               MERRICK
                     We had no choice, Karl. We had to keep
                     this away from The Institute.

                                  SCHEER
                     An d now?

      Merrick lowers in a chair, grim and leaden. He opens his attache
      and pulls out a contract folder. He hands it to Scheer.

                                   SCHEER
                     What's this?

                                 MERRICK
                     Your resignation papers. Maybe `early
                     retirement' would be more accurate...

      S c h e e r leans forward, frowning, curious.

                                MERRICK
                     T e n platinum bounty - if you sign the
                     papers, their loss becomes your gain.

                              SCHEER
                     A parachute... So there's a jump?

                                MERRICK
                     You understand that whatever happens,
                     The Institute must be able to deny it.

      S c h e e r says nothing. Merrick reaches in the attache and pulls out
      a case. Inside are a row of ampules and a pressure syringe-gun.

                               MERRICK
                     We use a chemical to dispose of waste
                     product. It's called di-halcyonate. I t
                     reacts on a molecular level to start a
                     process of internal combustion. The
                     subject is incinerated from the inside
                     out. In post-mortem application it's
                     done its job before rigor mortis. In a
                     live subject, well... you can imagine.

                                                                     118.



                                SCHEER
                     You want to dispose of your products.

                                 MERRICK
                     I t ' s a little more complicated than
                     that. We have to be very... thorough.
                     If you still have it in you, that is.

      S c h e e r gives him a sideways look. Then displays the USMC ring.

                                SCHEER
                     Why do you think I still wear this?

                              MERRICK
                     I don't know.

                               SCHEER
                     I was discharged from the marines for
                     insubordination. If you asked anyone
                     i n my unit, they'd call it heroism. I
                     disobeyed an order to fall back. I took
                     out a bunker complex single-handed.

                               MERRICK
                     S o you wear it is a badge of honor?

                                SCHEER
                     N o . It wasn't bravery. I wasn't afraid
                     of dying. I just didn't care. You see,
                     I suddenly realized I was just a sack
                     of flesh with a heartbeat. Life, death,
                     I just couldn't see the point anymore.

      Merrick allows a respectful pause, then-

                                   MERRICK
                     You'll find a vehicle parked outside.
                     It's unregistered, difficult to trace.
                     I take it we have an agreement...?

180   INT . KATHERINE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

      A slant of light falls across Ester, writhing in her sleep,
      rasping. Katherine and Lincoln peer in through the doorway,
      checking on her. Then Katherine quietly closes the door.

181   INT . KATHERINE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

      Lincoln paces around, feeling useless. Katherine considers him-

                                 KATHERINE
                     What do I call you?

                                                                 119.



                               LINCOLN
               Lincoln . My name's Lincoln.

                               KATHERINE
               Lincoln , I think she needs professional
               help. I think she needs to see a doctor.

                          LINCOLN
               N o . They'll find her. They'll take her.

                          KATHERINE
               N o t if I don't want them to.

                          LINCOLN
               You don't understand. They don't want
               people to know about her. Either of us.

                          KATHERINE
               The doctor I'm thinking of, he's an
               old friend. He look after John in
               t h e final stages. I trust him.

                           LINCOLN
               Why ? So you can take her baby?

                          KATHERINE
               N o . No, that's not what I want.
O f f Lincoln's blunt look, she sighs, lowering into a chair.

                               KATHERINE
               M a y b e I didn't realize she'd      be so...
                      ( c u t s off, a deep pause)
               M a y b e I just didn't want to.      Either
               way, I was wrong. I want you          to know
               that. I was wrong... And I'm          sorry.

A heavy lull. Lincoln hangs his head, remembering.

                           LINCOLN
               The y make you believe there's a place
               called The Island. Then they take you
               upstairs and put you to sleep. They
               cut you open. They take pieces of you.

Katherine looks at him, intuiting. She allows a pause, then-

                           KATHERINE
               E v e n if I had taken her baby, I swear
               to you, I'd never have... They give
               you a choice, you see, to extend the
               sponsorship after... after d e l i v e r y .

                                                                 120.



                                LINCOLN
                     N o . I saw a lot of us go to The Island.
                     But I never saw anyone come back.

                                KATHERINE
                     You mean... Even if I had extended the
                     sponsorship, they'd have... and kept
                     taking the money? But that's inhuman.

                                    LINCOLN
                          ( b e a t , a lost look)
                     Is it? I wouldn't know.

182   INT . UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - EVENING

      A sleek low vehicle known as a "straker" pulls down the ramp.

183   INT . APARTMENT BUILDING - EVENING

      The orbs on the doors eyeball Scheer, moving up the corridor. He
      stops at a doorway. Rings the bell. Tom Lincoln opens the door-

                                TOM
                     Yes?

                                SCHEER
                     I'm from the Sanger Institute.

                                 TOM
                     I've given you people enough of my
                     time already.

                                 SCHEER
                     I t ' s just a formality. I need to see
                     your sponsorship contract.

      T o m pauses then lets Scheer inside. He crosses to the wall safe,
      taps the keys. Then pulls out the contract folder. He offers it.

                               SCHEER
                     Is this the only copy?

                                TOM
                     Why would I make copies? Do you think
                     I want anyone else to know about this?

      S c h e e r accepts the folder. As Tom turns to close the safe, he
      sets it down. And grabs Tom from behind, by the scalp, pressing
      the syringe-gun into his jugular. A HISS. Tom clutches his throat
      like it's on fire. With a boiling gurgle, he staggers forward.
      Sweating, collapsing. Convulsing, belching steam. Then falling
      slack. His skin starts to smolder. Scheer pauses, then tosses
      t h e contract folder on top of him, leaving it to burn with him.

                                                                          121.



184   EXT. NEW GAZA HOSPITAL - PHOENIX - NIGHT

      E s t a b l i s h i n g . A clean facade of white steel and glass. A hatch-
      b a c k vehicle known as a "corsair" pulls down the parking ramp.

185   INT . UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - NEW GAZA HOSPITAL - NIGHT

      The corsair pulls up at the ER entrance, Lincoln at the wheel.
      Katherine gets out of the passenger side. A doctor is waiting -
      50's, caring face. His name is DR. ABRAMS. He looks curiously at
      the man at the wheel. Then greets Katherine with a hug -

                                        D R . ABRAMS
                      Katherine . . . It's good to see you. I
                      haven't seen you since John's funeral.

                                  KATHERINE
                      We l l I've been keeping busy. Trying
                      to. Thanks for coming down to meet me.

                                  D R . ABRAMS
                      Your call was a little cryptic. What
                      is it exactly that's wrong with you?

                                  KATHERINE
                      I t ' s not me... Not exactly.

      She opens the rear door of the corsair. Ester is lying on the
      back seat. Dr. Abrams frowns as he notices the resemblance.

186   EXT . THE RANCH HOUSE - SEDONA - NIGHT

      The straker p u l l s up into the port.

187   INT . THE STUDIO / MAIN HOUSE - SEDONA - NIGHT

      The shadow of Scheer moving outside the windows, looking for a
      point of entry. He inspects the studio door for alarms. Then
      elbows the glass. Reaching inside, turning the lock. He enters
      the studio, glancing at the sculptures. Moving through the home.

      S i l e n t l y , systematically, checking the rooms. He reaches the
      guest bedroom, looks around. Something catches his eye. Spots of
      blood of the linens. Eyes honing, he moves on into the kitchen.
      He discovers a holocom keypad on the counter. Taps some keys.
      The holoframe flashes "REDIALLING". The holoframe snows with
      static. Then a receptionist's face appears-

                                 R E C E P T I O N I S T (ON HOLOCOM)
                      N e w Gaza Hospital, how may I help you?

                                                                     122.



188   INT. WAITING ROOM - NEW GAZA HOSPITAL - NIGHT - LATER

      Lincoln stands waiting. There are chairs but he's too tense to
      sit. Katherine and Dr. Abrams now enter. Lincoln looks at them,
      expectantly. There's a pause. Then Dr. Abrams speaks-

                                 D R . ABRAMS
                     Your friend... she has pneumonia. At a
                     very advanced stage. Its progress has
                     been unchecked by her immune system.

                                LINCOLN
                     C a n you help her?

                                    D R . ABRAMS
                     We have two options... One is a super-
                     b i o t i c . But there's the risk her immune
                     system might bow out of the fight. The
                     other is a nodal transfusion. Katherine
                     has agreed to be the donor. But the new
                     antibodies may not conform fully. They
                     m a y decide to attack the baby...

                              LINCOLN
                     I don't understand any of this.

                               KATHERINE
                     He means that by trying to help her,
                     we could lose her. Or lose the baby.

                                D R . ABRAMS
                     Or , if we do nothing, both. Her immune
                     system is... remarkably unstable. If we
                     don't act, the infection will take over.

      Lincoln lowers into a chair. He feels a pain somewhere. He can't
      quite pin down where. Or what caused it. Or why it hurts so bad.

189   INT . HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
      Ester lies in bed, dozing, looking more relaxed. Her oxygen mask
      makes breathing easier. Lincoln enters and sits beside her. She
      stirs, meeting his eye with a faint smile. Lincoln returns it-

                                   LINCOLN
                     He l l o , stranger.

                                ESTER
                     You look tired, Lincoln.

                                 LINCOLN
                     Ester...

                                                                     123.



                                 ESTER
                     I t ' s okay. I know. Katherine told me.
      She sits up, lowering her mask. Her hand finding his.

                                ESTER
                     She told me a lot of things. About how
                     they used a tiny part of her to make me.
                     She said it wasn't so very different.

                                 LINCOLN
                     What do you mean?

                                      ESTER
                            ( t o u c h i n g her belly)
                     F r o m this... From having a baby.

      Lincoln nods. A pause. Ester continues, more troubled, wheezing-

                                ESTER
                     She told me how they use us... And I
                     keep thinking... about the others...
                     the ones we left behind, about how
                     they'll never know... how they'll...

      Ester ' s out of breath again, coughing. Lincoln helps her put the
      oxygen mask back over her mouth. Ester slumps back, relaxing.
      Off Lincoln's worried look, she smiles at him with her eyes-

                                ESTER
                     I'm going to be okay, Lincoln.

                               LINCOLN
                     I know.

      But even to his own ears, the affirmation sounds hollow.

190   INT . MEN'S ROOM - HOSPITAL - NIGHT

      The stream of water gushes into Lincoln's hands. He splashes his
      face. Then looks at himself in the mirror. He looks sallow from
      sleeplessness. The facial hair makes him look like a shadow of
      his former self. For an instant he tenses at a light blinking in
      the glass. Blue light. Like etherscreen. Then he sees it's just
      a humidifier on the far wall. Tension ebbing, he splashes some
      more water. When he looks up again, he sees his pupils are
      dilating. The sense of danger. His voice comes in a cold whisper-

                               LINCOLN
                     No...

                                                                        124.



191   INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

      Lincoln emerges from the restroom, scanning for the danger's
      source. Figures flash past in scrubs, white coats. Then he sees
      it. The figure emerging from the elevator. The face of Scheer...

192   INT . PREP ROOM - NIGHT

      A flurry of disturbance from the nurses as someone barges into
      the room. Dr. Abrams is prepping Katherine for the transfusion.
      Off the ruckus, he looks up. Lincoln comes up to them, urgently-

                               LINCOLN
                     We have to go. We have to get her out.

                                 KATHERINE
                     What are you talking about?

                                 LINCOLN
                     He's come for her. For us.

                                     D R . ABRAMS
                     What e v e r this is about, we can't move
                     her. She's already under sedation.

      Lincoln look to see Ester, asleep on the OR table beyond.

                                LINCOLN
                     How long before she wakes up?

                                D R . ABRAMS
                     The procedure takes three hours but...

                                   LINCOLN
                            ( t o Katherine, emphatic)
                     You'll take care of it, won't you? Take
                     her somewhere they can't find her...

      Katherine , understanding, simply nods. Lincoln takes a last look
      at Ester, then departs. Dr. Abrams, bemused, turns to Katherine-

                                       D R . ABRAMS
                     Katherine , what the hell's going on?

193   EXT . HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

      Lincoln moves up the corridor, purpose in his stride. His black
      gaze fixed on Scheer, making an inquiry at the nurse's station.
      Lincoln doesn't even break stride. He GRABS SCHEER FROM BEHIND--

      H U R L I N G HIM ACROSS THE NURSE STATION - INSTANT CONFUSION -
      NURSES RUNNING - PEOPLE SHOUTING - Lincoln takes off at a run--

                                                                      125.



      SCHEER RECOVERING - seeing his quarry through the confusion - no
      time for subtlety - he leaps over the nurse's station - pursuing-
      LINCOLN pauses at the emergency exit - checking to see his enemy
      is following - then pushing on through the doors into--

194   INT . STAIRWELL - NIGHT

      LINCOLN HAMMERS DOWN THE STEPS - an alarm sounding - shouting
      from beyond - FOOTFALLS BEHIND HIM - deeper into the gloom-

      S C H E E R VAULTING THE RAIL - shortcutting t h e flights of steps -
      catching sight of his quarry as he pushes through a door into--

195   INT . UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - NIGHT

      LINCOLN BURSTS OUT INTO THE PARKING LOT - flashes of light -
      vehicles pulling in and out - off across the parking docks -

      S C H E E R BURSTS OUT IN HIS WAKE - his quarry temporarily lost -
      now spotting him across the lot - leaping into a vehicle -
      LINCOLN FIRES UP THE CORSAIR - resistors droning - jamming the
      throttle - lurching out - NARROWLY MISSING ANOTHER VEHICLE -

      S C H E E R SPINNING ROUND as the corsair blurs past - it's heading
      for the exit ramp - he launches towards the straker -

196   EXT . EXIT RAMP - THE HOSPITAL - NIGHT

      T H E CORSAIR BURNS UP the parking ramp - SMASHING THE GATE ARM -
      plunging out into the street - bouncing across the lodestream -
      T H E STRAKER H U R T L E S UP close behind - into the snarl of traffic -
      steering expertly through - picking up the tail of the corsair -

197   EXT . STREETS OF PHOENIX - NIGHT

      T H E CORSAIR PLOUGHS UP THE STREET - TRAFFIC SWERVING out of its
      path - BUOYS CLANGING as it lurches from one lane to the next -

      LINCOLN JAMS THE THROTTLE - the resistors buzzing, growling with
      energy - he has one goal - draw his enemy away from Ester -

      S C H E E R COOLLY INTENT at the controls of the straker - keeping a
      certain distance - waiting for his quarry to make a mistake --

      A METRO PD OFFICER PULLS OUT - mounted on a hybrid of motorbike
      and jetski k n o w n as a "lode-runner" - SOUNDING THE SIREN--

      S C H E E R REACTING - the PD lode-runner pulling ahead of him - he
      can't allow a police intervention - he slips in behind --

                                                                             126.



      THE METRO PD OFFICER - darting looks back - headlamps b l i n d i n g
      his rear-view - another vehicle is coming up behind him fast -
      - C L A N G - THE STRAKER I M P A C T S - glancing the PD lode-runner which
      wobbles, corrects - the straker d r o p s back for a longer run up--

      T H E METRO PD OFFICER - yelling into his headset - inaudible over
      the siren - the headlamps a g a i n - the vehicle coming up behind--
      - C R A S H - THE PD LODE-RUNNER fishtails - its resistors suddenly
      clash with the prevailing polarity - A HUGE JOLT OF INERTIA-

      C A T A P U L T I N G THE METRO PD OFFICER through the air - plummeting
      down into obscurity - THE STRAKER W H O O S H I N G OVER HIS HEAD -
      T H E PD LODE-RUNNER LEFT SPINNING behind - resistors vying with
      the polarity - the drive system melting down - FUSING, SPARKING--

      - B O O M - THE PD LODE-RUNNER EXPLODES IN A FLASH OF ELECTRICAL FIRE-

      S C H E E R watches the fireball in his rear-view - there will be more
      police soon - he jams the throttle - he has to end this.

      LINCOLN SEEING THE STRAKER Z O O M I N G UP BEHIND - veering round
      another corner - the chassis tilting - A STEEP BANKING TURN -

      T H E CORSAIR HULL RUNNERS THUDDING across the buffers - recoil
      sending the chassis up against the concrete - SPARKS FLYING--

      S C H E E R TURNING THE CORNER - the windshield suddenly sprayed with
      sparks - jerking back on the throttle to avoid a collision -

      LINCOLN FIGHTING TO CORRECT THE STEERING - seeing the straker
      d r o p p i n g back - a chance to gain distance - JAMMING THE THROTTLE-

      A N INTERSECTION APPROACHING - Lincoln can't correct his steering
      in time - the corsair careens at full res over the intersection--

      C R A S H I N G THROUGH A GATE ARM - the ground dropping away into a
      steep ramp - suddenly the corsair is flying through the air--

      C R A S H I N G - SQUEALING ONWARDS - SCUDDING ACROSS VEHICLE ROOFS,
      finally nose-diving into an empty bay with a DEAFENING CRUNCH-

198   EXT . ENTRANCE - HOLSPAR STADIUM - NIGHT

      The straker p u l l s up at the smashed gate arm. In the booth, a
      holoserve p a r k i n g attendant greets the arrival with a smile-

                                     P A R K I N G ATTENDANT
                      We l c o m e to Holspar S t a d i u m , home of the
                      Phoenix Admirals, parking is fifteen
                      currency units...

                                                                          127.



      Scheer gets out of the straker. He looks down at the crashsite
      b e l o w . The parking lot, like a marina, is filled to capacity. A
      game is in progress. A corona of light coming from the stadium.
      Hoots, music, the roaring crowd. Over which, sirens can now be
      heard. Scheer draws the syringe-gun and heads down the ramp.

199   EXT . PARKING LOT - HOLSPAR STADIUM - NIGHT - MINUTES LATER

      D u s t blooms from the crashsite. S c h e e r crouches, peering down at
      the wrecked corsair. The burst windshield, the dangling driver
      side door shows his quarry has escaped the wreckage. He rises
      and scans around. On the concrete, a trail of blood is visible.

200   INT . STORAGE AREA - HOLSPAR STADIUM - MINUTES LATER

      The blood trail leads down a gloomy stairwell. The game is just
      audible overhead. Lincoln stumbles down the steps, clutching his
      bleeding arm. Between pain and concussion, he loses his footing
      and falls. He tumbles down the remaining steps to the bottom.

      I n the gloom we   see groundskeeping e q u i p m e n t , supplies - edgers,
      aerators, spray    rigs, drums of insecticides, herbicides. For a
      moment, Lincoln    lies stunned. Then hears a noise and rolls over.
      He looks up the    stairwell. A shadow is descending towards him.

      W i t h painful effort, Lincoln starts crawling across the floor,
      eyes fixed on the shadow. Tensing as A HANDGUN noses out of the
      darkness. Then A STADIUM SECURITY GUARD steps into the light -

                                 S E C U R I T Y GUARD
                     You , what are you doing down here?

      N o w he sees Lincoln more closely - injured, his arm bleeding.

                                S E C U R I T Y GUARD
                     O h , Jesus... Are you okay, son?

      Lincoln eases a little as he sees the security guard lower his
      weapon. Then suddenly the guard is JERKED BACK BY THE SCALP.
      A HISS. Now suddenly the guard jettisons the handgun, clutching
      his throat like it's on fire. With a boiling gurgle, he staggers
      forward. Streaming with sweat. Toppling across a herbicide drum.
      Convulsing, belching steam. Then suddenly his body falls slack.
      S c h e e r is at the foot of the steps, discarding the spent ampule
      from the syringe-gun. Now screwing a fresh ampule into place.

      Lincoln turns to him, realizing what he's just witnessed is a
      glimpse of his own fate. He pushes himself upright, bracing.
      S c h e e r looks at him. Clutching his bloody arm, barely able to
      stay upright, but still ready to fight for life. He half-smiles-

                                                                                 128.



                                  SCHEER
                       I'm jealous of you. You have a reason to
                       live. I can't say I've ever had that...

      Lincoln holds his gaze, looking deep in his eyes. Then, as if
      scared by what he sees there, starts inching away, glancing at--

      T H E GUARD'S BODY SMOLDERING - lowering, melting through the drum-
      S C H E E R MOVING FORWARD, the smile leaving his face. A mask of
      hollowness as he moves in on his quarry, the syringe-gun poised.

      LINCOLN STUMBLING - collapsing to his knees - hanging his head
      as if in surrender... then suddenly his hand flies up-
      - B O O M - A FLASH OF LIGHT as he fires THE HANDGUN - recovered from
      the ground - AN ENERGY PULSE impacting the wall, fizzling out--

      S C H E E R KEEPS COMING, syringe-gun ready, blank-faced, unflinching-

      T H E GUARD'S BODY CRACKLING INTO FLAME - the drum splitting open--
      - B O O M - ANOTHER FLASH - Lincoln fires again - clipping his enemy--

      S C H E E R KEEPS COMING, a charred wound in his shoulder, relentless-

      T H E GUARD'S BODY BURNING - sliding into the sands of herbicide -
      - B O O M - B O O M - B O O M - LINCOLN KEEPS FIRING - more hits than misses--

      S C H E E R KEEPS COMING, blank faced, his body PITTING WITH IMPACTS--

      A BLINDING FLARE OF LIGHT - THE HERBICIDE IGNITING - THE DRUM
      EXPLODING - STARTING A CHAIN REACTION - OTHER DRUMS IGNITING -
      EXPLODING - FIRE - SMOKE - ENGULFING ALL IN A BLAZING INFERNO...

                                                               D I S S O L V I N G TO:

201   INT . TOP OF STAIRWELL - NIGHT - MUCH LATER

      A cacophony of sirens can be heard outside. A thick grey smoke
      gulches up from the stairwell. Shadows are visible. The sound of
      extinguishers. A FIREMAN climbs up, emerging from the smoke, he
      pulls off his breathing mask to address a waiting PD officer-

                                         T H E FIREMAN
                       N o t h i n g . . . If there was anyone down
                       there, they're a pile of ashes now.

                                                               F A D E TO BLACK.

                                                                         129.



202   EXT. CEMETERY - SOME DAYS LATER

      P e a c e . Sunlight. A bell tolling in the background. We make out
      Katherine, dressed in black, standing at a grave. The headstone
      reads simply: "Here Lies Ester & Her Unborn Son - May They Rest
      In Peace". There are no dates. Katherine lays down some flowers
      then looks across at Dr. Abrams. As he escorts her away, we see
      Crowne crossing towards them. She introduces herself delicately-

                                CROWNE
                    M r s . Ester? My name is Ellen Crowne.

203   INT . CEO'S OFFICE - THE SANGER INDUSTRIES TOWER - DAY

      A celestial penthouse office. Katherine enters with Crowne.
      Merrick and Dr. Sanger rise to greet her. Strained solemnity.

                              DR. SANGER
                    M y name is Henry Sanger. I'd like to
                    offer my deepest condolences.

      His insincerity is transparent. Katherine just nods stiffly.

                                DR. SANGER
                    This is Bernard Merrick our facility
                    director. He knew Ester personally.

                               MERRICK
                    An d it's a terrible loss.

      M o r e insincerity. Katherine nods again. Then settles in a chair.
      Crowne allows a respectful pause. Then begins with due delicacy-

                                    CROWNE
                    L e g a l issues must seem trivial at this
                    time. But the sponsorship agreement has
                    certain conditions relating to confident-
                    i a l i t y . D e s p i t e this tragic t u r n of
                    events, those conditions remain binding.
                    We want to be sure you understand that.

                               KATHERINE
                    I see.

                                CROWNE
                    T h a t said, The Institute is likewise
                    bound by the terms of sponsorship and
                    while we reserve every right...

                               KATHERINE
                    You can stop there. I know why I'm
                    here. You wanted to know if I'm going
                    to sue you for breach of contract.

                                                             130.



                             DR. SANGER
              N o t h i n g so devious, Mrs. Ester. We
              simply wanted to find some way to
              heal the wounds from this incident.

                       KATHERINE
              I don't want restitution, Dr. Sanger.
              The reason I agreed to this meeting
              was to have the chance to talk to you.

                        DR. SANGER
              O f course. Please...

                         KATHERINE
              I never got to meet you when I visited
              The Institute. It was one of your sales-
              m e n who led the tour. I remember how
              h e described the agnates a s if they
              were some kind of mindless organisms.
              More like livestock than humanity...

                              CROWNE
              L e g a l l y , human rights don't apply.

                           DR. SANGER
              Don't interrupt, Ellen.

                       KATHERINE
              I remember how eager I was to believe
              him. But when I saw w h a t I'd created,
              in flesh and blood, when I touched h e r ,
              it was I who felt less than human.

                       DR. SANGER
              I understand.

He looks at her expressively. Perhaps he really does understand.

                               KATHERINE
              Ester ' s life was my responsibility and
              her death is my cross to bear alone. So
              I'm not going to sue you, Dr. Sanger...
                     ( b e a t , a sudden ominous tone)
              But I am going to blame y o u . Until the
              day I die, I will silently curse your
              name. That's w h a t I wanted you to know.

She drives it home with a horrible look. Sanger accepts it with
due gravity. There's an ugly pause. Katherine gets to her feet.

                         KATHERINE
              An d now I'd like to leave, please.

                                                                          131.



                               CROWNE
                     We do have other issues to discuss...

                                DR. SANGER
                     N o , Ellen, that's enough. I think Mrs.
                     Ester has said all there is to say.

      Katherine descends the steps from the entrance. She crosses to a
      black funeral sedan, parked kerbside. D r . Abrams stands waiting-

                              D R . ABRAMS
                     I hope you know what you're doing.

                              KATHERINE
                     I don't think they suspected anything.

                                 D R . ABRAMS
                     J u s t understand that I've put a lot on
                     the line for you, Katherine.

                              KATHERINE
                     I know... But it felt good. It felt
                     like something John would have done.

205   INT . ROOFTOP FLIGHTPAD - THE SANGER INDUSTRIES TOWER

      C r o w n e escorts Sanger and Merrick to the waiting whisper.

                                  CROWNE
                     We l l , I don't know about the two of
                     you but I'd say we got off lightly.

                                 DR. SANGER
                     Did we?

                                  CROWNE
                     Don't start getting maudlin, Henry.
                     It's a little too late in the game.

      She shakes their hands as they climb into the whisper. Then
      watches it take off, ascending into the blinding sunlight.

                                                            D I S S O L V E TO:
206   EXT . THE SANGER INSTITUTE - SOME WEEKS LATER

      A i r blasts up from the giant funnel. Widening, we re-establish
      the huge ring, the processing plant, the giant appendages of
      ducting, the immutable red rocks. The shot sequence, reprising.
      From the processing plant, over the main complex. From the front
      of the complex, to the dock.

                                                                           132.



      Following the lodeway out to the perimeter wall. The gateway now
      gliding open to disclose a view of the shimmering desert. Out in
      the distance, the institute liner emerging from the shimmer. The
      crosshatch insignia.

207   INT . ENTRANCE HALL - THE SANGER INSTITUTE - DAY

      T h r o u g h the polarized glass we see the liner has docked. A TOUR
      GROUP is disembarking. Another parade of plutocracy, aging
      bloated me and brittle young women. They filter inside to be
      greeted by the courtesy staff, led by the ever-perky LYDIA.

                                     LYDIA
                     L a d i e s and gentlemen, my name is Lydia
                     and on behalf of our staff, I'd like
                     t o welcome you to The Sanger Institute.
                     Before we start the tour, we'll be serv-
                     i n g r e f r e s h m e n t s in the visitor center
                     and circulating our standard discretion
                     agreements. I should add that today you
                     are all very lucky because our CEO and
                     founder, Dr. Henry Sanger, is with us
                     and will be leading the tour personally.

208   INT . VISITOR CENTER - THE SANGER INSTITUTE - DAY

      The tour group pick and mingle at a buffet. We isolate a
      casually dressed man, lightly bearded, in a Phoenix Admirals
      cap, crossing to Lydia. She turns to greet him with a smile-

                                   LYDIA
                     Yes . . . Mr. Thomas, isn't it?
      The man tilts up to reveal his face. We see he is LINCOLN...

                              LINCOLN
                     I can't find my sunglasses. I think I
                     left them on the shuttle.

                                 LYDIA
                     We l l we're about to start the tour.
                     But I can have someone check for you.

                                  LINCOLN
                     Don't worry. I'll catch up.

209   EXT . PROCESSING PLANT - DAY

      Lincoln moves quickly along the wall towards the back of the
      complex. Hugging the shadows, scanning for onlookers. There is
      the processing plant and there, the ring of funnels. The sight
      brings a sudden rush of memories, painful memories, horrors.

                                                                        133.



      Lincoln steels himself, then breaks from shadow and races for
      the nearest funnel. He makes a running lap. His fingers grab
      t h e lip of the funnel and he pulls himself up. Reaching the lip,
      he finds the funnel mouth has been gridded o v e r . Then he hears-

                                  A VOICE (O.S.)
                      S i r , this is a restricted area...

      Lincoln lowers back to the ground. He finds himself facing A
      TECHNICIAN in a hardhat. His uniform reads "Air Processing".

210   INT . ELEVATOR - PROCESSING PLANT

      The doors slide open and the technician enters, stiffly. Then
      suddenly topples forward, pistol whipped from behind. Lincoln
      enters the elevator, a familiar handgun clenched in his fist.

211   INT . ELEVATOR SHAFT

      L o o k i n g up an elevator shaft. The red pulse of the lode-poles,
      rippling downward as the elevator descends from the surface.

212   INT . ELEVATOR - DESCENDING

      Lincoln is now wearing the technician's uniform. He watches the
      panel lights flashing down. "Level 3: Harvest" "Level 5: Labor
      Decon", "Level 7: Labor Quarters". His pupils are dilating but
      his face is set with determination. He knows what he must do.
      His gaze drifts down to "Level Twenty: Agnate Containment".

213   INT . THE ETHER GRID

      The holographic rendering of containment spins in the vaulted
      chamber like a giant geometrical phantom. The ether blinks with
      blue dots in their hundreds as the agnates g o about their day.

214   INT . ETHER CONTROL ROOM

      O v e r l o o k i n g the ether, Ethercon sits at his console. The hiss of
      an opening door as someone enters. Ethercon looks round. He
      greets the technician's arrival with an inquisitive look. Then
      the technician takes off his hardhat. A crosshatch on his brow.
      Ethercon reacts almost instantly, reaching for the console. Then
      instantly freezes as Lincoln presses the handgun to his skull.

215   INT . CORRIDOR - LEVEL TWENTY SEVEN

      P a l e blue light. Ethercon leads the way down a silent corridor.
      Lincoln follows him, the handgun firmly levelled on his head.

                                                                            134.



216   INT. CHAMBER - LEVEL TWENTY SEVEN

      The pale blue light sustains. The chamber is reminiscent of the
      foundation chambers. The walls lined with tanks. But instead of
      amber fluid, these contain blocks of ice. Beside each tank is a
      grid of bio-monitors. E t h e r c o n stumbles into frame, prodded by
      Lincoln. Then, with a trembling finger points to one of the
      tanks. Lincoln holds aim on him and considers the glass facet.
      He wipes the condensation off the glass. Suspended in the block
      of ice is a shadow. A human figure. A device is attached to his
      stomach. Lincoln looks at the bio-monitors. A screen reads:

      " P R O D U C T ID: STARKWEATHER/ FOUNDATION: II/ GENERATION: DELTA".

      Lincoln looks across the EKG, the cardiograph, indications that
      Starkweather is still alive. Then he fixes on the RFI m o n i t o r . A
      resonant image of the brain. The shifting aura showing a level of
      consciousness. What thoughts must be going through that mind?
      The fate of the agnates s p a r e d from expiration. To be kept on
      i c e for future harvest. With a haggard look, Lincoln rests his
      hand on the glass where Starkweather hangs frozen. Connecting.

217   INT . SALES HALL - THE INSTITUTE - DAY

      An embryo in mutated effigy hangs suspended in the amber fluid.
      Dr. Sanger stands at the wall of display tanks, mid-way through
      his sales pitch. He delivers it now with noticeably less gusto-

                                       DR. SANGER
                     C a s e in point, the clone. Back in the
                     beginning, the mapping of the human
                     genome was declared a historic landmark-
                     to break the curse of heredity, to
                     correct congenital defect... genetic
                     engineering became the brave new world
                     of medical science. A bright future
                     that led to a dark age and much of...
                            ( a n abrupt pause, a frown)
                     . . . l e g i s l a t i o n we know today. But while
                     the clone laws may have narrowed the
                     field, science marches on. Only to...
                            ( a n o t h e r abrupt pause)
                     I'm sorry, I'm f...

      S u d d e n l y he clutches his arm, emitting a guttural gasp.

                                LYDIA
                     DR. SANGER?

      S a n g e r just looks at her. Then jolts from a spasm, clawing at
      his chest. His knees buckling, he topples against a display
      case. Pawing at the glass, he slides dreadfully to the ground.

                                                                        135.



                                 LYDIA
                     He's having a heart attack! A doctor!
                     Somebody get a doctor in here!

      The tour group keeps their distance, unsettled by the face of
      mortality. Sanger is now lying in contortion on the floor, his
      gaping eyes fixed on the display tank. The embryo in mutated
      effigy, rocking about in the amber fluid. The sight of this
      little human monster is one that will follow him to the grave.

218   INT . DIRECTOR'S OFFICE - CONTAINMENT

      The glass wall looks down on the avenue and the agnates m i l l i n g
      beneath. Merrick sits at his console. Business as usual. Off a
      buzz, he taps a button. The door opens and A CENSOR bursts in-

                                 CENSOR
                     S i r , I've been trying to contact you.
                     It's the ether... Something's wrong.

      Merrick taps another button and the glass wall frosts over. It
      pixellates o n t o an image of his own face. A recorded playback-

      I N T E R C U T T I N G : Agnates a t workstations watching on visors. In the

      We are still   in the apartment when the playback cuts out. The
      agnate looks    around as every piece of glass dissolves to trans-
      parency. The    mirror panels, the frosted walls, the window, which
      now shows no    view at all. Just the gleam of a holographic lens.

220   INT . DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

      Merrick looks down from the glass wall at the agnates m a s s e d in
      the avenue beneath. They are all looking directly up at him.

221   INT . ETHER CONTROL ROOM

      Alarms sounding. The ether grid blinking with red dots. Ethercon
      sitting frozen at the console, the handgun pressed to his head.
      Lincoln stands over him. His face cast in a chill of vengeance.

222   INT . RESIDENTIAL BLOCK - DAY

      A glass facade. A noise from within. A primal, guttural noise,
      building to a roar. Now warping as we drop to slow motion. The
      glass webbing, bursting open from within, the facade exploding
      in a GLITTERING SHOWER OF SHARDS...

                                                             S L O W FADE TO BLACK.

223   INT . BASEMENT - A YEAR LATER

      No windows. No clue of where we may be. A safehouse somewhere.
      The passage of time is marked on Lincoln's face, careworn, long
      hair, a full beard. He sits in front of a data tablet, his image
      recorded on its screen. His voice also seems older as he speaks-

                                                                   137.



                                    LINCOLN
                    I t ' s been a year since the breakout. A
                    year in hiding, waiting for things to
                    quiet down. I don't know how many made
                    i t out or how many who did, survived. I
                    know there are people called politicians
                    trying to say it never happened. That's
                    why I've kept this journal. To keep the
                    truth alive. Alive... I've learned what
                    that means but it still confuses me. In
                    functional terms, I've been alive for ten
                    years. In human terms, more than thirty.
                    Human... I'm not sure about that one
                    either. They say I'm not human because
                    I have no mother or father. I guess I
                    have more to learn. But one word I do
                    understand is hope. So maybe this
                    j o u r n a l will give hope - to those like
                    me, who may be out there. To know
                    t h e y ' r e not alone. My name is Lincoln
                    S i x - E c h o and this is my testament...

      He sits back, contemplating the screen with an air of closure.
      Then he stirs at a sound. At first just a gurgle. Then a moan.
      Becoming the sound of A BABY CRYING. Lincoln crosses to a cot.
      He lifts up a baby boy, 6 months old, bawling and squirming.

                              A WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Is he hungry again? I just fed him.

      Ester steps into the room, sleep-mussed, her beauty deepened by
      maternity. The baby reaches out for her. Lincoln hands him over-

                                   LINCOLN
                    Lincoln Junior, huh? It still doesn't
                    sound right. That name.

                                ESTER
                    I t ' s the name of his father.
      She lovingly kisses him. Lincoln smiles at her, then the baby,
      sweeping the hair from the forehead. Unscarred, blemishless.

                              LINCOLN
                    We should finish packing.

224   EXT . JETTY - THE PACIFIC COAST - DAWN

      A private jetty stretches out to a pile of supply canisters. A
      yacht is moored. We recognized it as John's boat. And we recognize
      Katherine, holding the baby as Lincoln and Ester finish loading.
      The last canister stowed, Lincoln comes up to her. He smiles at
      the sight of her with the baby. Then prompts her gently-

                                                                       138.



                                 LINCOLN
                     Time to go.
      Katherine hesitates, part of her unwilling to let the baby go.
      Then she plants a lingering kiss on his downy hair and lets
      Ester take him. Lincoln presents her with the data tablet-

                                   LINCOLN
                     You'll make sure this gets out?

                                 KATHERINE
                     Yes . There are people sympathetic to
                     the cause. I'm going to get it to them.

                                  LINCOLN
                     Thank you, Katherine. For everything.

      He smiles. Katherine points to a canister left on the dock.

                     Don't forget that. It has the
                     operating manuals for the boat.

                     I've been looking at them for months.

                                KATHERINE
                     But the maps, the charts...

                         ( b e a t ; a meaningful look)
                     I don't need them either.
      Katherine nods, understanding. Nothing more to say, she hugs him.
      Then turns to Ester with the baby. She folds them in a yearning,
      almost maternal embrace. Tears well in her eyes. Then the sorrow
      turns to laughter as the baby starts tugging at her gray hair.

225   EXT . THE PACIFIC - DAWN

      The sun rises in the east, casting the coastline in silhouette.
      The light glows across Lincoln's face, at the helm of the yacht,
      staring back to the shore. He looks at Ester sitting beside him,
      the baby swaddled in a blanket at her breast. Then he looks out
      to the west, to the soft reach of dawn and the boundless horizon
      of sea. There never was an island. But perhaps there will be...

               Forklifts RUMBLE. Workers WIPE FRAME. All the bustle and 
               cacophony of a major seaport.

               We FIND ourselves focusing on ONE LARGE CRATE. With the 
               GRINDING of gears, a crane lifts it off the dock and carries 
               it onto a ship.

               Through night-vision binoculars, CHARLIE CROKER, 28, watches 
               the mysterious crate. Charlie is young to run his own crew

               necklace. The saleswoman wraps it up as he dials a number on 
               his cell phone.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         Hi, sweetie.

               INT. STELLA'S CONDO - PHILADELPHIA - INTERCUT

               STELLA BRIDGER, 27, crushingly attractive, has just stepped 
               out of the shower, hair still wet, body wrapped in a towel.

                                     STELLA
                         Daddy. How are you?

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         I'm sending you something.

                                     STELLA
                         Really? Does it smell nice?

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         No. But it's sparkly.

                                     STELLA
                         Does it come with a receipt?

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         I'm having it sent to you from the 
                         store.

                                     STELLA
                              (toweling her hair)
                         Why not bring it by yourself? We 
                         could have dinner.

               He leaves the store and heads for the HOTEL ELEVATOR.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         Be a long trip. I'm in Genoa.

               She doesn't like the sound of that.

                                     STELLA
                         Let me guess. Checking out the 
                         birthplace of Christopher Columbus.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         Something like that.

                                     STELLA
                         With your parole officer's approval.

               He steps into the elevator. Rides up.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         I think I've paid my P.O. my last 
                         visit. I liked the guy, but we never 
                         really connected.

                                     STELLA
                         What are you into, Dad? Don't break 
                         my heart. You told me you were 
                         through.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         After this, I swear to you, I am.

                                     STELLA
                         You promised me. Daddy, don't do 
                         this.

               The elevator door opens, Bridger steps out and starts down 
               the hall.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         Everything's going to be fine. I've 
                         got to go now. I love you. Bye.

               He clicks off then uses his card key to step into the --

               INT. HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               He eyes Charlie, who looks pretty tense.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         Italians?

                         Not yet.

                                     STEVE
                         Don't worry, they'll come through. 
                         You can trust these guys.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         I trust everyone. It's the devil 
                         inside them that I don't trust.
                              (then, to Charlie)
                         Got a sec?

                                     CHARLIE

               They step inside, Charlie closing the door.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         How you feeling, boss?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Fine. I'm fine, fine.

               Bridger seems amused by that answer.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         You know what fine, stands for, don't 
                         you? Fucked-up, Insecure, Neurotic, 
                         and Emotional.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You've become quite the philosopher 
                         since you quit drinking.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         You don't like me sober?

                                     CHARLIE
                         No, I'm glad. Makes you a better 
                         thief.

               Bridger pulls out a fine cigar, still in its wrapper, hands 
               it to Charlie.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         For after the haul.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Hope I get to fire it up. If Steve's 
                         Italians are a no-show, it's three 
                         months prep down the shitter and 
                         I've dragged you out of retirement 
                         for nothing.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         This is kinda nice. You being the 
                         boss with all the worries, me just 
                         along for the ride.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Ain't you sweet...

               From the other side of the door, they HEAR --

               Charlie takes the binoculars from Steve. He SEES TWO ITALIAN 
               CUSTOMS INSPECTORS climbing onboard the ship.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Your Italians.

                                     STEVE
                         Yup. Dixie cups.

                         I toss 'em away if there's a problem 
                         down the road.

               In ITALIAN, the Inspectors quiz the NERVOUS CAPTAIN about 
               the mysterious crate.

               One Inspector takes a crowbar and yanks out several strips 
               of plywood, REVEALING unmarked cardboard boxes inside. The 
               other Inspector pulls out one of the boxes and tears it open.

               It is filled with tomatoes. He takes a bite out of one.

               Nods. Everything seems to be order. The Captain looks 
               relieved. The inspector closes the cardboard box but...

               Watch carefully now, because as he does this, he hits a power 
               button on a small HOMING DEVICE and stuffs it in with the 
               tomatoes...

               BENEATH THE WATER

               where we FIND Half-Ear, in scuba gear, applying Nitramon 
               explosive primer to the hull of the ship.

               INT. HUMVEE (MOVING) - NIGHT

               Plowing through thick brush that breaks out onto a secluded 
               beach. Handsome Rob is still behind the wheel but now Steve 
               is in the passenger seat. Lyle, in the back, is still on the 
               laptop, legs fidgeting like a drummer on meth. POP goes his 
               bubble gum.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Can you chill out back there? You'd 
                         make a hummingbird nervous.

               EXT. UNDERNEATH THE SHIP - NIGHT

               Half-Ear finishes up. Speaks into the headset inside his 
               gear.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         I'm done. Over.

                                     LYLE (V.O.)
                         Copy that. Enjoy the ride, cowboy.

               Half-Ear grabs onto the bottom rung of a ladder that is bolted 
               to the side of the ship as it launches off the dock and into 
               deeper water.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               TWO BRIGHT CIRCLES IN A SEA OF DARKNESS

               Coming closer... becoming clearer... It's Charlie and John 
               Bridger, in scuba gear, riding torpedo-shaped Dive Propulsion 
               Vehicles (DPVs) that pull them through the deep blue sea at 
               a good 5 m.p.h. Both DPVs drag equipment bags.

               A Global Satellite Positioning Device is mounted on the 
               handlebar of Charlie's DPV, being fed information via Lyle's 
               laptop. A circle pulsates on the monitor, a beacon to the 
               crate in the ship.

               EXT. UNDER THE BOAT - NIGHT

               Half-Ear still clings to the ladder. It's a wild ride.

               Through the headset inside his gear, he HEARS:

                                     LYLE (V.O.)
                         Get ready. 3. 2. 1. Drop.

               Half-Ear lets go of the ladder. The ship's propellers speed 
               by just above his head. WHOOSH.

               He removes a radio-controlled detonator. Hits the button.

               EXT. SHIP - ON THE CUT

               The hull of the boat EXPLODES.

               INT. SHIP'S HOLD

               A very neat hole on the bottom of the boat beneath the crate 
               is opened. Water RUSHES IN and the crate falls right through 
               the cavity, vanishing.

               UNDERWATER

               The huge, heavy crate drops down... down... hits the bottom.

               ON THE SHIP

               Chaos rules. She's taking on water fast. No way to save her. 
               The captain orders the dinghy lowered into the water.

               INT. HUMVEE - NIGHT

               Parked in the sand at the top of the bay. Steve looks out to 
               the bay through infrared binoculars.

               The ship is going down. The crew on the dingy head back to 
               the port, which is in the opposite direction of this beach.

               EXT. THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA - NIGHT

               The DPVs are now attached by a tether to an underwater lifting 
               bag that is used to move heavy loads through water.

               The crate is surrounded by our three diver-bandits.

               Using crowbars they pull apart the plywood. The cardboard 
               boxes of tomatoes dump out, tomatoes spilling everywhere.

               And now we see what was hidden between the boxes...

               A large safe.

               They move like clock-work. Half-Ear aims an underwater light 
               at the dial. Charlie drills a small hole near the dial.

               John peers inside a horoscope and lines up the three wheels 
               of the combination lock... until the door pops open.

               As they stare at what's inside, they speak into their 
               headsets, heard by all.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Sweet Jesus.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         "That for which all virtue is sold. 
                         And almost every vice -- gold."

               And now we see the contents of the safe: 160 glistening GOLD 
               BRICKS. Made in Singapore, they weigh 25 pounds and each one 
               is decorated with the face of an exotic Balinese girl. We're 
               talking thirty million dollars worth of gold.

               INT. HUMVEE (PARKED) - NIGHT

               They holler and high-five and it's just a great moment to be 
               alive. Steve takes another peek through his infrared 
               binoculars and sees --

               The last vestiges of the ship hang above the waterline, then 
               disappear.

               EXT. UNDERWATER - A LITTLE LATER

               The gold is now stacked and secured on the lifting bag.

               They attach an underwater parachute to the bag and hook a 
               hose from an air tank into press of a pressure release valves 
               which cause the parachute to INFLATE.

               Looking like a hot-air balloon underwater, the whole thing 
               floats up about fifteen feet. Half-Ear holds onto its side, 
               going along for the ride.

               Then Charlie and John Bridger speed off on the DPVs which 
               are tethered to the inflatable bag. As they glide through 
               the water towards the secluded beach, we...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. MOUNTAINOUS ROAD - FIRST LIGHT OF DAWN

               The Humvee climbs into the mountain ranges of the Alps.

               INT. HUMVEE (MOVING)

               The gold is in three crates in the cargo bay.

               Handsome Rob and Steve are still up front. The others are in 
               the back seats, the divers out of their scuba gear. They are 
               pouring champagne into paper cups; except for Bridger who 
               abstains. He holds up his empty cup.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         My name is John and I'm a very rich 
                         alcoholic. And I'm going to live my 
                         life one very rich day at a time.

                                     THE CREW
                         Alright, John!

               They laugh and pound their fists against the roof of the 
               Humvee. Charlie pulls out the cigar Bridger gave him. As 
               Bridger lights it for him --

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         You planned this one down to a t, 
                         kid. It's a gift. You saw the big 
                         picture, made contingencies, covered 
                         the angles...

               Hearing this, Steve looks a little jealous.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         Shit, you made thirty million dollars 
                         in gold drop out of sight without 
                         holding a gun. Who else could've 
                         pulled that off?

                                     CHARLIE
                         You could've. I had big shoes to 
                         fill.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         Fill the shoes but don't follow the 
                         footprints.

                                     CHARLIE
                         What're you talking about? You've 
                         lived the life.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         My life's been nothing but fake IDs, 
                         fake business cards and divorce 
                         papers. This is the only thing that's 
                         real.

               Bridger shows him a photograph of Stella that he keeps in 
               his wallet.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Stella's a beautiful girl.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         She's amazing. And I spent half her 
                         childhood in prison. This is a once 
                         in a lifetime haul, Charlie. Bring 
                         down the curtain after this one. 
                         Make a new life. Find someone amazing 
                         and be there for her.

               As the advice escapes Bridger's mouth --

               EXT. MOUNTAINOUS ROAD

               A Jeep thunders out of a hiding place in the trees and blocks 
               the road. The Humvee brakes to avoid running into it.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Shit.

               Click. That's the sound of a gun cocking as it's pressed 
               against Handsome Rob's temple.

                                     STEVE
                         Anyone acts stupid and his brains go 
                         on the windshield.

               They see the two Italian Inspectors jump out of the Jeep, AK-
               47s leveled at the crew. Steve has double-crossed them.

               ON THE CREW: shocked would be a good place to start.

                                     CHARLIE
                         What the hell do you think you're 
                         doing?

                                     STEVE
                         Sorry Charlie. But I want the box of 
                         Cracker Jack all to myself.

               The Italians pull the crates of gold out of the back of the 
               Humvee.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You're not thinking this through. 
                         It's a stupid move.

                                     STEVE
                         Think so? Well you're the brilliant 
                         one. The Master Planner. Isn't that 
                         so, John?

               Steve climbs out of the Humvee, gun still on Handsome Rob, 
               the AK-47s aimed at the others.

                                     STEVE
                         You bet on the wrong horse.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         We'll hunt you down. You're gonna 
                         regret this.

               EXT. HUMVEE

               Safely outside, Steve turns his gun on Bridger.

                                     STEVE
                         No regrets, Dixie cup.

               BOOM. He shoots Bridger in the head. Just like that.

               The Italians follow suit, AK-47s SCREAMING out bursts of 
               full automatic fire at the crew.

               INT. HUMVEE

               They duck for cover as the vehicle is riddled with gunfire.

               Glass shatters. Bullets ricochet. They're in the epicenter 
               of hell.

               Handsome Rob jerks the steering wheel and stomps the gas.

               Driving blind.

               EXT. MOUNTAINOUS ROAD

               The Humvee hits the side of the Jeep, grinds alongside it, 
               metal tearing against metal.

               The Humvee's right side tires precariously hover by the cliff 
               and the raging water below.

               The gunners keep FIRING. Bullets rip into the Humvee's tires.

               EXT. HUMVEE

               It almost escapes, but it can't make it on shredded rubber.

               It careens off the road and --

               SERIES OF SHOTS

               The Humvee plummets through the air and plunges into the 
               raging river.

               INT. HUMVEE

               Water cascades in through the open windows. They're thrown 
               around as the Humvee rides the rapids. WHAM. The passenger 
               door caves in as the Humvee rams into a large rock then is 
               swept further downstream. Through the foam and spray, Charlie 
               looks over to Bridger. He's dead. The torrent ROARS.

               Only their chests and heads are above water. And that's not 
               all. There's a WATERFALL AHEAD.

               EXT. WATERFALL

               The Humvee is palmed in its deadly embrace and hurled over.

               It cartwheels into the pool below, sending up a huge geyser 
               of water.

               It sinks out of sight.

               EXT. MOUNTAINOUS ROAD - SAME TIME

               The crates of gold are now inside the Italians' Jeep. Steve 
               climbs in, leaving the crew for dead.

               UNDERWATER - SAME TIME

               The Humvee strikes the surface bottom with an ominous thud.

               EXT. MOUNTAINOUS ROAD - DAWN

               The Jeep jerks to a stop. A door opens and the bodies of the 
               two Italians, shot dead, are dumped out into the mud.

               Steve is alone now. Just him and the millions in gold.

               INT. HUMVEE - SAME TIME

               The water entombs them. Blood from Bridger's fatal gunshot 
               mists the water red.

               They manage to get the door open. They start to swim out but 
               Charlie won't go without Bridger. He grabs his friend's body 
               and pulls it up with him.

               EXT. RIVER - SUNRISE

               They drag themselves ashore, Handsome Rob helping Charlie 
               pull Bridger's corpse. Charlie is shocked, tormented, grieved, 
               and angry beyond description. Against the rocky embankment, 
               he holds Bridger. Not wanting to ever let go.

                                     CHARLIE (V.O.)
                         If you would have told me that I 
                         would spend the next three years 
                         searching for Steve Bandell, I would 
                         have said that was nothing. Cause I 
                         would have spent a lifetime looking 
                         for that bastard if I had to.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. OFFICE - DAY

               SOMEONE'S POV. A top of the line safe. The only light in the 
               office is the beam of a penlight on the dial.

               GLOVED HANDS spin the dial, feeling for "contact points", 
               areas on the dial where a slight resistance can be felt -- 
               if you have the touch.

               NEW ANGLE. A woman holds the penlight in her teeth while 
               trying to crack the safe. It's Stella Bridger, now 30.

               SUPERIMPOSE:

                              Three Years Later Philadelphia

               She manipulates the dial. Click. She grabs the safe's lever 
               and swings the heavy steel door open, her face a mixture of 
               pride and relief. But before we see what's inside -- LIGHTS 
               TURN ON.

               TWO COPS lurk at the doorway.

                                     FIRST COP
                         You always work in the dark?

                                     STELLA
                         Buzz of the fluorescents throws me 
                         off. She's all yours.

               The cops come closer and only now do we realize that they're 
               on the same team.

                                     SECOND COP
                         Damn. Chris Perley couldn't crack 
                         it. Neither could Michael Hoyt.

                                     STELLA
                         Now you know who to call first.

                                     FIRST COP
                         You're expensive, Stella. Those guys 
                         cut us a break on subpoena jobs. 
                         Goodwill, community service...

                                     STELLA
                         Well I do it for the money. I'll 
                         send you the bill.

                                     SECOND COP
                         Don't you want to see what's inside?

                                     STELLA
                         I never look. Bye, guys.

               And as she walks off, they do look -- at her.

               EXT. STREET - DAY

               A car RISES INTO FRAME on a bustling street: a 1960 Mini 
               Cooper S., a worldwide motoring icon. Its shape crouches low 
               to the ground and its tiny 10-inch wheel-at-each-corner gives 
               it the legendary Mini look.

               If when you see its headlights and classic grille it doesn't 
               bring a smile to your face, then you've got no automobile 
               soul.

               INT. MINI (CRUISING) - DAY

               Stella takes on the road like someone who loves to be behind 
               the wheel of a car that claimed victory in the Monte Carlo 
               Rally three times. She passes a minivan, a breeze with the 
               Mini's quick, go-kart-like handling.

               She searches for a parking space on a street lined with SUVs.

               Sees a spot, it's not really a space, just a gap between two 
               gas guzzlers, there's no way any car could squeeze in.

               Brake. Shift. Hard turn. She parallel parks the Mini with 
               ease. She's right in front of --

               HER SHOP

               Antique keys and locks dominate the storefront window with 
               the name of the shop stenciled across the glass: BRIDGER 
               LOCK AND SAFE COMPANY. Stella hops out of the Mini. With a 
               poised walk she heads inside.

               INT. SHOP - DAY

               It is filled with old cast-iron safes she has rebuilt along 
               with some new models. Stella's RECEPTIONIST greets her.

                                     RECEPTIONIST
                         How long?

                                     STELLA
                         Four minutes, forty-three seconds.

               High-five.

                                     RECEPTIONIST
                         You're the man.

                                     STELLA
                         So what's on the line-up?

                                     RECEPTIONIST
                         2:00. Home safe in Fairmount Park. 
                         Owner died and the wife never knew 
                         the combination. And Todd Milliken 
                         called. He has a prototype combination 
                         lock he wants you to test out tomorrow 
                         morning. Says he added two false 
                         contact points on the tumbler.

                                     STELLA
                         Tell him if I don't have it opened 
                         in six minutes flat, breakfast is on 
                         me.

                                     RECEPTIONIST
                         And there's a Charlie Croker in your 
                         office. He said you two know each 
                         other.
                              (an aside)
                         And he looks pretty fine for a white 
                         boy.

               Without a response, Stella heads over to --

               HER OPEN OFFICE DOOR

               and sees him fiddling with her collection of safe doors that 
               line the shelves.

                                     STELLA
                         Charlie Croker.

               He turns around. Smiles. Charming.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Hi, Stella.

               She steps inside.

                                     STELLA
                         Refresh my memory. After you came to 
                         see me and told me what happened to 
                         my father, I told you I never wanted 
                         to see you again, didn't I?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Yeah. You did.

                                     STELLA
                         So I'm a little confused.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I found him.

               At first it seems that Charlie's words have no effect on 
               her, but then he notices that her hands are trembling.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I can tell you where he is.

                                     STELLA
                         I don't want to know.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Are you sure?

               She doesn't answer.

                                     CHARLIE
                         He's in Los Angeles.

               She doesn't respond. Doesn't ask him to go on, doesn't ask 
               him not to. So he goes on...

                                     CHARLIE
                         The gold bricks he stole from us 
                         were minted in Singapore and decorated 
                         with the face of a Balinese girl. 
                         I've had my tentacles out and got a 
                         call from a friend of mine and your 
                         father's, Philly Steak.

               Stella remembers him.

                                     STELLA
                         When I was little he would play poker 
                         at the house and drop quarters under 
                         the table for me to find.

                                     CHARLIE
                         He got word from an L.A. connection 
                         named Skinny Pete that a gold dealer 
                         has been buying bricks with the 
                         Balinese girl on them, three or four 
                         at a time.

                                     STELLA
                         You ever heard the expression, cut 
                         to the chase?

                                     CHARLIE
                         I tracked Steve down to an address 
                         in the Hollywood Hills. He's changed 
                         his last name to Frezelli. And get 
                         this: he had a Worthington 1000 
                         installed in the house before he 
                         even moved in. We both know that you 
                         don't install a Worthington 1000 
                         unless you have something precious 
                         to guard.

                                     STELLA
                         Precious or not, I don't deal with 
                         ill-gotten goods.

                                     CHARLIE
                         We boosted that gold from a terrorist 
                         group that was about to trade it for 
                         bio-weapons. Now that doesn't exactly 
                         make us Robin Hood, but maybe in our 
                         own little way we were doing a good 
                         deed. Problem is, no one in my crew 
                         can handle that safe. And I need 
                         someone I can trust.

                                     STELLA
                         And you think that's me? Haven't you 
                         heard that I work for the other side?

                                     CHARLIE
                         What I heard is that you have your 
                         father's touch. And he was the only 
                         safecracker I knew who could open a 
                         Worthington 1000.

                                     STELLA
                         I'm not a safecracker. I'm a 
                         professional safe and vault 
                         technician.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You're John Bridger's daughter. And 
                         this is our chance to set things 
                         right.

               That sets her off.

                                     STELLA
                         Our chance? Who do you think you are 
                         coming in here? Stealing the gold 
                         isn't going to bring my father back 
                         to life.

                                     CHARLIE
                         No, it won't.

                                     STELLA
                         Then get out.

               EXT. STREET  DAY

               Charlie comes out of her shop and starts down the sidewalk.

               Suddenly, Handsome Rob appears out of the crowd and is walking 
               next to him.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         How'd it go with the chick?

                                     CHARLIE
                         I'm working on it.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         I don't want her on the crew, Charlie.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Gotta have her. Important piece of 
                         the puzzle.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         There has to be someone else. What 
                         about Bill Huchins?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Doing ten long at Levinworth.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Red O'Reilly?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Chemo.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Martin Hernandez?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Found Jesus.

               Handsome Rob stops Charlie.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         I don't want a civilian to screw 
                         this up.

                                     CHARLIE
                         She has the skill. And the motivation.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Exactly. She's emotional. You know 
                         what happens when emotion gets into 
                         it.

                                     CHARLIE
                         It's emotional for all of us at this 
                         point. Don't kid yourself.

               INT. EXPENSIVE RESTAURANT/BAR - NIGHT

               RICHARD WORTH has his back to the bar. He's a blue blood 
               trial lawyer with an ego that has more horsepower than a 
               Ferrari.

                                     RICHARD
                         It's all in my patented sideways 
                         glance. Like this...

               He gives a sideways glance to Stella; it's their first date.

                                     RICHARD
                         I hit each woman on the jury with 
                         one of these. We make contact. And I 
                         know exactly what they're doing. 
                         Undressing me with their eyes.

                                     STELLA
                         I see...

               What a nightmare. Someone bumps into Stella, a mumbled, 
               "Excuse me." Nightmare continues...

                                     RICHARD
                         The case is all but won. That's why 
                         in jury selection I choose as many 
                         women as possible. Except lesbians, 
                         of course. I can tell in sixty seconds 
                         if they're a lesbian. Want to know 
                         how I know?

                                     STELLA
                         If they don't undress you with their 
                         eyes?

                                     RICHARD
                         Precisely. Like that waitress right 
                         there. See? She's looking at me right 
                         below my belt. Definitely not a 
                         lesbian.

               A waitress is indeed looking below Richard's belt. But Stella 
               notices that she was only looking because Richard's zipper 
               is all the way down. She smiles.

                                     STELLA
                         Your fly.

                                     RICHARD
                         I am fly. And I'm da bomb. Just wait 
                         until later tonight.

               Suddenly a BUSBOY stumbles and a tray of drinks fall, soaking 
               Richard's suit in red wine.

                                     BUSBOY
                         Oh, man. I'm sorry.

                                     RICHARD
                         You should be. Moron. What the hell's 
                         wrong with you?

                                     BUSBOY
                         It was an accident. I'm very sorry.

                                     RICHARD
                         Where's the manager? Richard Worth 
                         is not paying to have his suit 
                         cleaned. Damn.
                              (to Stella)
                         I'm going to... I don't believe this.

               He starts off to the bathroom and as soon as the space he 
               was occupying empties, Charlie fills it.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I think your date's going pretty 
                         well, what do you think?

               She shoots him a look that could reverse global warming.

                                     STELLA
                         What are you doing here?

                                     CHARLIE
                         What do you mean? I come here all 
                         the time.

                                     STELLA
                         I don't think so.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Sure. Lawyers, Judges, my kind of 
                         crowd. See that gentleman there, he 
                         sentenced me to 90 days in county 
                         once. We need to talk.

                                     STELLA
                         No, you need to listen. I want you 
                         to leave. Got it?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Hey, I paid valet parking prices to 
                         get in here, not to mention a twenty 
                         spot to the busboy to spill that 
                         drink on Mister Zipper.

                                     STELLA
                         You -- I don't believe this. You 
                         paid someone to spill that drink?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Actually, you paid for it.

               Charlie returns her wallet.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Didn't notice it was me who bumped 
                         into you earlier, did you? Anyway, I 
                         was hoping we could get to know each 
                         other a little better before we leave 
                         for Los Angeles. I already booked 
                         your flight.

                                     STELLA
                         You truly are a fatuous, odious man.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I have no idea what you just said, 
                         but I like the sound of it.

                                     STELLA
                         Well maybe you'll understand this. 
                         Hit the road, Jack --

                                     CHARLIE
                         Charlie --

                                     STELLA
                         Or you'll be sorry, Charlie, cause 
                         I'll kick you in the nuts so hard 
                         that your voice will be as high as 
                         my heels.

               She means it, too.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I'm beginning to worry about this 
                         whole relationship.

                                     STELLA
                         I'll let you in on a secret. You 
                         can't have a relationship with a 
                         pickpocket, gold robber, or any kind 
                         of thief.

               Charlie looks away, lets her have her point. This whole thing 
               is getting pretty heated so when he turns back to her, he 
               uses a whole new approach. His emotions are genuine.

                                     CHARLIE
                         John wasn't just a man I crewed up 
                         with, he was my friend, he was the 
                         closest thing to a father I ever 
                         had. I wish to God I could bring him 
                         back. But all I can do is go after 
                         this guy, the guy that killed him, 
                         and hit him where he lives.

               She feels the honesty in his words but before she can reply, 
               they're interrupted by --

                                     RICHARD
                         Everything alright, Stella?

               He's back, red wine splotched on his suit.

                                     STELLA
                         Fine. Richard. Charlie. Charlie was 
                         just saying goodbye.

               But for now, Charlie is just staring at Richard, boring into 
               to him...

                                     RICHARD
                         Can I help you with something?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Oh, sorry. I was just undressing you 
                         with my eyes.

               And with that, Charlie goes. Stella can't help but smile.

               EXT. STELLA'S CONDO - NIGHT

               She comes home, having shed her date.

               INT. STELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               She goes through a drawer and pulls out a package she hasn't 
               looked at for years. She opens it.

               Inside is the beautiful necklace that her father bought her 
               in Italy. It brings tears to her eyes.

               INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               He lies in bed, can't sleep. His phone rings. He picks up.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Hello.

               INT. STELLA'S BEDROOM - INTERCUT

               She's on the other end of the line.

                                     STELLA
                         I'm in this for one thing, Charlie, 
                         and one thing only. I want to see 
                         the look on his face when his gold 
                         is gone. He took my father from me, 
                         I'm taking this; it's the best I can 
                         do.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. STREETS - DAY

               Stella's Mini passes, weaves, tucks in between cars. She 
               drives like a madman.

               INT. MINI (SPEEDING)

               Charlie feels like he's inside a video game.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I see Drive Defensively is your motto.

                                     STELLA
                         Don't worry. Jack Daniels never let 
                         me down.

               She slaps the dashboard of her car.

                                     CHARLIE
                         By the way you drive, I'm not 
                         surprised you named your car after a 
                         bottle of whiskey. Left.

                                     STELLA
                         Jack Daniels was chief engineer of 
                         the Mini. And I drive it exactly the 
                         way it was meant to be driven.

               She whips down the avenue.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Another left.

               She hangs a left.

                                     STELLA
                         We're going in circles. Who's tailing 
                         you this week?

                                     CHARLIE
                         The possibilities are endless.

               EXT. STADIUM PARKING LOT - DAY

               The Mini parks in the middle of the huge, empty lot that 
               surrounds Veterans Field, home of the Philadelphia Phillies.

               INT. MINI

               She looks around...

                                     STELLA
                         Where are they?

                                     CHARLIE
                         We're a little early. I didn't expect 
                         us to get here quite that fast. 
                         There...

               A Vespa pulls into the lot, headed their way. It's Lyle.

               Charlie starts the introductions.

                                     CHARLIE
                         That's Lyle. Gearhead. He's who really 
                         invented Napster...

                                                              QUICK CUT TO:

               INT. DORM ROOM - NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY - 1999 - NIGHT

               Below a Metallica poster, Lyle has fallen asleep on his desk.

               His roommate, Napster creator SHAWN FANNING, recognizable in 
               his trademark baseball cap, sneaks a peek at Lyle's computer.

                                     CHARLIE (V.O.)
                         At least that's how Lyle tells it.

                                                               CUT BACK TO:

               INT. MINI - DAY

               And now they see a monster pick-up truck bouncing into the 
               lot, MUSIC THUMPING from its Alpine at ear-bleeding levels.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Half-Ear. Explosives. He lost fifty 
                         percent of his hearing in the fifth 
                         grade.

               INT. GRAMMAR SCHOOL BATHROOM - 1990 - DAY

               A 10 year old boy stands in front of a toilet in the stall.

               BOOM! Water geysers out of the bowl and soaks him.

                                     CHARLIE (V.O.)
                         One M-80 in the toilet bowl too many.

               Some kids in the bathroom saw the whole thing.

                                     KID
                         That was rad!

                                     HALF-EAR
                         Wha'?

                                                               CUT BACK TO:

               INT. MINI - DAY

               And now a RUMBLING in the distance. Stella looks. Sees a car 
               streaking their way, almost like a mirage in the heat waves 
               coming off the pavement. Closer. Faster. A classic Mustang. 
               Its engine rumbles like a jackhammer. It's had some serious 
               custom work done to it.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Handsome Rob. Premier wheel man. He 
                         once drove all the way to L.A. just 
                         so he could set the record for longest 
                         freeway chase.

                                                              QUICK CUT TO:

               EXT. L.A. FREEWAY - 1999 - DAY

               Handsome Rob's behind the wheel, flicks a cigarette butt out 
               his open window --

               We watch it hit the pavement, ashes spark, and then behind 
               the fallen butt we see that every lane of the 405 is filled 
               with cop cars in pursuit.

                                     CHARLIE (V.O.)
                         Smashed the mark by twelve minutes.

               We now see Handsome Rob through the lens of a TV news

                         And what about you?

                         I've been a thief since I had baby 
                         teeth.

               INT. GRAMMAR SCHOOL PLAYGROUND - DAY

               SEVEN YEAR OLD CHARLIE is shoved against a chain link fence 
               by a SIXTH GRADE BULLY.

                                     BULLY
                         Cough it up, Charlie!

               Charlie hands the bully a dollar bill. The bully puts it in 
               a wallet that is over-stuffed with cash and saunters off, 
               laughing it up with his bully pals. Charlie turns to his 2nd 
               grade classmate who sports a fresh black eye.

                                     CLASSMATE
                         So much for lunch.

                                     SEVEN YEAR OLD CHARLIE
                         You need a dollar?

                                     CLASSMATE
                         I thought he took your last one.

                                     SEVEN YEAR OLD CHARLIE
                         He did.

               Charlie holds up the over-stuffed wallet that he pickpocketed 
               from the bully.

                                     SEVEN YEAR OLD CHARLIE
                         But I got lots more now.

                                                               CUT BACK TO:

               EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

               Doors open simultaneously. Everyone out. The crew eyes Stella. 
               Charlie gets right down to business.

                                     CHARLIE
                         This is Stella. She's working with 
                         us on this one. IDs?

               Handsome Rob hands out fake driver's licenses.

                         I don't even have a cool nickname.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Enough of this sewing-circle shit. 
                         Phones.

               Half-Ear hands out new cell phone to everyone and takes their 
               old phones.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         Philly Steak says these are clean as 
                         a whistle. He also got us four dozen 
                         internal chips with different numbers. 
                         Change out the chips twice a day.

               As Charlie hands out airline tickets --

                         We travel to L.A. separately.

                                     LYLE
                         You still haven't told us the most 
                         important thing. What exactly is the 
                         job, Charlie? And who exactly is 
                         she?

               Lyle and Half-Ear have been kept in the dark until now.

                                     CHARLIE
                         This is Stella Bridger. And we're 
                         finishing the job that we started in 
                         Italy.

               They're a little stunned at first.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         Holy shit. It's about time.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               MONTAGE - LAX - NIGHT

               The crew deplane from five different airplanes, different 
               air carriers.

               They disperse in separate vehicles. See Charlie at Avis, 
               renting a car.

               See Handsome Rob renting a U-Haul panel truck.

               See Stella on a hotel shuttle bus.

               See Half-Ear on the underground Metro Rail, taking the Red 
               Line.

               See Lyle in a taxi, headed south on Figueroa Street. He 
               notices a YOUNG WOMAN HITCHHIKING. For a moment, their eyes 
               connect. She is a beautiful waif and the feeling sweeps 
               through Lyle: if only... But the taxi passes by.

               Charlie checks into Shutters, with its Victorian beach house 
               feel and oceanfront view.

               Stella's at the Peninsula in Beverly Hills with its opulent 
               lobby.

               Handsome Rob's at the Standard, with its kitschy decor and 
               ironic style. He stares at a huge empty aquarium behind the 
               front desk where a performance artist writhes and a DJ spins 
               out rhythmic throbs. Very L.A.

               Half-Ear's at the new Renaissance Hollywood Hotel adjacent 
               to the dramatic Babylon Gate and the Kodak Theatre.

               And Lyle's at the Downtown Bonaventure, riding up the glass 
               elevator. Perfect gearhead hotel.

               EXT. SHUTTERS HOTEL - BALCONY - SUNSET

               The five of them sit in chairs on the balcony of his hotel 
               room. There's a sweeping view of the Pacific.

                                     CHARLIE
                         We need an in to get a video blueprint 
                         of the interior. We're not going 
                         into this place blind. Half-Ear, you 
                         take the first surveillance shift. 
                         Who goes in, who goes out, levels of

                         You got it.

                         central office remote observance 
                         monitoring system and fool it into 
                         thinking there's a legal tap on the 
                         line. Reroute the digital copies of

                         I'll burn through the night, have it 
                         up and running before morning.

                              (to Handsome Rob)
                         We need to know how long to get from 
                         the house to Union Station downtown.

                         No problemo.

                         Stella. How much time will you need 
                         with the safe?

                                     STELLA
                         I'll have it open in five minutes 
                         flat.

                         It's not the same as opening a safe 
                         for the cops. Your heart will be 
                         pounding in your ears. Perspiration 
                         on your fingertips. It's a whole 
                         different ball game.

                                     STELLA
                         You get me to the safe, I'll open 
                         it.

               Out over the ocean, the sun is in its death throes, bruising 
               the sky a coiling purple and orange.

               EXT. STEVE'S HOUSE - MORNING

               Nestled at the end of a cul-de-sac on Oporto Drive in the 
               Hollywood Hills. Chrome. Glass. Carved wood.

               EXT. MARAVILLA DRIVE - MORNING

               The U-Haul panel truck is parked on the side of the road 
               that overlooks Oporto Drive and Steve's house.

               INT. U-HAUL - MORNING

               It's been converted into their surveillance vehicle, the 
               back outfitted with monitors and surveillance equipment.

               Half-Ear peers through binoculars and says his notes into a 
               micro-cassette recorder. His binoculars focus in on the fence 
               that surrounds the perimeter of the property.

                                     HALF-EAR

                         We've got an anti-scaling fence. 
                         Hardened, electroplated steel. Hacksaw 
                         won't work. We'll need Nitramon.

               The binoculars SWISH PAN TO a guard booth where a guard keeps 
               an eye on the gate.

                         Armed guard. 9MM semi-automatic in 
                         the holster. Security booth is 
                         accessible and ideal for a triple 
                         charger chemical grenade.

               The binoculars SWISH PAN TO four Rottweilers prowling the 
               grounds.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         Shit. Dogs. Why do black men hate 
                         dogs? I'll tell you why, Charlie. 
                         Because dogs are racist. That's a 
                         natural fact. Someone else deal with 
                         'em.

               EXT. 101 FREEWAY - DAY

               A sea of cars, gridlock in L.A. Crammed in the middle of the 
               traffic meltdown is Handsome Rob's rental car.

               INT. RENTAL CAR (CRAWLING)

               Timing out the getaway route. He's got a Thomas Guide on the 
               passenger seat and a stopwatch ticking away but he's going 
               nowhere fast. He futilely leans on the car horn.

               INT. U-HAUL - DAY

               Lyle's surveillance shift. He takes digital photos with a 
               telephoto camera. ZOOMS IN on a security pad on the front 
               door.

                         fire, and environmental hazards. 
                         Best way around it is to get a back 
                         door password, trip the alarm during 
                         the heist, then call it in as a false 
                         alarm.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. STEVE'S HOUSE - OFFICE - DAY

               A HAND turns the dial to a Worthington 1000 vault. The vault 
               opens and voila: stacks and stacks of gold bricks.

               EXT. STEVE'S HOUSE -DAY

               The same hand clutches a very heavy duffle bag. OUR VIEW 
               BOOMS UP to see Steve, three years older than when we last 
               saw him, his beard shaved away.

               INT. U-HAUL - SAME TIME

               Through his digital camera lens, Lyle watches Steve walk 
               towards his car: a Ferrari 550 Barchetta Pininfarina. It's 
               the first time he's seen Steve in three years.

                                     LYLE

                         15:25. There he is. He's gained 15 
                         to 20 pounds living off our money. 
                         And Handsome Rob, you're going to be 
                         pissed when you see his wheels.

               Lyle watches the security guard hit a switch in the guard 
               booth. The gate rises like the blade of a guillotine in 
               reverse. The Ferrari zooms away.

               EXT. FIGUEROA STREET - DAY

               Another route. Handsome Rob's rental car is in the left turn 
               lane waiting for the light to change.

               INT. RENTAL CAR

               The light finally is a green arrow but the lady in front of 
               Handsome Rob is so preoccupied with applying her make-up 
               that she doesn't go until he honks but by then it's too late 
               as she makes it through the light but he doesn't.

               He checks his stopwatch. Simmers.

               EXT. PENINSULA HOTEL - POOLS SIDE - DAY

               In a bikini, Stella lies on a lounge chair under a cabana, 
               reading a copy of Vogue magazine.

               But as we take a closer look, we see that she's really reading 
               the owner's manual for the Worthington 1000 safe which she's 
               inserted in the fold of Vogue.

               INT. U-HAUL - DAY

               Charlie's shift. He sees a Latina housekeeper get into her 
               car.

                              recorder)
                         Housekeeper leaves at 17:30.

               EXT. COIN & BULLION STORE - EVENING

               Steve bangs a fist against the steel security door that covers 
               the closed store. The steel door rises up and a Ukrainian 
               named YEVHEN unlocks another door. He is the gold dealer 
               that Philly Steak told Charlie about.

                                     YEVHEN
                         You're right on time.

               INT. COIN & BULLION STORE - EVENING

               Yevhen is 50 and like many in the gold trade, there isn't a 
               conspiracy theory that he doesn't embrace. As they make their 
               way to a back room, he keeps his mouth in overdrive --

                                     YEVHEN
                         All those poor bastards out there 
                         putting their life savings in banks 
                         and S&Ls and mutual funds. What do 
                         they think -- that when the collapse 
                         comes they can depend on the 
                         government? I don't think so.

               Steve motions to a security camera that looms down on them.

                                     STEVE
                         Is the camera off?

                                     YEVHEN
                         Of course. Just like you said. I 
                         never tape you, you can see for 
                         yourself.

               Steve sees the red light is off. He lays the duffel bag on a 
               table, unzips it, pulls out three 25 pound gold bricks with 
               the face of a Balinese Girl stamped on each one. As Yevhen 
               inspects them --

                                     YEVHEN
                         Governments are nothing more than 
                         puppets on the strings of the 
                         Trilateral Commission with their 
                         twisted gods.

               Yevhen retrieves a briefcase, opens it, presenting Steve 
               with stacks of Ben Franklins: $100,000 worth. As Steve 
               inspects the cash --

                                     YEVHEN
                         I mean, it's so obvious that in a 
                         world where NAFTA can overturn the 
                         Supreme Court, not to mention 
                         Microsoft's nefarious financial 
                         machinations, this, is our only 
                         refuge; gold.

               Steve closes the briefcase.

                                     YEVHEN
                         Plus a little walking around money.

               EXT. 7TH STREET - NIGHT

               A fender bender in the middle of an intersection has traffic 
               backed up for miles.

               INT. RENTAL CAR

               Handsome Rob checks the latest time on the stopwatch.

               INT. U-HAUL - NIGHT

               Through night-vision binoculars Charlie sees a (different) 
               security guard open the gate as Steve returns.

               He watches Steve go inside his house. Through the windows, 
               he sees him use a remote to turn on a TV.

               EXT. 101 FREEWAY - THE NEXT DAY

               A freeway sign says: UNION STATION 1/2 MILE

               INT. RENTAL CAR

               HANDSOME ROB can see the exit up ahead, but traffic is so 
               backed up and going nowhere that it feels like it's a hundred 
               miles away. And it's not even rush hour. Just life in L.A.

               Idling on the freeway, he looks at the drivers in the cars 
               beside him. He sees a businesswoman reading the Wall Street 
               Journal. Sees a man with his finger deep, deep up his nose.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Where's a grenade launcher when you 
                         need one?

               EXT. YAMASHIRO RESTAURANT - DAY

               Our crew walks along the pathways of Japanese gardens that 
               wind along outside the restaurant. It's a breathtaking view 
               from high in the Hollywood Hills. Some tourists take in the 
               vista.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Doesn't matter what time it is. It's 
                         either bad traffic, peak traffic, or 
                         slit-your-wrists traffic.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         I'm sure it's ideal for carrying a 
                         ton of gold, genius.

                                     CHARLIE
                         What's your guesstimate?

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         If we had all green lights, fourteen 
                         minutes. But in the twenty times 
                         I've done it, the average is thirty-
                         two minutes, with a top time of fifty 
                         minutes.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Then we'll travel like Rockefeller.

               They don't know where Charlie is going with this, but they've 
               been around him long enough to know it's going somewhere.

                                     CHARLIE
                         When cars first started catching on, 
                         workers on tall ladders would use 
                         these swiveling colored boards for 
                         traffic signals. Now whenever 
                         Rockefeller would take the drive 
                         from his mansion to his office on 
                         Wall Street, the workers would make 
                         sure that he got green boards all 
                         the way.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         How do we get all green lights?

                         Let me see what I can do.

                         Did you know that the first traffic 
                         signal to be patented was invented 
                         by a black man named Garrett Morgan?

                         We still need an in to get the video 
                         blueprint.

                         We'll never get by the guard unless 
                         they're certain it's legit. I'm 
                         thinking cable TV. We cut his cable, 
                         he calls the cable company. We show 
                         up. Send a cable technician into the 
                         house with a pinhole video camera 
                         while we get a feed through an RF 
                         antenna.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Who plays cable technician? Steve 
                         thinks we're all dead.

               But Stella knows that's not exactly true. He doesn't think 
               Stella is dead; he doesn't know her at all.

                                     STELLA
                         If you're all dead, I guess I'm the 
                         man for the job.

                         In for a penny, in for a pound.

               EXT. ADELPHIA CABLE - PARKING LOT - EVENING

               Service trucks pull into the lot. Technicians are getting 
               out, finishing their shifts.

               INT. RENTAL CAR (PARKED NEARBY)

               Handsome Rob behind the wheel. Lyle shotgun, aiming his 
               digital camera at the exiting workers.

                                     LYLE
                         I'm telling you. He claims he named 
                         it Napster because his hair is so 
                         nappy underneath that cap of his. 
                         But I know the real reason. It's 
                         because I was NAPPING when he stole 
                         the idea from me. I should've been 
                         on the cover of Wired magazine.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Would you clam up. You'd give a 
                         woodpecker a headache.

                                     LYLE
                         I'm the Napster.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Okay. You're the Napster. Heads up: 
                         cable chick.

               They see a female service tech getting out of her work truck.

               Lyle zooms his camera lens in on her Adelphia Cable work 
               shirt. It has BECKY sewn in above her right breast.

                                     LYLE
                         Becky. Nice name. I wonder what she 
                         calls the other one.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         And it's such a mystery why you don't 
                         have a girlfriend.

                                     LYLE
                         I had a girlfriend. Unfortunately 
                         even though the relationship ceased 
                         in an objective reality, it's still 
                         going on in my mind.
                              (tapping his head)
                         That woman's lived in here rent-free 
                         for four years.

               Lyle takes a few more pictures of Becky.

                                     LYLE
                         Okay. All we need now is a work shirt 
                         like this one and a service truck 
                         like that one. You think Stella will 
                         be able to pull it off?

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         I have my doubts, but there's no 
                         talking to Charlie.

                                     LYLE
                         Maybe he's been inserting his hard 
                         drive into her software. Clouds the 
                         judgment.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         He knows better than to mix business 
                         with pleasure.
                              (getting out of the 
                              car)
                         Only I'm allowed to do that.

                                     LYLE
                         Where you going?

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         To get a work shirt and a service 
                         truck.

               Lyle watches him stroll over to Becky and strike up a 
               conversation in the parking lot. Lyle can't hear what's being 
               said, but Becky smiles, and lest we forget, his name is 
               Handsome Rob for a reason.

               INT. BECKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               OUR CAMERA FOLLOWS a trail of clothes, hastily littered, 
               that lead to the cable chick's bed. Lit candles are on the 
               bedside table. The couple is asleep under a tangle of sheets. 
               Handsome Rob has clearly mixed business with pleasure. His 
               eyes flash open.

               He slips out of bed. Pulls on his pants. Reaches into her 
               pants and removes her key chain.

               He selects the key to her service truck and does an old trick: 
               he blows out one of the candles and presses the key against 
               the warm wax, making a clear impression of the key's ridges.

               He returns the key chain. Takes a couple more steps, past 
               her panties, past her bra and.

               He snags her work shirt. Then he's gone.

               INT. HANDSOME ROB'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Using locksmith equipment, he cuts a key that matches the 
               impression on the candle wax.

               EXT. ADELPHIA CABLE PARKING LOT - DAWN

               Stella, wearing Becky's work shirt, arrives before any other 
               workers. Using the key Handsome Rob made, she unlocks the 
               door to the cable truck and gets in.

               EXT. NEARBY STREET - MORNING

               The cable truck pulls over. Charlie and Lyle climb into the 
               back where they can't be seen.

               EXT. OPORTO DRIVE -MORNING

               The cable repair truck pulls over, parking down the street 
               from Steve's house.

               Charlie gets out. He quickly uses a crowbar to lift up a 
               sidewalk cement grate that says CABLE on it. Inside are cable 
               wires that feed the street. He crouches over and uses pliers 
               to disconnect one of the cables.

               INT. STEVE'S HOUSE - MORNING

               He drifts into the kitchen for a cup of coffee. He hits the 
               remote control for a TV. It turns on but there's nothing but 
               snow.

               He goes into the living room and checks out the plasma TV.

               The cable's not working in here, either. He hits an intercom 
               button on his telephone.

               INT. GUARD HOUSE - INTERCUT

               A SECURITY GUARD answers the intercom.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         What can I do for you, Mister 
                         Frezelli?

                                     STEVE
                         The cable's out. See if you can get 
                         someone over here to fix it'.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         Yes, sir.

               He finds the number and dials.

               INT. CABLE TRUCK (PARKED) - MORNING

               Lyle monitors a digital copy of the security guard's call 
               that's being routed to his laptop. Then he takes off his 
               headphones and tells Charlie and Stella:

                                     LYLE
                         Whoa. I've never heard the Muzak 
                         version of Purple Haze before.

                                     CHARLIE
                         When's the appointment?

                                     LYLE
                         Thursday between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m.

               Charlie dials a number on his cell phone.

               INT. GUARD HOUSE - INTERCUT

               The security guard answers the phone.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         Hello.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Yes, I'm calling from Adelphia Cable. 
                         I understand your service is out and 
                         an appointment was set up for 
                         Thursday.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         Yes.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Well we have a technician working in 
                         your area who finished with an 
                         appointment earlier than expected. 
                         Will someone be there for the next 
                         hour?

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         Sure. That'd be great.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Our technician will see you then. 
                         Have a nice day.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         You too.

               Charlie hangs up.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Let's check the camera.

                                     LYLE
                         Stella, you're going patriotic today.

               Lyle puts an American flag pin on her work shirt. Then he 
               hits keys on his laptop and an image pops up on his monitor 
               via an RF antenna: the POV of the pin.

                                     CHARLIE
                         He's got cable lines in the kitchen, 
                         living room, bedroom and a cable 
                         modem on the computer in the office. 
                         Try to get a 360 look at each room. 
                         And walk slowly or the image will 
                         streak.

               Lyle hands her some papers.

                                     LYLE
                         I printed these up to look like 
                         paperwork from Adelphia. When you're 
                         done, ask him to sign and date the 
                         bottom.

               Stella looks very tense.

                                     CHARLIE
                         How you doing?

                                     STELLA
                         Fine. I'm fine.

               Charlie seems amused by that answer.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You know what fine, stands for? Fucked-
                         up, Insecure --

               Stella joins in with him...

                                     STELLA & CHARLIE
                         Neurotic and Emotional.

               They look at each other a moment... and smile.

               INT. RENTAL CAR (MOVING) - DAY

               While the others deal with the cable, Handsome Rob and Half- 
               Ear drive down Sunset.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         Here's our spot.

               They pull up in front of a strip joint.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Girls girls girls.

               Half-Ear pulls a switchblade out of his boot and puts it in 
               the glove compartment. Handsome Rob gives him a questioning 
               look.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         Philly Steak said we'd be frisked.

               INT. STRIP CLUB - DAY

               Outside the doorway of a back room they're frisked by a BURLY 
               MAN. He's very thorough, digging hard into their crotches.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                              (scowls)
                         Y'got a great job.

                                     BURLY MAN
                         Pays the rent, asshole. You got a 
                         problem, talk to Skinny Pete.

               He opens the door to the --

               INT. BACK ROOM

               Where we meet SKINNY PETE, who is the FATTEST MAN YOU'VE 
               EVER SEEN. He takes up an entire couch in the rear of the 
               room.

               His catcher's-mitt-sized hands motion them to come closer.

                                     SKINNY PETE
                         Philly Steak sent you?

               His voice is raspy, it's like a climbing-ten-floors-effort 
               just for this guy to get out the words.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         That's right.

                                     SKINNY PETE
                         So was I right-on about the gold 
                         bricks or what?

                                     HALF-EAR
                         That's really not what I'm here to 
                         talk about. Philly Steak said you 
                         could get us some supplies.

               The fattest man you've ever seen attempts a nod, triple-chins 
               colliding like a train wreck.

                                     SKINNY PETE
                         What do you need?

                                     HALF-EAR
                         A four inch can of Nitramon. Nitramon 
                         primer. Detonating cord. Two triple 
                         charger chemical grenades. Launcher.

                                     SKINNY PETE
                         Nine p.m.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Should we hang here? Check out the 
                         dancers?

                                     SKINNY PETE
                         Nothing's going down here. I don't 
                         shit in my own yard, do you?

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         No, but I take a whizz off the deck 
                         sometimes.

               With his distended belly and bursting shirt, his eyes glazing 
               with repletion, Skinny Pete writes down an address.

                                     SKINNY PETE
                         Five thousand dollars. And don't be 
                         late.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SECURITY GUARD BOOTH -DAY

               Looking at a monitor, one of Steve's security guards sees 
               the Adelphia repair truck pull up to the gate. He hits a 
               button and the gate rises, beckoning it inside.

               INT. CABLE TRUCK (MOVING)

               Stella heads up the driveway, apprehension painted on her 
               features. Lyle is hidden in the back.

               She parks next to the Ferrari and finds herself surrounded 
               by the four Rottweilers. They snarl and flash their teeth 
               outside her door until a shrill WHISTLE yanks their attention 
               to --

               EXT. STEVE'S HOUSE

               where Steve has just stepped out the front door. The dogs 
               immediately back off.

               Stella gets out of the truck as Steve walks over, smiling at 
               her.

               She comes face to face with the man who killed her father.

                                     STEVE
                         It's all right. They won't bother 
                         you now.

               She's not sure she's going to be able to speak or pull this 
               off.

                                     STELLA
                         It's okay. I'm used to running into 
                         all sorts of dogs on my job.

               He holds out a hand.

                                     STEVE
                         I'm Steve.

                                     STELLA
                         Becky.

               She shakes his hand. She hates this, feeling his skin touch 
               hers, but she can't betray her feelings. He stands there a 
               moment.

                                     STELLA
                         You want to show me the problem?

                                     STEVE
                         Yeah. Course. This way.

               INT. STEVE'S HOUSE - SAME TIME

               She enters, moving her body to give the pinhole camera a 
               full sweep of the entryway.

                                     STELLA
                         I'd like to check the cable modem 
                         first.

               INT. BACK OF THE CABLE REPAIR TRUCK - SAME TIME

               Lyle watches Stella and Steve on his laptop via the pinhole 
               camera and hears them talking through his headphones.

               INT. HALLWAY - INTERCUT

               Steve leads Stella down the marbled hall...

                                     STEVE
                         I'll show you.

               They step into the --

                                     OFFICE
                         She turns her body so the mini-lens 
                         can stare at the gleaming black 
                         Worthington 1000 safe. Then she goes 
                         up to his desk and pretends to work 
                         on the cable line that feeds into 
                         his computer.

               He stares at her as she bends down...

                                     STEVE
                         The cable guy who hooked this up 
                         weighed about 300 pounds, didn't 
                         wear any underwear, and his pants 
                         slung a little too low if you know 
                         what I mean.

               She tries her best to ignore his flirtatious stare and his 
               words.

                                     STELLA
                         There we go. Now onto the TVs.

               INT. BACK OF THE CABLE TRUCK - DAY

               Lyle sees a perfect view of the main hallway as Stella walks 
               down it.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

               He escorts her inside. She works on the cable connection to 
               the plasma TV. Finishes.

                                     STEVE
                         Is it fixed?

                                     STELLA
                         Turn it on and see.

               EXT. OPORTO DRIVE - SAME TIME

               Back at the spot where Charlie disconnected the cable.

               Wearing a headset with a mic, he gets the word from Lyle --

                                     LYLE (V.O.)
                         Now.

               Charlie reconnects the cable just as --

               INT. LIVING ROOM

               Steve turns on the TV and the picture is --

                                     STEVE
                         Perfect.

                                     STELLA
                         Then it looks like you're all set.

               Steve stares at her a moment.

                                     STEVE
                         Have we met before?

               She's hoping to get out as quickly as she can.

                                     STELLA
                         I don't think so. Sign here, please.

               She hands him the paperwork and a pen. He signs it.

                                     STELLA
                         Date.

                                     STEVE
                         You read my mind.

                                     STELLA
                         Oh, no. I meant that I need you to 
                         put the date by your signature. It's 
                         the 26th.

                                     STEVE
                         I know what you meant.
                              (he smiles)
                         This might seem a little sudden, 
                         but... would you like to have dinner 
                         with me?

                                     STELLA
                         I don't think that'd be a very good 
                         idea.

                                     STEVE
                         Why? Is there some kind of cable-
                         rule against dating customers?

                                     STELLA
                         No, it's my rule. I don't accept 
                         dates from men I've just met. I've 
                         only known you five minutes.

                                     STEVE
                         Then I guess I'll have to sabotage 
                         my cable over and over again until 
                         you get to know me better.

               He's being charming, and she has to act like he is being 
               charming, but she really wants to throw-up.

                                     STEVE
                         Look, I'm just talking about dinner. 
                         Friday night. It's no big deal. If 
                         you don't like me, you never have to 
                         see me again. You know I'm not going 
                         to stop until you say yes.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CABLE TRUCK (MOVING) - DAY

               Stella drives in heavy traffic down Sunset. Charlie and Lyle 
               are in the back.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I know it was tough in there.

                                     STELLA
                         He touched my hand. And he came-on 
                         to me. That slimy, disgusting man 
                         came onto me and I had to pretend 
                         that I liked it.

               Stella keeps her eyes forward, on the road, so Charlie and 
               Lyle can't see her face. But Charlie catches her reflection 
               in the rearview mirror and watches a tear glide down her 
               cheek. She wipes it away.

                                     STELLA
                         You do know what this means... I've 
                         created our window of opportunity.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I know. When Steve leaves Friday 
                         night, we go in. By the time he 
                         realizes you've stood him up, we'll 
                         be long gone with the gold.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. HOUSING PROJECTS - NIGHT

               A different world. A different vibe. That feeling in the 
               gut: you don't belong here.

               INT. RENTAL CAR (MOVING)

               Handsome Rob drives, Half-Ear in the passenger seat.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         Skinny Pete.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         The guy makes Jabba the Hut look 
                         like a spokesman for the Subway 
                         Sandwiches' diet.

               They pull over in front of the apartment building that Pete 
               sent them to.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         What do you think?

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         I'm trying not to.

               EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

               Half-Ear hits the buzzer for the apartment number on the 
               paper from the fat man. The door to the building buzzes in 
               response and they go inside.

               INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

               Climbing stairs. From behind closed doors: TVs, crying babies, 
               violent yelling. They start down a hallway. Ahead of them a 
               door opens and a suitcase is put in front of the doorway. 
               The door closes. They don't even get a glance at whomever is 
               inside.

               They go to the suitcase. Half-Ear clicks open the lock for 
               just a peek. He sees the goods.

               Handsome Rob starts to slide an envelope of cash under the 
               door frame. Its sucked out of his hand by someone on the 
               other side of the door and disappears.

               EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

               Half-Ear carefully deposits the suitcase into the trunk of 
               the rental car. Handsome Rob closes the trunk.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         Drive slow. We crash and we're a 
                         crater.

               They get into the car.

               INT. RENTAL CAR

               Handsome Rob keys the ignition.

               The beam of his headlights illuminate TWO HOMEBOYS. TWO MORE 
               step out of the shadows, one right up to the passenger's 
               door window. That one taps a 9 MM against the glass.

               Half-Ear lowers the window. The homeboy pats one hand against 
               the faux-leather inside of the door, his other hand clutches 
               the weapon.

                                     HOMEBOY
                         What'd you put in the trunk?

                                     HALF-EAR
                         Suitcase.

               The homeboy, bugging on crank, is not one to be fucked with.

                                     HOMEBOY
                         Just gimme the keys before I pop a 
                         cap in your head.

               Handsome Rob takes the trunk key off the chain and passes it 
               over to Half-Ear... who nervously drops it onto the carpeted 
               floor.

                                     HOMEBOY
                         Hurry up!

               Half-Ear reaches down for the key... but in the flash of an 
               eye... moving so fast it almost doesn't register... we see 
               him yank his switchblade from his boot, unleash its blade, 
               and stab it down into the homeboy's hand. The knife goes 
               through his hand and lodges into the faux-leather interior 
               of the door.

               The homeboy suffers as Half-Ear whacks the gun out of his 
               other hand -- while Handsome Rob keys the ignition and guns 
               it.

               The other homeboys are already POPPING OFF SHOTS at the car 
               with semi-automatic handguns. Half-Ear hits the deck. Glass 
               shatters.

               INT. TRUNK OF THE CAR

               Bullets slam into the trunk, illuminating the darkness with 
               streaks of light from the bullet holes. They barely miss the 
               suitcase filled with explosives.

               EXT. RENTAL CAR (MOVING)

               The homeboy is still attached to the car door by the knife.

               His legs scurry to keep up with the moving vehicle but it's 
               going too fast so pretty soon he's being dragged. Bullets 
               whiz by him. He cries out in agony until Half-Ear has the 
               time to yank out the knife and the homeboy rolls away on the 
               pavement.

               The car makes a sharp right at the next block and pulls over.

               The U-Haul is waiting for them.

               They get out of the rental car and open its trunk. Half-Ear 
               sees the bullet holes that surround the suitcase. An inch 
               closer and they would've been a crater.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         Christ.

               INT. U-HAUL - NIGHT

               They get in with the suitcase. Charlie is behind the wheel, 
               he's been waiting for them. He hits the gas. They take off, 
               leaving the shot-up rental car behind.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Looks like that went without a hitch.

               INT. CHARLIE'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

               An edited loop of the exterior and interior of Steve's house 
               plays on Lyle's laptop. The crew is huddled around.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Lyle, what's the distance from the 
                         front door to the vault?

               Lyle doesn't answer.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Lyle?

               Handsome Rob leans over to Charlie.

                         He only answers to The Napster now.

                         I'm not calling you The Napster.

                         You call him Half-Ear.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         That wasn't my idea.

                         That's only cause he is Handsome 
                         Rob.

                         So here's the riddle. How do we get 
                         over a ton of gold from the vault to 
                         the getaway car?

               The video that Stella got of the hallway plays on the laptop.

                         We could rumble right up the front 
                         steps, bring the getaway car right 
                         to the vault, and then straight to

               EXT. CAR RENTAL COMPANY - DAY

               Parked in the lot are shimmering Supercharged Mini Coopers, 
               a new model that still captures the legendary Mini look and 
               feel.

               Half-Ear climbs in one Mini. Lyle into another.

               In the background, a large window overlooks the lot.

               Handsome Rob fills out the paperwork on the Mini he's renting 
               while flirting with a petite COUNTER BABE.

               At the same time, in the background, we see Lyle and Half-
               Ear's Mini pull out of their parking spaces and BACK RIGHT 
               INTO EACH OTHER. Just a little bumper hit.

                         And I'm in a hurry, okay?

               INT. YEVHEN'S COINS & BULLION STORE - NIGHT

               It doesn't seem to matter if Steve's in a hurry or not, Yevhen 
               still runs at the mouth while heading into the back room.

                                     YEVHEN
                         Of course the Florida vote rigging 
                         was a CIA and Mob operation.

                                     STEVE
                              (with total disinterest)
                         That a fact?

                                     YEVHEN
                         You want facts? Fact: CIA officials 
                         were allowed free -- and illegal -- 
                         access to official election material.

               Steve puts his duffel bag down on the table. It THUDS. Once 
               again, he pulls out three gold bricks that each weigh 25 
               pounds.

                                     YEVHEN
                         Now given the sordid history in Miami 
                         of joint ventures between Central 
                         Intelligence and the Mob, which led 
                         to the unsuccessful attempts to kill 
                         Fidel Castro and the successful 
                         assassination of your President John 
                         F. Kennedy, this conjunction raises 
                         numerous red flags.

                                     STEVE
                         And I'd love to hear more about it, 
                         but like I said...

                                     YEVHEN
                         Don't worry, we'll have you out in 
                         no time. The cash is on its way.

               Steve cocks his head, as if he could not have heard right.

                                     STEVE
                         On its way?

                                     YEVHEN
                         My cousin is bringing it over.

                                     STEVE
                         Your cousin?

                                     YEVHEN
                         Yes. Cousin Mashkov.

                                     STEVE
                         He's on his way?

                                     YEVHEN
                         Don't worry, he will be here any 
                         minute.

               Steve looks up to the security camera.

                                     STEVE
                         The tape's off?

                                     YEVHEN
                         Of course. Believe me, he doesn't 
                         want to be on video, either.

                                     STEVE
                         Yevhen. Didn't I tell you, many times, 
                         that I never wanted to meet with 
                         anyone but you?

               Yevhen sweats a bit.

                                     YEVHEN
                         I know. But it's his cash. He uses 
                         me to launder money. I'm just a 
                         middleman.

                                     STEVE
                         And a middleman is supposed to stay 
                         in the middle.

                                     YEVHEN
                         But you were early. Please. Don't 
                         worry. It will be fine. My cousin's 
                         a cool guy. Like I am.

                                     STEVE
                         What you are, is a Dixie cup.

               Yevhen smiles quizzically, not sure if he's being complimented 
               or insulted.

                                     YEVHEN
                         Dixie cup?

               Before the words are out of Yevhen's mouth, Steve grabs one 
               of the 25 pound gold bricks and slaps it across Yevhen's 
               face, shattering his jaw.

               Yevhen's falls to the floor and Steve lifts the brick again 
               and rams it down onto his head with an ugly THUD.

               And again.

               And again.

               He then takes the gold brick -- slathered in blood -- and 
               places it back in his duffle bag.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. YEVHEN'S COINS & BULLION STORE - TEN MINUTES LATER

               Yevhen's Ukrainian cousin, MASHKOV, stares down at the corpse. 
               Steve is long gone.

               Mashkov kneels down by the body and starts sobbing.

               INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

               Mashkov walks through a living room, past some lighting 
               equipment and a video camera and we get just enough of a 
               look to realize that a porno is being shot here but he 
               couldn't care less as he makes his way into the kitchen where --

               His boss, DANYA, 60, the owner of this house, is eating a 
               bowl of Frosted Flakes at the kitchen table. They speak in a 
               colloquial Ukrainian tongue that we SUBTITLE.

                                     MASHKOV
                         My cousin Yevhen was beaten to death.

                                     DANYA
                         By who?

                                     MASHKOV
                         That's what I'm going to find out.

               They stop talking for a moment as one of the "ACTRESSES" 
               comes in, plops herself down next to Danya and pours herself 
               a bowl of cereal. She puts her hand on Danya's leg. She's 
               young and it's a disturbing image and we RECOGNIZE HER: she's 
               the HITCHHIKER who Lyle passed in the taxi ride down Figueroa 
               Street when he first arrived in L.A.

               Danya goes back to speaking SUBTITLED UKRAINIAN.

                                     DANYA
                         And what will you do when you find 
                         this piece of shit who killed your 
                         cousin?

                                     MASHKOV
                         I'll hack off his limbs and bury him 
                         while he's still alive.

                                     DANYA
                         Okay. But now we should stop talking 
                         Ukrainian, it's rude to my girl.
                              (switching to accented 
                              ENGLISH)
                         How are you tonight, Karen?

                                     KAREN
                         Hungry.

                                     DANYA
                         Then eat your Frosted Flakes.

                                     KAREN
                              (like Tony the Tiger)
                         They're grrrreat!

               Danya laughs pleasantly.

                                     DANYA
                         Such a perfect girl.

               But as she eats her cereal, we see a troubled, sad look on 
               her face.

               INT. RENTED WAREHOUSE - DAY

               The three Minis are parked inside: one red, one white, one 
               blue. Handsome Rob and Stella are doing custom work under 
               the hoods. Lyle is wearing the strap-on laptop and typing 
               away. Half-Ear squeezes silver Haliburton suitcases into the 
               Minis' trunks as Charlie enters --

                                     CHARLIE
                         How are our matchbox cars?

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Souped.

                                     STELLA
                         Don't let their size fool you. These 
                         were rally cars back in the day. 135 
                         mph, 155 horsepower --

                                     LYLE
                         Do I get to drive one?

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         No.

                                     LYLE
                         Why not?

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Because you can't navigate your way 
                         out of a parking lot. Here's your 
                         ride.

               He pulls a blanket off a Vespa. Lyle points at Half-Ear.

                                     LYLE
                         But he ran into me.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         He's not driving either.
                              (to Stella)
                         You ever got a speeding ticket?

                                     STELLA
                         Let's put it this way: I can only 
                         get insurance through companies that 
                         advertise on TV at 3:00 in the 
                         morning.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         You drive. I drive. Charlie drives.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I got us spots for three cars on a 
                         car carrier and five first class 
                         seats. Train 59 from Union Station 
                         to New Orleans.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         That's N'Or'lins, Yankee.

                         What's the word on Rockefeller?

                                     LYLE
                         The Traffic Control Center is on the 
                         top floor of a building on Olympic 
                         and Grand. They get their data from 
                         pavement loop detectors and video 
                         image vehicle detectors. That info 
                         is fused together by specially 
                         designed algorithms to predict traffic 
                         conditions and control the traffic 
                         lights. So all I have to do now is 
                         change the data by creating my own 
                         algorithm.

                                     CHARLIE
                         What can I do to help?

                                     LYLE
                         I need to hard-wire into the 
                         mainframes.

               EXT. TRAFFIC CONTROL CENTER - NIGHT

               Housed in a towering building on the corner of Olympic and 
               Grand in the heart of downtown L.A. OUR VIEW RISES UP to the 
               rooftop, where WE FIND Charlie and Lyle.

               OUR VIEW MOVES IN CLOSER on Charlie, who adroitly picks the 
               lock to an access door and they climb down a short set of 
               steps into the 

               INT. MAINTENANCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS SHOT

               From an equipment bag, Charlie pulls out a silent power drill 
               and uses it to remove an access panel from the AC vent.

               INT. AIR-CONDITIONING VENT - NIGHT

               Charlie leads, crawling through this tight space, his path 
               illuminated by the thin beam of a penlight.

               INT. TRAFFIC CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

               A high-tech setting with a half-dozen workers overseeing the 
               large traffic information monitors that display multiple 
               images.

               OUR CAMERA PUSHES IN on the wall of monitors and then 
               BLACKNESS as OUR VIEW CROSSES to the --

               OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL

               Where the 70" tall mainframe computers are housed and running. 
               We see that the AC vent to this room is now open since Charlie 
               and Lyle have already snuck inside.

               They move fast. Charlie removes the rear panels of the 
               mainframes while Lyle adeptly hard-wires his laptop into the 
               computers. The laptop's screen lights up.

               Charlie fits two false panels where the rear panels of the 
               mainframes used to be. Lyle pulls an innocent looking filing 
               box out of his equipment bag. He places the box on a nearby 
               shelf where it enjoys line-of-sight to the false panels.

               He punches a key on his laptop and the false panels and the 
               filing box quietly clicks into action, communicating with 
               his laptop via infrared. His laptop now shows a guiltwork of 
               thumbnail views from the traffic information monitors.

               Typing commands, Lyle is clearly operating on a higher 
               bandwidth than the rest us.

                                     LYLE
                         B4 X TTratio, where Bi are Fisher's 
                         linear discriminant function 
                         coefficients, SpdRat is the speed 
                         ratio, and TTratio is the travel 
                         time ratio.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I have no idea what you're doing. 
                         Just do it fast.

               There.

               Their motto: "Never closed. Never without a customer!" The 
               place has the same decor as it did 75 years ago. It's also a 
               spot where everyone minds their own business. One of the OLD 
               TIME WAITERS leads OUR CAMERA to a table in the back where 
               Mashkov sits across from a LAPD HOMICIDE DETECTIVE. He slides 
               over an envelope of cash and a photograph of Karen.

                         Fresh off the bus. One of Danya's 
                         guys picked her up hitchhiking 
                         downtown.

                         who works the counter at your cousin's

                         gold bricks with the face of a 
                         Balinese girl on them. Same gold

               preens in front of the three sided full length mirror, 
               adorning himself in the most expensive fashion, that he is a

               turning to complete surprise.

               HIS POV

               The neighbor across the street from Steve is having the 
               biggest party in town. The road is filled with parked cars 
               and arriving guests. Ain't no way they're blowing the gate, 
               launching chemical grenades or in any way robbing Steve's 
               house in the midst of this.

                         You'll have to fake it. Laugh at his 
                         jokes. You need him to ask you out 
                         again.

               INT. AGO RESTAURANT - NIGHT

               A posh restaurant. As OUR CAMERA FINDS Stella and Steve, she 
               is laughing at something he said, faking her way through the 
               date. They're sitting at an intimate table.

                                     STELLA
                         You really make laugh.

               He takes the lie like the compliment she wants him to think 
               it is.

                         after dinner. We'll go to Club Deep. 
                         The Ferrari always gets me to the 
                         front of the line. We'll do a little 
                         dancing...

                         Not tonight. I don't want to be out 
                         late.

                                     STEVE
                         Why the curfew?

                                     STELLA
                         Let's just say I've made some wrong 
                         calls in the past. I like to take 
                         things slow, cautious. Next time...

                                     STEVE
                         I understand. You have nothing to 
                         worry about. You can trust me.

                                     STELLA
                         I trust everyone. It's the devil 
                         inside them that I don't trust.

               That saying strikes Steve.

                                     STEVE
                         That's an interesting saying.

                                     STELLA
                         What?

               He looks at her closely, really closely.

                                     STEVE
                         There's only person I've ever heard 
                         say that. Used to say it all the 
                         time.

               This worries her. Because of course, she used to hear it 
               from her father.

                                     STELLA
                         Who was that?

               Under the table, he grabs her by the wrist, squeezes it like 
               a vise.

                                     STEVE
                         A man named John Bridger. Where did 
                         you pick up that phrase?

                                     STELLA
                         Ow. I don't remember. You're hurting 
                         me.

                                     STEVE
                         John Bridger was a thief. And he had 
                         a daughter. About your age. He told 
                         me that she took over a safe and 
                         lock company that he used as a front.

                                     STELLA
                         Let go of my wrist. What is wrong 
                         with you? It's just a saying.

               Steve's voice is calm, so at ease that watching them you'd 
               think this was pleasant dinner conversation.

                                     STEVE
                         No wonder I liked you right away. 
                         Just like I liked your old man, right 
                         up until the moment I shot him in 
                         the head. Now tell me who you're 
                         working with and tell me the plan. 
                         Do it now or we'll go for a ride and 
                         I'll break every bone in your body.

               Stella intentionally knocks over a glass of wine. It shatters 
               on the floor. An emergency signal...

               Charlie, Half-Ear, Handsome Rob and Lyle appear around the 
               table.

               Steve is shocked to see the men he left for dead three years 
               ago standing before him, very much alive.

               They pull up chairs from another table, encircling him for a 
               tense and pointed talk.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Something wrong, Steve? You look 
                         like you want to call Ghostbusters.

               Half-Ear furtively slides the switchblade out of his boot.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         She's coming with us. You got a 
                         problem with that?

                                     STEVE
                         Fine by me. But it's you that has 
                         the problem.

                                     LYLE
                         How do you figure?

                                     STEVE
                         You've just blown the one thing you 
                         had going in your favor, the element 
                         of surprise. And I was surprised.
                              (he laughs unpleasantly)
                         Jesus Christ when I saw all you guys 
                         come out of the woodwork. For a minute 
                         I thought maybe you were ghosts. But 
                         you're screwed now.
                              (an arrogant sneer a 
                              Half-Ear)
                         Did you figure out how to take care 
                         of my security guard? I'll hire five 
                         more.
                              (at Lyle)
                         You know how to bypass my alarm 
                         system? I'll have a new one installed 
                         tomorrow.
                              (at Handsome Rob)
                         Does it tear you up inside seeing 
                         what car I drive? I'll buy a matching 
                         one in red.
                              (at Stella)
                         You think you can crack my safe? 
                         You'll end up the same way as your 
                         dad.
                              (then to Charlie, all 
                              smiles)
                         Looks like Good Time Charlie's got 
                         the blues.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You can wear that shit-eating grin 
                         on your face, but I know under that 
                         Versace shirt you're in a cold sweat. 
                         And you're not going to sleep a minute 
                         tonight. Cause you thought you'd 
                         gotten away with it free and clear. 
                         You thought you'd gotten rid of us. 
                         You're the one who's screwed. Right 
                         to the wall.

                                     STEVE
                         Give it your best shot. I'll outsmart 
                         you every step of the way. And this 
                         time, I'll bury you myself.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (taking the challenge)
                         Get more guards. Change the alarm. 
                         Buy a dozen Ferraris. We'll still be 
                         here. Sleep tight.

               Charlie grabs a bread stick off the table and goes. The others 
               follow.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. STRIP CLUB - BACK ROOM - NIGHT

               The door bursts open as the burly man we met earlier is 
               dragged inside at gunpoint. Five Ukrainians armed with MAC-
               11 machine pistols storm the room where Skinny Pete works.

               Mashkov walks behind the posse. He carries a duffel bag. He 
               takes in the sight of the fattest man he's ever seen.

                                     MASHKOV
                              (in accented English)
                         Do you know who I am?

                                     SKINNY PETE
                         You work for Danya.

                                     MASHKOV
                         Yes. And you are gonna be straight 
                         with me and everything's gonna be 
                         okay. You fuck with me, I will be 
                         ruthless.

                                     SKINNY PETE
                         I understand.

                                     MASHKOV
                         I don't want you to understand. I 
                         want you to overstand.

                                     SKINNY PETE
                         Overstand... Okay.

                                     MASHKOV
                         Because if you don't overstand, I 
                         will use this.

               Mashkov nonchalantly opens the duffel bag and pulls out a 
               short-handled ax. Skinny Pete sees dried blood on the blade.

                                     MASHKOV
                         Someone was asking about gold bars 
                         with a Balinese girl's face on them. 
                         I want the name of this man.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SHUTTER'S ON THE BEACH - MORNING

               The sun shines over the ocean and the hotel.

               INT. CHARLIE'S HOTEL ROOM

               The crew is gathered. Lyle, monitoring digital surveillance 
               on his laptop, takes off his headphones.

                                     LYLE
                         Well we scared him alright. He's 
                         flying the coop. His security guard 
                         called Brink's Armored Car Service 
                         to confirm a 5 p.m. pick up at his 
                         house, then JetClub to confirm a 
                         MD11 cargo plane departing from the 
                         Imperial Terminal at LAX at 8 p.m.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Confirmed? How'd we miss the first 
                         calls?

                                     LYLE
                         They must have been cellular. The 
                         cargo plane is being chartered to 
                         Mexico City.

                         Only place with worse smog and traffic

                         Once the charter's in the air, he 
                         could change the flight path to 
                         anywhere. And good-bye gold.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Not so fast. This is good news for 
                         us.

                         Good news?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Sometimes when you're up to your ass 
                         in alligators you forget that you 
                         started off trying to drain the swamp.

                         Meaning what the fuck?

                         We've been trying to get to the gold 
                         in the safe. Now the safe is coming 
                         to us. We'll boost it in transit.

               He might as well have said they'll steal the Holy Grail before 
               sunrise.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Charlie. He could take a dozen 
                         different routes to the airport and 
                         we have no idea which one. We can't 
                         take out an armored truck during 
                         rush hour.

                                     CHARLIE
                         We're already set to do it. Napster: 
                         how would you like to create the 
                         biggest traffic jam in the history 
                         of Los Angeles?

                                     LYLE
                         Keep talking.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You gridlock every route except the 
                         one we choose. Force the truck to go 
                         exactly where we want it to go.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         But where do we want it? We can't 
                         shoot it out with armed guards in a 
                         Brink's. We'd lose. And even if we 
                         pulled it off, the cops would be all 
                         over us, chasing us all the way to 
                         Union Station. We're outmanned and 
                         outgunned.

                                     CHARLIE
                         But not outsmarted.

               Charlie hums with focused energy. There's a term for it in 
               horse racing. When a thoroughbred is at peak condition, and 
               twitching with eagerness to run, he is "on the muscle." That 
               describes Charlie right now.

                                     CHARLIE
                         We'll do it like the Italian job. 
                         We'll make thirty million in gold 
                         drop out of sight.

               They're interrupted by Charlie's cell phone RINGING. This 
               throws them all off.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Who else has this number?

                                     HALF-EAR
                         No one but us.

               It's still RINGING. Charlie decides to answer it.

                         Listen to me. You've gotta get out 
                         of L.A. Now.

                         What're you talking about? We didn't 
                         clip anybody.

                         Well Skinny Pete just called me. 
                         Yevhen's cousin is under the distinct 
                         impression that you did.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Why does he think that?

                         Because you wanted, to know about 
                         the gold with the Balinese Girl. 
                         Plus I guess Pete was under duress. 
                         This Ukrainian thinks he's Paul 
                         Fucking Bunyan.

                         Do you know how to get in touch with 
                         him?

                                     PHILLY STEAK
                         Yeah but... 

                                     CHARLIE
                         Maybe there's a way we can play this 
                         to our advantage.

                                     PHILLY STEAK
                         Are you out of your mind? Listen to 
                         me, Charlie. Get out of L.A. Now. 
                         Cause if there's one thing I know, 
                         it's that you never mess with Mother 
                         Nature, mother-in-laws, or mother-
                         fucking Ukrainians.

               stuffed with her only belongings, creeps into the kitchen 
               with two 3/4" videotapes in hand.

               She sets them down on the counter. They say MASTER TAPE on 
               the labels. She opens the microwave oven. Puts the tapes 
               inside. Sets the timer for 60 minutes at the highest level 
               and presses the start button.

               As the videotapes start to cook, we watch Karen flee out the 
               door.

               The U-Haul is parked on the side of the noisy, congested 
               boulevard. A large metal sheet is now mounted on the side of 
               the panel truck.

               HIGH ANGLE. Parked behind the U-Haul are two of the Minis 
               and Lyle's Vespa. We see traffic flowing through the busy 
               intersection next to the vehicles. Then WE BOOM DOWN, really 
               fast, right into the black pavement and --

               THROUGH THE DARKNESS and out the other side, so we are now 
               underground in the middle of the --

               METRO RAIL TUNNEL

               where Half-Ear is at work, mounting Nitramon primer to the 
               tunnel walls, Charlie assisting. They both wear orange 
               jumpsuits, plus headsets and mics.

                         teacher told him he was a moron who'd 
                         never amount to anything? Same as 
                         mine.

                         No shit. I thought you dropped out 
                         of high school.

                         we've been pulling?

                         Quit going to strip clubs. Went to 
                         night school instead. City college 
                         is all.

                         Good for you. That's a real feather 
                         in your cap.

                         I didn't want to say anything to the 
                         guys.

               There's a RUMBLING SOUND in the distance.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Secret's safe with me.

               The RUMBLING grows unbearable as a Metro roars closer, 
               headlights gobbling up the dark tunnel. They press themselves 
               into a crevice in the wall.

               With a ROAR and a gust of wind, the Metro howls by. It makes 
               their jaws clatter.

               Handsome Rob's Mini is parked on the side of the winding 
               road. Using binoculars, he looks down onto Oporto Drive at 
               Steve's house. Into his headset:

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Everything's quiet here. Over.

               INT. METRO RAIL TUNNEL - DAY

               The Nitramon is applied. Half-Ear closes his eyes. Charlie 
               observes him a moment.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You okay?

                                     HALF-EAR
                         Ah huh. Just need a moment's 
                         meditation.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Now?

                                     HALF-EAR
                         I'm about to insert a wire into a 
                         detonator tube and if the wire touches 
                         the sides of tube, we'll be blown to 
                         Kingdom Come. Best to be at one with 
                         yourself.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Take all the time you need.

               Another moment, then Half-Ear sets to work. Charlie holds a 
               mini-flashlight, illuminating the intricate detonator. Very 
               carefully, he inserts a wire into a tube. Remember, the wire 
               must not touch the sides.

               The wire is half-way in when a LARGE SPIDER drops onto his 
               hand. Frozen, he ponders this.

               Charlie sees the spider, doesn't know what to do.

               Half-Ear studies the spider... then he closes his eyes just 
               a moment... relaxes... breathes in, breathes out... and then --

               He leans forward, opens his mouth and clamps his lips over 
               the spider, comes back up. Finishes inserting the wire.

               Job done, he calmly opens his mouth. The spider puts a hairy 
               leg out and delicately explores his cheek. Half-Ear plucks 
               it off just as delicately, depositing the spider on the wall.

               Charlie just shakes his head in disbelief.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         My work here is done.

               A Brink's truck climbs the road towards Steve's house, flanked 
               by two BMW K1200LTA motorcycles.

               EXT. MARAVILLA DRIVE - SAME TIME

               Through binoculars, Handsome Rob is still keeping an eye on 
               Steve's house from the higher vantage point.

               HIS POV

               The front gate rises. The Brink's truck and motorcycles are 
               let inside and head up the driveway.

               But then he sees a SECOND ARMORED truck drive up, also guarded 
               by two motorcycles. And a third Brink's followed by 
               motorcycles turns into the driveway.

               EXT. STEVE'S HOUSE

               It's a convoy of matching armored trucks...

               The caravan of armored trucks and motorcycles now head down 
               the driveway. The Ferrari follows behind.

               Handsome Rob sees the vehicles head east on Oporto. He reports

                         truck has the gold?

               Charlie is just as frustrated... but in a tight spot he always 
               comes up with an idea.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You can monitor the traffic video 
                         cameras from your laptop, right?

                         Where's the first camera the trucks 
                         will go past?

               Lyle hits a command key and we now see the intersection of 
               Woodrow Wilson Drive and Cahuenga where vehicles are driving 
               under the traffic signal that a traffic video camera is 
               mounted to.

                         Cahuenga Boulevard. They all have to 
                         cross that.

                         The weight of the gold will lower 
                         the suspension on the truck.

               momentarily FREEZING the image. He makes a visual check of 
               the top of the armored truck against the Cahuenga Boulevard 
               street sign.

               He unfreezes the first image just in time to check out the 
               next armored truck in line. FREEZE. The top of this truck 
               also lines up perfectly with the top of the street sign.

               It comes to the next intersection. Every light is stuck on

               for one car to gun through it at a time.

               At the same time, we see Charlie get out of the U-Haul and 
               climb into the first Mini. Stella gets into the second Mini.

               Another Metro stops on the Red Line.

               The three Minis jump the curb and drive right over the star- 
               lined sidewalk... Pedestrians throw themselves out of their

               The motorcycles following the Brink's come to a sudden stop.

               The motorcycle guards watch the smoke clear. The armored 
               truck has vanished! Vaporized in the gridlock! Gone!

               Pandemonium. People scatter. A man jumps out of his BMW and 
               sprints away from the explosion.

               Lyle gets out of the U-Haul and runs to his getaway vehicle: 
               the Vespa. He's about to hop on, but something stops him...

               The sight of the vacant, shimmering, 2002 BMW 750iL parked 
               just ahead, keys dangling from the ignition.

               At the same time, the motorcycle guards climb off their bikes. 
               Draw semi-automatic handguns. Result: more madness Bystanders 
               flee.

               The BMW tears out of there, Lyle behind the wheel.

               Steve slams the car into gear and jumps the sidewalk, passing

               accelerating full throttle for the horizon while pedestrians 
               flatten themselves against a high-rise in fear.

               INT. CHARLIE'S MINI

               He sees someone give him the finger. Mutters:

                                     CHARLIE
                         If you don't like how I'm driving, 
                         get off the damn sidewalk.

               Meanwhile:

               INT. HANDSOME ROB'S MINI

               He's got the other motorcycle on his tail, RELENTLESS GUNFIRE 
               dogging his every move.

               He shifts smooth as silk, squeezing between a car he's passing 
               and an oncoming car in the other lane. Half-Ear is trying 
               his best to remain calm but Jesus, that was close.

               Suddenly, Handsome Rob veers off the road and WHAM. He takes 
               down a chain link fence and is now in the parking lot of 
               the:

               EXT. CONVENTION CENTER

               His white Mini catapults across the asphalt, the motorcycle 
               still right behind.

               INT. HANDSOME ROB'S MINI

               Up ahead, he eyes the open door entrance to the Convention 
               Center. Stomps the gas.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         What are you doing?

               The turbine howls.

                         What -- are -- you -- doing?

               EXT. CONVENTION CENTER

               The Mini squeezes through the doorway and into the --

               INT. CONVENTION CENTER

               It's the STAR TREK GRAND SLAM 2002 convention in full swing.

               Display tables are lined up in the cavernous hall and the 
               Mini snakes through the maze and the Trekkies as --

               The motorcycle follows right behind and the chase is really 
               on now.

               THUDA THUD THUDA, the Mini's wheels climb a flight of steps.

               Waves of people flee the path of the little car and --

               THUD, THUDA, THUD, the motorcycle follows right behind.

               The Mini zips down the wide Concourse Hall -- travels 
               underneath banners of Star Trek characters that hang from 
               the ceiling -- the motorcycle keeps up, tires tearing into 
               the carpeting.

               INT. HANDSOME ROB'S MINI

               He shifts, swerves, avoiding people, obstacles.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         Go that way!

               Handsome Rob turns, taking them down the --

               WEST HALL

               that stretches out toward the Staples Center.

               WHIZ. The Mini goes by. WHIZ. The motorcycle goes by.

               Then --

               The Mini steamrolls through the exit doors and --

               EXT. CONVENTION CENTER/STAPLES CENTER

               It bounds down outdoor steps and ramps onto the outside 
               entrance to the Staples Center, fitting snugly between cement 
               pillars that are designed to keep regular-sized cars out.

               INT. STAPLES CENTER - DAY

               The Mini bulldozes through glass doors. Across the lobby.

               Down an aisle that leads right to --

               CENTER COURT

               where OUR L.A. LAKERS are in the midst of practice. The Minis 
               do look like matchbox cars next to these towering players.

               The car's tires leave a streak of rubber on the parquet floor. 
               The team clears a path. The car is off the court before they 
               know it.

               But now the players see the motorcycle coming down the aisle.

               See the guns. See security guards running after it.

               KOBE BRYANT picks up a basketball.

               The motorcycle charges across center court.

               Kobe aims... hurls the ball. It RAMS into the motorcycle's 
               handlebars. The bike spins out of control and into a nasty 
               fall, spitting off the riders while --

               EXT. STAPLES CENTER

               The Mini crashes out the opposite side of the arena and glides 
               right through the L.A. Sports Arch of Fame before escaping 
               onto Figueroa. Meanwhile:

               EXT. SOUTH ALAMEDA - DAY

               The Ferrari is eating up the pavement as it hounds after 
               Stella. Two police cars are roaring after them both.

               INT. STELLA'S MINI

               She slaps the gears into action, maneuvers tight turns around 
               the cars in her path, just like she does at home with Jack 
               Daniels.

               EXT. SOUTH ALAMEDA

               A cop car tries to pass the same car as the Ferrari but 
               smashes into an oncoming vehicle. As it spins like a corkscrew --

               EXT. FERRARI

               The rear tires spin smoke and it launches like a missile 
               after the Mini.

               INT. STELLA'S MINI

               She keeps flooring it... the gauge rising... the customized 
               engine screaming...

               But the Ferrari, like an unstoppable force, hangs menacingly 
               in her rearview mirror.

               I/E FERRARI

               Steve RAMS into the rear bumper of the blue Mini. The bumper 
               tears off, rolls across the pavement. The Ferrari is about 
               to make another charge.

               INT. STELLA'S MINI

               She yanks the wheel left to avoid the hit. Suddenly finds 
               herself in the path of an ARROWHEAD WATER TRUCK. She yanks 
               the wheel right to avoid a collision.

               INT. ARROWHEAD WATER TRUCK

               The truck driver hits the brakes, over compensating as he 
               turns away from the Mini and --

               EXT. SOUTH ALAMEDA

               The truck falls over onto its side, sending those big jugs 
               all over the road, water exploding into the air and --

               The Ferrari crashes through the jugs, one rolling up the 
               hood and over the windshield, dousing it like a car wash.

               The lane is blocked by the wreck. Steve makes a right turn.

               The police cruiser hits the brakes but not fast enough. It 
               slams into the water truck.

               EXT. 5TH STREET

               Steve turned onto a one-way street and he's going the wrong 
               way. A Jeep Wrangler almost runs into him head-on but both 
               cars stop just in time.

               The DRIVER of Wrangler, a muscular fire plug of a guy, jumps 
               out, furious.

                                     FURIOUS DRIVER
                         What's wrong with you, you stupid-
                         ass, son of a bitch, dickhead...

               As more invectives are hurled, Steve gets out of the Ferrari 
               and walks towards the furious driver.

                                     FURIOUS DRIVER
                         What? You want a piece of me? C'mon, 
                         dumbshit. Bring it on. I'll be pulling 
                         peanuts out of your asshole --

               BANG. Steve shoots the guy's foot.

                                     FURIOUS DRIVER
                         Shit! Shit! You shot me in the foot!

               While the furious driver hops on one leg, Steve gets into 
               the Wrangler and takes off, abandoning the Ferrari. At the 
               same time --

               INT. BMW 750IL (MOVING) - SUNSET

               Lyle's coasting down Exposition Boulevard towards Union 
               Station. Clear sailing for him.

               He sees a young woman thumbing for a ride. It's Karen. And 
               he recognizes her: she was hitchhiking when he first arrived 
               in L.A. He pulls over. To Lyle, she might be an angel in the 
               empyrean if she wasn't, so completely, a woman.

                                     LYLE

                         The farther the better.

               EXT. FIGUEROA & OLYMPIC - DAY

               Charlie's still having a helluva time getting rid of the 
               motorcycle. It screams like a Banshee as it streaks up 
               alongside the Mini. Charlie suddenly sees an AK-47 pointed 
               right at him.

               INT. CHARLIE'S MINI

               He jerks the steering wheel and swerves off the street, 
               driving through the parking lot of the historic Hotel 
               Figueroa.

               With the motorcycle dogging his heels, he looks up at the 
               building. It has three towers that rise up 12 stories, with 
               a giant mural of Albert Einstein covering one of the towers

               (it's an ad for Apple Computers: Think different.)

               Suddenly the LAPD helicopter swoops down towards the parking 
               lot, shattering the air, blowing up dirt and discarded 
               newspapers in a rush of turbo-wash, trying to box in the 
               Mini.

               INT. CHARLIE'S MINI

               He's got no place else to go...

               INT. HOTEL FIGUEROA

               The Mini squeezes through the entrance and into the lobby 
               with its exotic Moroccan decor. Horrified guests catapult 
               out of the way. The Mini drives past wooden statues, potted 
               palm trees.

               The motorcycle follows the car as it streaks towards the 
               elevator. Charlie looks back, sees the motorcycle. The 
               elevator door opens. Some tourists step off.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Going up?

               INT. ELEVATOR

               The Mini darts right in, not an inch to spare. Charlie reaches 
               out the window, presses the button for ROOF.

               He sees the motorcycle charging after him, burning rubber 
               across the beautiful tiled floor. Closer, closer.

               The door closes just in time.

               A second elevator opens, the motorcycle zooms inside, people 
               screaming at the sight of the guns.

               EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY

               The doors open, PING, and the Mini reverses out, spins.

               LOOKING DOWN onto the building's rooftop, we see that it is 
               shaped like a capitol E, three towers connected by a narrow 
               strip. Each tower has its own elevator.

               INT. CHARLIE'S MINI

               He wants to drive across the rooftop strip but there's a big 
               problem: the giant sign that exclaims HOTEL FIGUEROA in red 
               and white neon lights blocks so much of the strip that even 
               the Mini couldn't squeeze through.

               In his rearview, he sees the second elevator door open and 
               out comes the motorcycle. He's trapped up here. But he's not 
               about to abandon ship.

               EXT. ROOFTOP

               So he floors it, slaps the gears, hurtles to the edge of the 
               first tower and in --

               EYE-POPPING CGI SLOW MOTION SHOTS

               His car hurls into the wide blue empty space... The ground 
               deliriously distant... Spiraling through the air like a 
               football...

               NEXT TOWER - ROOFTOP

               The Mini lands right-side-up with a THUD. Charlie, rattled, 
               looks over his shoulder and sees the LAPD helicopter rising 
               over the rooftop, turbines SCREAMING.

               And here comes the motorcycle. Flying from one section of 
               the rooftop to the next. It lands and the driver REVS it 
               forward --

               I/E CHARLIE'S MINI

               He speeds toward the edge of the roof and launches off towards 
               the third tower some twenty feet away. Lands. Keeps going to 
               the last elevator, skids to a stop.

               He reaches out, punches the call button. Then looks over his 
               shoulder to witness --

               THE MOTORCYCLE

               going full throttle to make the final rooftop to rooftop 
               jump.

               But its front wheel hits the edge slightly off-kilter...

               It soars but with a slight downward trajectory...

               Towards a large window on the top floor...

               Then lower...

               And the look on the driver's face says it all as...

               The front wheel of the motorcycle SMACKS into the side of 
               the building, just below the window.

               The guards are flung off the bike and their bodies CRASH 
               through the window as --

               A hunk of exploding metal imbeds itself in the side of the 
               LAPD chopper and --

               INT. HOTEL FIGUEROA

               The guards land in the Tangier Suite in a hailstorm of glass 
               shards.

               I/E. LAPD HELICOPTER

               Smoke billows out where the hunk of metal hit. The pilot 
               keeps it under control but it's time to go. With a WHINING 
               THROB, the injured chopper banks away.

               INT. HOTEL FIGUEROA LOBBY - DAY

               PING. The elevator door opens. Charlie's Mini shoots out 
               then skids out the lobby's exit. He made it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. STELLA'S MINI (SPEEDING) - DAY

               She checks the rearview mirror. No sign of the Ferrari.

               Just a Jeep Wrangler back there.

               Stella looks relieved. Feels like she's home free.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. UNION STATION - SUNSET

               Stella's Mini pulls up to the ramp of the enclosed car carrier 
               at the end of Amtrak Train 59, bound for New Orleans.

               She can see the other two Minis are already inside. She gets 
               out and hands the cargo loader a ticket.

               EXT. UNION STATION - NIGHT

               The "All Aboard" announcement goes out over the PA system.

               Then the Superliner train pulls out of the station, quickly 
               picking up speed.

               INT. FIRST CLASS CAR - NIGHT

               The outside streaks by through the window. It's a happy crew. 
               Champagne is poured. Charlie holds up his glass and gets 
               their attention.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I want to make a toast. Cause there's 
                         somebody missing here today, and we 
                         all know who it is.

               They all raise their glasses.

                                     CHARLIE
                         To John Bridger. The most brilliant 
                         master planner of them all. We wish 
                         he was with us.

               We PAN ACROSS their faces. It's been a three year odyssey 
               for them. They got the gold, but they lost someone they loved.

                                     ALL OF THEM
                         To John.

               Clink.

               INT. CAR CARRIER - NIGHT

               OUR CAMERA MOVES past the three Minis parked inside...

               And STOPS at the last car in the carrier -- the Jeep Wrangler. 
               Its rear hatch rises and Steve creeps out. Looks around. 
               It's safe.

               He walks over to Stella's Mini. Pops open the trunk REVEALING 
               a silver Haliburton suitcase. He unzips the case.

               It's filled with stacks and stacks of gold bricks, the exotic 
               face of a Balinese girl on each one.

               Steve pulls out a brick, embraces it. He knows his gold.

               These bricks are real.

               But as he has a moment with his gold, BEHIND HIM, the trunks 
               of the other two Minis RISE in unison.

               Then Mashkov RISES out of the trunk of the white Mini.

               Another Ukrainian RISES out of the trunk of the blue Mini.

               Four more Ukrainians slide out from underneath the Minis.

               They cock their M-lls.

               CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK.

               Steve hears the sound from behind him. He turns around to 
               see the weapons pointed at him.

                                     MASHKOV
                         Take out your gun and drop it on the 
                         floor.

               Steve has no choice.

                                     STEVE
                         Who are you?

                                     MASHKOV
                         You knew my cousin. Yevhen.

                                     STEVE
                         I never knew anyone named Yevhen.

                                     MASHKOV
                         Get in the trunk. Not that trunk, 
                         this one. That gold is for us. A 
                         gift from some old friends of yours. 
                         They said to tell you that they didn't 
                         mind sharing the box of Cracker Jack, 
                         as long as you didn't get any. Not 
                         even the toy surprise.

               The Ukrainians force Steve into the trunk of the white Mini.

               And for the first time, he's scared. Looking up at Mashkov, 
               he begs.

                                     STEVE
                         Please. Don't shoot me. Please...

                                     MASHKOV
                         Don't worry. That wasn't the deal. 
                         I'm not going to shoot you.

                                     STEVE
                         Thank you. Thank God.

                                     MASHKOV
                              (to the others)
                         He really thought I was going to 
                         shoot him.

               The Ukrainians laugh. Steve tries to laugh.

                                     MASHKOV
                         No. No. I'm not going to shoot you. 
                         I'm going to hack off your limbs and 
                         bury you while you're still alive.

               And with that, he closes the trunk. THUD. Like the lid of a 
               coffin. And for Steve, the world falls into BLACKNESS.

               INT. FIRST CLASS CAR - SAME TIME

               Underneath the crew's seats, we see the other two silver 
               Haliburton suitcases filled with the rest of the gold. We 
               BOOM UP to our five thieves...

                                     CHARLIE
                         New IDs.

               Handsome Rob passes out new fake driver's licenses for when 
               they arrive in New Orleans.

                                     LYLE
                              (re: his fake license)
                         Simon Quackenbush? Could I -- just 
                         once -- have a cool name?

                                     HALF-EAR
                              (also complaining)
                         250_pounds?

               They're interrupted by the RING of Charlie's phone. He 
               answers.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Did you get what you wanted?

               INT. CAR CARRIER - INTERCUT

               Mashkov is on the other end of the line.

                                     MASHKOV
                         I'm happy.

               During this, Lyle types commands into his laptop that is 
               connected to a phone jack in the car.

                                     CHARLIE
                         It was good doing business with you.

               Lyle hits a final command and --

               INT. ENGINEER ROOM - SAME TIME

               signal box receives the command and --

               EXT. CAR CARRIER - SAME TIME

               The coupler between the car carrier and the rest of the train 
               is electronically disengaged.

               This causes the train to separate from the car carrier. The 
               train speeds on without it at 100 miles per hour.

               The car carrier slowly comes to a stop in the middle of 
               nowhere.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               The Dining Car features crisp white linens and extended 
               windows for scenic dining. Lyle walks over to a table where 
               Karen is waiting for him. She looks resplendent.

                                     LYLE
                         Is this seat taken?

                                     KAREN
                         It is now.

               He sits. And as OUR CAMERA HOLDS ON Lyle, ready to embark on 
               a new life, we --

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Charlie and Stella drink from glasses of champagne.

                         We did it.

                                     STELLA
                         We sure did.

                                     CHARLIE
                         There's something I've been meaning 
                         to ask you, Stella. But I've just 
                         been so busy lately, what with the 
                         explosion, car chase, Ukrainians and 
                         all.

                                     STELLA
                         It has been a hectic day.

                                     CHARLIE
                         It's about that thing you said to me 
                         back in Philadelphia.

                                     STELLA
                         That thing?

                                     CHARLIE
                         You said that you can't have a 
                         relationship with a pickpocket, gold 
                         robber, or any kind of thief.

                                     STELLA
                         Oh... That thing.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Do you still believe that?

                                     STELLA
                         Yeah. I do.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Well I was wondering... What about a 
                         retired pickpocket, gold robber, 
                         thief?

                                     STELLA
                         Now that's an entirely different 
                         question.

               And as an enigmatic smile settles across her face, we --
